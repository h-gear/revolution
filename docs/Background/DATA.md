# The data

This project is centered on four datasets:

## Founders online
This project examined the entire corpus of 185.000 documents in the US National Archives’ Founders Online database. This database brings together the bulk of the edited and collected papers of seven so-called Founding Fathers from existing print editions as well as from additional online-only sources; a total of 294 print volumes. 

The archive is a rich digital collection of primary source documents
from the most prominent figures in early American history, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison. The database also includes the papers of Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and the records of the Continental Congress. The documents are fully searchable and are available in both digital facsimile and transcribed formats.

## Letters of Delegates to Congress

This collection of 25 volumes contains all public laws, congressional debates, and (to a limited extent) correspondence of members of Congress for the period of 1774-1789. Letters from delegates comprise most of the entries, although there are also (parts of) public papers, essays, and diaries. In total, ca. 15.000 documents are included. The data was scraped from the Library of Congress' American Memory project.
