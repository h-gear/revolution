# Historiographing the Era of the American Revolution (HGEAR)

![Rev](../logo.jpg)

The historical concept of *democracy*, *liberty* and *freedom* and its development through time is important to our understanding of the past. The goal of the HGEAR project is to chart shifts in the character and structure of political discourse during the era of the American Revolution. By comparing shifts in language usage (via [**ShiCo**](https://github.com/h-gear/ShiCo/) *(Shifting Concepts Through Time*) with changing formations in 
correspondence networks, we are able to measure how networks of communication within the [**Founders Online**](https://founders.archives.gov/) corpus and other resources such as the [**Letters of Delegates to Congress**](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwdg.html) shaped the character, distribution, and spread of political ideas during the Revolutionary era. 

This project and associated analyses offer insights into longstanding debates in the field of early American history. Also, by means of additional collected data, we show how the 
here included scripts and analyses can be easily accomodated to include other letter
correspondence sources as well. Ultimately, this allows researchers to get a more complete picture of the fluxes in the political discourse during the American Revolution.
