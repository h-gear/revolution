# Introduction

The code for the analyses can be found in the subfolder **scripts**. It is structured in parallel to the structure explained above:

* [1_data_collection](https://github.com/h-gear/revolution/tree/main/scripts/1_data_collection)
* [2_data_preparation](https://github.com/h-gear/revolution/tree/main/scripts/2_data_preparation)
* [3_exploratory_data_analysis](https://github.com/h-gear/revolution/tree/main/scripts/3_exploratory_data_analysis)

In adition, the code and procedures to create the word2vec models needed as input for running shico can be found in the subfolder **w2v_models/delegates**. The code is applied to the data from the delegates of congress, but can be easily adapted and eqaully applied to create word2vec models for all other datasets in this project as well.
