"dg015572",1780,"North Carolina Delegates to Abner Nash Dr. sr. Philada. Augt. 15 1780 I (1) arrived at this place on the 22d of June & Having no Doubt but Mr. Burke would inform you of every thing material done in Congress previous to his Departure, I deferred writing to you, from day to day, with the hope of giving you an Account of the Arrival of the French Fleet. This Fleet, consisting of eight Ships of the Line & 3 or four Frigates commanded by Monsieur Ternay, & with 5000 Land Forces, under Count Rochambaud, got into Rhode Island on the 12th July; the Minister announced this Event to Congress on the 21st, and I gave you the Intelligence, together with a State of Matters here in my Letter of the 22d(2) by favor of Capt. Stith, copy of which I now inclose. His most Christian Majesty has put these Ships & Land Forces under the Command of Genl. Washington, and directed the Officers of both to pay him all the honours due to a Marshal of France.  What I suspected proves true, Graves is superior to the French Fleet. Two or three days after his (Graves) Arrival at Sandy Hook, having obtained a Reinforcemt. of about 1000 Seamen from N. York and being joined by Arbuthnots fleet, and all the Frigates upon the N. York Station, making in the whole near 20 Sail, nine or ten of which are of the Line, he sailed for Rhode Island, intending in Conjunction with a large body of Land Forces under the Command of Genl. Clinton in person, who was to proceed thro the Sound to attack the French by Land & Sea. Clinton embarked his Troops, and proceeded as far as Huntingdon bay; but returned suddenly again to N. York. Genl. Washington havg taken Measures for reinforcing Count Rochambaud as soon as he was informed of Clintons Embarkation crossed the No. River, and advanced rapidly towards N. York, with Intention to attack it in Clinton's Absence. Whether Clintons Return AUGUST 15, 1780  was occasioned by Genl. Washington's Movements, or by contrary Winds, which delayed him so long that he had no prospect of surprising the French Commander, we know not: however it is greatly lamented that he did not persevere, for he must have failed inevitably at Rhode Island, the French being nobly supported by the New England Men, and Genl. Washington very probably would have carried N. York in his Absence. In Consequence of Clintons Return, Genl. Washington repassed the North River. Admiral Graves's Fleet lies at Anchor between Block Island and point Judith, so as to block up the French Fleet completely. The preparations for attacking New York are still going on with the greatest Vigour. Genl. Washington I conjecture has now with him near 20,000 Men, exclusive of a strong Garrison at West Pt.; the Militia of this State 3,500, march this day under the Command of their Governor; the Jersey Militia are ordered to be ready at an hours Warning, and other Reinforcements are yet to join the Army from the Eastward, all which will probably make an Army of at least 30,000 Men. Should the French Fleet be reinforced so as to give us a Superiority on the Water in time, I think N. York wil1 certainly fall; otherwise I fear it will be impracticable to reduce it; nor do I know that Genl. Washington, without this Contingent, will make the attempt. Congress have been under the greatest Difficulties ever since my arrival arising chiefly from want of Money. There is not one Shilling in the Continental Treasury. The New Money for some of the States will soon be thrown into Circulation; we hope that will relieve us. Congress appears willing to do every thing for the Support of the Southern army and the Recovery of Georgia & So. Carolina. Genl. Washington is empowered and directed to form a plan for the latter purpose, but not to interfere with the immediate Operations agt. N. York: (3) The Govr. of Virginia, is ordered to transmit a considerable"

Mr. Ross has directed Mr. Whiteside a mercht. of this City to pay us £200 each, which will enable those of us who have been sometime here to discharge our outstanding balances but will leave a small sum only for future occasions.  We impatiently expect a confirmation of the very interesting intelligence received from the Wt. Indies respecting the entire reduction of the Island of St. Christophers by the Forces of his most Christian Majesty and advantage gained by the Fleet of the Ct. de Grasse over that of Sr. Saml. Hood. This last circumstance, if true, will give the Count so decided a superiority, that it is probable other Islands of the Enemy will soon share the fate of St. Christophers.  The Chevr. de la Luzerne will we expect, in a few days set out for Virginia on a visit to Ct. Rochambeau, you will probably see him at Richmond.(1) Very respectfully, we are Yr. Excellency's obed Servts. James Madison Jr. Arthur Lee  Edm. Randolph Jos. Jones RC (Vi: Continental Congress Papers). Written by Jones and signed by Jones, Lee, Madison, and Randolph.  1 La Luzerne informed Congress on March 8 of his imminent departure and placed French affairs in Philadelphia in the hands of the marquis de Barbe-Marbois. PCC, item 95, 2:90. During his five-week journey, from which he returned by April 13, the French minister conferred with Rochambeau in Williamsburg in hopes of persuading him to come to Philadelphia to discuss military affairs with Washington, but La Luzerne did not visit Harrison in Richmond despite his intention to rouse Virginia officials to more vigorous support of the war effort. See Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 5:302-3; Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:146, 207; and William E O'Donnell, The Chevalier De La Luzerne, French Minister to the United States, 1779-1784 (Bruges: Desclee de Brouwer, 1938), p. 202.

May 28th 1782  The late arrival of the post last night, and it being my turn to write the Public letter, puts it out of my power to be so full by this post as I could wish to be. I have however determined not to be silent. As I see you are reforming-and as I am convinced that a habit of Indolence which is the growth of our Summer's might creep on you insensibly, & know that example is more prevalent than Precept, I have determined to shew you the latter rather than Preach the former, your finesse of (No. 3) will not take. I keep an exact register and letters by the post never miscarry-send none of yours to me by a Private hand-you shall have no excuse-they will not count- Neither have I received any that way. I register them regularly. I have seen with pleasure the former weighed in his own scales-it must be a usefull experiment at this time-popular errors and popular prejudices must be rooted out, age & experience are too respectible Authorities to be Combated. I have formd an acquaintance with common-sense in Philada. since I came last here and from the knowledge I had of his Brother in Virginia, I propose to make myself the medium through which the Complements of one pass to the other. The news of Rodneys Victory which we had here as soon as you had-has been contradicted, with every appearance of Probability-it has been believed, disbeliev'd & rebelieved here half a Dozen times, and now credulity itself is at a stand. You will see all the pro's & Cons in the papers, they are too long to insert in a letter. I am highly pleased at your having a good house and a likelihood of much good being done this Session. Our Public letter(1) contains Intelligence of great importance-& as you have access thereto officially I need not repeat it here, it is of a Secret nature-writing in Cypher is tedious, & time precious. The Subject of my last letter is at an end, we have decided, the letters are deliverd & must now take their Chance.(2) We considerd ourselves as only vehicles-and not responsible for any effects one of them might produce. Entre nous-I think the remonstrance was just but some of the words objectionable. This will not suffer my pen to Run on-God Bless you-my love to all real Friends, adieu.

There yet remains some doubt relative to the event of the Action of the two fleets in the West Indies. Accounts from Martinique by different Channels and of a late date, appearing to render it dubious, whether Rodneys letter is spurious or real, we confess however, we have no expectation of its being the former; Yet there is great room to believe that the remainder of the French fleet will form a Junction with the Spanish at Cape Francois and that the Combined fleets will have a decided Superiority in the West Indies, which will enable them to proceed with the Expedition against Jamaica.  We find-in a Report, the Superintendt. of Finance has made to Congress-the Substance of his letter to you on the Subject of Stores, and have since had a Communication with the minister of France on that Subject, (1) who, informs us he Answerd your letter, to him, relatively thereto, and he hopes satisfactorily, but requested us to acquaint your Excelly., ""that the Misfortune which the Count de Guichens Convoy had met with, rendering it very difficult, for the Ministry to procure transports for the Supply of their own fleets and Armies and to bring out the Supplies orderd for the United states, he feard it would not be practicable to send out those which had been purchased for the State of Virginia in any short time."" He gave us to Understand that the transfer of the Debt from the State of Virginia to the United States had been a Misunderstanding of the Ministry, or some of the Under offices, & that it would be revoked and accommodated to all parties.

""This State as a Member of the Republic of the United States has ever considered its immediate Interest but in Subordination to that of the great whole; and as national honor is of the first consideration,  FEBRUARY 5, 1784  this House cannot be too solicitous that all engagements to the public Creditors of every species and particularly the Army who have so distinguished a claim to our esteem and gratitude, should be faithfully performed: They are therefore of opinion that the requisitions of Congress upon the States for funds, if yet insufficient, should be extended till they are fully commensurate to this object; and that the business of setting off the Lands designed by Congress for our line should be expedited, and the allotment of them in the vicinity of their other lands granted by this State requires your particular attention, it being considered by them, as an essential point. ""Certain measures now pursuing by some European States having a tendency materially to injure the general trade of America, the attention of this House is naturally turned to the affairs of Commerce, and herein are struck with an apparent defect in the Constitution of Congress, for as the local exercise within the States, of the powers of regulating and controlling trade, can result only in discordant systems productive of internal jealousies and competitions, and illy calculated to oppose or counteract foreign measures, which are the effect of an unity of Council; this House are clearly of opinion, that the individual as well as general good will be best consulted, by relinquishing to Congress all these seperate and independant powers,  ""And this House are willing and desirous on the part of Pensylvania, to concur in substantiating this idea, by the necessary legal acts. ""Another object of national consideration has been the establishment of a Mint, and this House are desirous, your abilities should be employed to carry that useful design into effect.""(1) Submitted by, Thomas Mifflin John Montgomery Edwd. Hand RC (DNA: PCC, item 24). In a clerical hand and signed by Hand, Mifflin, and Montgomery. 1 Although this document actually contains three instructions--on the use of western lands for Continental veterans, granting Congress authority to regulate commerce, and ""the establishment of a mint""--it was referred on February 6 to a committee charged with only the second of these.

Writing to his wife for the first time after taking his seat in Congress the preceding day, the newly-married McHenry complained of the burden imposed by his attendance at Congress. ""In truth, I am no longer anxious to please my state, seeing it cannot be done without sacrificing too much of your company. It is time too that I should accommodate my leisure and industry to our prospects and circumstances. Neither of us can be happy under a long separation; nor can our interest be promoted by my sitting in Congress. My first object was to get you to Baltimore, to see you mistress of your house, and pleased in your new situation--but a strong hand restrains me where I am and delays that necessary event.(1) I fear my beloved that I shall not have it in my power to move from this place sooner than the first of May. It is a tedious period--but unless I do what I have censured others for doing I cannot make it shorter."" (2) MS not found; reprinted from Steiner, James McHenry, pp. 78-79. 1 For an explanation of the ""strong hand"" that kept McHenry in Annapolis until the end of April, see McHenry to William Paca, March 15, 1784. 2 McHenry continued to write Peggy regularly while they were separated, but his letters contain little of public interest. Writing on April 1 he observed that he had dined ""at different houses every day this week"" and that he had also ""been very busy in Congress."" Steiner, James McHenry, p. 79.

But should that be the case you will be pleased to consult with Mr Hardy. If the committee is dissolved I think it will be best to have all the papers safely packed up in cases and brought to this city. Let the manuscript Journals that remain be put into the iron chest. I am sorry you did not return the bills I sent you immediately on Mr Harwood refusal to pay them. In that case you would have had the cash sent you. Is there no person in Annapolis who will advance the Money for them or who will lend you the amount of the bills till you can send them up. If any person will take up those bills & send them to me, I will immediately advance the Money. I wait with impatience for farther Intelligence and am,"
"dg021615",1784,"the Commissioners at Paris"
"dg021616",1784,"Charles Thomson to Benjamin Franklin My dear friend, Philadelphia August 13. 1784  The renewal of our ancient correspondence and the receipt of your letters excited those sensations, which real friends feel on meeting unexpectedly after a long separation. As Mr Jefferson, who I hope is by this time safe arrived will explain matters to you and make you fully acquainted with the state of our affairs I shall no longer conceal from you the circumstance of the Omission of the signature of the letter of the 5 Jany last,(1) which procured me the favour of hearing from you. The letter was to have been signed by the President. As the vessel was on the point of sailing and the captain only waiting for the dispatch, I copied the letter in Congress and delivered it to the President, who sealed it in a hurry without putting his name to it. So that my letters to you are all private, and this will explain why they generally contain ""nothing of public Affairs."" I am sensible you must, for a considerable time past, have been greatly at a loss for want of official communications. And though I often wished to give you some yet I forbore, for reasons, which if ever I am so happy as to have a personal interview I can assign and which I am persuaded you will deem satisfactory. But this Inconvenience will be obviated, if Mr Jay who with his family is arrived at New York and who as I mentioned to you in a former letter, is appointed Secretary for foreign Affairs, accepts that Office, as I hope he will: Though I must confess my hope is founded more on my wishes than on any solid reason. I have written and informed him of his appointment & urged his acceptance, but have not yet received his answer. Col Harmar who arrived with the Marquis de la Fayette after a fine passage of 35 days delivered me on the eighth your letter of the 14 June with a copy of that of the 13 May, the original of which I  AUGUST 13, 1784  had received before, announcing the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty of peace. On this happy completion of our hazardous enterprize I most sincerely congratulate you. It is an event, which I have devoutly wished and yet I cannot but say, the prospect of it has often excited many uneasy apprehensions. From the first appeal to arms, through the whole contest, I never had a doubt of the issue; but I was afraid it would come upon us before we had acquired national principles, habits and sentiments, which would enable us to improve it to advantage and to act becoming our station and dignity. I need not mention to you who know so well the peculiar circumstances of America at the commencement of this revolution. The several colonies were distinct and separate governments, each jealous of another and kept apart by local interests and prejudices. Being wholly dependent on Great Britain they were secluded from all negotiations with foreign courts and almost from all intercourse with foreign Nations. Having never been much taxed, nor for any length of time, they had no funds, whereon to ground public credit. Those who know the diffculty which old established nations experience in their attempts to introduce new arrangements either in government, police or finance, will readily conceive what we have had to encounter; more especially when it is considered, that the ancient governments being dissolved, the people were thrown into a state of nature, that property being equally divided and the feudal system unknown in this country, there were no individuals to whom the people were accustomed to look up and who could influence their conduct or Opinions. And even when new governments were adopted, the ideas of liberty which prevailed threw the whole power into the hands of the people And the rotation which took place in the legislatures and executives of the several states afforded little Opportunity of acquiring National sentiments. Notwithstanding all this we have made considerable progress in the short period of eight years; the time elapsed since we became a Nation; and I am happy to think that the people every day become more and more impressed with the necessity of honorably paying our debts, supporting public credit and establishing a national character. And though Rhodeisland still holds out and refuses her assent to the impost of 5 per cent, yet as all the other states have agreed to the measure I have strong hopes that she may be induced to come into it, or that some means will be devised to overcome the obstacle which her refusal throws in the way. In like manner I am persuaded the people of these states will quickly find it to be their interest as well as of absolute necessity to be faithful in the observance of treaties and to avoid internal contentions and divisions. There is no doubt but Britain will watch for advantages, if not to recover what she has lost, at least to be revenged for what she has suffered; and that every thing will be attempted and every artifice used, which Malice can suggest, to break our connection with France and to sow dissensions among the states. The easy access which foreigners have to these states and the ready reception they meet with afford   favourable opportunities of putting their Arts in practice. And it is worthy of Observation, that it is strangers lately come among us, whom we know nothing of, joined with Men, who, to say the least of them, were lukewarm in our cause and of doubtful Characters, who are now most active in sowing jealousies of France, from an affected regard for our liberty and a zeal to preserve this country from foreign influence. I think it therefore highly necessary both for France And America to be on their guard and not suffer themselves to be duped by the arts of their common enemy. The atrocious and unprovoked outrage lately committed in this city by one Longchamps a vagabond frenchman seems to carry strong marks of a premeditated design to embroil us with France:(2) And what makes this still more probable is the palliating account given of this affair in a paper newly set up here, as if for the purpose, entitled ""Courier de l'Amerique,"" and which is conducted by Boinod and Gaillard, two strangers, who came to this place last fall about the same time as Longchamps. The complexion of this paper evidences a marked inveteracy against France and a strong desire to excite fears and jealousies or at least to give an unfavourable impression of her. I am glad to find that the zeal of the Authors has hurried them into so palpable a manifestation of their design and that suspicions are already raised which I trust will guard against the influence of the poison they mean to convey. I send you the Courier de l'Amerique as far as published and some other papers of the day. I also enclose the copies of some originals, which will explain the circumstances of the outrage committed by Longchamps and the measures taken by Government in Consequence thereof.(3) I must inform you that the judges have not yet given an Answer to the last letter of the President. The question ""Whether Longchamps can be legally delivered up by the Council according to the claim made by the late Minister of France"" was publickly argued by lawyers before the Judges, who still have it under advisement. In the mean while Longchamps is confined in prison and the matter is laid before the legislature, who have now under consideration a bill, which I have no doubt they will pass for effectually securing the rights and immunities of public Ministers and punishing the violators of them. It may not be amiss to acquaint you that from his own shewing it appears that Longchamps had been an Officer in the french service; that in 1775 he came to America and went to our camp then before Boston, where he was cordially received; that after being in our camp and about head quarters for some weeks he took the advantage of a pass given for the purpose of going into the country, to slip into Boston, which we were beseiging; that he wanted permission of genl Gage to come again into our camp; But for some reason that does not appear it was not granted; That in our camp he passed by the name of   Longchamps and in Boston by that of Blutiere. In short from many circumstances, there is reason to suspect that at that time he either was or wished to be employed as a spy of the british general. Whether his late crime is the effect of sudden passion or the result of some premeditated design may possibly in time be manifested. There is a circumstance in the Conduct of Longchamps not mentioned in any of the papers, which it may not be improper to inform you of. On the 17 he committed the first insult. On the 18 he went to a justice of the peace and took an Oath of allegiance to the state, after which he perpetrated the outrage of the 19th. His views in taking the oath have been variously interpreted, some imagining that he meant thereby to secure himself from the french laws and from the power and resentment of the Consul; others that his design was by becoming a citizen to involve the state in his crime and interest the populace in his favour. But whatever might have been his views, even the lawyers who undertook his defence laid little stress upon it in their pleadings And the Bench seemed to be decidedly of opinion that the oath he had taken was of no effect and that he was only to be considered in the light of an alien stranger. The Commissions which Mr Jefferson carried with him and which I hope you have received befor this will not only inform you of the purpose of Congress respecting your request of recal, but enable you to satisfy the Danish Minister and to proceed on commercial treaties with Great Britain and other powers. I wish I were able to give you any pleasing expectations with respect to some employment for your secretary W.T.F.,(4) against whose conduct or abilities while in public service I have never heard the least objection. On the contrary I have always heard them well spoken of. But to me it appears that it will be injuring your grandson to delay making some other provision for him in hopes of an employment from Congress and of this I am persuaded you are already convinced by the appointment of Col Humphreys. And yet I have seen such changes in the conduct of public affairs occasioned by the change of Men entrusted with the direction of them, that there is always room left for hope. But he who has other means of support is less affected by a disappointment in meeting with public employ and if his country stands in need of his services and calls upon him to fill any office, he seems to confer rather than to receive an obligation by accepting it. I have taken some steps but they have hitherto been fruitless to find out Philip Hearn. Upon Enquiry I learn that capt. Holland came to this country in 1775 and was employed as adjutant to a regiment; that in 1776 he was promoted to the rank of a captain in the Delaware and was killed in the battle of Germantown in 1777; that he had married a   daughter of Parson Ross of the Delaware State by whom he left issue and that his widow & children enjoy a pension from the Assembly of that state agreeably to a recommendation of Congress. I need not mention with what marks of cordiality and Affection the Marquis de la Fayette, who came to this place last Monday, was received by all ranks of people. His Stay was but short as he was anxious to see general Washington. He left town this Morning and expects to return in three or four weeks. Mr. Laurens is arrived at New York, but not yet come forward. I intended to have troubled Mr Jefferson with a line by this opportunity, but my letter to you has insensibly become so long, that I shall not have time. You will please to make my respectful compliments to him and Mr Adams. I thank you for the notice you have taken of Mr Isaac Norris. From what I hear I am afraid he is too fond of the company of ""Moines crasseux."" Is there no way of reclaiming the son of our common and worthy friend?  With sincere affection and esteem, I am,"

I thank you, for myself for this fresh mark of your remembrance and attention, and I make no doubt but that the other gentlemen are duly sensible of the obligation. Mr. Henry arrived on Thursday which makes three in conformity to the recommendation of Congress. In a few days Delaware will be present and Georgia is expected hourly; so that we may soon see the Union fully represented. This circumstance and the many important matters before Congress in which the state is materially interested will keep me here till some time in next month, when I hope to be at liberty to make a visit to Philadelphia to endeavour to persuade Mrs. McHenry to accompany me to New-York.(2) I presume you have heard of our late appointments. Adams to the court of London, and Jefferson successor to Doctor Franklin. We still continue however (so inform Mr. Stone) Mr. Adams and Jefferson joint commissioners to form our commercial treaties. Mr. Stone will oblige me very much by giving me as early notice as possible whether the within report(3) is in conformity to his sentiments; or whether it meet with his concurrence in the grand committee. Some are of opinion that an average, say 75, would bring the U.S. less in debt.(4) I fear the report would open a door for frauds to a consider- MARCH 13, 1785  able amount.

The Secretary of Congress presents his Compliments to the Board of Treasury and requests the favour of them to cause enquiry to be made in the Marine Office & inform him whether in the latter end of the year 1782 there was any frigate or Vessel of War belonging to the United States commanded by a Captain Gregory, which was Captured by the Mediator Capt. Lutera1. The Secretary wants this information that he may be enabled to report on a petition of a Monsieur Barré who sets forth that he was an Officer on board the American Vessel.(1) LB (DNA: PCC, item 18A). 1 Le Sieur Barré had submitted a petition to Congress in December 1784 seeking a promotion upon which no action had been taken, and he had submitted a second appeal (June 29, 1785), with a supporting letter from the marquis de Lafayette (April 18, 1785), which was referred to Congress by the secretary for foreign affairs John Jay on September 2. Congress had referred the case to Thomson to obtain additional information on Barré's claim, which he obtained not from the board of treasury but from Joseph Hardy, who had served with Capt. Stephen Gregory before his capture by Capt. James Luttrell and H.M.S. Mediator. For Secretary Thomson's September 13 report to Congress recommending against Barré's claim, which was adopted October 6 and referred back to Secretary Jay ""to take order,"" see JCC, 29:700--;701; and Thomson to Jay, October 6. For Barré's petition and the related letters from Lafayette and Jay, see PCC, item 59, 4:395--;408, item 80, 1:377; and Diplomatic Correspondence, 1783--;89, 1:305--;10. SEPTEMBER 10, 1785

SEPTEMBER 25, 1785  1 No letter from Monroe formally declining this appointment, which he had accepted March 20, has been found, perhaps because he may have simply announced his resignation orally when he left New York on August 25 to begin a trip to the West which occupied him until mid-December.
