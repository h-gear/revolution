# Deployment folder 

This folder contains the following code:

- **Extract place of publication from letters.R** (Extracting geographical information from the correspondence letters)
- **geocoding.R** Geocoding the location from where the letters were sent from
- **animated_wc.R** To complement the output from the shico application, we also enable to obtain an animated wordcloud. For each topic, the animated wordcloud
shows the frequency of the topic-associated words through time (i.e. year). The size of each word changes depending on the frequency it occured in a particualr time interval, thereby indicating the word's relevance in denoting the topic (cf. rationale behind shico).
