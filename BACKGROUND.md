# The H-GEAR project
The H-GEAR project is unraveling the intellectual tapestry of America's founders by using digital methods to chart shifts in the character and structure of political discourse during the American Revolution. The project, led by Dr. Mark L. Thompson, a Senior Lecturer in American Studies at the University of Groningen, sifts through 185,000 time-stamped letters that were exchanged between seven so-called “founding fathers” and other key figures of that time. The ambition of the project is to understand how political discourse shifted during the Revolutionary era in the United States, to reveal which people had influence and power, and to discover where and how these changes spread.  
 
1) The first phase of the project involves content-based analysis, employing the ShiCo (an acronym for Shifting Concepts in Time) software tool. At the Netherlands eScience Center, Thijs Vroegh leads the team of research software engineers utilizing this software to scrutinize the usage of words over time. 

    More specifically, the team aims to trace how liberal and republican concepts and ideologies shifted in the period between 1725-1835, uncovering the subtle nuances in language usage that shaped political discourse. Given a small set of user-provided keywords (e.g., freedom, liberty, right), ShiCo gives insight into changes in the vocabulary used to denote the concept by examining the semantic relations between words in different years.  
 
2) The second phase employs temporal social network analysis to establish links between the writers through time. Through the analysis of letters exchanged, the project seeks to identify the most influential figures and map the network that propagated these political ideologies.  
 
Fndings underline that **Thomas Jefferson** emerges as the central figure of this period – not surprising given his leading role in drafting the Declaration of Independence. However, as is common to historical network analyses, because the corpus of letters is biased with its focus on the founding fathers, the researchers acknowledge that the results are equally biased.  
 
With anticipation of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, Mark L. Thompson, Jelte Olthof, Erik Tjong Kim Sang and Thijs Vroegh believe interest in the American Revolution will garner even more attention. 

# Research Questions
- How did the political discourse centered around the two concepts of **liberal** and **republican** ideologies develop during the Revolutionary era?
- Who initiated and drove the spread of these ideas on political ideology?
- How did these ideas on political ideologies spread accross the network of interconnected people?
- Can we identify specific moments in time and places where these shifts are particularly prominent?  

# Methods
The project integrates the analysis of 1) shifting concepts in time with word2vec-based shico software, and 2) the combination of semi-supervised topic analysis with temporal social network analysis.
