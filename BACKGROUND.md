### GOAL
The goal of the HGEAR project is to use digital methods to chart shifts in the character and
structure of political discourse during the era of the American Revolution. By comparing shifts
in language usage (via ShiCo: Shifting Concepts Through Time) with changing formations in 
correspondence networks, we are able to measure how networks of communication within the 
Founders Online corpus shaped the character, distribution, and spread of political ideas 
during the Revolutionary era. This project and associated analyses offer powerful new methods
for addressing longstanding debates in the field of early American history. Also, by 
means of additional collected data (i.e., the Letters of Delegates to Congress), we show how the 
here included scripts and analyses can be easily accomodated to include other letter
correspondence sources as well. Ultimately, this allows researchers to get a more complete picture
of the fluxes in the political discourse during the American Revolution.

### KEYWORDS
ShiCo, word vectors, natural language processing, text analysis, social network analysis

### RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- How did the political discourse centered around the two concepts of liberal and republican ideologies develop during the Revolutionary era?
- Who initiated/ drove the spread of these ideas on political ideology?
- How did these ideas on political ideologies spread accross the network of interconnected people?
