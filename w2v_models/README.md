# W2v folder

For each of the four datasets used in the project, a separate folder exists which stores the w2v models needed to run shico. The delegates folder is complete, inclusing
*make_word2vec_models_for_delegates.py* that demonstrates how the w2v models are computed. This code can be used for the computation of w2v models for all other datasets as well.

Again, for reasons of large files, not all data is stored in these folders
