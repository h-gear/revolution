# Folder for hosting all documents related to developing word2vec models based on the extracted data from the **delegates of congress**. These models serve as input for running Shico (shifting concepts in time)

- running *make_word2vec_models_for_delegates.py* will train the models and save them in the models folder. Next, to run ShiCo with these models and for further instructions to set up shico, see:
