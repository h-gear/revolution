  Dear Sir, Philada July 2. 1785 [i.e., 1784]  I should have sent you some account of Longchamps trial, but you will have it better from Mr Wilson & Mr Attorney general (1) who are gone down to meet the committee. I think it will be proper to send a minute detail of this matter to our ministers in Paris to prevent any disagreeable consequences. For this purpose I have requested Mr Attorney general to be careful in preserving the correspondence that has passed between him and Mr Marbois on the subject as well as notes relative thereto. When he returns I will call upon him & draw  JULY 2, 1784  up a short account, which I shall have the honor of submitting to your inspection. I have had a slight touch of a disorder which usually attacks me at this season of the year. It has left me weak but I hope I shall soon recover. Please to make my respects to the Comee. With great esteem & respect I am Sr your most obt & most h Ser, CT P.S. I send you the first 3 numbers of the herald,(2) a paper which has just made its appearance in this City. ""

  Sir Phila. Jany. 1st. 1785 I transmit to your Excellency the resolutions of Congress respecting the places of their temporary & permanent residence. In the first view, the question was put on Phila. & negativ'd, Pensyla., Virga. & the three southern States voting for it; then on N. York & carried, the southern States, except Georgia, acceding to the measure.(1) Every State seem'd sensible of the necessity of our removal from Trenton, for the several delegations exclusive of the officers of Congress & the foreign ministers could not obtain tolerable accommodations there, and we had already experienc'd inconvenience from these circumstances. We put the question upon Georgeton for our permanent residence but it was negativ'd; it was then put on the falls of the Delaware & carried by 8 States. Sensible of the propriety of coming to some decision upon this subject, from a conviction that the publick named character must suffer from their remaining longer in the late fluctuating state, all Congress shew'd an earnest solicitude to effect it. The majority of the States were decidedly in favor of the latter position, & we had only the alternative left us of acceding to a measure which the superior voice of the union requir'd, or to frustrate it & keep the business fluctuating as heretofore, which could be effected only in the absence of N. Hamshire or Connecticut, whose delegations were daily  JANUARY 1, 1785  expected, & we prefered the former course. I have the honor to be with great respect & esteem yr.

  Gentlemen. Annapolis Jan. 11. 1785 The legality of arresting Captain Henry Carbery by a Warrant from a Committee of Congress having been questioned and I being a Member of the Committee and desirous that the General Assembly should be fully informed of the part I took in this and every other Measure while acting as their Delegate in Congress beg leave to submit the following State of facts relative to this Subject.(1) On the 16th of March last information was given to Congress as I understood, that Capt Carbery & Mr Sullivan were in a Vessell lying in the harbour of Annapolis in consequence of which upon the Motion of Mr Reed of South Carolina a Committee was appointed to take Measures for their arrest, upon enquiry it was found that the information given to Congress was erro- JANUARY 11, 1785  neous. On the 23d of April Mr Reed who was of the Committee brought in a report stating to Congress that Capt. Carbery was in Baltimore Town and concluding with offering a Resolve requesting the Executive of Maryland to arrest him, I suggested the Propriety of transmitting the proof against Capt. Carbery which was in the possession of Congress to the Executive of Maryland, without which I was apprehensive the Executive might be under some difficulties in carrying into effect the request of Congress. It was thought this would take up some time---;the Governor was out of Town and it was not known whether there were Members of the Council in town sufficient to make a board. Congress seemed very desirous that a Man who it was thought had a principal hand in causing them to remove from Philadelphia, should be immediately arrested and secured & after some debate on the Subject referred the Matter to the Committee to take order therein & I was added to the Committee in the place of Mr Lee who was absent. The Committee met after the adjournment of Congress, and determined to issue a Warrant to Mr Henry ---;---; Gassaway to arrest Capt Carbery and bring him before a Judge of the General Court of this State to be dealt with according to Law in Consequence of which a Warrant was issued and signed by all the Committee---;Copy of which is herewith sent, and Capt. Carbery was arrested and brought before the honorable Mr Goldsborough & the committee laid before him such proofs as were in possession of Congress, and made the report of their proceedings as stated in the printed proceedings of Congress of the 28 April herewith transmitted. What was done in Consequence of the Arrest and Proceeding of Congress is not for Me to say being altogether unconnected with the Point which I mean to submit to the Legislature. The several affidavits herewith sent---;the knowledge of the fact by Members of Congress & some of the Committee---;the Riot at Philadelphia and it's Consequences be notorious & public, were the Evidence upon which the Committee proceeded. The Principle upon which the Warrant was issued was that in Cases where Crimes of high and dangerous Nature had been committed and there was knowledge or proof of the Commission it was not only lawfull but the duty of every Citizen and body of Men independent of all possitive Authority to take the most effectual Measures for arresting the perpetrators and bringing them before the Constitutional Judiciary power for examination and Trial, and that if such a power could not be exercised, the assembly of the united States might at any time be broken up or destroyed before an adequate remedy could be applied. I believe it was not considered by any Member of the Committee of what State Capt Carbery claimed to be a Citizen but it was thought none could justly be offended by his being arrested & his Case submitted to a judicial determination according to the Law of the Land. The Committee called on Mr Gassaway to execute their   Warrant not merely because he had been a Military officer as has been very unjustly alledged but because he was thought to be a Gentleman who would conduct the business with strict propriety. I have thus given the assembly a State of facts relating to this Affair which I should have done sooner but expected the Delegates would have been called on to give an Account of their Proceedings before one or both branc[h]es of the Legislature in the Course of which I intended to have stated and explained this Subject and to have submitted my Conduct therein to the determination of the Assembly, but apprehending there is no reason now to suppose the Delegates will be called before either house this Session I can no longer either consistently with my duty to the Assembly or my engagement to the public withold this Communication, which I hoped it would not have been necessary for Me to make before a determination on Capt Carbery's Case, as I have tho urged by Abuse in the public papers carefully avoided every measure, which might in any degree make an impression unfavourable to him, and I do not mean by this address any thing further than to give the General Assembly a State of facts necessary to be known previous to a determination upon my Conduct in the Case referred to. I state the Motion of the 16 of March from information & the report and resolve proposed the 23d of April from Memory. Neither of them appear on the Printed Journals of Congress & the Secretary to whom I wrote for every thing relative to this Subject sent Me only the Copies inclosed & a Copy of a Letter from Mr Carbery to Congress after he was arrested which having no relation to the question upon the legality of the Arrest I did not think necessary to inclose. I believe it is not the practice of Congress when Motions or reports are referred to take Order, to enter them on the Journals, & probably Mr Thomson could not readily find these papers after the removal from Annapolis. I have however consulted Mr. J. T. Chase who was in Congress with Me & recollects what passed on the 23d of April as I have stated it. Holding Myself responsible to the General Assembly for my Conduct in Congress I shall with chearfullness submit to their determination upon the part I acted in this Affair in which if I have erred I trust the Legislature will do Me the Justice to believe that I was not influenced by a Desire to injure or oppress an Individual, but was governed by principles which appeared to Me to be just in discharge of what I esteemed my Duty as a Citizen & Delegate of Maryland.)(2) I am Gent, Yr most Obt Sert, T.

12941,dg02283,1785,David Howell to William Greene,"""David Howell to William Greene
  Sir, New York January 12, 1785. As I arrived at Trenton before a Congress was formed I proceeded directly forward to Philadelphia & applied at the Office of the Paymaster-General for settlement of accounts in behalf of our State's short Levies, agreeably to order of Assembly. After putting this business in train, I returned to Trenton & took a seat in Congress on the first day of session. A second journey to Philadelphia enabled me to compleat the settlement; & I transmitted, by the hands of Mr. John Innes Clark, the certificates I obtained, to the General Treasurer. For want of materials to fill up a Letter, more than from any other cause, I have deferred writing to the present time. In justice to myself I must also hint at another cause. It has been suggested to me that my former communications to the State have been too lengthy---;& carry the appearance of a wish to obtrude my own political dogmas. I shall only observe that I am justified in this line of Conduct by the Communications of our Foreign Ministers to Congress---;& even by the communications of Congress to the States---;in which may be seen not only a statement of facts, but opinions & reasonings, as well as Scraps of Letters from their Servants, with their opinions & arguments & even (so strong was their desire to illuminate) the opinions & reasonings of the Minister, a very respectable character, of a Foreign Court. As I well knew that my Letters were to be laid before men, who were not only tenacious of their rights but capable of understanding them, I have written with a frankness, which (at least in my humble opinion) the public has a right to expect from its Servants---;and, to this day, I find no reason to retract, or alter any thing I have written in my official character. If it is the character of a politician to conceal or, to deliver with reserve & cryptically his opinions---;to keep a watchful eye on the tide of popular opinion---;and in all events to aim chiefly at bringing off his own dear Self in a whole Skin, I thank God I am no politician! From the time that it first pleased my fellow-citizens to raise me into the political World I have neglected no opportunity of rendring them the best services within the compass of my poor abilities, & of obtaining information of the Transactions on that great Theatre. I am now JANUARY 12, 1785  soon to retire to my little cottage. I shall do it with a chearful mind & a clear conscience as to my official conduct: but not without great anxiety for the fate of my Country. Avarice, ambition or the lust of power & all the baser passions are so much more active & prevalent than the virtues, with which they stand contrasted, that it is not strange to see the Government of this World commonly in the hands of the vilest men in it. \""There is, says an excellent writer, in every human Society an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power & happiness & to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness & misery,\"" And whoever contemplates the different Kingdoms, Empires & States throughout the World, the nature of their governments, & the condition of the people will be affected, if capable of feeling, with the wretchedness of his fellowmen & will be constrained to drop a sympathetic tear over the ruins of human nature! \""Ye Gods! What havoc does ambition make among your works?\"" The U. States furnish the World with a rare instance of Freedom---;and a wise System of political Constitutions happily calculated to secure it. But alas! How restless are many of our rulers to engross more power? How easily are the people imposed upon & duped out of their rights? What artifice, what chicanery, what management have already taken place in our public affairs? I cannot, however, close this dull & gloomy letter without making one consolating remark---;& in that I am warranted---;that the seasonable & firm stand made by Rhode Island against the all grasping hand of power, in the case of duties, has saved the U. States! And I should be wanting, as well in duty to the State, as to my own feelings, if I should neglect to inform them that they have the thanks of thousands of the wisest & best men in the Union for their Conduct. The Journals of our proceedings at Trenton are not yet printed. I hope the Ordinance, which has been published in the Newspapers, establishing the permanent residence of Congress near the falls of Delaware; & the temporary residence in this City will meet with the approbation of the State. Should the Commissioners to be appointed to erect the fOEderal buildings make an advantageous purchase of Soil, the Sale of Lotts, it is expected, will reduce the Sum appropriated to that use. As I voted against the resolution of Congress, which puts all the Letters received from our Foreign Ministers under an injunction of Secrecy,(1) by the yeas & nays, which, by the way, are not published in our journals, I have a right to offer that as an Apology to the State for not sending forward an account of the contents of such Letters as have been received since I left Congress last Summer. Such parts of them, however, as are thought necessary to answer certain purposes will be sent forward to the States---;but under the strictest injunctions of Secrecy. I pray your Excellency to be assured of my constant attention to the  JANUARY 13, 1785  interests of the State---;And of the great respect & esteeme with which I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient & very humble Servant, David Howell ""

  Sir. New York Janury. 14th. 1785. I have the honr. to inform your Excellency of my safe arrival in this City on the seventh Instant,(1) where I joined my Honble. Colleague Mr. Long. He informed me, he had enclosed a Paper containing the resolution by which Congress stood adjourned from Trenton to this place.(1) This Sir will superceed the necessity of my being particular on this Head.  By the resolution you[r] Excellency will perceive Congress seem determined to erect buildings for their accommodation near Trenton, and in the mean time to reside in this City. If this object could be effected, it would doubtless be convenient; but I conceive a considerable time must elapse before it can be accomplished, especially when I consider that the Houses for the accommodation of the several Delegations must be built by their respective States. If the late movement however, does but serve to fix Congress, untill the public Buildings are prepaired for its reception, it will be better JANUARY 14, 1785  Photographic Reproduction of New York City Hall   than the late disposition of removing from place to place. The removal of [the] Presidents Houshold, and the Offices of Congress, must have taken some time; the recess was perhaps longer than was absolutely necessary for the purpose, but it was the Voice of seven states, and dissentients were obliged to acquiess in this, as well as in the Vote to adjourn from Trenton. On the thirteenth Instant seven States attended at City-Hall, and proceeded to business. It is my earnest wish that attention, & diligence, may retrieve the time lost in the removal.

  Sir, New York January 14th. 1785. Yesterday Congress received a Letter from the Governor of the State of Connecticut dated the 24th December 1784, inclosing a Resolve of the General Assembly of that State upon the Memorial of John Franklin and others Settlers and Claimers of Lands &c to which the right of Jurisdiction was lately in Contest between the States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania.(1) The Memorialists bring Complaints against the Executive of the Citizens of Pennsylvania which are sufficiently pointed and bitter of which I shall not trouble you with a Copy as the Paper is pretty long and you may already have received such Copy from Governor Griswald. The Act of Assembly transmitted to Congress is in the following words \""Resolved by this Assembly that it is expedient for the Memorialists to pursue their Application to the Congress of the United States for a Trial of their Right of Soil and Possession agreeably to the ninth of the Articles of Confederation and that this State will countenance and patronize them in such Application and Tryal in order to obtain for them that Justice this State apprehends the Memorialists are entitled to. And the delegates from this State in Congress are directed to give them all necessary Assistance in the premises. And His Excellency the Governor is requested to address the Congress of the United States on the Subject of their Situation and Sufferings and also address a full State of their Claim &c to the State of Pennsylvania, remonstrating against the Barbarities and Cruelties exercised towards the Memorialists and request a Redress of their Grievances and a Restoration of their Rights, Properties and possessions under the protection of the Laws and Government of said State of Pennsylvania.\"" The Letter from the Governor of the State of Connecticut and the inclosed papers are referred to a Committee of the whole House which is to set on Tuesday the twenty fourth instant.(2) If there had been any Member present from the State of Pennsylvania it would have been their duty to inform Your Excellency of the Train in which this unpleasing but very serious Business is placed, and they would doubtless, in a more clear and pointed manner than I have been able to do it, have justified the State in shewing that her late Conduct on this very head is a full proof that she is by no means inattentive to the Cries of those who complain. As You may probably wish to be represented in Congress when the Letter and other Papers from Connecticut are to be considered or JANUARY 14, 1785  may at least wish that Congress be fully informed of the late as well as the former proceedings of the Executive and Legislative of Pennsylvania respecting those Susquehanna Claimants I have taken the liberty of giving You the above information as I cannot cease to feel myself interested in the Peace and Reputation of a State which gave me Birth.(3_) I have the honor to be with the utmost Regard Sir, Your most obedient and very humble Servant, Hugh Williamson.

If therefore there is not a good Prospect of your recovering that without a Voyage, & a probability of its being of service to you in that respect, there is no room to hesitate, you sho'd by all means go. On the other hand, it will be a great loss of business, & an extreme embarrassment to all our affairs for you to leave them in the situation they now are, & while am under the necessity of being absent from them: And what is of yet greater Importance that you sho'd loose this fine Opportunity of Initiating yourself in Business.

Sisters health, I lament exceedingly my having accepted this Appointment to attend Congress, but I am now too far engaged to retreat, & we must e'en do the best we can in this embarrass'd situation. My Opinion therefore is at present, that you be making all the preparation you can for the Voyage, so that you may not fail of the Opportunity which now presents of going, if it be necessary, but if you find any favorable Alteration in your health (as God grant you may) that after all you omit it. The Mode you propose for providing for it, is the right one, to get Horses, Cattle &c from my Debtors, to whom you had best apply immediately & see what JANUARY 16, 1785  they can engage for. I have not the highest Opinion of Benjamin, perhaps not so good as he Merits. If therefore the other Vessell be as good, & the Captain Clever, I sho'd prefer that.

With great respect I have the honour to be Your Excellencys Most Obedt. humble servant. S. Hardy ENCLOSURE To the honorable the Congress of the United States of America. The Memorial of the Freemen inhabiting the Country Westward of the Allegany or Apalachian Mountain, and Southward of the Ouasioto, Humbly sheweth, That having been made acquainted with several Resolves and other Acts of Congress respecting western territory, and having considered maturely the contents of the same, we are highly pleased with that equal respect for the liberties of the People which seems to influence the Councils of Congress. That nothing but a firm adherence to the principles of the Confederation, and a sacred regard to the rights of mankind, could produce the late Resolves for laying off new Independant States; thereby pointing out such effectual measures to prevent the encroachments of arbitrary power on the Asylums of freedom. That we are happy to find so large a part of western territory already ceded to the United States for national purposes, and trust that every Obstacle will speedily be removed, for the completion of that business, by the individual States affected thereby That we are too much elated at the prospect before us, not to wish that we may speedily enjoy the advantages of such a Government as will be exercised over a convenient territory, not too small for the support of authority, nor too large for the security of freedom. That our situation is such; inhabiting valleys, intermixed with and environed by vast wilds of barren and inaccessible mountains, that the same comprehension of latitude allotted to the new States, Northwest of the Ohio, might prevent us from ever being on an equal footing with our neighbours, blessed with so many natural advantages, navigable waters, and a level fertile Country. That a State bounded by a Meridian line that will touch the confluence of Little River near Ingles Ferry, thence down the Kanhawa to the Ronceverte or Green Briar River; thence Southwest to Latitude 37° North, thence along the same to the meridian of the rapids of the Ohio, South along that meridian untill it touches the Tenesee or Cherokee river; down the same to the part nearest of latitude 34°, South to the same; and eastwardly on that parallel, to the top of the Apalachian mountains; and along the highest parts of the same, and the heights that divide the sources of the waters that fall into the Mississippi, from those that empty into the Atlantic to the Beginning. This tho' not equal in quantity of habitable lands, with the adjoining  States, yet may be sufficient territory for a Society that wishes to encourage industry and temperance as cardinal virtues. That in our present settlements we have maintained our ground during the late perilous war, and frequently gave effectual aid to our brethren to the South and Eastward, that we are first occupants and Aborigines of this Country, freemen claiming natural rights and the privileges of American Citizens. Our prayer therefore is, that your honorable Body, with a generous regard to the rights of mankind, would speedily erect the aforesaid described territory into a free and independent State, subject to the fOEderal bond, and likewise confirm and guarantee to its inhabitants all their equitable rights and privileges acquired under the laws of the States lately claiming this territory; that the disposition of the vacant lands be under the power of the legislature of the new State in as full a manner as that exercised by such of the Eastern States having unappropriated lands, with this reservation, that the monies arising from the sale of vacant lands shall be faithfully paid to the order of Congress, towards the payment of the national debt.

  Dear Sir, New York Jany 20. 1785 I received yesterday your letter of the 14 with the reply to the message of the general Assembly.(1) I am well pleased with the reply, as far as it is directed against the Measure in general, which I consider as unwise & impolitic as it tends to sap the foundation of the federal government to bring upon the state a load of public debt beyond its proportion, and at the same time expose it to loss of public character and a charge of ingratitude, selfishness & want of faith & national honor, in confining its views to its own citizens without any regard to the engagements, stipulations & solemn contracts & treaties entered into by JANUARY 20, 1785  its delegates in the Congress of the United States. What will France & Holland think of our national faith, our honor or our gratitude, or what will the other nations of Europe think of them, if they see the states attending solely to their own citizens without paying any regard to those who generously stepped in to our relief, succoured us in the hour of extreme distress & rescued us from impending ruin? & will not this be the case in every state if Pensylvania sets the example? England represents us as a rope of sand & delays to comply with her engagements in the definitive treaty and to evacuate the posts she holds within our territory which were to be given up with all Convenient speed. France, which on the Eve of being involved in Another War, is jealous that we mean to leave her embarrassed not only with the advances she made to us herself but with the engagements she entered into to procure us pecuniary aid, when her own finances would not admit of further supplies. The individuals in Holland that trusted our faith & honor pledged are now looking with anxious expectation for a compliance with the engagements entered into. The other nations in Europe are waiting to form an opinion of our public character by the evidences we shall give of national honor, faithfulness and gratitude not merely to our own citizens but to the Nations with whom we have contracted engagements & more especially to whom they are under obligations. And how short sighted a politician must he be who does not see of what importance it is to establish a good character & reputation among the other nations of the earth? The loss of this oftimes occasions oceans of blood & millions of treasure. But you will in a few days have some important communications from Congress which will I hope engage the attention of the Assembly and induce them and every other legislature in the Union to pursue different measures from those they seem to be disposed to do at present. If they do not produce this effect, I must confess the hopes I have entertained of our future happiness & prosperity will be greatly dashed, & we may learn to our cost of how much importance it is to maintain national faith & honor. I have not time to examine the reply with a critical eye and give you any farther thoughts on it nor even to copy this, as you desire to have it returned by the 25. You will therefore excuse this scral & these loose thoughts. Please to present my Love & respects to cousin Dickinson & Sally, & be assured of the affection and esteem with which I am, Dear Sir, Your obedt. humble Serv, Cha Thomson ""

  Sir(1) New York January 24th 1785. We arrived here on the 12th instant, and the next Day Congress entered upon Business and have continued their Deliberations as usual. For some Days indeed there were only seven States represented, & consequently only lesser matters could be taken up, but Additions to the Body have been continually making, and there are now nine States represented, and one Delegate from three of the other four. Other Gentlemen are daily expected, so that there is reason to hope there will very soon be a full Congress. The immense Quantity, Variety, & Magnitude of the Business which lies before Congress renders it necessary that as complete a Representation as possible should be obtained and continued. Hitherto there appear on all sides & in every Body here, good Dispositions to enter into the Consideration & Discussion of public Affairs with Diligence, Zeal, and Integrity, yet none of the Ardua Regni, such as Revenue, Western Territory &c. have hitherto been taken up not from any direct Reluctance in any one to engage in them, but that on account of their extreme weight & difficulty, every one seems to hope by longer Reflection & Consideration of these very important Subjects to come to the Discussion & Determination of them with yet greater Strength & Furniture of Mind: they will JANUARY 24, 1785  not however, we imagine, be much longer postponed---;indeed they must not. Upon the former all-important Subject your Excellency already has, or very soon will receive some very stricking Communications from his Excellency the President,(2) upon which it is equally unnecessary and  improper for us to make any Remarks. In Consequence of your Excellencys Representations in behalf of the Wyoming Sufferers an early day has been assigned to take up that Subject in a committee of the whole House:(3) but no Agent from those People having appeared here (though it seems one was prematurely present at Trenton) nor any of the Papers arrived, it will be necessary for us, if possible, to have it postponed, as it will be impossible for us, unfurnished as we are with either Evidence or Exhibits to present it in a proper manner to the Committee, or execute in any effectual manner, the trust reposed in us by the Act of Assembly in favour of those People. Pensylvania will, we find, contend, & that warmly too, that they have done their Duty & more than their Duty, towards them; and that it is owing to their own Negligence, Tergiversation, or Obstinacy, that they have not long since had a complete redress of all their Grievances. Indeed that it is intirely their own fault that they ever suffered any; but how this Matter will appear upon Investigation we know not. The Act of Assembly impowering Congress to impose the five Per Cent Duty in Consequence of the Assent of twelve States to the Measure should we conceive, be forwarded, if it be not already done; as it will, no doubt, be of material Use when that Subject is taken up. Great hopes are given us that the State of Georgia will soon accede to the Measure; and the like is expected from the Assembly of New York who are now convening.

  Dear Sir. New York 24th. January, 1785. I have recd. the letter you did me the honor to write the 12th instant; the sudden determination of Congress to remove to this City JANUARY 24, 1785  was disagreeable to me & had my hearty negative, but it was not so to my honorable Colleagues, in particular, Mr. Gerry who moved the resolutions first, that was afterwards considered as an ordinance, & passed upon the same day,(1) so that you will perceive that the rules of Congress respecting reading ordinances, were dispensed with to get the favourite resolutions passed; I was of opinion at that time, that if they did not pass that day, they never would, & I have been confirmed in that opinion since, & am happy now to find, I am not alone in sentiments of the matter: great attention is paid to the members of Congress by the people here, & personally I am very happy on that account, but has it not been said by some persons that a large City was not a proper place for such a body as Congress to sit in, & if they were right, will this polite people have no influence upon our public Councils, but in answer to this, the FOEderal town is to be built immediately, but I say where is the money, for 100,000 dollars is but a small sum toward such a piece of business, if we could command that, but I conclude. The post that carries this will bring you officially, the distressed state of our finances in Europe, however, here we are, & I hope the public business will not now be delayed, & that all will turn out for the best. I wish it was in my power to give you all the information you desire, respecting appropriating the residue of the requisition for 8,000,000 of dollars, & paying the interest on Mr. Pierce's certificates, but as the whole business of our finances are under consideration of Com[mit-te]es of Congress, I can't as yet, form a judgment what Congress will do, upon the subjects.

JANUARY 24, 1785  You mention my keeping in my hands £30. of Shelden's interest; I think it is likely upon my return that I shall owe him more than that sum, but it will then be with him, to receive the money of me, & do with it what he pleases, but you may be assured if you can procure an order from him, on me, it would be agreeable to pay the money to you. How Mr. Shelden conducts his affairs when at home, I am not able to say, but if I was to form a judgment, from his proceedings while with me,(2) I should conclude he would make money at home, as I am sure he makes it here; I do suspect, by what I hear, that some of his creditors have unreasonably attached his interest, yet, I have reason to think that he will convince them upon his return, that he is able to pay his debts, & go on with business, notwithstanding what they have done or can do. It gives me concern for your friend Mr. Hartwell, and I have wrote to Colo Putnam(3) fully upon the subject, to which I must refer you. By what you mention I suppose before this comes to hand you will have removed Polly, & as it must be hard for Mrs Holten to part with her; I therefore have to request, that you will return with her to my house as often as you can with convenience. I have to request your attention to the notes I left with you against Mr. Whipple's estate; some time since I wrote to Colo Hutchinson (4) fully upon the subject & desired him to converse with you, if he has not, I request that you would immediately wait upon him & take his advise, and you must object against the estate being distributed among the creditors before the notes are paid, & if the Wido. or the person that acts for her will not settle it, you must wait upon the Judge of Probate, & desire him not to distribute the estate before I am paid, if the Judge should want evidence that the notes were given for taxes to hire a soldier. Mr. Kettell & Mr. Tapley are well knowing to the affair, & the notes will appear to be for the same sum he was taxed in the class, as I never had any other dealings with the deceas'd. You will mention to Mrs. Holten that my health is better than when I wrote to her last; and make my kindest love to Polly. Yours with parental affection, P.S. Since writing the foregoing I have recd.

  Sir No. 1. New York 25th January 1785. The Ship Philadelphia, Captain Bass, which sailed from Philadelphia on the 19th Decr. last Carried in separate letters advices from the Delegation(1) upon all Such Subjects as they had in their power to give any Intelligence to your Excellency for the Information of the Legislature---;among the most Material was the Conclusion of a treaty of peace with the Six Nations a Copy of which Mr Read of our Delegation had the pleasure to inclose in a private letter to your Excellency.(2) After the sailing of Captain Bass's Ship we had the pleasure to receive Your Excellency's dispatches by Captain Allibone. They are the latest advices with which we have been favoured from Carolina. The very Strait'ned Situation in which the delegates in Congress found themselves in Trenton rendering it impossible to continue their Session at that small Village it was thought prudent to adjourn to some larger Town till buildings in a federal City Can be provided for the accomodation of that body and the public Officers. Every one appears at present to reprobate the Idea of an Itinerant federal Council and to be Convinced of the necessity there was to repeal the Votes of Congress passed at Princeton in 1783 respecting an alternate residence in Annapolis and Trenton.(3) That plan had its advocates when JANUARY 25, 1785  first proposed and adopted but on Trial has been found so inconvenient and to derogate so greatly from the dignity of the Supreme Council of the Union that it is now totally laid aside. Your excellency will we trust by this time have received from the Secretary of Congress the ordinance passed on the last adjournment respecting the building a federal City.(4) We hope it will meet the Approbation of the Legislature of South Carolina. As the dignity of the federal government seems emminently Concerned in the Congress's possessing an independent Situation and Exempt jurisdiction it highly imports the Individual States to make exertions for Carrying the ordinance last mentioned into effect. We Cannot entertain a doubt but that the legislature of the State We have the honour to represent will Cheerfully grant such sums as may be necessary as well for the buildings requisite for the service of the United States and their officers as for a House proper for the accomodation of its own delegates. According to the present Idea the Several States are to build Houses for the accomodation of their respective delegations at their separate expence---;but if one Uniform plan cou'd be adopted & the whole be done at the expence of the Union it wou'd tend greatly to the Beauty and Elegance of the federal City and perhaps be productive of more solid advantages by removing jealousies from the Minds of the less Wealthy states than any difference of expence to the greater and more opulent Can possibly amount to. As some Considerable time was necessarily employed in the transportation of the records to this City Congress adjourned on the twenty fourth of December to meet here on the Eleventh of the present Month but from the Inclemency of the Season a sufficient quorum of the States did not assemble for some days after that time. Ten States are on this day for the first time represented and as the Members find themselves Comfortably accomodated we have every prospect of a Steady and Sedulous attention to the public business, and we trust it may prove an advantageous one to the Confederacy at large. We are sorry it is not in our power at present to give Authentic intelligence on Several great National points but the fewness of the States on the floor has hitherto prevented our touching on the Most important objects as without more than nine States we had no prospect of Coming to dignified and decisive Conclusions. The business of a requisition on the Several States is now before a grand Committee and will we trust be forwarded to the Legislature in time for their acting on it during their present Session.(5) The Critical Situation of the United States will also urge Congress to take the earliest opportunity of introducing to the Consideration of the several Legislatures a Variety of other Matters on Which the Credit, peace and perhaps the very existence of the United States may depend. Your Excellency will receive by this conveyance a Letter from the president of Congress Covering Copies of some of the Most important   Letters and paragraphs of Letters from the Ministers of the United States at foreign Courts.(6) As they are under an Injunction of Secrecy We do not think it proper to make a further Mention of them---;they will speak for themselves and Shew pretty plainly the Situation of our Credit and money Concerns abroad. We Cannot doubt their having a proper Effect in our Legislature, 'tis perhaps not very difficult to preserve our Credit, but if once lost, Who Can tell the price at which We may be obliged to purchase it anew? While on the Subject of Communications from the Ministers of the United States at foreign Courts, We beg leave to observe that we feel ourselves much hurt at the publication in the Gazettes at Charleston of Certain extracts of a Letter from Doctor Franklin Communicated by Mr Read of our Delegation from Annapolis to your Excellency,(7) and Which have been Copied into all the public prints in this part of the Union. We wou'd observe to Your Excellency that all Letters from our Ministers at foreign Courts are Necessarily under injunctions of Secrecy and When by leave of Congress on application of any Member or State Extracts are permitted to be sent to the Executive of the Several States, it is ever under the Idea that no Copies for publication will on any Account be suffered to be taken. If a Contrary practice was to prevail our Ministers wou'd be deterred from fully Communicating their opinions and ever exposed to the Intrigues and Vengeance of the particular Court or Minister of whose conduct they entertained suspicions. It is true that Secrets of State and public dispatches of a Secret Nature have frequently got into print but it has ever been thro' the Violation of the Injunction of Secrecy and want of Honour of some Unworthy Individual of Congress and always from the most Mischevious Motives. We hope our future Communications may not be exposed to be printed except where Congress think no injury to the Interests of the Union Can possibly arise from their being made public in that Manner, Which Opinion We shall not fail always to Communicate. We expect soon to inform your Excellency of the proceedings of Congress respecting the Affairs of the Southern Indians. That business is before a Committee and will receive some Considerable advantages from the papers forwarded by you to the Chairman of the late Committee on Indian Affairs.(8) The public prints and general Tenour of advices from Europe seem to determine that War is actually Commenced between the Emperour and their high Mightinesses. The first Cannon are said to have been fired, Ships Stopped and Hostilities Compleatly Commenced. But for the quiet of Mankind We hope that during the Winter the differences between the Contending powers may be compromised. Shoud it happen otherwise a general War seems inevitable. Prusia, France and England may probably be obliged to take a part. America will We   hope be kept out of the Scrape and may receive great advantages in the Sale of her produce during a general Commotion. We have great pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the overtures for forming Commercial Treaties with several European powers made by the Commissioners plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris have been very Cordially receivd and that there is the greatest prospect that Connexions highly advantageous to the Trade and Commerce of these States will soon be formed with the principal Kingdoms and States not already in alliance with these United States. As Citizens of the State of South Carolina as well as Delegates from that State to the Supreme head of the Union We enjoy the greatest pleasure in hearing that an Uninterrupted harmony prevails throughout the State and that the Contests on the important point of a Choice of representatives were Conducted with Temper & the greatest decorum and We heartily reciprocate Your Excellency's congratulations on that pleasing Circumstance. No Conveyance will be omitted by which we Can possibly lay before Your Excellency and the Legislature any Important transactions that may take place in Congress and we trust we shall be favoured with your Communications by all Convenient opportunities for our guidance and Information. We are with the greatest respect, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient Most Humble Servants. Jacob Read John Bull Charles Pinckney ""

To the Honorable the United States of America in Congress Assembled The Memorial of the Undersigned Agents for the State of New York in a certain Controversy depending between the said State and the Commonwealth of the Massachusetts---;Most respectfully Sheweth. That altho the Agents for the said two States have had the Happiness by Joint Consent to elect the Judges for constituting a FOEderal Court to determine the Controversy aforesaid,(1) they could not agree upon the place for holding the said Court. That your Memorialists would have been Contented that the said Court should be held at Elizabeth Town, New Ark, New Brunswick or Trenton in New Jersey, at Hartford in Connecticut, at New Port Rhode Island, at Bethlehem in Pensylvania or at Wilmington in Delaware; but that neither of these places were acceptable to the Agents for Massachusetts who insisted that the Controversy ought to be tried at some point which was most Central to the Residences of the two Judges the most remote from each other. That as the Memorialists could see no reason for such a Measure, and were persuaded that its Adoption might work fatal Mischiefs to the State which they represent they proposed that the Appointment  JANUARY 26, 1785  of the place for holding the Court should be submitted to the Honorable Congress. That it is with extreme Regret that they learn that Congress have been pleased to determine that Williamsburgh in Virginia shall be the place for holding the said Court; and they flatter themselves that impressed as they are with the dangerous Tendency of that Resolution to the Rights of their Constituents, they shall be pardoned for earnestly entreating the honorable Congress to reconsider the said Resolution.(2) And here your Memorialists beg leave to Remark 1st. That in a Contest of the utmost Moment, and which must depend for its Elucidation on a Recourse to ancient Records as well as living Witnesses, it must at the first View appear essential to Justice, that the parties should be placed in such a Situation as to be able to avail themselves not only of every proof which the Adverse Claim immediately may point out; but of every proof which an Investigation of the Merits of the Question in any period of its progress may render Necessary. But will this Justice be secured if the parties must be drawn away to a remote Tribunal at the distance of four hundred Miles from the Archives and the Witnesses on which they rely for their Defence and their Safety? Surely not. IId. This Observation will apply with singular force to the Case immediately under Consideration. The Claim of the Massachusetts is Vague and indefinite, comprehending ancient Settlements for which the Massachusetts confessedly do not mean to contend. The Nature and extent of that Claim remains then to be ascertained at a future day when the Court shall be Assembled: And it is therefore of the last Importance, that when it shall be thus ascertained, the Agents for the State of New York should be in a Condition to avail themselves of such Records and Testimony as Circumstances may require. IIId. Precedents ought to have their Force and where they have been Uniform, it will be presumed that they are founded in Reason and Justice. The only Controversy which has been decided under the FOEderal Compact was the Claim of Connecticut against Pensylvania, and then the Court was held at Trenton in New Jersey---;a Situation convenient to both the contending parties. Before the Revolution the Controversy between New York and New Jersey was determined in this City altho one of the Judges, the Honorable Mr. Randolph was a Citizen of Virginia. The Controversy between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was determined at Rhode Island. In Appointing each of these Places, the Conveniency of the parties and Witnesses appears to have been the principle Object. IVly. But if only the Convenience of the Judges is to be considered, it will---;we speak it with the greatest Submission---;appear that Wil-liamsburgh is not a suitable Appointment.  First. The Cause is to be Tried in the Summer, and if Health is any Object it must be allowed, that a more Northern Climate is in that Season preferable. Secondly. Let the situation of the respective Judges be reviewed. We may venture to Appeal to the Southern Delegates, that it cannot be more disagreable to the Honorable Mr. Rutledge to perform a Voyage to the Delaware than the Chesopeek; and that there is no reason to suppose, that in the Summer he would undertake the Journey by Land. This Honorable Gentleman seems then to be out of the Question. Of the three remaining Southern Gentlemen, the Honorable Mr. Munroe is already in this City, and the Honorable Mr. Grayson, daily expected. If---;for tho we do not presume to dictate, we are Obliged to Name a place for the sake of Computation---;If the Court should be held at Wilmington the distances to be Travelled would stand thus---; By the Honorable Mr. Wythe 292 Miles the Honorable Mr. Harrison 164 the Honorable Mr. Johnson 134 the Honorable Mr. Reade 6 the Honorable Mr. Munroe 120 the Honorable Mr. Grayson 120 the Honorable Mr. Smith 60 the Honorable Mr. Patterson 87 Total 983 On the other hand, should Williamsburgh be adhered to, the Honorable Mr. Wythe would indeed be at home, but Mr. Harrison must perform a Journey of 130 Miles Mr. Reade 286 Mr. Munroe & Mr. Grayson each 400 800 Mr. Smith 352 Mr. Patterson 379 Mr. Johnson 200 Total 2147 The difference then to the Court collectively considered and we conceive it to be our duty to consider them collectively and with an equal degree of Attention and respect would be in favour of Wilmington as 983 Miles are to 2147. Thirdly. Add to this the Attendance of Agents, with the Records and Proofs which must be brought to view in investigating the Ancient Transactions with which this Contest is connected---;and can it be conceived that the Cause ought to be carried down for Trial to so remote a City as Williamsburgh? Fourthly. The Law Agents for New York who have been appointed because they are best acquainted with the Controversy are in public Stations, which they cannot abandon without Public Detriment, to say   nothing of private Injury to themselves. Whether it is reasonable to deprive the State of their Services merely on Account of the supposed Conveniency, which may arise by holding the Court at Williamsburgh is humbly Sub[mit]ted? Fifthly. It is true that the Honorable Delegates for the Massachusetts have proposed that the Court shall [be] held at Williamsburgh, altho they are much more [re]mote from that City than the Agents for New York---;these honorable Gentlemen may find no Inconvenience in such a Measure; but we can with truth say that we would expose our Cause to Hazards which Prudence requires us to Shun. Sixthly. The Expence of Carrying parties and Witnesses so great a Journey would be enormous and we have every reason to apprehend that few Men could be prevaild upon to undertake it. These are the Reasons which give rise to the present Memorial, and we flatter ourselves they will have sufficient weight to Induce the Honorable Congress to Grant the Relief which the sacred Cause of Justice requires.(3) James Duane } Agents for Walter Livingston} New York ""

  Sir, New York, 27th. January, 1785. Since I had the honor of addressing your Excellency last,(1) Congress have assembled in this City, & ten States being represented, they are now much engaged in business, & I can't but hope, we shall get thro' with the most important matters, so as to have a recess in the spring, notwithstanding, so much time was lost before we made a Congress, & in adjourning to this City. Two days since Congress made choice of the Honorable John Lewis Gervais of South Carolina, honorable Samuel Osgood of Masstts., & the honorable Walter Livingston of New York, commissioners for the treasury.(2) I conclude before this comes to hand, that your Excellency will have heard, that Congress had determined upon Williamsburgh in Virginia for holding the fOEderal Court for settling the dispute between Masstts. & New York; but yesterday the agents of N.Y. presented a memorial to Congress representing that Williamsburgh was not the most proper place for the Court to sit, & praying for a reconsideration of the matter, & after debate it was agreed that it should be on the table 'till this day, so that what farther determination it will produce in Congress is uncertain.(3) I have, with perfect respect, the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient servant, S.

  Dear Brother: Trenton, [January 28? 1785](1) In my letter, dated Jan. 1st, I presented to you the compliments of the season, and particularly wished my amiable cousin Betsey, who I suspected would before the close of the year form a new and important connection, a happy new year. By a letter from Mr. Channing I find that event took place about the time I wrote; upon which accept my congratulations, and be pleased with my regards to your son-in-law and married daughter to tender to them my best wishes that they may enjoy all the felicity that the marriage state can afford....I could wish to know how our brother is. This I think is the time of year in which he used to be attacked by the asthma with the greatest fury. It is indeed a pity that a man who enjoys such a fine flow of spirits, and who so well loves to talk, should not be able to breathe freely; but the human constitution is subject to disorders, and he is the happiest who is the least oppressed by them. Thank God, I enjoy a pretty good state of health, but I have been for some days afflicted with an inflammation, principally in my right eye, which obliges me to be temperate, and debars me from the amusement of reading. I hope it will go off soon, and that I shall not long suffer by my attempts in writing to convince my friends that I hold them in the most grateful and pleasing remembrance. I have declined several invitations to dine on this account, but if hereby I have lost any pleasure, I have saved constitution. The gentle- JANUARY 28, 1785  men of this city take great notice of members of Congress. Their cards are as frequent as leaves, and their tables are sumptuous. I dined yesterday with the Marine Society, whose regulations resemble those of the Fellowship Club of Newport. The company was very large and the talk plentiful. This society hath a handsome fund which secures to the widows of masters and mates of vessels who had belonged to the society a considerable support. All institutions calculated to promote the happiness of mankind merit encouragement. In the evening I went to Monsieur Quesnay's Concert, which was the merest farce in the world. We saw cobblers, or rather the shades of cobblers, etc., working to music; heard Jockey on the Green played pretty well, and the tune to Guardian Angels performed amidst mimic thunder and lightning. Dances by masters and misses concluded this grand and instructive exhibition. What effect exhibitions of this sort may have upon the morals of the people, I leave with you to determine. We have ten States on the floor, and have a prospect of twelve pretty soon, when business may proceed with some degree of celerity.(2) Most of the business of Congress requires nine States, and an agreement of nine in ten is not much to be expected. We have lately received letters from our Commissioners. They have announced their authority to negotiate commercial treaties to the ministers of most of the powers, and received favorable and polite answers, but nothing effectual had been done when their joint letter of the 11th November was dated. I wish you would procure of Mr. Peabody two handsome walnut canes of about three-fourths of an inch thickness next to the head, and three feet eight inches in length, well polished, and armed with good ferrules. I mean to make a present of one of them to the President of Congress. Desire the captain who may take charge of them to send them on his arrival at New York to Mrs. Hart's, on Smith street, not far from Pitt's statue, that being the house where I board. I am affect'y yours, W. Ellery. MS not found; reprinted from Historical Magazine, 3 (July 1859): 211--;12. 1 This date has been conjectured from the assumption that it was posted to Rhode Island with the following entry. Furthermore, Ellery notes herein that \""We now have ten States on the floor,\"" which Congress achieved on January 25. The appearance of \""Trenton\"" on the dateline is an obvious error, either Ellery's or that of the editor of the Historical Magazine, for Ellery's references to \""the gentlemen of this city,\"" the \""Marine Society,\"" and \""Monsieur Quesnay's Concert,\"" all pertain to New York. 2 Ten states were first represented on January 25; the representation of 12 states was not achieved until March 21.

  New York Jany. 28th. 1785 I have received your Excellency's letter inclosing a copy of the JANUARY 28, 1785  mode of making Parmesan cheese, which was transmitted to your lady by Dr. Franklin, for which be pleased to accept my thanks. Since the arrival of Congress at this city we have attempted much business: but only a little has been completed. The most important affairs are in the hands of a Grand Committee; such as a proposal, to empower Congress to regulate the trade of the United States, to form a requisition for the present year, to frame an establishment for a mint, an application to Congress from the State of Massachusetts for an explanation of that article of the treaty of peace which respects bona fide debts &c. After repeated efforts to chuse Commissioners for the treasury, Messrs. Osgood of Massachusetts, Walter Livingston of this State, and Jervais of Charlestown So. Carolina are at last elected. Before this letter reaches you, you will have heard and seen the resolution of Congress relative to a federal town.(1) Nothing but the loss of time attending the vibration of Congress, the retardment of public business, and many other pernicious consequences resulting from the unsettled state of Congress would have induced me to come into that measure, at a time when the great demands against the public are unsatisfied. We have not been able as yet to appoint commissioners to carry that resolution into execution, and I can't conjecture when it will be done; for some members are opposed to the measure, and will throw every obstruction in the way, in their power, in order to defeat it, so that the federal town may be yet considered as in the air. If one should be erected I should suppose that the banks of the Delaware would be preferred by our State to those of the Potowmack; and I trust that the adjournment to this city, as it has brought my colleague and me nearer to our constituents, and, by increasing the business of our Packet-boats, will throw some money into the State, will not be disagreeable. We have received letters from our ministers abroad, which I dare not remark upon; because, with regard to them, we are under an injunction of secrecy. Paragraphs taken from those letters are transmitted to the Executive of each State to be laid before the respective legislatures, under an injunction of secrecy.(2) I opposed their being thus transmitted; and after the vote had passed desired that the house would declare their sense, whether any thing more was meant than to prevent copies thereof being taken & published.(3) The house did not do it; but several members said that that was their intention. I think, in a time of peace, nothing should be kept secret in which the people at large are interested; and in Republics, especially, secrecy is very apt to beget suspicion. Your Excellency knows my opinion with regard to the Impost. I trust that nothing but the last necessity will induce our state to embrace it in its present form, if at all. It is probable that this State will-  not come into it; and if it should not I think we ought not to be scared into it, by the inefficacious acts of Connecticut. If the report of the Committee on the motion for empowering Congress to regulate trade by laying duties thereon; to be collected by the States and applied to their own use, should substantially correspond with the motion we shall agree to it; because a uniformity of duties will prevent a variety of interests; and because I expect a handsom sum may be collected from such of the maritime powers as have disclosed very illiberal commercial Principles. We have not received a line from our Commissioners for treating with the Indians, since the treaty at Fort Schuyler. I wish we could get the Western territory under sale; but it will take time to do this. In the mean time I hope that the people will be content to pay the interest of the public debt by direct taxation, and not be hurried by their impatience into measures which may prove pernicious to their liberty. I am with sentiments of the highest respect, Yr Excellency's most obedt. servt. Wm Ellery ""

  Dear Sir N. York Jany. 29. 1785. Yesterday Mr. Gervais, Mr. Osgood & Mr. W. Livingston were elected comrs. of the treasury.(1) So. Carolina & N York voted agnst. you upon the first ballot, and as No. Carolina & Virga. were the only votes in your favor, we withdrew you immediately from the nomination. The first two were elected on the first ballot & the 3d the 2d. Mr. Read was out of Congress when the vote was taken, being indispos'd & was very sensibly mortified at the vote of his state. The principle upon wh. the delegation of N.Y. acted was well-known to me, (at least I suspected it) before we left Trenton, & from the conduct of that of So. Ca. I must confess I was not surpris'd at theirs. You have no reason for pain or anxiety at this decision: for yr. age, & little experience in business, a very honorable attention was paid you at Trenton in the vote of 5 States.(2) You had also formd early in your service here some powerful enemies who have injur'd you in their States & wh. it will take some time to get the better of. The exertion of yr. State & of yr. frnds. in other States to promote yr. wishes in this instance, as it impresses on other delegations & of course on their States, the knowledge of the confidence & respect wh. your State entertain for you, will I hope have this tendency. As I have not recd. a line from you since I left Annapolis, & of course know not the present state of your enjoyments, it is impossible for me to say anything with respect to your future direction. Indeed all that I cod. say, was I possess'd of this information, wod. be to give you my opinion upon the propriety of your coming here. There seems to be a strong disposition existing among the more respectable members, to prevent an adjournment untill all the arrangments of the Union are effected here, & in the instances wherein they depend on the measures of States in their Legislative character, effected there also, so that the Union stand well connected together & under a wise direction with respect to foreign nations. If this policy takes place, wh. I shall warmly advocate, our session will perhaps continue for a year or two, with respect to accomodations I doubt not they may be obtain'd here. Mr. Hardy & myself have hir'd three very excellent rooms in a convenient house, in a fashionable part of the town, & yesterday began to keep house. God knows what hand we  JANUARY 29, 1785  shall make of it. We have had but one dinner yet wh. was only tolerable. But we live at ease, are quiet & well situated for business. The lady of whom we hire them & who occupies the remdr. is very aged & a quaker. Some letters from our foreign ministers being read in Congress were referr'd to a committee.(3) The committee reported the day after we recd. a letter from Mr. Jay containing this paragraph. \""I have reason to believe that I have come into the office of foreign affrs. with Ideas of its duties & rights somewhat different from those wh. seem to be entertain'd by Congress. If that shd. prove to be the case, I shall certainly think it my duty either to execute it on the plan most agreeable to theirs, or retire from it with as much acquiescence & respect as I accepted it with confidence in their delicacy, & gratitude for the honor they did me.\""(4) This was also referr'd upon wh. Mr. Jay produced to the committee a report drawn by himself for them to adopt & hand into Congress, part of wh. is as follows. \""Your committee are of opinion that whatever intelligence from abroad Congress may think proper to transmit to them or others (meaning the govrs. of states) shod. be by the Secretary of foreign affrs. & that all foreign Letters & papers wh. may be laid before Congress shod. in the first instance be referr'd to him.\""(5) Of this committee I am the chairman, the other members are Platt, Read, Hardy & Spaight, and I will candidly own to you, that I consider the servants of Congress in a different point of view from that in wh. Mr. Jay holds them: I wod. consult or not consult them at pleasure & make them respectful & obedient to the orders they receive. As you tell me nothing from the ladies I am to believe the ladies think not of me. I might apply the same reasoning to yourself but will attribute it in both instances to more interesting ingagments, wh. in your case is pardonable. I am yr. friend, Jas. Monroe P.S. Remember me very affectionately to my friend Genl Gates. Suggest to him that I feel it will be difficult to have the arrang'ments we wish'd & wh. the interests of the union require carried into effect; that if any difficulty shod. appear in placing him at the head of the war department I shall have him withdrawn. Make known to him also the delicacy of my own situation in that instance. Believe me there is not a woman in this town half so hansome as Miss Ch. P.S. I have inform'd Stone we withdrew you from the nomination & my other correspondents, so that it will appear as if you were not in competition. ""

As our finances at present are not in a condition to enable us to carry them into execution I trust they will remain on paper only, till we are better able. We are now but Just emerg'd from a long and expensive war---;many debts contracted in the course thereof---;and at present unpaid---;and till we can see our way clear for the payment thereof I think Congress may be content with such accommidations as we now have---;And with a people who seem disposed to shew us every civility. Mr Foster & myself and some other members of Congress are at present averse to the measure---;& unless we are instructed to the contrary---;shall oppose the motion every time its called up. Could a plan be set on foot to buy a tract of land that's every way suitable for the purpose---;and such a part thereof be sold as would be sufficient to defray the expence of erecting the buildings then we could have no objections to the same---;and I have no doubt in my mind, but in a little time it may be done for wherever a federal town is built, land will consequently rise in value---;as many people will wish to settle where Congress has a permanent residence. I hope that happy time will come, as in my opinion in [it] will cement the union more & more & keep it pure to generations yet unborn. Nothing but our poverty makes us averse to the present mode. Mr. Foster wrote your Excelly. a few days since & now presents his most respectful compliments. We expect soon to have matters of consequence to communicate---;which will be dispatched Jointly.

Among a Variety of other subjects with which the Committee are charged are the Letters from the Ministers of the U S at foreign Courts some contracts of which & also Copies of Two Letters one from the Comte de Vergennes & the other from Mr Grand the banker at Paris are also enclosed. I beg leave to observe that the very different Idea entertained by Myself & other Members of Congress of the State of our Mony Matters in Europe (& Which we imbibed from Conversations with Yourself) seems to render a pritty general reference on these matters to you necessary, in order that Congress or the Committee may from you have a Clear & full statement of the real situation of our Money Concerns on the other side the Atlantic. I thought my self Authorized from your Information to say that a pretty Considerable sum of money was actually in Holland at the disposal of the U S & yet Mr Adams says your Bills will be protested if you shall have drawn on our Bankers there.(3) Mr. Grands Letter says he can pay no more & that he is greatly in advance and the joint Letter of the Ministers shews their situation to be truly distressing.(4) I will further just remark that your Letter of 17th August last enclosing one from Mr Marbois of the 15th, & your Answer of the 17th of same Month are also among the papers now before the Committee(5) & seem to Authorize the Idea we entertained of provision having been made for payment of the Interest due in Novr last on the Dutch loan guaranteed by his Most Christn Majesty. On this Matter this Committee wish the fullest information, their resolve is full to this point. In consequence of a former Reference to the Comptrolers office I receivd from him, the following Accounts Which will render any Containing the same information unnecessary vizt. Estimate of the \""ar- FEBRUARY 1, 1785  rearages to 31st Decr. 1784 & of one years Interest arising on the Foreign & Domestic Debt,\"" In which he has not Charged the Int of the Ten Millions guarenteed by France, supposing it paid, \""Estimate of the Foreign & Domestic debt\"" and \""Statement of the Times of Payment of the Principal & Interest of the Loans in France.\"" The Committee will also be obliged for an Accurate return of the present Civil list of Congress & the Actual sallaries under which they Act from the proper office. I have been very full on the points of the business with which I am charged by the Committee and request you will do me the favour to refer to the proper Offices any Matters on which I may have improperly Called upon you for information and further to furnish Answers as speedily as possible.(6) I remain with very great respect & esteem, Sir, Your Most obedt Humb Sert Jacob Read Chairman of the Grand Committee of Congress ""

  Dear Sir N. York Feby. 1. 1785. I have lately heard nothing from you nor indeed from Richmond. I shod. suspect it arose from the adjournment of the Assembly, if I did not presume, had that event taken place, I shd. been instructed to whose care I might address my letters for you in Fredericksburg or Richmond. My letters to Mr Jones1 have advisd you of the principles upon wh. our delegation actd in the questions respecting the places of temporary & permanent residence for Congress; more explicitly perhaps than our communications to the Executive have done, altho' indeed we have been sufficiently explicit to the Executive.(2) The comrs. FEBRUARY 1, 1785  for the FOEderal town are not yet elected, arising from the urgency of more important business.(3) I am sorry I have it not in my power to inform you we had already taken measures with the {Courts of Spain}(4) & {Great Britain} upon the subjects wh. have arose between us. The reports respecting each, have been frequently acted on, without making any decisive arrangement.(5) That upon a letter of {Mr. Laurens} desiring permission for {Dr. Franklin} to retire hath also been before us.(6) It contain'd a provision that a successor be appointed in his room. A division was calld for, upon wh. an amendment to the same effect was mov'd & six States agnst three were for it. Thus it is upon all questions of a similar nature. Some gentn. wish to commit all our affrs. to be transacted at these several {Courts} to the two gentn. now in office, while we hold that at each {Court} a {minister} is necessary. That at the {Court} of {France} we shod. always be represented, & at that {of the U. Netherlands} untill we had pd. the publick debt or establish'd funds for it. That the nature of the business & the manner in wh. it shod. be conducted considering our situation, requires a particular {minister} at the {Courts} of {Great Britain} & {Spain} at their leasure & who might assume a tone suited to circumstances. That two {ministers} are incompetent to this business if they are to do it, at the respective {Courts} & that to attempt it elsewhere will certainly fail of success, since we have information to be depended on that the {Courts} of {Great Britain} & {Spain} dislike to treat with us elsewhere. Upon all these points we have six States & hope upon the arrival of Maryld. or Delaware, both of wh. are expected daily, to have the 7th. The comrs. of the treasury are elected, Girvais, Osgood & Walter Livinston are the men. Some importt. communications being recd. lately from our ministers abroad, it was mov'd that they be referr'd to a committee to determine what part shod. be communicated to the States. A committee was appointed & a report made. A few days afterwards we recd. a letter from Mr. Jay containing the following paragraph \""I have some reason to apprehend that I have come into the office of foreign affrs., with ideas of its duties & rights somewhat differt. from those wh. seem to be entertain'd by Congress; if that shod. prove to be the case I shall certainly think it my duty, either to execute it on the plan most agreeable to them or retire from it with as much acquiescence & respect as I accepted it with confidence in their delicacy & gratitude for the honor they did me.\"" This was also referr'd to a committee to whom Mr Jay gave (to be ingrafted in the report) in writing the following proposition, \""and that all foreign letters & papers wh. may be laid before Congress shod. in the first instance be restor'd to him.\"" Whether it will be the sense of the committee to make it a matter of right in the minister of foreign affrs. to advise Congress in the first instance upon the various subjects of his department & preclude themselves from a previous consideration, or will consider the offices in a different point   of view, consulting him when necessary & refering or declining to refer to him, at pleasure, any of the subjects before them, is yet to be determin'd.(7) I am very respectfully yours, Jas. Monroe P. S. Mr. Mercer was in the nomination for the treasury but we withdrew him. ""

I [...] for for when I desired you to write I told you I could not. It is really true my right hand has in this respect forgot its burning. At least I am obliged to write to You that in order it be legible to anyone but myself but it is impossible for me to raise up any correspondance which require much writing. Add to this that I find myself so much engaged here either in Business & company, of the latter of which I am obliged to see much more than I could wish that it absolutely take up the whole of my time & leave me very few Moments except necessary so keep to myself. I can therefore at present at least only very briefly Answr. yr. Quests. Nobody I have seen here seems to doubt but the Pamphlet you have so justly remarked upon was written by the Author whose Name it bears (2) but it is a Book not much read & less regarded. The general observat[io]n of those who have seen it is that he was not sufficiently informed upon the subject he undertk. to say much to the purpose upon it. And there Is I believe no danger of his making any Ill Impressions here. You need be under no apprehensions at present I believe of any Aristocratic Chains but may yet ride (I hope long & securely) upon the Democratic Wave. Not that there are no Democratic Tyrants here but the Principles & Vices of Democracy are yet prevalent & will I think continue to have the [...] a superiority. The greatest Danger in that regard that [...] in seems to arise from that Strong propensity we have to run into [...] Lunacy & dissipations of every kind. The fatal tendency of which [...] to overturn our Constitutions FEBRURY 2, 1785  our Countrymen do not seem to be sufficiently aware of. You ask how I like Congress & how they like me [...] of me they have had so little arg[um]ent that as yet I dare say they have [...] formed no expressed Opinion upon the subject. Nor can I have had sufft. knowledge of them to form a decidedly just Judgmt of them. In general I can only say there is much ability discovered in the discussion of affairs & universally good dispositions to do the best they can for the general Weal. But they do not always readily agree in what is [...] that [...] they must with in [...] & [got at?]. All I have to find fault with at present is that discussion appears to me, on many occasions to be too much protracted, & of consequence the business makes but slow progress.

[1785] It was an unfortunate Consequence of the irregularity of the Stage that I did not receive your favour of the 1st till this afternoon when it was almost too late to hope to obtain any Letters for you seasonably to send forward by this post. I applied however immediately to Mr. McEvers who says his Partner Mr. Seagrove has lately made the Tour of the Islands, & will furnish you with such as may be necessary.(1) Fortunately also I just now fell in with Mr. Deuer whose Family was from Antigua, who has also promised me Letters, & Mr. Verplank proposes to get others from a Mr. Beekman so that I hope I shall have some at least ready by the time the Post go's out. I shall nevertheless procure others, in expectation that you may not perhaps sail precisely on Wednesday, & that I may have Opportunity to send them by the Stage before your departure; or if you sho'd be gone they may be return'd me that I may inclose them to you at the several Islands to which directed, & forward them from hence, for which reason I sho'd know the Name of your Vessell. I doubt not they may be useful to your Captain in the Sale of his Cargo, as well as to you. I am persuaded you have determin'd prudently in the resolution you have taken, & approve of it. I have therefore only to wish you a prosperous Voyage & to pray God that it may be the means of restoring & confirming your health. Majr. Alden from his Experience will be able to give you good directions for your Conduct in taking Care of yourself both at Sea & in the Islands. Avoid as far as you can the Evening Air, the Meridian Sun, & Excess of every kind. I shall want to know how you are furnish'd for the Voyage, & what you will have to subsist on when on shore. If you have not time to write again before you go, let Charles inform me. You will of course write us by every conveyance. Don't you propose to carry some Books with you to amuse you, if you are not sea sick, & particularly a French Grammer &c. You will no doubt ride about the Country when on shore, perhaps you had best take a Horse with you for that purpose. Your answer to Nicholls was very well. I am content to wait on Castle, as I believe he is FEBRUARY 5, 1785  very poor, but what I agreed to was to take a new Note with security, for the Balance, but it may be as well to let it rest where it is. Sunday Eveng. 8 O'Clock. The Eastern Post I find is not come in, & no dependance upon his arrival sooner than Thursday. But the Stage (by which I have no Letters) is, contrary to expectation, come in, & as usual gos off at 5 in the Morning. Depending upon the Post, & not expecting the Stage, the Letters I had engaged were to be ready at 10 O'Clock, the Post hour, tomorrow. I have therefore been to Mr. McEvers & sent to Mr. Duer, to acquaint them with this embarrassment. Mr. Seagrove is gone from home but Mr. McEvers has sent after him, & they will do the best they can to dispatch their Letters this Evening. Such as I can obtain I shall enclose, the rest must wait, the next Conveyance. I have written Govr. Shirley but do not at this moment recollect his Christian name, I think it is William, probably Majr. Alden will recollect it, so leave it to you to direct & seal it (as you will all other Letters sent you) before you deliver it. I hope I shall be inform'd by the first Opportunity whether you are certainly to sail on Wednesday as was proposed I sho'd wish it might be postponed a few days that you may receive such Letters as I may be able to procure, if not as I have said I will endeavour to forward them from hence. Present my tenderest Love to all the Family. That all gracious Heaven may Bless, Protect, & Prosper you, & return you to us again in health & safety will be the constant Prayer of, Yr. most affectionate Father & Friend, Wm. Saml.

  Dear Sir,(1) (Copy) New York. Febry. 5th. 1785 I have lately received your favor from Cataraqui (2) and am happy I have it in my power to correct the information you have received respecting the detention of Captain Aaron Hill and others, Chiefs of the Six Nations, under the late Treaty at fort Stanwix.(3) The Commrs. in concluding that treaty, agreeably to a stipulation of it,(4) with consent of the Six Nations, kept these Chiefs as Hostages untill there shou'd be a  FEBRUARY 5, 1786  complyance with the engag'ment on the part of the Indians, in the restitution of their prisoners. This is a custom warranted by all previous Treaties, where stipulations of the same Kind are entered into. Their situation is quite different from that of Prisoners nor are they considered in such a light. It is a practice Known & in use, among the politest European Nations and therefore cannot be held dishonorable to the Indians. As for my own part, I consider it in this instance as an unnecessary precaution, for I have such confidence in the Indian Chiefs and Warriors, that if they gave me their honor they wou'd perform any condition, I wou'd require no other obligation from them. It is in Old Countries, hacknied in the vices & debaucheries of Courts, where solemn ingagements are treated with contempt, and the faith of Treaties hold of no avail. Between the Indians & the United States I wou'd require no other obligation than their mutual honor, but the commissrs. of Congress thought it their duty to pursue the old custom. I have no doubt, if it is the desire of the Chiefs, they will be set at liberty, provided they can get home; or if they cannot, they will be invited here, where they will be treated with the utmost kindness & friendship. I am exceedingly glad you did not go to G. Britain. It is the earnest disposition of the States to cultivate the friendship of the Indians, and of course, the less they are connected with other powers, the more agreeable it will be to them; and the greater confidence they will be able to place in them. Examine your own situation; look to the Powers of Europe; mark their objects and progress on this Continent; then look to the united States; with whom does the powerful impulse of nature, or the God of nature bid you ally yourselves! Did we request you in the late War to be otherwise than neutral! But you might have joined us! And do we request more now than that you be our friends. Does the spirit of revenge govern us in our conduct toward you? It does not. We wish to take you by the hands & forever hereafter to esteem you brothers. Your apprehensions of danger in coming here are believe me groundless. You shall certainly be treated with kindness & the utmost attention & be permitted to go when you please. I shou'd be glad to see you here & many other members of Congress as well as our friend Governor Clinton wou'd also be happy to see you. Believe me I speak with sincerity, that the disposition of the Congress is very friendly to the Indians, and that nothing wou'd be more painful to them, than that any circumstance shou'd take place which might give them uneasiness. I shall be always happy to hear from you & Mrs. Brant as well as little Joseph & am very sincerely your friend & servant, James Monroe ""

I wish not to give Mrs. Whipple trouble nor desire her to pay me, before she can sell the estate, but I must insist upon payment before the estate is divided among the creditors, as the money due to me, was advanced (to the decd) for taxes, and is first to be paid & therefore I have still to request your attention to the same. It gave me concern to hear of your indisposition, & real satisfaction to find you were recovering, & I hope your health is perfected. I perceive you are under some mistake in supposing the letters you mention came from me, as I have wrote to you but one letter, before this, since I left home, & that you acknowledge to have received. Please to make my respectful compliments to the Doctor & acquaint him that I have not heard from Capt. Jones since I left home, neither do the letters from our ministers mention any thing about the FEBRUARY 7, 1785  affairs the Doctor is concerned in, however he may be assured it will give me pleasure if I can render him any services while I am here. Congress are much engaged in business of the greatest national importance; Our finances, the settlement of the Western country, the navigation of the Mississippi, the state of our commerce in general, & the British being still in possession of the Fortresses on our northern frontiers, are subjects that require the greatest attention. The affairs between the Emperor & their High Mightinesses put on a very serious appearance, but as winter is the time to negotiate, possibly it may be settled. The people of this City are very kind & polite to the members of Congress, who they say have honored them with their presence; visitors, cards for dining, & visiting cards &c, &c, are numerous; however, these things are well enough in there place, but we are a young republican Government & great oeconomy & prudence is necessary.

  Gentlemen, New York 7th Feby. 1785 We have this day drawn a Bill of exchange on the treasurer of the commonwealth of Massachusetts for Two hundred and sixty mexican dollars to enable us to send an express to the commissioners of our appointment for constituting in part a federal court for determining the dispute between Massachusetts and New York---;the necessity of this measure arises from a detention of official information on the Subject, in consequence of a memorial from the agints of New York to annul the determination of the place for holding the federal court, made in pursuance of an agreement of the agents of both States. We have opposed a commitment of the memorial,(1) upon the ground that congress have no authority to alter the place thus fixed by agreement---;and to secure the commissioners acceptance of our nomination, we shall be under the necessity of continuing our opposition, unless we are assured that an alteration of the place will have no effect in preventing that acceptance. This may take up much time in congress, and as the appointments are by a second agreement of the agents null & void, unless as respects those who may accept within two months after the determination of the place for holding the Court, and considering likewise that seventeen days have already elapsed of the time mentioned, we think it is indispensably necessary to transmit to the Commissioners attested copies of the agreement & determination referred to and to obtain their answers before the expiration of the Two months.(2) We have the honor to be with great respect your most obedient & very humble servants.

 Pennsylvania Delegates to John Bayard Dear Sir New York Feby 7th. 1785 I received one of your favours since my arrival here and have wrote you (1) stating that Connecticut has revived the old dispute about Wyoming.(2) A copy of their papers I have transmitted to Council which doubtless will be laid before the Assembly for their deliberation Very soon after Meeting.  FEBRUARY 7, 1785  Mr Henry's arrival with the copies of the Proceedings of the state in this affair has anticipated My request that you wou'd furnish us with them. The Council having done this fully except such as relates to the proceedings of the last Supreme Court at Northumberland & Easton, these may be necessary at least so far as they were published in one of the Philada. papers about one month ago. A few days after the arrival of Mr Henry this Matter was taken up as the order of the day when we without difficulty had it postponed Sine die And hope it will give time to the Legislature to deliberate in such a manner as will give Mutual Satisfaction to the parties and do complete Justice. By all that we can learn from the delegates of Connecticut she has no serious intentions of prosecuting this dispute as a state any more than Merely to Patronize her Cityzens (the Wyoming Settlers) in their Claim of Soil and even that feebly as Dr Johnson has told us that he neither wishes nor can proceed in the dispute till he receives further instructions and that he expects An agent or agents from the Settlers and not the State. How far the decree at Trenton has decided the right of Soil as well as Jurisdiction is a question that professional Lawyers may differ in Very much. We think that both have been determined fully. There is evidently two parts in the decision Vizt the lands in dispute and Jurisdiction both Judged to be in Pennsylvania by the Court at Trenton. If this Matter comes to be seriously debated in Congress you must see the Necessity of having an agent or agents of professional knowledge of Law to combat Dr Johnson. Hitherto we have not been able to finish the business of appointing the additional Commissioners for settling and liquidating the Publick accts.(3) altho' a report has been on the table many days agreeable to the intention of the law which we hope will be compleated in a few days. The report is a general one comprehending every State having large unsettled accts. with the Publick and when resolved upon we will take the earliest oppertunity of forwarding. If it don't arrive in time I wish the operation of the Law could be suspended a few days longer, that we may have the Credit of being Federal in our measures. A Brittish Packet arrived at the Hook Thursday last but the mail was not brought to the City 'till Saturday evening last, a report prevails that the Dutch & the Emperor have Settled their dispute---;no particulars nor is it generally believed---;but it is probable that the winter may afford an oppertunity of negociating & perhaps terminating them. We lodge together Since Mr. Henry's arrival and 'tho not the most comfortable, or at a Very high rate, which together with fuel, candle and liquors &c amount to more than we had any reason to apprehend.

  Sir, New York February 9, 1785. In pursuance of the Instructions of the Hon. the General Assembly, their delegates have moved in Congress that the Contractors for Oxteams in 1781 should be paid their ballances out of the last requisition. This motion is yet in the hands of a Committee. It is our Expectation to obtain a resolution authorizing the State to pay these ballances out of the requisition for the current year, the last requisition having been otherwise appropriated.(1) And, indeed, this is all that Massachusetts could obtain for their Contractors. A great deal of business lies before Congress in the hands of Committees & in reports. It is easy to perceive that the tardiness of the delegates in assembling at Trenton, together with the adjournment to this City must have prevented us from the expected dispatch of public business. I have the pleasure, however, to observe that eleven States are now on the floor, & that a good degree of harmony prevails. A Grand-Committee has been appointed & instructed to report a requisition on the States for the supplies of the current year. Mr. Morris has returned his Commission to Congress in a Letter dated Sept. 30th & ceased to act in his official character. His accounts of receipts & expenditures, during his administration, in detail, has not been laid before Congress, as yet; but we are informed it is now at the Press in Philadelphia. The Chairman of our Grand-Committee has written to him for information [on] what arrangements he has taken for paying the interest due in Europe?(2) What payments have been made, or measures taken to make payments, by the several States on the requisition of last April? And what monies remain in the Treasury, FEBRUARY 9, 1785  or elsewhere, not specially appropriated? This is all the account I am able to give of the State of the Treasury, excepting that the State of Virginia, in the course of the last year, as I am informed by her delegates now in Congress, have paid into the Treasury of the U. States more than four hundred thousand dollars in real money. I hope this will at least justify an opinion heretofore advanced that the delinquency of the States was not so much owing to want of energy in the fOEderal government, as to want of energy in the government of the particular States & a real want of resources, or of the power to render them productive. The happy return of peace & plenty to the States will, it is hoped, produce similar effects throughout the Union & restore public credit. The Hon. John Lewis Gervaise, of So. Carolina, the Hon. Samuel Osgood, of Massachusetts, & the Hon. Walter Livingston, of this State, have been elected Commissioners of the Board of Treasury. The latter is present & ready to accept. The two former have not had time, since the notification of their Election, to return an answer. Congress have ordered all their public Offices to be removed from Philadelphia to this City. The Portraits of the King & Queen of France are also to be brought here. The City-Hall has been given up to the use of Congress & their officers by the Corporation of the City, excepting the room in which the Mayors Court is holden(3)---;And I presume it is unnecessary to mention that the members can be accommodated in the best manner---;but that the expences of living here are greater than at any other place where I have attended in Congress. We wait with impatience the result of the negotiations opened with the Indians---;as the Western lands are in great demand, & frequent applications are made for grants. It is expected that Congress, before they rise, will be enabled to open their Land-Office, & to establish Some government in the Western wilderness. I am sorry to observe that the Southern States do not seem disposed to cede their claims over the mountains to Congress. No. Carolina has even repealed her act of cession, after the example of Connecticutt. Happily it is out of the power of N. York & Virginia to repeal theirs. The Agents for Massachusetts & N. York have agreed on the Judges to constitute a fOEderal Court to decide on their interfering claims to Vacant lands.(4) This Court is to be holden in the City of Williamsburg in Virginia, next June. The N. York land-office is open to all the citizens of the U. States. Forty two petitioners are to have six miles Square at one Shilling per acre to be paid in any kind of Securities for liquidated debts due from the U. States, or from the State of New York. Their land-office, their Impost, their confiscated estates, &c. will enable this State to establish funds sufficiently productive to pay all their debts. I am informed, &   that in a manner satisfactory to me that the Bill for granting an Impost to Congress will be rejected by a Majority in the Legislature of this State which is now in Session.(5) As this measure has not been adopted by the State of Georgia & as the supplementary funds, the only Security in the System for the domestic creditors, have not been effectually complied with in more than one or two States, I have given it as my opinion here that our State would not resume the consideration of that Subject 'til all the other States should have substantially complied: And indeed, in that event, of which I see no probability, it might perhaps be for the Honor of the State to fall in with that measure, last of all & only on the most violent compulsion. In consequence of a motion made in Congress by an advocate for a revenue in the hands of Congress, a Committee has been appointed to report the measures necessary to be taken on the Subject of the recommendations of April 18, 1783, for the Impost, &c. As Congress have been pleased to appoint me Chairman of this Committee & to join with me two members who are not friendly to the revenue System, it would seem that a change of the financeering System may not be far off: But as this Subject has not been drawn into discussion in the present Congress I have no authority to announce the probability of such an event.(6) I have transmitted to my good friend Governor Bowen News- papers containing a bill published by the Legislature of Pennsylvania for funding their quota of the national debt on State funds. Such a measure was adopted by New Jersey long ago; & I am told that other States are taking the hint. Sure I am that State funds may be established on as safe grounds & prove as productive as funds in the hands of Congress. Can it be said that the particular States are unable to draw from the people as much money as they can, or ought to pay? Will not State-laws operate with greater energy & safety than fOEderal Ordinances? But I have almost involuntarily run into a Subject I intended to have avoided when I sat down to write this Letter, as it has been already exhausted & the bare mention of it has become ungrateful to the ears of some of my good friends. Congress have resolved to send Ministers Plenipotentiary to represent the U. States at the Courts of Madrid & London; & their Election is made the order of the day. In consequence of the earnest request of Dr. Franklin it is in contemplation to permit him to return to this his native Country, where he wishes to lay his bones. The return of this venerable Patriot under these circumstances must give pleasure to all his friends, or let me say to all the friends of this Country & of freedom. Governor Jefferson, who is peculiarly acceptable to the Court of Versailles, will probably be appointed his Successor at that Court. I observed in my last,(7) that the resolution of Congress putting all the Letters from our foreign ministers under an injunction of Secrecy,  was my apology for not making more ample communications on the Subject of our Foreign Affairs. It is in contemplation, at least with some Gentlemen, to recommend to the States an Alteration of the Confederation on the Subject of Commerce. The motion under commitment aims to vest Congress with power to regulate both foreign & coast wise trade---;And to ascertain & regulate the duties to be paid in the importation of foreign merchandise:(8) provided that the assent of at least nine States in Congress shall be necessary to all their ordinances on these Subjects---;And provided also, that all such Ordinances shall receive the approbation of the Legislatures of nine States before they shall take effect. provided also that such ordinances shall continue in force only years. provided moreover that the Legislatures of the particular States shall relinquish all power to lay imposts against their neighbouring States---;And lastly, provided, that all such imposts shall be collected under the Authority, & accrue to the use & benefit of the particular State where they shall be paid. I have thought proper to lay these outlines of the System proposed before the State; Should it be thought proper to act on this Subject, or any other by way of altering the Confederation, I am clearly of opinion that the Bill for the purpose ought to be published for the consideration of the people at large & that every town should be requested to give their deputies special instructions on the Subject. I trust in the Wisdom of the public councils to devise a System of commercial regulation which will answer every reasonable object of the mercantile part of the community, without endangering the Liberties of this Country: But if I am called on either to part with my freedom, or foreign commerce, I shall want no time to deliberate. The proceedings of the Committee of the States at Annapolis last Summer are printed & to be sent forward to the several States.(9) Since the assembling of Congress in this City some of the Southern States have discovered great uneasiness under the Ordinance passed at Trenton respecting the residence of Congress & It yet remains very uncertain whether FOEderal buildings will be erected any where soon. On this Subject, however, it is considered that the eastern States have possessed themselves of the advantage ground.  The question of the Independance of Vermont has not been resumed---;nor have their delegates made their appearance as yet. The delegates would be happy to receive particular & pointed instructions on the Subject of commerce. How far will the State consent to part with its power to regulate commerce? How far will it be safe to vest Congress with power relative to ascertaining & regulating duties, &c. As it is our earnest wish (for I believe I may also speak for my Col-  league in this matter) to conform our conduct to the views of the Honorable the General Assembly, it will, at all times, be very agreeable to receive instructions on any subjects of Importance. I could wish to enlarge on several Subjects but the fear of giving of- fence by obtruding my indigested Ideas will induce me to conclude this Letter by requesting your Excellency to assure the Hon. Genl. Assembly of my constant attention to their interest & to those of the U. States---;& to be persuaded of the great esteeme with which I have the Honor to be, your Excellencys most obedient & very hble Servt. David Howell P.S.

Schuyler, Phil. Dickinson and Robt Morris are the commissioners. Some States have not been hearty in the Measure---;Maryland has been principally active in delay---;from what Motives we are not at liberty to do more than conjecture.(1) Perhaps the precipitate retreat of Congress last Summer from their Capital has its influence, or they rather wished the banks of the Potomack had been fixed for the permanent federal residence which would have placed the Capital of the United States nearer them---;but what- FEBRUARY 11, 1785  ever reasons opperated with them it is Very evident that Congress have lost that influence at home and respectability abroad which are essentially necessary to conduct with advantage the concerns of a great Nation and which can never be r[e]gained while they are once or twice a year Moving from place to place. Princeton, Anapolis and Trenton have been Visited in order & in the Very hour of expectation each have experienced disapointment. New York is now the temporary residence untill a permanent one is provided and if this should fail Perhaps this City in turn will feel her share of Chagrin by another removal---;in short Sir there appears no end to removals but in the erection of a permanent federal House in which each State will have an intrest and in some degree find themselves at home. We gave a Cheerfull assent to the ordinance at Trenton convinced of the advantage and necessity of the Measure and believing that it woud meet the approbation of our constituents who have generally stood first in executing every thing that appeared calculated to promote the Honor and happiness of the federal government. The Place proposed in the ordinance whether on this or that side the Delaware is Very favorable to Pennsylvania. Much of the money expended there will finally center in our State---;this deserves attention. The offer made by New Jersey of thirty thousand pounds and territorial Jurisdiction give rise to an enquiry which we have frequently heard What will Pennsylva. do? To this we cannot answer but as the Legislature are now sitting we state these things to you in order that they may have it in their Power to favor us with their instructions upon this point as soon as convenient. Wednesday nixt is appointed for discussing the report of a committee respecting the appointment of additional commissioners of accts and we have reason to hope it will fully answer the intention of the house---;a compleat Copy of the Laws and resolutions of the legislature since the revolution are Very necessary for us, therefore we request that we may be furnished with them as early as convenient.(2)  We have heard nothing of the Wyoming Business since we last wrote you.

Having obtained by this Procedure the Sense of the House, which We found generally opposed to a Suspension, and not being possessed of any Official Opinion from the State, We thought it best to decline our Right of Entry on the Journals till We could be officially advised. Out of eleven States on the Floor, there appeared in Favor of a Suspension, the State of New-Hampshire, one Delegate from Massachusetts, one Delegate from Virginia with the State of Maryland. After submitting to your Excellency the inclosed Copy of our Motion of the 10th which contains the Substance of that made on the 8th, it is almost unnecessary to add that on a candid Review of the Circumstances of the United States We are sincerely penetrated with the Policy and Necessity of a Suspension of the Operation of the Ordinance.

The Objects of the Ordinance being two, First to found a fOEderal Town, And Secondly to erect(3) They had flattered themselves, they speak it with profound Respect to Congress, that the Circumstances of the United States, would alone have justified Congress in procrastinating the Execution of so expensive & seemingly unnecessary an Undertaking. They have sedulously but unsuccessfully attempted, to reconcile it's immediate Execution, with the pressing and importunate Demands of those Creditors, whose Loans to the United States, Congress are FEBRUARY 11, 1785  called upon by every Impression of Gratitude and good Faith, to satisfy without further Delay. They are also compelled to acknowledge their Insufficiency of Penetration, to discover the Expediency of Founding a fOEderal Town, of not less than two Miles square, between two large Cities, either of which offer to Congress almost without Expence, every Convenience and Advantage that can be created by the Force of Money in a fOEderal Town. They also entertain a painful Doubt, as to the Competency of Congress to \""found a fOEderal Town\"" under the Authority of the Confederation. By the eighth Article of the Confederation, it is declared \""That all Charges of War and all other Expences that shall be incurred for the common Defence or general Wellfare and allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common Treasury.\"" It would seem that Congress having so many Towns in their Choice, in which they may hold their Sessions, and at a very inconsiderable Expence erect a FOEderal Stadt-House & proper Offices, if the Erection of such Stadt-House and Offices should become necessary, that the \""Founding a FOEderal Town\"" for these Purposes is by no Means essential to the [\""]common Defence or general Wellfare\"" and that the Money for such a Measure cannot therefore be constitutionally defrayed out of a common Treasury. From all which Considerations it appears essential to a satisfactory Conclusion that the Parties be allowed a reasonable Time to consult & advise with their Constituents, especially as an Opportunity for similar Advice and Consultation may be said to have been tacitly admitted by Congress in the Case of the two fOEderal Towns. Therefore the Delegates of the State of Maryland move that Congress suspend the Appointment of Commissioners to carry the Ordinance for founding the said Town into Effect till the first of May next.

Nevertheless, Congress adjourned before it could be taken up, and the Virginia delegates succeeded in further postponing the election on February 9. The following day the Maryland delegates offered a more formal motion to suspend consideration of the ordinance until May 1 (see enclosure), intending to register their protest on the journal.

  Gentlemen, New-York 12th. Feby. 1785. The meeting of congress at Trenton in pursuance of the resolution of the 26th of April last was attended with many embarrassments; the town is small, and the accomodations not so extensive as the various officers of congress required for the convenient transaction of the public business; many of these accomodations were contrary to the expectation of congress taken up by the Members of the legislature of New Jersey, then sitting at that place; a general uneasiness in consequence was soon manifest in the members of congress, and a preference for Philadelphia was daily increasing. The present policy of carrying into effect the Resolve of congress for their alternate residence on the Potomack, and the Delaware, was made a question, & induced the Resolution of the 20th of December, declaring the inexpediency of erecting federal Buildings at more than one place at present.(1) We were fully impressed with the inconvenienies of an appropriation of money for the erection of even one sett of federal buildings; the pressing demands for an annual discharge of the interest of our foreign debt, the same obligation applying with equal justice to the FEBRUARY 12, 1785  Debts due to our own citizens, were viewed in connection with the backwardness of some of the States in furnishing their respective quotas of former requisitions, and operated against an appropriation. On the other hand, the numerous inconveniencies of the frequent removals of congress, the dissatisfaction that some of the States would entertain, provided their individual wishes, on this subject, were not gratified, the great loss of time, and division of sentiments, likely to take place, in future discussions of this question, the exposure of the public records to injury, or destruction, and in fine, the opinion of irresolution, and want of union, which the frequent changes of residence would probably produce in foreign nations, are considirations of importance, & were allowed their weight---;our situation at Trenton convinced us that a small village was unfit for the residence of congress; and it did not escape us, that their sessions being held in any large commercial city, would never be found beneficial to federal measures; the experience already acquired on this subject had made the proposition most clear, that the council of the United States ought to be remote from large trading cities, and free from their influence. Comparing these sentiments we were induced to esteem it a measure of political necessity, to conclude in favor of an immediate erection of federal buildings, on the Delaware; and until such buildings could be ready for the reception of congress, to fix on a situation, less exceptionable than Trenton, for their temporary residence. Had we been reconciled to Pennsylvania on the subject of her former Defect in support of the Honor of the United States, yet we found that state so central to the Union, that, holding a casting vote, and it being her individual interest that Philadelphia should be the residence of congress, she would have impeded every measure for the completion of the federal buildings, & thereby have kept Congress in that City. New York is so far on one side the Union, that this difficulty is not to be apprehended; the accomodations of this City are equal to those of Philadelphia, the climate more salutary, and the erection of federal buildings free from impediment; our exertions therefore were in favor of New York as the temporary residence of Congress, who yesterday made choice of General Schuyler, of New York, General Dickerson of New Jersey, & Robert Morris Esquire of Pennsylvania, Commissioners to carry into effect the ordinance of the 21st day of December, relative to the federal buildings. The instruction of the Legislature relative to an explanation of the fourth Article of the definitive treaty between the United States and Great Britain has been laid before congress, and is now in the Hands of a grand committee:(2) the inclosed extract of a Letter from the commissioners for forming commercial Treaties (and numbered 1) will inform the Legislature in what stage that business is abroad, in pursuance of an instruction of congress.(3)  The progress made in instituting a federal court between Massachusetts & New York previous to the Time when the Agents left us, has undoubtedly been communicated to the Legislature(4)---;soon after we forwarded duplicates of the joint Letter of the Agents of the two states to each commissioner, with a letter signed by us copy whereof is inclosed (No. 2).(5) These Dispatches were covered to the address of Messrs. S. & R. Purviance of Baltimore with one letter to those Gentlemen copy whereof is inclosed (No. 3).(6) Copy of their answer is likewise inclosed (No. 4). The business in Congress upon the subject of our federal court has assumed a less amicable appearance than was expected---;conformably to the agreement of the agents of the two states a copy whereof is inclosed (No. 5)(7) Congress on the 21st day of January proceeded to determine the Place where the Court should be holden, and Williamsburgh in Virginia was fixed upon by five States, there being nine on the floor; this determination is contained in the inclosure (No. 6).(8) The advantage of this decision to Massachusetts will be readily understood, when it is observed that it furnished the Highest probability that those of the commissioners, who are of our Nomination by this measure would be induced to accept, as it fixed the court in the vicinity of their homes---;the Agents of New York discovered this benefit, and to defeat it, preferred a memorial to congress, praying an alteration of their determination on this subject, copy of this memorial is enclosed No. 7.(9) We opposed the agency of Congress upon this memorial (without remarking upon the erroneous reasoning & statements it contains) on the ground, that the only authority Congress had upon this Subject in the present stage of it, was derived from the Agreement of the agents of the two states; and that in pursuance of that Agreement, Congress had made their award, which was conclusive to the parties. Although New York have been unable to induce Congress to annul their determination of the Place for holding the federal Court, yet they were in the Train of accomplishing their wishes, by an indirect effect of their memorial. The president apprehended that he was not at liberty to transmit the Official information to the commissioners,(10) of their respective appointments, and of the place fixed for holding the Court until Congress should take some resolutions on the memorial of the Agents of New York---;this Opinion we could not discover the propriety of, but attempted in vain to alter. By a second agreement between the agents of the two States, it is determined \""that if either of the commissioners shall not within two months next after congress shall have appointed a place for holding the court declare his acceptance of the trust, he shall be considered as not accepting thereof, and his place shall be supplied in the same manner as if he had expressly declined.\""(11) Seventeen days had elapsed after the appointment of the place for holding the Court, & FEBRUARY 12. 1785  no information had been officially transmitted to either of the commissioners except Mr. Rutledge of their appointment. In this situation we judged that the interest of the state would justify us in forwarding attested copies from the secretary of congress to the commissioners of our nomination by a special express; and Major Story, whom we engaged for this purpose, sat out yesterday for Williamsburgh, where Mr. Wythe lives, & from thence, on his return, will call on each of the commissioners of our nomination, and also on Mr. Johnson & Mr. Harrison, for their several answers. This measure was attended with an expence, for the discharge whereof, we have drawn on the Treasurer Mr. Ivers for Two Hundred and sixty Mexican Dollars, and rely upon an order of the Legislature for the timely payment of our bill. We do not at present see any mode whereby New York can go off from this determination; although after the acceptance of the commissioners of our nomination, if it is agreeable to them, to come farther northward than Williamsburgh to hear the cause, we can discover no objection to our acceding to such a proposition; but then it must be a measure of mutual consent, and not the result of an acknowledged power in congress upon the subject. We have been particular in our communication to the legislature upon this business, because we wished them to have every information touching a subject, which we do not esteem unimportant. We inclose for the information of the Legislature the form of a Deed (No. 8) which we propose to execute for the cession of Western Territory.(12) To cede a less extent of territory than New York have ceded, we judged would be wholly impolitic at this period; to cede a larger extent if we had no other objections might appear like an attempt to influence the federal court in our expected Trial; we therefore adopted, as a line wholly free from exception, the same western boundary which New York made, in their cession to the United States. The confidence of the Legislature placed in their delegates upon this subject, is a painful one to discharge; the business not requiring an immediate execution, and being so very important, we thought it our duty to communicate to the Legislature the extent of Territory we proposed to cede, and afterwards to wait a proper time for their instruction relative thereto. If we receive no additional instruction upon the subject during the present session of the Legislature, we shall presume that the proposed cession meets their approbation, & will proceed to execute the deed.(13) We inclose likewise copies of an instruction from the Count Vergennes to Monsieur Marbois, the Chargé dé Affairs of France, with it's inclosures; these Papers were communicated to us by Monsr. Marbois, as will appear by his Letter addressed to us, and prefacing the inclosure (No. 9):(14) it is only necessary for us to add that our answer to Monsr. Marbois has been that we would transmit to our Legislature   copies of all the papers, and wait their instruction what answer touching the same we should return to him. The extracts from the Letters from the foreign ministers communicated by the President of Congress to his excellency the Governor,(15) are of a nature, and importance, that require no observations from us: the Legislature must feel the force of the remarks which they contain. We hope the establishment of the board of Treasury and the late appointment of commissioners named in the inclosure No. 10 will have a happy effect on our money affairs,(16) and remove all jealousies on that subject in every part of the union. We are constrained to point the attention of the Legislature to a notification, in the Boston Gazette printed by Powars & Willis, which has been reprinted in the Gazettes of other States, announcing Mr. Richard Soderstrom as consul of the Swedish nation (duly commissioned,) at Boston in the commonwealth of Massachusetts.(17) The sixth of the articles of confederation declaring that no state without the consent of the United States in congress assembled, shall enter into any conference, agreement, alliance or Treaty with any King, Prince or State and the Ninth of the said articles vesting the sole power of entering into Treaties and alliances in the United States in Congress assembled, it hath been heretofore supposed that the authority in the first instance of passing acts of recognition of the quality and character of consuls was exclusively vested in the United States in Congress assembled. The Exequatur of the quality of Mr. Soderstrom, published by the authority of his excellency governor Hancock (Mr. Soderstrom not having been announced to, or recognized by, the United States in congress assembled, in any quality, or character, of consul) has been remarked on here, as a procedure adverse to the principles of confederation; and may induce some act of congress upon that subject. It therefore becomes our duty to inform ourselves of the sentiments of the Legislature upon this subject in good season, lest our private opinions should lead us to concur in measures that might be in opposition to the sentiments of the state we have the honor to represent, & whose determinations when known must constantly govern our conduct. We shall continue to make such communications to the Legislature, from time to time, as our Duty shall point out, & their interest require. We have the honor to be, with the highest consideration, Gentlemen, your very humble servants E Gerry Geo.Partridge} Delegates of S. Holten R. King } Massachusetts ""

  Sir New York Feby. 13th. 1785. Having received no late dispatches from Your Excellency, we are of course ignorant what part of ours, have reached you, or the Council. We will however begin with the resolutions which respect the erection of fOEderal buildings at the falls of the Delaware, and the intermediate residence of Congress here.(1) FEBRUARY 13, 1785  When the question was first brought forward for erecting, a fOEderal town it was the wish of our delegation to decline a decision on it for the time, and pursue the business of the union, either where we were; at Philadelphia; or in New-York; to either of which places we were willing to adjourn. But in pursuit of this course, we had not the assistance of a single State, the delegation of Maryland being absent. The two ends of the Continent had heretofore, upon this subject, been drawing in different directions, the eastern and middle States in favor of the Delaware, and the southern in favor of the Potowmack. The division upon this question, since they left Philadelphia, had induced the unsettled and vagrant system which has taken place; a system so destructive of confidence among the citizens of the Union, and dishonorable to the fOEderal councils throughout the world. The contest had now come to a point; whether this should continue to be the case, and the Congress move alternately to Annapolis, and Trenton annually, and carry on the fOEderal buildings at both places at the same time, or no buildings at all, under the resolution of Princeton; or come to other resolutions, changing those arrangements, were the questions before us; questions too which were forced upon us, from every quarter of the Union. The only prospect for obtaining a decision in favor of Georgeton had depended on the support of the Southern States, and we soon had the mortification to find, that they had given it up. By them it was urged that the object of the southern Gentlemen was, when they left their States, to move to a northern climate; that they generally visited N. York, N. Port and Boston; that by water, their passage was as easy to either place, as to the Chessapeake: that they had no object to serve by a situation on the Chessapeak, and that they perceived no great fOEderal end, which could be attained by it for the present, at least none to occasion a longer delay, or that would counterbalance the injury arising from the present state. This was the language of Georgia, South-Carolina and one of the members from North-Carolina (there being but two on the floor), and of all the States eastward of Maryland. There were then nine States in Congress, eight of which held this opinion, and New-Hampshire and Connecticut were daily expected. In this situation it was proposed \""as inexpedient to erect for the present more than one fOEderal town\"" and to this we agreed. It was then proposed \""to appropriate 100,000 dollars to this purpose,\"" and for this eight States were decidedly in the affirmative. The situation then became more interesting to Virginia. The only question before us was, shall we frustrate what the sense and voice of the union require, frustrate it too only for a few days, for upon the arrival of Connecticut or New-Hampshire, it will be carried without us, or accede to a measure which they all think so necessary for the general interest? And we conceived that the great principles upon which we entered into the confederacy, a respect for the harmony and inter-  ests of the union, and a regard for the character and honor of our own State, should determine us to pursue the latter course. The next question was \""where shall the town be erected.\"" We had, you perceive, before this lost all hopes of Georgeton, but we thought it our duty to put the question on it, for which we had only the State of Virginia. It was then carried in favor of the falls of the Delaware. Many arguments occur to us, in favor of a fOEderal-town. If we reason from experience, we are inclined to think many disadvantages must arise, from the residence of Congress in a great commercial city, a city more especially, under the jurisdiction of a particular State. We suspect that inconvenience hath, in some instances, been already felt from this source. Parties appear to have been formed at particular OEras, for and against particular characters, who were unworthy of parties, in a much less dignified assembly. In all great bodies there are usually some men, who are easily won on by little considerations, and the nature of the fOEderal government is so constructed, that it is much more difficult to carry than obstruct a measure. Those then who are under an improper influence, from whatever source it may arise, are always the most obstinate: they will hold to their point, while those who seek only the public good will make concessions to carry a measure, which they think of importance to the general interest. With pain we conceive we have seen these remnants of parties, contending with more warmth than the public interest required in favor of measures, which derived their consequence, merely from the circumstance of their having been an object, with one of the sides. And we have been also happy to find, that Congress had so far extricated themselves from their influence, by moving out of their reach, as to weigh the measures merely in the scales of reason, while they looked with equal indifference upon those, who espoused or opposed them from other considerations. In a great commercial town, it is almost impossible, to keep any thing a secret. The Ministers of other powers have their eyes upon us, and we have reason to suspect that our transactions of the most important, and secret nature, do not long remain secret to them. If this is effected by the too frequent intercourse which takes place under the present state, or the indiscretion or villany, of those intrusted with them, it will be more easily discovered and prevented in a fOEderal- town. Indeed every consideration of interest, propriety and dignity urge with us in favor of the measure. Upon what terms it is to be erected, is also an interesting consideration. The delegates of Jersey inform'd Congress that their State would advance a considerable sum, and those of Pensylvania did the same, provided it should be on their side. Although it might be improper to accept it as a gift, still we conceive the same objections do not exist, as a loan. We borrow from foreigners, and with more propriety may we do  it from each other. With respect to the temporary residence, we were indifferent, between this place and Philadelphia. We knew not how our residence at either place, could essentially affect our State, farther than it respected the members in Congress; and upon general principles we thought this entitled to the preference. The province of Canada is at present in possession of the furr-trade. Our first exertion should be to draw it within the States, and before any competition can arise between the communication down the Mohawk, thro' this port, and the Potowmac, we shall have removed hence to the falls of the Delaware.  Upon the arrival of Mr. McHenry from Maryld. he moved for a repeal of the ordinance of Trenton but was not seconded. So soon as his Colleague joined him, he moved for a suspension of the measures necessary to carry it into effect;(2) for this purpose he introduced a resolution with a long preamble, containing a very illiberal censure upon the proceedings of Congress in that instance, as well as upon the measure of a fOEderal-town. All Congress seemed desirous to keep it from the journals, and at length succeeded as to the preamble, the resolution was negatived. Having failed doing any thing effectual at Trenton, we conceived this measure had taken its direction. Our friends of Maryland should then have been upon the floor to have aided us, and why now fill the journals with vain and fruitless opposition, but to disseminate an opinion of divisions in our councils, and throw contempt on our government. We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, Your Excellency's most obdt. and most hble sts., S. Hardy Jas. Monroe ""

13004,dg022146,1785,Richard Henry Lee to Patrick Henry,"""Richard Henry Lee to Patrick Henry
  Dear Sir. New York, February 14, 1785 Your favour of December 9th,(1) has just now been put into my hands, together with the printed papers that you were pleased to send me, but I have not yet had the pleasure of finding Colonel Grayson here.(2) I do sincerely wish to see my country flourish and be happy, so that if by any means in my power, I can contribute to this most desirable end, I shall certainly exert myself. No time or circumstance, can ever force from my mind, the sincere affection that I entertain for the original friends, to the just rights of America, whose wise and firm perseverance, has secured to the United States at least the blessings, without which, there is little difference between men and brutes. The ill state of health that I contracted at Richmond in May 1783, still afflicts me, which, added to the business and the ceremony of my present office afflicts me much, and must, necessarily prevent me from such frequent communications, as otherwise I should undoubtedly make. With respect to official intelligence from Europe, we have none of great consequence; Mr. Adams thinks, that the negotiations of this winter will probably accommodate the difference between the emperor, and the United Netherlands, and our charge des affairs at  FEBRUARY 14, 1785  Madrid, informs us that the court of Spain has appointed Mr. Gardoque, to come here as their minister and we expect him daily.(3) His purpose is to treat of commerce, and territorial limits. Our ministers at Paris are generally proposing treaties of amity and commerce, with all the European commercial powers, and they receive answers very civil, but as yet no treaties formed, except such as you have seen notified from Congress. As you have been pleased to desire my reflections upon the state of affairs, I will give them freely, as they appear to me. The courts with which we are most immediately concerned, are Spain, England, France, and Holland; the two first, because we border on them, and because we have with each most pressing difficulty; the two last, because we are indebted to them both on the score of money lent, and friendship in other ways conferred. Spain is proud, and extremely jealous of our approximation to her South American territory, and fearing the example of our ascendency upon that country, is grasping forever at more territory, by way of security; and hoping to derive benefit to her system, from our want of system, our discord and inattention. Hence we may expect from Mr. Gardoque, an apparent firm demand of the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi, with some tempting commercial offers, to procure our assent to the loss of this very valuable navigation. But probably, the apprehension of a quarrel with us, and the effect of it upon their South American possessions, may secure to us, if we are wise and firm, the free navigation, to be finally agreed to by Spain; with Great Britain, our difficulties will be greater; equally proud with Spain, and much more powerful, with fewer reasons to fear a rupture with us, and more to hope from a successful one; she remains sullen after defeat, and seeming to wish for just provocation to renew the combat. The passions of states, and of individuals, are not very different; for what are the former, but a compound of individuals, and of course carrying into the composition, those leading principles that characterize the parts. In private life, a wise and fortunate victor, over great strength, would, in all his conduct with the vanquished, show a respectful civility, avoiding every display of supposed superiority, and carefully shunning every appearance of giving cause for fresh offence. It seems to me, that if the conduct of America, had been founded on such principles our magnanimity must have been confessed, and that the seeds of future discord, would not have been so effectually sown as I fear they are. Both countries have been to blame, and transgressions against the terms of peace were on each side coeval, so that whilst we charged them with removing the slaves from New York, they pointed to the violence with which their friends were everywhere treated, with the detention of their debts, and with actions here brought against those who possessed houses in this city, whilst it was in their power by the fortune of war. This again is followed by their detention of the western posts, by their   encroachments on our north-eastern boundary about St Croix, and by their unfriendly interruption of our commerce, and lately by arresting in London a merchant of Philadelphia for debt, because his privateer had taken, during the war, a vessel belonging to the complainant. This is an unpleasant state of things, and if temper and wisdom are not employed on both sides, it is not difficult to foresee a renewed rupture ere long. The principles of republics being virtuous, and their conduct therefore squaring with justice, they rather negotiate differences than fight them. Monarchies depend too much upon the ultima ratio regum. When we have acted fully up to our principle, we shall be upon strong ground to combat theirs. But the cause of virtue, without proper means to support it, must often fail. These considerations lead me to wish most sincerely that my country may quickly cease to give the smallest cause for just offence, and that our rulers would engrave upon their minds, the wisdom of the inscription upon the arsenal of Berne in Switzerland---;That people happy are, who, during peace, prepare the necessary stores for war. It is in vain for us to expect this from the United States---;to be secure, each state must provide amply for itself; and whenever Great Britain shall find us just, temperate, and prepared, she will be extremely cautious of hostile aggressions, or of unjust treatment of us. If this reasoning is right, how will your excellency's administration be marked for wisdom, if effectual attention be paid to the collection and preservation of military stores; I have here been informed, by an officer of rank in the continental artillery, at the surrender of York, that several pieces of our artillery were retaken from the enemy, and that they are now at Philadelphia; it deserves to be considered, whether these are not subject to be returned to us, upon demand of the state: there were also several pieces of our artillery, thrown into Pamunkey river, near New Castle, in 1781, and some other pieces fixed in the ground, and in vain attempted to be destroyed by the enemy. Baron Steuben lately sent us the enclosed letter, which I have now the honour to transmit; his published plan, is only an outline, but the details by which that plan is to be executed, he professes himself willing to communicate, when the state of Virginia shall call upon him, for them. The sum of this, (I fear, too long digression, upon our relative situation with Great Britain), is, that being secure of having done right, we should be fully prepared to meet aggressions from that quarter; a sentiment founded upon an attentive consideration of the correspondence, between the British generals, during the late war, by which it is not difficult to discover, that experience had instructed them in this truth, that a war against the United States, had better be pushed in full force at first against Virginia. I have before observed to your excellency, that Mr. Adams thought we might expect a compromise between Holland and the emperor, from the negotiations of this  winter; it is certain, that every influence of France, will be used to effect the compromise, for reasons very obvious: but, whilst the emperor demands a preliminary, that the Scheldt shall be opened, and Holland as peremtorily says, that it must not, it remains possible, but not probable, that an accommodation may take place: if it does not, the powers on the continent will be engaged in a most expensive war, whilst, as it seems, Great Britain will remian neuter, and by peace, preparing herself for war, render her hostile views, more dangerous to us. The apprehension of this difficulty, on the part of our friends, has probably produced the strong intimations that we must be exact in the payment of our interest upon the foreign loans; and the same reason does indeed call upon the United States, in the strongest sense, to be punctual in their payments, that those who have assisted us, in the day of our distres, may not suffer for their generosity. The attention of Congress, has been applied to our western concerns, as your excellency will see by the treaties made with the Six Nations, and the western Indians;(4) in the latter, the Shawanese are not included, but their being prevented by some active British emissary, from coming to the latter treaty, will probably not be attended with ill consequences, as they are very much under the control of the Six Nations, and of the Wyandots, their powerful neighbours. The spring will open further treaties with the more southern tribes, north-west of the Ohio, and also, on the south-eastern side upon ours, and the frontiers of North and South Carolina, and Georgia.(5) Judging from myself, I suppose your excellency will be tired with the length of this letter, and if you will pardon it, I promise you, that I will not again transgress in the same manner. I have the honour to be, with sentiments of esteem, respect, and regard, sir, your excellency's most ob't serv't, Richard Henry Lee MS not found; reprinted from Memoir of the Life of Richard Henry Lee, 2:56--;60. 1 Governor Henry's letter of January 9, rather than December 9, is in Henry, Patrick Henry, 3:265--;67. 2 Henry explained that delegate William Grayson, who intended to leave Richmond on January 10, had agreed to deliver the governor's letter.

Two of the commissioners who negotiated that treaty---;Richard Butler and Arthur Lee---;were joined by George Rogers Clark in meeting with western tribes at Fort McIntosh on the Ohio River in December and January.

They recommended, however, that they continue negotiations with the tribes even farther to the west at Fort Vincennes in the spring. Congress referred the letter and treaty this day to a committee consisting of William Samuel Johnson, James McHenry, David Howell, James Monroe, and Hugh Williamson which reported March 7 that such a treaty should be held and recommended certain conditions and a meeting date of June 20.

I have not been honored with your commands upon that point. Soon after my arrival in this city, I sent you one of the few pamphlets addressed to the President of Congress by Doctor Price---;it will give me pleasure to know that you have received it.(2) The commissioners for treating with the western Indians did yesterday present to Congress the Treaty that they have made with the Wyandots, Delawares &c. A copy of the Treaty I have now the honor to enclose you.(3) The Shawanese, you observe, are not there---;it seems that persons, disaffected to us, prevented them from meeting the Commissioners. The Wyandots being stated as their superiors may perhaps prevent any mischief from the Shawanese not being included in this Treaty. Another Treaty will be held with the more Southern Indians in the spring or first of the summer.(4) The policy seems to be a good one, of enclosing as it were, the Indian nations within our acknowledged territory. It will probably tend to civilize them sooner, and by preventing intrigues with them, render them more certainly our friends. FEBRUARY 14, 1785  The Court of Spain has appointed Mr. Gardoqui their Chargé des affairs to the United States, and we have reason soon to expect his arrival.(5) We are to apprehend a very firm ostensible demand from him, of the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi. His secret orders touching an ulterior agreement may be another thing. Time and wise negotiation will unfold this very important matter, and I hope may secure to the U. S. and those Individual states concerned, the great advantages that will be derived from a free navigation of that river. My respects, if you please, to your Lady, whose health I hope is perfectly reestablished. I have the honor to be, with the truest respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. P.S.

  Sir New York 19th Feby. 1785 Application has been made to Congress lately by James McMechen who is connected with James Rumsey of Virga. in the newly invented Machinery for pressing Boats through the Water. Mr McMechen has laid before the Committee, to whom his Memorial was refer'd, a Certificate that you was pleas'd to give him respecting the Invention.(1) We observe your Opinion that \""He has discovered the Art of working Boats by Mechanism and small manual Assistance against rapid Currents.\"" Though this Opinion is clearly in favour of the Invention the Committee have great Doubts whether Mr. McMechen has interpreted it fairly. He says that his Boat will by means of the Machinery and without any manual assistance ascend a rapid Stream and that the small manual assistance which you mention refers only to working the Boat in dead Water. If this is true the motion of the Boat depends on the adverse motion of the Stream and it's Speed must be as the resistance. The Committee would have presumed that the Progress of the Boat depended on the Mechanism, which being well contrived; the Boat with few Hands or with little force would go much faster either in a Current or in dead water than by help of any former Invention. But if it is true, as Mr McMechen alledges, that the Boat is forwarded by the Opposition of the Stream & that against swift Streams it does not even require the aid of manual Assistance the Case is essentially different and the Discovery extremely important. Mr McMechen we find expects a Patent for the Invention from the Legislatures of the several States, but he further requests that Congress would give him a large Tract of Land in consideration of the Benefit which the western Country must receive from his Boat. Certainly an Improvement so well calculated to promote Commerce and Agriculture as Mr McMechen supposes his Boat, ought to be liberally encouraged but we fear that he colours too high, mistakes the Facts or miss-represents them. It is with much Reluctance I give you any Trouble on this subject but being very desirous to know in what Rank this Improvement should be placed I am to request your Opinion on this Position that the Boat stems the Current and requires least manuel help where the opposite Stream is most swift, for such Powers does he ascribe to his Boat.(2) FEBRUARY 19, 1785  You have probably heard some Time since that the Indian Commissioners have finished the second Treaty. The last was held with the Wiandot, Delaware, Chippawa and Ottawa Nations. The Shawnees did not attend. It is difficult even at this Hour to say how much Land is purchased for the Use of the United States. By the first Treaty the six Nations ceded all to the Westward of a certain Line, say to the west of Pensylvania. By the second Treaty the Indians first mentionned have reserved a Quadrangular Piece of Land viz Beginning at the Mouth of Cayahoga thence up the River to the Portage to the Tuscarawas Branch of Muskingum, then down that Branch to the Forks above Fort Law-rence, then West to the Portage of big Miami which runs into the Ohio, then along the Portage to the great Miami or Omai, thence down to its Mouth, thence along the south Shore of L. Erie to the Mouth of Cayahoga. Those Indians cede all to the East, South & West of the reserved Tract. Probably there may be 12 or 14 Millions of Acres clear of any interfering Claims of Indians to the West or North. I presume Congress will soon try whether they can agree on the best mode of sinking Part of their Debt by this Land.

Some for their funding bill & some against it. Some for fOEderal & some for state funds & some for neither funds nor payment. Another division is for & against the test- law, but this cannot last long. All these collisions & discussions are perhaps the natural consequence FEBRUARY 20, 1785  of the heterogeneous materials of which that State is so remarkably composed, and will I doubt not eventually lead to the increase of knowledge & Security of freedom.(2) My last official Letter to the State contains all the information I can give.(3) With best regards to all friends, I am, &c, David Howell P.S.

At length with infinite difficulty I have carried thro' a committee of 5.

If the recommendation takes place for this change it is propos'd to write a circular letter to accompany it to the States. The more I consider this subject the more fully impress'd I am with the necessity of this measure, for upon it depends the strength & duration, in a great degree, of the confederacy. Hardy is in favor of it & will give his assistance. Yesterday we attempted to  FEBRUARY 20, 1785  Elect a minister to the ct. of London, & Adams, Rutledge & R. R.

The previous one suggested that I possess'd the good wishes &ca of a particular person. If this were the fact as it might have proceeded from some attention wh. I paid her, which never were intended to lay myself under any obligation to her, but merely to enjoy the pleasure of her company wh.

  Gentlemen New York 23d. Feb. 1785 The controversy between Massachusetts and New York is of a nature that excuses me in remarking to the agents of the former, such observations as I may obtain here relative to the same. The New York title will depend on their possessory right, directly, or impliedly, acknowledged by Massachusetts, and other states.(1) They will prove a possession prior to the first Massachusetts Charter, and produce ancient maps to shew that the whole country west of the Hudson was laid down at that time as nova Belgia; then argueing from the municipal principle, that a possession of a part, inures to all the beneficial purposes of a possession of the whole Territory claimed, attempt the establishment of their title by possession. Perhaps in obviating this doctrine, the old Dutch records of New York might furnish some useful information, but how they are obtainable I am at a loss. Pennsylvania used translations of these records in her Trial with Connecticut; but since, contrary to the practice of all other courts, the parties withdrew the papers used as evidence in that trial, it would depend on the good will of those, who wish us no prosperity, whether we can obtain the same Translation, or any other. New York will introduce such parts of these records as they may find proper for their object. Smith in his history of New York cites an old author, whose name I don't remember, who considers the Territory west and north west of Albany as Terra incognita, by looking into Smith's history probably you may find something that will serve us.(2) The Gentlemen of New York speak of some public acts, laws, proclamations, or opinions of Massachusetts, declaratory of their idea of the  FEBRUARY 23, 1785  extent of their western boundary---;they do not particularise. I have heard it said that Massachusetts have heretofore declined assistance to or protection of western Indians, upon the grounds that the Territory of Massachusetts, did not extend beyound a certain western boundary; it certainly would be well to examine every act of Massachusetts on this subject that may be obtainable and perhaps the Laws fixing the county lines may by incautious expressions express some precise Limit to our western Line.  It was a custom, and I learn a pretty ancient one, for the board of trade in England every Eight or Ten years, to propose to the respective Governors of the American colonies, questions relative to their general prosperity, numbers, and the progress made in settlement of the Country, the extent of their Boundaries, and the number and disposition of the indians in their several colonies. The answers to these questions by the governors of Massachusetts and New York may be important acquisitions in the Trial between the two states. Great reliance was made by Pennsylvania in their trial with Connecticut, upon an answer of the Governor of the latter, which stated the number of indians in that colony as very inconsiderable; from whence Pennsylvania argued that at that Time Connecticut had no idea of a western country as annexed to their colony, for had that been the case they would have given a far greater number of Indians, as the western country was then crouded with Natives. Although indian applications do not always demonstrate that the power to whom they apply, is their rightful protector, yet any thing of that kind, from the western indians, to Massachusetts in early Times, would weigh well against the claim of these Dutch Descendants, and therefore should be looked after. It has been hinted that by force of the p[r]ocess on the quo warranto against the Governor & al, under the first Mass. Charter, or by force of the Jugement therupon (if any jugement was ever entered in form, which Hutchinson doubts in his history) (3) the patent made by King James to the Council of Plymouth, and of consequence the Grant from the council of Plymouth to Roswell and his associates was vitiated. A summary account of this p[r]ocess is given by Hutchinson, but nothing particular can be concluded from his history; if an authentic report of that case can be obtained, it might be very serviceable. There is a declaration made by the Governor & Company of Mass. in the year 1676 on the records of the Mass. Genl. Court for that year, which was transmitted to the King and expresses the sense of the Colony then (which was forty seven years after the date of their Charter from Charles the first) of the extent of their Territory from sea to sea. This paper is in Belknap's History of New Hampshire,(4) Appendix paper 14. The paper No. 15 in the same appendix, containing a report of the board of trade, throws light upon the same subject. The original is in the Office of the supr. Court of New Hampshire. FEBRUARY 24, 1785  Doctr. Johnson thinks both these papers will be useful on the trial, advises therefore to obtain authenticated copies.  No information yet concerning the acceptance of our Judges---;the business stands in Congress upon this Subject as when you last heard from us---;we will inform you of the progress as it may happen. I have the honor to be respectfully your very humb servt. R King ""

It stands Assigned for an early hearing before Congress, but must if possible be delayed till some person appears from that Quarter to support it. We see by the Philada. Papers that yr. Exs. Letter to Presidt. Dickenson upon that subject has been lately laid before the Legislature of that State, & we shall probably soon hear from them something further relating to it. The Act relating to the Impost, we find upon the Files of Congress.(2) That subject has lain some time before a Commee. of Congress, who do not yet Report,(3) probably because they wait to see what the Assembly of this State now sitting, & before whom a Bill is depending upon that subject, will do in the affair. The Cession of Western Territory by the State of Connecticut we some time since formally laid before Congress, moved their Acceptance of it, & offer'd to execute a Conveyance pursuant to the act of the Legislature. It was strenuously Objected to, but after some Debate refer'd to a Committee, who have not yet enter'd upon the consideration of it.(4) If they do not do it, after FEBRUARY 24, 1785  waiting a reasonable time we shall conceive it to be our duty to call upon them to take it up. Two Objections especially are made to it, 1st That it is within the Cession of Virginia. 2ly. That even the 120 M[iles] reservd by Connecticut is included within the extensive Purchase lately made of the Western Indians & Ceded to the United States by the Treaty recently return'd to Congress by the Commissioners. So that they must not only receive from Connt. a Cession of what is already their own, but implicitly confirm to that State 120 M. of Territory already Purchased by, & belonging to the United States. Our pretence for reserving which, it is alledged, is also unfounded, as it belongs to the United States & not to Connect't to furnish the Lands for the Satisfaction of the Soldiers of whose Interests we affect to be so careful. To these are added the original deficiences of our Title, & the decision at Trenton against it. The answers we shall give to these Objections we need not state, they will readily occur to your Excelly. Congress have, since we wrote last, been very busy, & have taken up a great Variety of affairs, yet no very capital matters are yet bro't to a conclusion. Many are Reported upon & more yet lie before commees. The Papers have some time since announc'd to you the Election of the Commrs. of the Treasury.

It is resolv'd to send a Commissr. into the Western Territories on the Mississippi & Ohio where it is said the Settlers are in great disorder,(5) to endeavour the restoration of Peace & Order, & to prepare the way for the Establishment of regular government in those extensive & very valuable Countries which are rapidly filling with Inhabitants. A demand has been made of Longchamp by the Court of France, a very delicate & important affair which has claimed the Attention of Congress, but has not yet receiv'd a full discussion. He will not, we Imagine, be Delivered up, but the Question is what Answer shall be given & upon what grounds the denial may be most prudently placed.(6) We can add nothing farther at present but remain with the greatest respect & esteem, Yr.

I am happy to give You this Information, both on publick Consideration, & on the Scope of Friendship, the former however being on every such important occasion the predominant principle, in my Mind. At the first balloting You had five, Mr Chancellor four & Mr Rutledge two Votes: And the States were tenacious of their Votes for several Days.(2) Temper was however preserved, & produced an Explanation by which it appeared that the southern States were impressed with the Idea, that You being totally averse to the Slave Trade would not exert Yourself at the Court of London to obtain Restitution of the Negroes taken And detained from them in Violation of the Treaty; & that in negotiating it, You was not so anxious as the other Commissioners respecting the American Debts, & would not, in all probability, be assiduous in executing the Instructions of Congress for discharging the American Merchants from payment of the Interest that accrued during the War, & for postponing the payment of the principal for three Years after the signature of the preliminaries of the peace. Whether these were real or ostensible Reasons, It is not in my power to determine.(3) I only state them as what were urged by the States opposed to your Choice. I find however that One part of your secret Journal, wherein Mention is made of a Compliment paid You as being \""the Washington of the Negotiation\""(4) & that a paragraph of one of your Letters describing the proper Character of the Minister for London, that he should be possessed of the \""cardinal Virtues,\"" compared with other Letters of yours claiming the Appointment, are urged as Traits of a weak passion, to which a Minister ought never to be subject, & as an Evidence that an artful Negotiator may flatter You out of important objects---;these Your Friends & disinterested persons consider as subtil Devices of Seekers, And their Dependants to supplant You: & every person who knows the Value of an able, faithful & indefatigable Minister, who has been long in his Country's Service & rendered the most essential Services to her Cause considers with Horror such Measures & is happy in defeating FEBRUARY 24, 1785  them. It is nevertheless my Duty, as a Friend to my Country, to yourself, & to the Cause of Virtue, to give You confidentially this Information, that Your publick & private Letters may not be in future abused to such unworthy purposes, indeed I think Cave is applicable, as it respects some of your Correspondents high in office at Massachusetts. These You must be sensible are Communications, which nothing could induce me to make, but, the Necessity of your co-operating with those who are determined to support You on this side the Atlantic, in putting a stop to, or at least in checking such ruinous Intrigues.

Nevertheless, if Britain is so much under the Influence of a weak passion, as to indulge it in renewing Hostilities amongst Us, & We shall meet her with cheerful Hearts, well knowing We have Resources, & being fully assured, We FEBRUARY 25, 1785  shall by some effectual plan be able to draw them forth in sufficient quantities to humble her pride & correct her inimical Disposition. Having given Mr. Adams Information of the proceedings of Congress since their Meeting at Trenton, & desired it may be communicated to Yourself,(2) I can only add on this Head, that Mr R. Morris, General Dickinson & General Schuyler are elected Commissioners to erect the fOEderal Buildings on the Deleware, & that the two former have accepted the appointment. Nothing further is done respecting a Land office, but I presume it will be soon taken up, as the Indian Commissioners have made considerable progress in their Negotiations. A Report is made to raise 1500 Men, but what Number will be agreed on & in what Mode, Time must determine---;the proposition is to raise them for three Years. Another Report is made for recommending to the States an alteration of the Confederation, so as to invest Congress with the power to regulate the Trade of the united States, as well with foreign powers as with each other. & whilst I am on this Subject give me Leave to enquire, whether it will not be better policy to form our Treaties on Terms of Reciprocity with each Nation rather than on the principles it has adopted with the most favored Nations? If we provide in our Treaty with each Nation, that whatever may be the Average of its Duties on Imports & Exports, We will lay similar Duties, they may impose what Duties they please, & We shall have power without embarrassment, to reciprocate this commercial Tax & thus avoid being what We otherwise inevitably must be, their Tributary---;for if on the other Hand, We are to be on the same Footing as the most favoured Nation, & this on an average pays 15 Per Ct. on Imports & Exports, whilst the most favoured Nation on our part pays but 5 Per Ct., is it not evident that this Rule would operate to tax us 10 Per Ct. as a Nation, on Imports & Exports from such a Treaty? This favoured Nation system appears to me a system of Cobwebbs to catch Flies. Attend to it as it respects Restrictions, prohibitions, & the carrying Trade, & it is equally distant from a Rule of Reciprocity, which is the only equitable & beneficial Rule for forming Commercial Treaties. Mr. Adams is appointed to the Court of London, & a Report for accepting Doctor Franklins Resignation is before Congress, who will probably pass it, & appoint yourself to the Court of Versailles. You will certainly have all the N England Interest in your Favour. Doctor Lee having just arrived from the Indian Treaty, informs me that a Cession is obtained from the Savages of about thirty Million Acres of Land, bounded by the great Miami, Lake Erie &c; & that another Treaty is to be held, in which a further Cession is expected more to the Southard.

A resolve of Congress of the 29th day of January 1784 placed this business in train1 & originated, the appointment of Commissioners by Massachusetts to examine into the complaints of encroachments by the british on her territory, the commissioners, proceeded to make such examination [and] I think reported to the Legislature a state of acts & their opinion on the same, & here the business appears to have terminated. The resolve above referred to recommends that the proceedings had by Massachusetts, should be communicated to Congress. This communication has not been made, altho, it is most clearly the policy of Massachusetts to do it, & to procure an Act of Congress upon the subject, that shall make it the concern of the Union. Congress in their present un-informed situation can do nothing on the subject. If a proper report comes forward to Congress, it undoubtedly will become an instruction to their Minister.

Court might be reminded of filling up the Delegation if they Judge it expedient. I feel myself happy in retiring to private Life, at a period when the Liberties of my Country are so well secured, and when there is so solid a Foundation laid for the publick Prosperity and happiness: being confident that a Country so enlightened as ours, will not fail to build on this foundation a National Character corrisponding to the Dignity of humane nature under a Republican form of Government, where Justice, Wisdom and every Principle of virtue may operate unrestrained.

  Dr Sir,(1) New York the 26th Febru. 1785 I thank you for your favors of the 15th and 19th Inst. I Doubt the sincerity of the Wyoming people in thier application to Congress for a federal Court, no commissioners are yet arived nor any further instructions to Dr Johnston, if they could bring them selves within the ninth article of confederation I would not object to their having a federal Court for the sooner an end can be put to this affair the better. Mr John Adams was Elected two days since Minister to the court of London. A Charge des afair will probably be left in the Hauge till he can return for his principal business will be to make a Demand of the western Posts now in the hands of the British.

  Dear Sir, New York Feby. 27th 1785 I am now to thank you for the letter that you did me the honor to write to me on the 8th of this month, and which I received on the 17th with the enclosures.(1) Sir James Jay had mentioned the plan of Lady Huntingdon to me, previous to the receipt of your letter, and at the same time that your packet reached me, there came one to Congress from Governor Henry with her Ladyships letter and plan enclosed, which the Governor strongly recommended.(2) It was presently observed that the terms upon which lands had been ceded to the United States did not leave it in the power of Congress to dispose of them for any purpose but for paying the debts of the public by a full and fair sale of all the ceded lands. It was indeed remarked, that those religious people whom her Ladyship had in prospect to transplant & fix on our frontier were remarkable in the late war for an unanimous and bitter enmity to the American cause, and as such might form a dangerous settlement at so great a distance, contiguous to the Indians, & easily accessible to Canada. Especially in the present very unfriendly temper of mind that we now suppose the British nation possesses with respect to us. It was therefore ordered that Governor Henry's letter with the enclosures should be filed, but nothing more done in the affair. Finding this, I concluded it not necessary to shew your letter, either publickly or privately. I have therefore returned to you, Lady Huntingdon's packet. It  FEBRUARY 27, 1785  appears to me, that Georgia is the most likely State in the Union to close with her Ladyship, if the latter argument mentioned in Congress should not prevent it. I am sorry to hear that you are so interrupted by applications that ought not to be made. I hope however that you will not suffer them so to prevent your necessary exercise, as to injure your health. The investigating and opening our western navigation is an object of great importance and well worthy of your patronage. I believe, as I hope, that it will be found by experience to be of great utility both to the public and to the private adventurers. Very little has yet been done in Congress respecting the Western Country---;but a very full discussion of that business will soon come on when it is to be expected that our affairs in that quarter will be put under better regulation than hitherto they have been. The mischief that experience & reason both join in proving to flow from the Sessions of Congress being held in our large Citys, produced the necessity of determining on some place of easy retirement for the federal government, and the unhappy neglect of attendance on the part of the Southern States has furnished an opportunity for a Majority in Congress to fix on a spot too excentric. My wishes would have been to have gone further south, but of two evils it was best to choose the least, and therefore we thought it better to fix somewhere in retirement than to continue wandering, or to fix in the midst of dissipation.(3) We had but just determined upon sending a Minister to the Court of London (Mr John Adams) when this day 28th Feby., we receive a letter from our Commissioners, for making treaties &c. at Paris, the copy of a letter from the Duke of Dorset, Minister from London to Versailles, to our Ministers, in answer to a proposition from them for making a treaty of Commerce with G. Britain & for settling other points of difficulty arising from the late peace---;In which his Grace declares the determination of his Court to be ready to settle all these affairs upon terms of equal & lasting good to both countries whensoever the U. States shall send to their Court a Minister properly authorised for the business.(4) This looks well at least---;and we shall shortly make the experiment of their sincerity. The King of Prussia thinks that there will be no war between the Emperor & Holland, and indeed it does now seem probable that his judgement will prove right. I have sent the letter you committed to my care for the Marquis on to France by the packet. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and regard dear Sir Your most obedient & very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee ""

  Sir New York Feby 27th. 1785 We have the honor to inform your Excellency that on the 25th instant the honorable Arthur Lay [Lee] Esqr arrived in this city, and presented to Congress several medals given by the King of Great Britain to the Indians in the middle district which they had delivered to the commissioners for settling a treaty with them.(1) In the treaties which have been completed with the Indians about thirty millions of acres of land have been obtained which in our opinion is a quantity sufficient to form one new state and half of another. These lands we hope will very soon be put in such a train as to be the means in some measure of releiving the public credit. Congress in pursuance of their resolution to erect buildings for their accommodations have proceeded to elect commissioners for that purpose---;and accordingly made choice of the honorabl Robert Morris Esqr of Pennsylvania, General Dickerson of New Jer[s]ey, and General Schuyler of this State for to carry this business into effect the gentlemen first mentioned have accepted their appointment, from the other no answer has been received. We have thought it our duty to obstruct this measure as much as was in our power from the pursuasion that the State we have the honor to represent is not under its present embarrassments able to advance cash for the purpose, we wished at least to have gained time to have consulted our constituents on the subject---;but although we had the support of some other States in our opposition yet it was carried against us. The buildings however are as yet on paper only and probably will not soon become more substantial unless the commissioners can contrive means to erect them without calling on the re- FEBRUARY 27, 1785  spective states for the moneys for that purpose---;perhaps it may be effected by making a purchase of so much land over what may be wanted by the United States as when sold will complete the business. Yesterday Congress went into the election of a minister to the court of London(2)---;when the Honble. John Adams Esqr was made choice of by nine states---;instructions will be forwarded with his commission relative to the western posts and other matters interesting to the states. It is our wish not to multiply ministers in Europe and it will be our endeavour, that the removal of Mr Adams from the United Netherlands shall be supplied a charges des affairs to reside in Holland. We conceive the expected arrival of Mr Guardoque from Spain in that character will render abortive any motion to appoint a resident minister at the court of Madrid. We have further to inform your Excellency that such measures have been adopted by congress as we hope will prove effectual to obtain treaties with the Reginers [Regencies] of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.(3) A committee consisting of a member from each State have under consideration an estimate and requisition---;as also the subject of coin and a mint but have as yet made no report thereon. Congress have resolved that the appointment of ministers to foreign courts shall be for three years only unless rechosen, and subject to be recalled at any time. We must beg the favour of your Excellency to lay before the honorable Council our necessity for a further advance of cash. We have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest respect, Your Excellency's Most obedient humble Servant, Abiel Foster Pierce Long ""

  Dear Sir. New York February [28], 1785 I have receiv'd the letter you did me the honor to write the 19th ultimo; it will always give me pleasure to comply with your wishes, the states that are \""deficient in granting the Impost of 5 pr. Cent\""---;are Rhode Island, Georgia, & N. York, this latter has it at this time under consideration; I sensibly feel with you, respecting the state of our finances, and they are now under deliberation of a grand comee. of Congress. The affairs of Vermont, or New Hampshire grants respecting being admitted into the union are, I conclude in the same state they were in some years since, not having heard them mentioned in Congress for a length of time; and I can only add, as my opinion, that there is little prospect of their being considered as a State by Congress at present. \""Old continental paper money,\"" is to have another hearing in Congress in a short time, but what determination it will produce, I consider as uncertain, as when the state of Vermont, so called, will be admitted into the union; however, I am sure the delegates from Masstts. will carefully attend to the same for they are sensible how much their constituents are interested in the matter. As to there being a commercial treaty with G.B.: I consider our commissioners in Europe fully authorized to treat upon the subject, but the prospect of success may be but small. Whether Congress are \""authorized to regulate trade,\"" I must beg leave to refer you, to the articles of confederation, which you are so well acquainted with, however, Congress have it in contemplation to propose to the several states ad- FEBRUARY 28, 1785  ditional powers to be vested in them For a certain time, at least respecting this matter. I am fully in sentiment with you respecting Congress's sitting in a large commercial city, but we are to have a fOEderal town erected, & two of the commissioners to superintend the same have accepted their appointments (viz) Messrs. Morris & Dickinson, however, I consider it uncertain when the buildings, &c, will be ready For the reception of Congress, as some money will be necessary to compleat the same, & where are we to procure it, & pay our other just debts. The consideration of an appointment of a minister to the Court of London, & who should be the person took up considerable time, but at length it terminated in Favor of the Honorable John Adams, being elected by nine states out of Eleven that were present. The fortresses on our northern frontiers being still in the hands of the British, the navigation of the Mississippi, as it respects the Court of Spain, the settlement of our western Country, added to the state of our finances makes great attention of Congress necessary. The affairs of the Emperor & their high Mightinesses must be important in their nature, & serious in their consequences; but as winter is the time to negotiate, possibly it may be settled.

  Gentlemen New York 28th Feby. 1785. My last to you was written early in January just before my Departure from Phila. for this place. I have long flattered myself with a Hope of hearing from you, but have not had that pleasure yet, this perhaps may be attributed to the interruption the post has suffered from the severity of the season & to the negligence & irregularities of that establishment. I have at last received some Letters by that Conveyance from my Friends in Carolina that were the immoderate time of 40 days on the road, from this Circumstance I doubt whether all the Letters I have written you are yet come to hand. I hope this Evil will soon be remedied. Congress disapprove of the Conduct of the Officers who have the superintendance of this department & will very soon take Measures for their better Regulation.(1) Not long since I was favor'd with a Letter from your Brother Mr. Wm. Blount stating the propriety  FEBRUARY 28, 1785  of my return home in March (if possible) with reasons that were sufficiently powerful to induce me to adopt his advice. This impels me to address you on the subject of money, the want of which might prevent my return when nothing else wou'd, having found it impracticable to leave this so early as to enable me to be at home by March term. I have concluded so to regulate my Measures as to return time enough for the ensuing term of our Court which will be the second Monday in May. Nothing shall prevent me from this step but the want of money & I am sure a disappointment in that article must be owing to the Treasury if it happens to me at all. Before I left Phila Mr. Barr informed me you had shippd him a Cargo out of which he was directed to pay me Two hundred & fifty Dollars, part of this he then advanced Me, the remainder he has not yet remitted owing to a detention of the Cargo by the Ice below Phila, he writes me, he shall soon dispose of it & will then remit, the Ballance. Before I left Phila. being pressed much for Money to pay off my Expences there & enable me to come here I was compelled to make use of One hundred & sixty Dollars, the amt. of a Bill drawn by Major Carnes in favour of Mr. W. Blount on Messrs. Stuart & Barr. As this was contrary to his Wish when he gave me the Bill, designing it I beleive for Mr. Ben Smith, I coud wish it Might be replaced as soon as possible, that no Inconvenience might arise from my using it. My Brother writes me that the Sheriff of Craven will take up all my Warrants with the present Collection. You may remember that two or three of them were left in your hands some time before I came from home. I mention this because he expresses ignorance of what has become of them all. I have no late News to write you. A French Packet arrived yesterday. If she brings any News it has not yet transpired, the public Dispatches by this Mail give us no accounts of the Emperor & the Dutch. I think there is great probability Matters will be made up between them this winter. Congress a few days since appointed John Adams, the late Minister at the Hague, Minister to the Court of London. They have also appointed Genl. Schuyler, Robt. Morris & Phil. Dickinson of the Jersies Commissioners for carrying into Execution the Ordinance for building a fOEderal Town &c. I intended by this post to have sent you the prices current of this place but I am disappointed in getting them & have not time to wait as the Mail will soon be closed. I must defer it till the Opportunity by Capt. Tinker who sails next week for New Bern & will no doubt get there before this does. Please present my respects to Mrs. J. G.

 North Carolina Delegates to Alexander Martin Sir, New York March 1st 1785 Congress since their meeting in this City have chosen three Commissioners of the Treasury in lieu of those Gentlemen who were appointed at Annapolis last Year, who have declined accepting that appointment. The Gentlemen now chosen are Mr. John L. Gervis of South Carolina, Mr Samuel Osgood of Massachusetts, and Mr Walter Livingston of this state.(1) General Schuyler, Mr. Robert Morris & General P. Dickinson are appointed Commissioners to carry into effect, the ordinance of the 23d December last respecting the fOEderal Town.(2) This ordinance was transmitted to your Excellency by the Secretary of Congress. We have recd. accounts of a Vessel belonging to Alexandria in Virginia, being captured by one of the Barbary Corsairs & carried into Algiers. By the last accounts the Vessel was not condemned, and as she was only in ballast bound from Cadiz to Madiera, perhaps they may give her up. The depredations of those pirates unless speedily put an end to by making a treaty with them, may prove very injurious to the Commerce of the United States, Congress have taken such steps as they think will accomplish this desireable end.(3) The British Court having taken no steps to comply with that article of the treaty which respects the delivery of the Posts on our Western frontiers, but on the contrary it is said, that they have reinforced the Garrisons, and are repairing the fortifications: And every account from Europe convincing us of the unfavorable disposition of that Court towards us, it was thought necessary to send a Minister to that Court, to insist on the delivery of the Western Posts, and a compensation for the negroes that were carried away in open Violation of the Definitive treaty of Peace, and to prevent matters from getting to that pass, which might again involve us in a War with that nation. Mr. John Adams is the person elected for this purpose.(4) Congress have directed that the Comptroller shall, until the board of treasury are organised, appoint Commissioners to settle the accounts of the states, against the United States.(5) As soon as the Delegates find a proper person for that purpose, they will have one appointed for the state of North Carolina. Our Commissioners have concluded a second treaty with the Indians at fort McIntosh, but as Congress have not yet either ratified the MARCH 1, 1785  present or former treaty with the Indians, we don't look upon ourselves at liberty to transmit copies of them to Your Excellency.(6) We make no doubt but Your Excellency have taken the proper steps to have us relieved at the expiration of our tour of duty, by ordering on the other Delegates, so that they may be here by the first of May, at which time the six months, we are to stay pursuant to the Resolve of the general assembly passed in May 1784 expires.(7) But lest Your Excellency may have omitted to take these steps, we must request You to order on the other Delegates to relieve us at that time; as our private business demands our attention at home, and we must whether releived or not, leave Congress the beginning of May, in which case, if the other delegates don't come forward, the state will not be represented.

I have recd. your favour of the 1st and in answer thereto beg leave to observe that by the 26 Article of the treaty with Sweden and the 29 Article of the treaty with France \""the two contracting parties grant mutually the liberty of having each in the ports of the other Consuls, vice  MARCH 2, 1785  Consuls, Agents and Commissaries whose function shall be regulated by a particular agreement.\""(1) No agreement has yet been entered into for this purpose with either of those Courts. But it has always been thought necessary for foreign Consuls to make known their appointments to Congress, who thereupon order the Commissions to be registered and an Act of recognition to be sent to the States who are called upon to furnish the said Consuls respectively with an exequatur or notification of their quality. See 7 Septr. 1781.(2) Till this is done it has not been usual for any state to acknowledge any Consul from a foreign power. On the 3d of Decr. last Mr Charles Hellstedt produced a Commission from his Swedish Majesty dated the 22 Septr. 1783 appointing him Consul. This Commission is registered & acts of recognition have been sent to the States.(3) But I do not find that Mr Richard Soderstrom is known to Congress as consul of Sweden for any of the States in the Union. With great Esteem and regard I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedt Servt Cha Thomson ""

  Dear Sir New York 2nd March 1785 By last Post I recd a Letter from a Gentleman who lives near your Estate in Virga. He informs me that Col. Henry Reddick & Mr. Pugh at present are in Possession of the Lands but are ready to give them up as soon as certain Legacies shall be discharged to the Amot of £400 Slg. The Land he says is worth £1500 Slg, he promises to give further particulars when he is better informed. On the 2nd Octr last I wrote you,(1) probably to the full exercise of your Patience, & shall not repeat in detail. I told you in genl. that a small Share consisting of 1000 A[cre]s of the great Dismal, joining your Land, may be purchased @ 3/4 Dlrs per Acre. The Company have it in contemplation to dig a Canal through the Dismal, to drain some of the lowest grounds and to carry off the Timber. I informed you also that 10 or 12 Thousd As. survey'd and Patented in the Western part of our State may be purchased @ 40 Dlrs per hundd As. I have not been on those Lands but they are said to be extremely good. Our State made a present of 25,000 As. to Genl Green in that District, he told me lately that he had refused 1 Dlr per Acre for the whole in Specie. As I have 5000 As. which I recd a Present from the State in the same District and much more that I have bot. or recd in paymt. of debts due me by the State you may presume that I have been very attentive to Questions respecting the Quality of those Lands. Our Commissioners have just finished a second Indian treaty at which the several Tribes concerned have ceded to the United States about 12 or 14 millions of As. I presume that we shall soon open an Office for the sale of those Lands. I think the Price will hardly be lower than a Dlr per Acre, hardly so little, but public securities will be taken in Paymt and they may be purchased much below par. Some People fear that our Western Country may be affected by some claims which the court of Spain are said to have made to the exclusive navigation of the Mississipi, If you have heard of such claim you hardly thought it serious. You certainly did not believe that the Court of Spain was disposed to irritate or provoke a Nation who in a few Years must be sufficiently numerous to eat up the Dons in a month if they  MARCH 2, 1785  were reduced to Rations of 12 Ounces, and who could reduce them to that size if they were so disposed. In fact every sober Politician in this country reprobates the Idea of attempting to touch the Gold or Silver Mines of America; they are destructive as the Plague of the human Race. The Spaniards will certainly be so prudent as suffer us to cultivate our Lands. They will furnish us occasionally with a few Dlrs & we shall fairly give them in Exchange a few Brls of Flouer.  On the 24th ult Mr Jno Adams was chosen resident Minister from the US for the Court of London & yesterday Colo Smith a native of this State & formerly one of Genl Washingtons aids was chosen Secy. of the Legation. Unless England shall within a short Time admit us to her West Indies trade we certainly shall take such Steps as will be very injurious to her manufacturers, to the great emolument of the French & Dutch to whom by the way, many good Citizens of these states wish a much larger share of our Commerce than they have hitherto enjoyed. An Acquaintance from Pensylva. has just given me some memorandums which I shall transcribe for your Information lest the Persons, whose Duty it is, should not have embraced the first conveyance. Your Father who paid the last debt to Nature towards the End of Jany has left you the whole of his Estate except as follows. He has left---;To his Son John £350 Pensy mony and one or two negro boys. To his Daughter Louisa £300. To Betsy 150 As. of the upper Tract. To his Widow £500. She had been entitled to £300 by marriage contract, £200 have been added, she is to quit the Estate on the next Spring. To your Sister Sally was left some Piece of mony as a Proof that she had been considered formerly. If there had been any doubts whether you would come over this spring or Summer I presume this incident would remove them.

We therefore previous to the Appointment, conferred with Colo Smith on the Subject, & candidly informed him, that confiding in his Integrity & Honor, & on his prudence in avoiding every Thing that might savour MARCH 6, 1785  of Intrigue against the Minister of the Legation, as well as on his firm Determination to discharge his Trust in fulfilling the reasonable Desires & supporting the Dignity of his superior in office, We should use our Endeavours to promote the Appointment mentioned; and should likewise continue our Endeavrs. to Support the Secretary, whilst he continued to evince the good Disposition We expected---;And We further informed him, We should certainly be firmly opposed to him, should he ever contrary to our present Expectations evince a different Disposition.

  Dear Sir N. York. March 6. 1785. The arrangment in our foreign affairs begins at length to assume some form. Upon whatever ground they were taken up for a considerable time, either with respect to France, Spn. or G. B., the same difficulties arose. If it was mov'd that {Dr. Franklin}(1) be permitted agreeable to his request to retire home it was firmly oppos'd by {R. Island} & {Massachusetts}. If that a minister be appointed to {Great Britain} it MARCH 6, 1785  was mov'd that those instructed to form commercl. treaties be instructed &ca. It was argued on the other hand that our affairs with these courts stood on their own ground respectively and that negotiations with each seperately & at their respective capitals wod. be more eligible & likely to produce success. It was at length mov'd by {Mr. Howell} that a {minister} be appointed to represent {U. States} at the {Court} of {Great Britain} and carried. Adams, R. R. Livingston & Rutledge were put in nomination. It had been previously, with the ill-founded expectation of facilitating this measure, mov'd, by Mr. Pinckney \""that the commissions to foreign ministers unless renew'd by Congress shod. continue in force only for three years.\"" This was negativ'd; but being agn. renew'd by the mover & press'd upon Congress from other quarters was at length carried.(2) Upon several ballots Adams had 5 votes, Livingston 4 & Rutledge 2, Jersey at length voted for Adams, having previously nominated & voted for Livingston, upon wh. Virga. & Maryld. joined in favr. of Adams & gave him his appointmt. Mr. Smith lately an aid to the general hath been since appointed secry. to the legation. A Mr. Trunbull of Connecticut was his only competitor.(3) Had this affr. come on upon the first meeting of Congress at Trenton the event must have been the same. 5 States, the 4 Eastern & Pena. were decidedly in favr. of Adams in preference to any other person, Jersey was at first dispos'd to commit our for. business to Adams & Jefferson only, and wod. therefore have voted Adams to the above {Court}. He wod. of course had the majority in Congress & the expedience of the measure wod. have superseded any difficulties with respect to the man. I suppose {Mr. Jefferson} will shortly be appointed in the room of {Dr. Franklin} to the {Court} of {France}. Carmichael writes that some person in the character of Chargé des affrs. will shortly be sent from Spn. instructed &ca. so that the affrs. with Spn. will sleep till we hear further on the subject. I have recd. letters from Mr. Jefferson of the 10th of Novr. & 11 of Decr. last.(4) In the former he considers war betwn. the Emperor & the Netherlands with their respective associates, the Empress with the Emp. & France, Prussia & the Porte with the Nether. as unavoidable. He considers the intermediate negotiation as an art only of the Imperial Courts to enable them to commence the campaign on better conditions; in the last he says the genl. opinion is there will be no war but that he sees no reason for it, except the indisposition of the Empress upon whose health the projects of the Emperor must depend. He believes that if it takes place Engld. will keep herself out of the scrape for the following reasons, [\""]l. because she cannot borrow money to take part in it, 2. Ireland is likely to give her disturbance, & 3. because her disputes with us are not settled by a full execution of the articles of the treaty and the hatred of her people towards us has arisen to such a height as to prepare their minds for a recommenc'ment of hostilities shod. their govt.   find this desirable.\"" If the war takes place & the states have the direction of their commerce upon fOEderal principles I shod. suppose, provided we settle our affrs. with {Great Britain}, it will be advantageous to us. Every divertion wh. it creates to the vessels of other powers from the business of commerce must form an additional demand for ours and admit us gradually into the carrying trade. By his last letter I find that a correspondence had taken place between our ministers & the Duke of Dorset the B. minister at Paris upon the subject of a commercial treaty.(5) His Grace makes a previous stipulation on the part of his court \""that a minister instructed &ca. by Congress repair to London.\"" They say they are jointly authoriz'd to treat, that they have no objection that it shall be in London, from wh. I suspect they may be there at this time. The commission to Adams will perhaps find him there, but this will not give him powers singly to form a commercl. treaty. The States of Mass. & N. York having previously agreed upon the members to constitute the Court enter'd also into a stipulation that the place of session shod. be determin'd by a majority of the States present in Congress. When brought before Congress, the delegation of Mass. propos'd Wms.burg & that of N. Yk., Wilmington. The former had 5 votes & the latter 4. Of course the decision agreeably to the covenant enter'd into by the two States was in favr. of the former. N. York was dissatisfied with the decision. Mass: mov'd that the Presdt. forward the letters to the gentn. appointed, upon wh. the displeasure of N. York was discover'd. Mr. Williamson movd \""that the decision of Congress by 5 States under the agreemt. of N. Y. & Mass: under the confideration wh. requires 7 in all cases except &c was void.\""(6) Whether the States of Mass. and N. Y. had independently of Congress the right of fixing the place & might chuse any intermediate plan, wh. shod. be obligatory on themselves & the Union, or whether Congress had the power of controul became the question. Whenever it came before them a decision of the main question was always evaded by those of order, so that it was never taken. The two States at length agreed that whatever had been committed to the journals shod. be eras'd wh. was admitted. In this condition it remains. It is expected they will agree to some more northern position.(7) I am dear Sir very respectfully yr. frnd. & ser. Jas. Monroe P. S. Since the appointmt. of Adams it seems generally agreed that some person shod. be sent to the Hague, but no one is yet thought of.(8) ""

  Dear Sir, New York March 6. 1785 I have received your favour of Novr. 11, with the pamphlets, for which I return you my hearty thanks.(1) The report on animal magnetism gave me great satisfaction. Before I had heard of these experiments and of this report, I was greatly at a loss what to think of the matter. The Marqs. de la Fayette had come over quite an enthusiast in favour of it. He had got a special meeting called of the philosophical Society at Philadelphia and entertained them on the subject for the greater part of an evening. He informed them that he was initiated and let into the secret but was not at liberty to reveal it. He spoke of it as an important discovery which would be of great and wonderful advantage & that he himself had by means of it performed a surprizing cure on his passage. I was not present at the meeting for which I was sorry. Still however it appeared to me surprizing, that there should be a fluid pervading all nature capable of being collected and when collected of producing such wonderous effects as were mentioned and that no trace of it should ever before have been observed or noted in any of the various experiments that had heretofore been made on matter or motion. Having heard of the Shakers in this state, the agitations with which they were affected and with which they affected some who visited them from curiosity, I began to admit the opinion that they had by some means become acquainted with this fluid and that what they ascribed to the influences of the divine spirit was the effect of this unknown agent. The report you sent me has removed this doubt and though it has sufficiently demonstrated that Mr. Mesmer and his disciples have discovered no new property in nature yet it has itself made a very wonderful and very important discovery, namely to what degree the imagination can operate on the human frame. I am much pleased with your description of the Cylinder lamp and wish for an opportunity of procuring one. The phosphoretic matches I have seen. They are sold in our toy shops. I think them a pretty invention, but am not much disposed to make use of them in the way you hint. I am in general obliged to be so much awake in the day that I sleep sound at night: or if I chance to awake in the night which is MARCH 7, 1785  but seldom, I find that solemn stillness a good opportunity to revolve some subject which I want to trace through its various relations and probable effects & consequences. I would willingly subscribe for the Encyclopédie Methodique, But it appears to me as if I must bid adieu to the Sciences. My time and thoughts are so entirely engrossed with the duties and business of my office that I have no leisure to prosecute those philosophical researches I once was fond of, And from what I can see Congress seem disposed rather to encrease than to diminish those duties. I am made very happy by Mr Jay's acceptance of the office for the department of foreign affairs. By him you will be supplied with the journals of Congress and regularly informed of their proceedings as well as of the state of our affairs in general, so that I need not trouble you on that head. I long to see your answer to Mr. M[arbois]'s queries. I hope by this time you have found leisure to revise and compleat that work and have committed it to the press or at least struck off some copies for the satisfaction of your friends, among whom I hope to be ranked. I submit it to your consideration whether you do not owe it to your reputation to publish your work under a more dignified title. In the state in which I saw it I consider it a most excellent Natural history not merely of Virginia but of No. America and possibly equal if not superior to that of any Country yet published. I thank you for your notice of Mr. Norris and shall be happy in every opportunity of testifying with what sincerity and respect I am, Dear Sir, Your affectionate friend & humble Servt., Cha Thomson ""

This, it is hoped, with [will] finish this business for the present.

How long it will last I will not presume to predict, but I greatly fear that Schisms & hard words will ensue on some great questions soon to be brought before us. Congress have been informed that Mr. Osgood proposes to accept a place at the Treasury Board. As soon as he can come forward & join Mr. Livingston a Board will be formed. I have seen an account in a Philadelphia paper that a funding bill, on State funds, has passed in Maryland, similar to that proposed in Pennsylvania---;& to that adopted long ago in New Jersey & Georgia.(5) Congress are not informed of the payments made, or of the measures taken to make payments on the last requisition on the States---;nor have they information what has been done by all the States scarcely on a single requisition or recommendation. This has led some to believe that it is necessary to extend the office of Secretary of Congress to the home department agreeably to the report of a Committee No. 4.(6) It gives me pain to be under the necessity of saying that I am much in debt here & entirely out of Cash. I received no money from the Treasury before I came away & I cannot learn that any has been paid to my orders since. What am I to do? I have had serious thoughts of returning home---;but I am unwilling to leave this City in debt. Members of Congress are, by priviledge, protected from civil Suits. I am therefore in no danger of a Jail---;And have concluded to wait the event of another application to my old friend the Treasurer---;to whom I must pray you to write in my behalf &, if possible, to point out to him measures to obtain for me a supply of Cash & to pay it to an order I have put into the hands of Capt.

  Sir New York March 9th. 1785 We have been honored with your Excellency's favor of date(1) incloseing the Memorial of the Merchants and Traders of the City of Philada. expressing their apprehensions of further depredations on their trade by the Barbary Corsairs if Speedy and Effectual Measures are not taken to prevent them, which has been laid before Congress. And we are happy to inform you, Sir, & thro' you the Merchants of Philada. that Congress have not been inattentive to this Very important concern to which we believe they are well disposed to give every relief in their power. Our Ministers abroad have long since been authorized to negociate with the States of Barbary (in common with others) treaties of amity & commerce which we have reason to know have only been rendered ineffectual heretofore (with the Barbary States) for want of a Sum of money which Custom has Made absolutely necessary to purchase them. Congress have lately appropriated for this purpose a Sum of Money not exceeding eighty thousand dollars Subject to the draughts of our Ministers.(2) A Gentleman well recommended for his integrity and personal knowledge of that Country will be charged with fresh dispatches to Europe in a Short time respecting this business who may probably be employed to carry into effect the wishes of congress at the court of the Emperor of Morrocco.(3) Altho we ardently wish as much as possible to satisfy the anxiety of the Merchants upon this Subject, yet we request that no extracts maybe taken or published as the Matter is yet Subjudice and any premature publication may have a tendency to delay if not prevent the proposed negociations and draw the unwary Merchant into a snare by Mistaking the intention for the fact. There is little reason to doubt but that Great Brittain will use all her influence to prevent any such treaties being made. As soon as Congress have taken their final determinations upon this Subject we will have the honor of communicating them as far as our injunctions of secrecy will admit. Mr. Marbois in the name of the King his Master has made a demand of Longchamps, this has been under consideration for several days as the order of the day and has been postponed, when this great national question may be discussed is uncertain but there appears no disposition to hurry.(4) No moves have been made by the Connecticut Gentlemen upon the Wyoming business and we remain in the dark what the wish of the State is in that affair. If any determinations of the house take place we will be much oblidged by your Excellys. communication upon that Subject. Genl. Knox is appointed Secretary at war ---;the treasury is not yet formed, no official accts from Jarvais or Osgood whether they will serve or no.

  Sir New York, 9th March 1785 When I had the pleasure to see you last Summer at Mount Vernon I believe I informed you in answer to a question on the Subject that Congress had received a Copy of the Roll of Negroes &ca taken by the Commissioners for superintending the Embarkations at New York at the time of the removal of the Refugees and British Garrison from this City.(1) I now find I was mistaken and that the one I had seen in the Office of the Secretary of Congress was only of 168 Negroes being the last Inspection of the Whole and made on board some Transports at that time at Anchor at Staten Island. The General Roll never has been seen by Congress and is at this time Wanted to enable our Ministers in Europe to proceed to execute the Instructions of Congress of 1785 on the Subject of Negroes Carried off in Contravention of the Treaty of peace. I request Your Excellency to forward the Document alluded to as early as possible.(2) As I embark in a day or two for So Carolina to be absent for 2 or 3 Months I cannot flatter myself with the pleasure of any Correspondence with you till my return unless I can render you any service in Charles Town.(3) I beg you'l Command me in such Case without reserve and assure yourself I shall feel the greatest pleasure in obeying your Commands. The Public Prints will ere this have informed you that Mr Jno. Adams is elected Minister to the Court of London. I had the happiness to succeed in my endeavours to send Col Wm Smith as Secretary to the Legation. Mr McHenry of Maryland now in Congress offered himself & there were sevl other Candidates but finding himself not likely to be elected Mr McHenry with a wonderful dexterity rose & nominated the very man whom he in a conversation with me had offered a great many arguments to defeat, it was the Colo's wish to stand MARCH 9, 1785  Portrait of Jacob Read  on the Nomination of So. Carolina, but we were supplanted by this little Son of Esculapius, however Smith was at once Elected.(4) Congress yesterday Elected Genl Knox Secretary at War. I put Colo. Walker of your late Family in Nomination & he had an Honourable support.(5) The sallary is Cut down to Twenty four hundred & fifty Dollars, not I am sure sufft to render it worth Genl Knox's acceptance. With this Idea I brought forward Col. Walkers name---;he woud have been Elected but the New Englanders thought Genl Knox wou'd accept & rely on the future generosity of Congress to make him some Allowances of House rent, Travelling expenses, &ca. From the want of a full Congress, the great National Questions still remain untouched & will not be Attempted till late in the Spring when tis hoped we may Assemble the whole force of the Union & try if we can act as a Nation, Which by the bye I very much doubt now the Common tye of danger is removed.(6) Do me the favour to present my most respectful compliments to Mrs Washington.

  Dear Sir New York 9 March 1785. Two posts ago I had the pleasure of writing you(1) in which I answered, in reply to your last Letter enquiring of the fate of the Bill of Exchange of Major Carnes, that it was paid, my reasons also for making use of this money, contrary to your wish expressed to me, were then stated. I am sorry necessity compelled it but I hope no Inconvenience will arise from it as I have long since written to Messrs. J G & T Blount informing them of this & requesting them to replace the amount of the Bill in the hands of Messrs. Stuart & Barr and place the same to my Account.(2) Scarce any thing new has occurred since my last, except the appointment of Mr. Adams our late Minister at the Hague to be Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of London, Colo. Smith late one of Genl. Washington's confidential Officers is appointed Secretary to that Legation, the Secretary at War is General Knox. A Minister at the Hague in the room of Mr. Adams is not yet appointed. Congress have much Business before them & I believe will not adjourn before July if they can then, as Dr. Williamson, Colo. Spaight & myself will all Return before the Month of May or in that Month I fear the Govr. will neglect to order on the other Delegates & the State will be unrepresented. The late unfortunate Conduct of my Brother which I have just been informed of by my Father, gives me great pain & uneasiness, this Circumstance together with the present disagreeable situation of the Family & my own immediate Interest all concur in urging & inducing me to return as soon as possible, the only obstacle which by the bye is a great one is the want of Money or I shou'd have embraced this opportunity of returning. I fear there are little Hopes that my friends J G & T B will have it in their power to remit me enough for this purpose shortly, on this Consideration I shall be driven to the disagreeable necessity of taking Money on loan if I can, whether it can be procured here where I am wholly unacquainted is yet uncertain & doubtful. If I shou'd be successful in this Attempt I will (if I can get ready so soon) take passage in Hollister who lately arrived here from New Bern & will sail in five or six days. Inclosed are the last papers, a Letter on the establishment of a Militia by Baron Steuben (3) and an Almanac. My Hint with respect to returning immediately need not prevent your Brother from making me remittance as soon as he conveniently can because if I shou'd succeed in getting Money here, the sooner funds are placed me to repay, the less Interest & more satisfaction will arise. Three Commissioners will be appointed by Congress to hold Treaties & conclude lasting peace with the Indians in the Southern MARCH 9, 1785  Department. We are now debating on their Instructions &c. What they will be, who they will be & when the Treaties will be held I cannot yet tell you. I have had some thought of nominating the Speaker of the House of Commons or my friend Hawkins but I have some Doubts whether they will serve, I have come to no Conclusion on this subject.

  Dear Sir New York March 10th. 1785. I had the honor of your favor of the 22nd of Jany.(1) just as I was setting of[f] from Dumfries, and I should have answered it from Mr. Orr's in Loudoun, where I was detained some time on account of Mrs. Grayson's illness, if I had not wish'd for more time to reflect on the subject matter of it: It would have giv'n me great pleasure (if my particular situation would have permitted) to have waited on you at Mount Vernon & to have convers'd with you on the occasion as I could in that case have entered more fully into the different circumstances than it is practicable to do by any communication on paper; I shall now however give you the best information in my power, as also my own sentiments with the utmost candor & sincerity; It was talk'd of by gentlemen of the House that some mark of attention and respect (not barely complimentary) should be paid you by your native Country; that the other States in the Union knew you only as an American, but that your own knew you as an American and a Virginian; the only difficulty was, how to fall on any expedient that might not wound your feelings on the one hand or be unworthy of the Legislature on the other; While matters remain'd in a situation altogether inconclusive, a gentleman of the Assy. made a motion respecting you, which it was thought adviseable to oppose on the principle of particular impropriety; however it was soon discovered from the temper of the House that if the question had been put it would have been carried without a dissentient as those in the opposition would also have voted for the measure; recourse was therefore had to intreaty & he was prevail'd on to withdraw it, on being promis'd a plan should be brought forward which should in some degree imbrace his views as well as the wishes of the House; accordingly the act which took effect was presented the next day, & immediately pass'd both Houses.(2) Some of the reasons which suggested it were these; It had appeared by conversations out of doors, on the passage of the river bills, that the House were anxious (as you had patronized them and opened their importance to public view) that the credit of the undertaking should be ascribed to yourself & it was wish'd that this might appear by some public act of the legislature; In pursuing this idea, it was thought that such an act might with propriety contain a grant of a certain number of shares to yourself which at the same time that it would be an instance of the attention of the House might also serve in part as a reason for taking up the sub- MARCH 9, 1785  ject and introducing the other matter; It was reasoned by those who countenanc'd this particular plan, that the grant when measured by the European scale (the only criterion by which it could be judged) was so relatively inconsiderable, as to exclude every idea of it's being looked upon as a reward for services; that the value of the subject was so precarious & depended on such a variety of circumstances as almost to prevent the sensation of property in the mind; That the act would carry to Posterity an evidence of the part you had acted in this great undertaking, the remembrance of which would be kept up by the possessions which were granted by the Assembly and retained by your family; That under every view of the subject it could be considered in no other light than the Act itself set forth, an honorable testimonial of the gratitude & affection of your native Country; The gentlemen who favored this particular mode, designedly contracted the number of shares in order to guard it against the objections which you now suppose it to be liable to, as the blank with equal facility might have fill'd up in such a manner as to have comprehended objects of much greater magnitude; The idea of your being subjected to the performance of any particular service never once occurred and so far from it's being suppos'd that you are in any degree circumscribed by the act I am perfectly satisfyed you will yourself confer the obligation by the acceptance; I will not pretend to say that the House do not wish you to devote some portion of your leisure reflections to the furtherance of this great national object; this is also I verily believe the case with every man in the state who has reflected on the matter; indeed numbers rest the success of the measure in a great degree on such an event; But then Sir this is hop'd for, not as the effect or condition of the act but merely as the result of your own inclinations; they suppose such a line of conduct will at the same time, be highly honorable to yourself & that this is one of those few great objects on which you can now with propriety fix your attention; The House I am convinc'd would feel very sensibly if they suppos'd you concieved yourself to be less independant on this account, or that any act of theirs should have a tendency to prevent you from offering your advice to your Country whenever you concieved it to be necessary. These were the ideas which prevail'd in general on the occasion; there was a great variety of sentiments, and a great deal said about the matter particularly witht. doors where every man spoke his mind freely; indeed candor obliges me to inform you that there were not wanting some who thought you were plac'd in a situation which call'd for assistance of a very different nature from the present; With respect to what you hint as to it's being considered in the light of a pension, I am satisfyed it can never be the case under any view of the subject; indeed I cannot concieve there can be any such thing in our governments according to the ideas generally annex'd to it, and if instead of-  a precarious unproductive property it had been the grant of an annuity from the United States, I think it would not have been liable to this appellation, for I look upon the uninfluenced grant of a free people in a very different light from a gift which proceeds from the caprice of Princes or Ministers and which is always supposed whether true or false to be founded on the principle of favoritism; this distinction is preserved in the Brittish constitution & is productive of sensations essentially different, the one conveying the idea of personal favor and the other that of acknowledg'd merit; if then the grants of parliament in a Monarchy are looked upon as highly honorable to the person who recieves them, how much stronger ought the impresssion to be in a republican government, where the principle of action is always suppos'd to be Virtue. Upon the whole however as you have plac'd so much confidence in me as to consult me on the occasion, and as the subject is a very delicate one, I would rather advise that you should not accept the grant at present in any other manner than that of acting under it, leaving your ultimate decision to time & future reflection. There are persons in the world interested in defeating the whole undertaking, and from motives of resentment alone might be induc'd to misrepresent the purity of your intentions, & though I have not the least doubt myself of the propriety of your accepting the grant yet it would be a painful reflection in me to think I had recommended a measure which had the most distant tendency in lessening you in the estimation of the world; it is certain if I had thought not it decidedly right, I never would have voted for it as a representative of the people; and I have every reason to believe that this was the case with every member of the House, who never would have offered a thing which they conciev'd it was improper in you to recieve; If you should at a future period and after the maturest consideration find yourself unalterably determined against converting it to your own use, you will always have it in your power to appropriate either the principal or profits to public purposes of essential utility; though this will contradict the desires and wishes of your fellow Citizens, and counteract the purposes which gave rise to the measure. I think it will be less objectionable than an absolute rejection in the first instance. It will shew a willingness on your part to comply with their request as far as your own sensations would permit you; I hope however that at some future period, and after you have thoroughly weighed all the circumstances, you will find yourself disposed as well from the propriety of the thing itself, as the impulse of your own feelings towards your parent State, to accept of the grant in the manner originally designed by the legislature, and that the same may go and descend to your representative agreable to their intentions; The Assembly of Virginia have no doubt a reguard for your interest, but I am satisfyed they have a much higher one for your personal fame & honor. I shall now leave this subject with obser-  ving that there are strong reasons to be urged against your parting with the power giv'n you by the act, and which in my opinion essentially reguards the success of the undertaking, but as your own feelings are connected with the subject I find a repugnance in pressing them in point of delicacy. I shall therefore leave them & their operations to the suggestions of your own mind making no doubt they will have such an effect as the magnitude of the object and your attachment to it's success may with propriety point out. With respect to the Aspen & Yew trees, I beg leave to acquaint you, that I sent to Sprigg's ford to see if the tree which the Doctr. had giv'n me had produc'd any scions, and was inform'd there were none; I then applied to Mr. Landon Carter who had several at his plantation on Bull run; Mrs. Grayson whom I left at Mr. Orr's promis'd me to carry them behind her carriage to Dumfries & to send them from thence to Mount Vernon together with any scions of the yew tree which she with the assistance of Doctr. Graham & Mr. R. Graham, might be able to procure. We have very little news here, Mr. Marbois has inform'd us there will be no war between the Emperor and the Dutch, & the Minister of the latter expresses himself to the same purpose, but neither have communicated the terms of the pacification. Congress are engaged in a plan for opening their Land Office on the Western waters, In recommending a plan for extending their powers in forming Commercial treaties, In regulating the Post Office and in making a Peace establishment. They have directed a treaty to be form'd if practicable with the Piratical States on the Coasts of Africa; I expect a Minister will be appointed to the Court of Spain after the arrival here of Don Diego Gardoqui; & one I presume will be appointed to Holland in the room of Mr. Adams who goes to the Court of St. James.

  Dear Sir, New York 10th. March 1785 I did not receive your favor of the 7 Feby untill a few days ago, and have taken the first leizure moment to answer it. Upon reflection I do MARCH 9, 1785  not think it would be so proper to have applied to the court to re- instate the report they had set aside, it would at least have the appearance of their having acted inconsiderately, which the characters of Judges in Equity ought not to admit of, and therefore it is better that the individual should suffer pro tempore, than the least flaw be discovered in the supreme court. As it is my disposition rather to make the best of the present, than to fret at what is past, I submit with patience to the delay, and must rest satisfied with the new Order of Reference. It is very immaterial to me who the referees are, pro[v]ided, they are disinterested men & capable of settling accounts. Mr. James Reed, Mr. Thos. Mclaine and Mr. John Hurst the persons appointed by the Second order of reference, would be perfectly agreeable to me, but I believe Mr. Hurst resides at Hillsborough---;in that case suppose the two former, should agree upon a third person and proceed to the settlement it would be perfectly agreeable to me, if it would be so to Mr. Campbell. All I want is a final settlement so that I may receive whatever may be the balance, which I have been too long kept out of, and the want of which has rendered my situation not only irksome but very disagreeable. Mr. Cruike has already a power of Attorney from me to Act for me in the district of Wilmington, and whatever he may do on my account, I shall be fully satisfied with. The claim against Waddle's Estate I am very Anxious to have settled, but fear nothing can be done with it till my return to No. Carolina; It is my intention, at present to be at New Bern by the 20th or 25th of May, unless some thing happens to prevent me which I do not foresee. The only european news we have here is the war between the Emperor & the Dutch. The season admits of nothing else but the various Opinions of the politicians, whether the Controversy will be put an end to, by the negociations of the Winter or decided by Arms. For my part from every Acct. I have heard, am induced to be of the last Opinion. Its pretty certain that the only way of putting an end to it by negociation is, either, that the Dutch must give up the free navigation of the Scheldt, or the Emperor desist from his demands. The former are decided in not granting the free navigation of that river first because it is contained in that treaty which confirmed their freedom and Independence, and if they admit any of the Articles of that treaty not to be valid the others are equaly so. Secondly they have kept the Scheldt shut up for more than 130 years, without their right for so doing, having ever been disputed. On the contrary it cannot be supposed that the Emperor will recede from his demands; the ridicule it would throw on his character, to have made such, as he should be obliged to recede from for want of a sufficient force (the only right he had to plead) to oblige them to comply with would be too great, for a prince of such abilities and ambition as he is supposed to possess, to submit to.  Congress have lately appointed Mr. John Adams Minister to the Court of London, it was a step absolutely necessary to be taken, & I think has been delayed too long and its well for America if her saving policy don't cost her millions. The holding of our Western posts contrary to the Treaty, her different arrangements in Canada & the lakes, added to the murmurs of the nation against America, and the restraints laid upon our commerce with them, Shew so hostile a disposition in the court of Great Britain towards us, that I think we should at least be prepared for any think [thing] that might happen. Yet the States seemed to be lulled into perfect security, few of them have organized & armed their Militia, still fewer have taken any steps to procure a sufficient supply of military Stores, without which no nation ought to be, and I think our situation at the begining of the late War for want of those Articles, ought to be a warning to America, never to be unprovided. The want of Money and the Unsettled State of Ireland, rather than the want of Inclination, will prevent them from renewing the controversy. Mrs. Montgomery the Widdow of the late General of that name requested me to write to some of my Aquaintance in Edenton, to know what had become of the Statue (I believe it is) that was ordered by Congress to be erected to the memory of Genl. Montgomery. It was sent from France to Edenton and lodged in the hands of Messrs. Hewes, Smith & Allen, an Order of Congress passed at Annapolis for its being sent from thence to this city.(1) Shall I take the liberty of requesting you to make this enquiry and to inform me of the result?

  Sir, New York 14th March 1785. Before this comes to hand you will have received official notice of your appointment of Secretary at war; with this notice you will undoubtedly be informed that the salary is fixed at twenty four hundred and fifty Dollars.(1) This sum is too small, but in the existing situation of affairs it was not practicable to obtain a larger sum. The Office is certainly a very honorable one; and the U.S. will not suffer the head of so very respectable a department to remain unsupported. The ordinance for erecting federal buildings on the Delaware, makes provision for MARCH 14, 1785  the secretary at War---;the salary of that Officer has been determined on, since the passing of the Ordinance relative to federal buildings; a future congress would probably be of opinion that House Rent should be allowed to the Secretary at War exclusive of his salary, until the federal buildings are completed. Add to this, if the contingent expences of the Office, including the expence of travelling to and from the various Posts and Magazines are allowed to the secretary, the salary would be more adequate to his support. In fact; when congress shall be convinced by a particular statement of expenditure that the salary is insufficient, they certainly will not refuse to increase it: the present Sum therefore I hope will not be an objection. If the wishes of your particular friends, and the entire Satisfaction of the states would be an inducement to your acceptance, you cannot refuse.

  My dear Sir, New York March 14. 1785 Your favors (for I am always favored when you are pleased to write to me) by Mr Walker of the 9th, and by Captain Landais of the 10th of December were duly delivered to me by those gentlemen, and without loss of time I laid them before Congress. Their applications have been referred to very good Committees,(1) so that there is reason to expect that these Gentlemen will receive just and satisfactory determinations from Congress. Your very friendly and sensible letter of the 23d of the same month(2) deserves my sincerest thanks and approbation, which with great cordiality I present to you. My ill health (with much business and the necessary attention to the ceremonies of my office) prevents me from being so punctual a correspondent as I wish to be---;but I well know that your goodness will excuse me. It is the part of a friend to advise, and of a well disposed mind to profit from good counsel. I MARCH 14, 1785  shall certainly endeavor to benefit from your judicious sentiments. Very much it is to be wished that all who are in authority, discerned with you that the eyes of the world are upon us, that great expectations are formed from great beginnings, and that wisdom and virtue can alone satisfy such just expectations. It is however much too correspondent with human nature to exult \""beyond measure,\"" and thereby to neglect those duties that better sentiments ought to inspire. To this cause may perhaps be attributed much of the inattention and violence that have too generally taken place since the preliminary articles were made known to us. Whether in public or in private life, it seems most becoming wise men in the time of victory and success, to practice the virtues of Magnanimity and Justice, to avoid the display of irascible passions, by effectually \""burying the hatchet\"" as our Aborigines express the idea. Without this philosophic temper, what would become of mankind governed as they too generally are by Tyrants whose caprice forceth Nations into War? Endless carnage and evil without bounds must be the result. The philanthropy that I revere and admire in your character must revolt at the contemplation of it. And I think that the Christian philosophy, in tenderness for human infirmities strongly inculcates principles of mutual forgiveness and benevolence. These reflections have been created in my mind by that kind of exultation \""beyond measure\"" which you so wisely deprecate, and which I have seen so much to prevail as to injure in my idea that greatness of character, which had dignified America in her resistance to British Tyranny. For I am not disposed to admit Revenge as a just plea for such Extravagancies, altho' a well judged system of measured politics may be admissible. The selfishness and corruption of Europe I have no doubt about, and therefore wish most sincerely that our free Republics may not suffer themselves to be changed & wrongly wrought upon by the corrupt maxims of policy that pervade European Councils---;where artful and refined plausibility is forever called in to aid the most pernicious designs. It would seem as if there were a general jealousy beyond the water, of the powerful effects to be derived from Republican virtue here, and so we hear a constant cry from thence, echoed & re-echoed here by all Expectants from the Treasury of the United States---;That Congress must have more power---;That we cannot be secure & happy until Congress command implicitly both purse & sword. So that our confederation must be perpetually changing to answer sinister views in the greater part, until every fence is thrown down that was designed to protect & cover the rights of Mankind. It is a melancholy consideration that many wise & good men have, somehow or other, fallen in with these ruinous opinions. I think Sir that the first maxim of a man who loves liberty should be, never to grant to Rulers an atom of power that is not most clearly & indispensably necessary for the safety and well being of Society. To say that these Rulers  are revocable, and holding their places during pleasure may not be supposed to design evil for self-aggrandizement, is affirming what I cannot easily admit. Look to history and see how often the liberties of mankind have been oppressed & ruined by the same delusive hopes & fallacious reasoning. The fact is, that power poisons the mind of its possessor and aids him to remove the shackles that restrain itself. To be sure, all things human must partake of human infirmity, and therefore the Confederation should not be presumptuously called an infallible system for all times and all situations---;but tho' this is true, yet as it is a great and fundamental system of Union & Security, no change should be admitted until proved to be necessary by the fairest, fullest & most mature experience. Upon these principles I have ever been opposed to the 5 Per Cent impost. My idea is still that of the Confederation, Fix the sum, apportion it, & let every State by its own means, and in its own way faithfully & honestly make its payment. That the now fOEderal mode of apportionment is productive of delay, of great expence, and still liable to frequent change, is certain. And therefore I see no inconvenience in so far altering the Confederation as to make the Rule of Apportionment lie upon the numbers as stated in the recommendation of Congress upon that subject. But I can never agree that this Body shall dictate the mode of Taxation, or that the collection shall in any manner be subject to Congressional controul. It is said that this will more effectually secure the Revenue---;But how so? if a spirit prevails to neglect a duty imposed by the Confederation, may not the same spirit render abortive at any time Acts passed for granting the Impost? Besides that we are depending for the payment of our debts upon uncertainty, when the most certain revenues of the State ought to be appropriated to that purpose. Whilst every good man wishes great punctuality to prevail in the payment of debts, he must at the same time condemn and discourage large importations which impoverish by encreasing the balance of trade against us. So that from this system we are to expect our greatest good from our greatest evil. A good physician will tell you that contrary indications of cure threaten danger to human life, and by a just parity of reason, contrary indications threaten danger to the Political body. But happily for us, our political disease admits of simple remedies for its cure, if rightly judged of, and wisely practised upon. Let it therefore be the effort of every Patriot to encourage a punctual payment of each State's quota of the fOEderal demand, and let the money he found in ways most agreable to the circumstances of every State. This is the plan of the Confederation, and this I own will be mine, until more satisfactory experience has proved its inefficacy. A word more upon the point of our just wishes to be detached from European politics, and European vices of course. I wish it most sincerely. But unfortunately Great Britain is upon our Northern quarter  and Spain upon the Southern. We are therefore compelled to mix with their Councils in order to be guarded against their ill designs. I am very happy to hear from my friend Mr Lovell that you are in health and spirits, & that you still delight to speak of politics. There is nothing in this life that would give me more happiness than to see & converse with you in Boston---;but Alas! I fear that my poor state of health will deny me this pleasure---;yet at all times and in every place, I shall be dear Sir, your most affecte friend, Richard Henry Lee. ""

Three Commissioners are to be appointed for this purpose, and monies voted for paying the incidental expences. Each of the Executives of the Southern States are to be officially informed on this subject, and may, if they think proper send an agent to be present at the Treaties.(1) We enclose your Excellency a Resolve of Congress, limiting the time in which unliquidated accounts against the United States, are to be given in to the Commissioners, appointed to adjust and settle the Accounts of Individuls against the United States, and precluding those MARCH 18, 1785  who fail to comply with that resolution from any future settlement. We thought it our duty to oppose it, as we conceive the time allowed is too short for the Citizens of North Carolina living in the western parts of the State, who are Creditors of the United States.(2) There being no Commissioners in the State will, however, extend the time a Month or two Longer. Mr. Jefferson is appointed to succeed Doctor Franklin at the Court of Versailles, who has leave to retire agreeable to his repeated requests. Mr. John Brown of Providence is elected a Commissioner for carrying into effect the Ordinance of the 23d December last, in the place of Genl. Schuyler who has declined accepting that appointment.

  Dear sir New York arch 19th. 1785 I have received so many of yours without answering them that hardly remember where to begin. The death of my friend was an expected event for some time. I am Very glad that so great respect was paid by his friends to his remains. Mr Searle who attended the funeral informs me that he never saw in Philadelphia so large a concourse of people upon the like occassion.(1) The fate of the funding bill I am likewise informed of. I am pleased that it passed as it did but wou'd much rather it had passed without any discrimination. I have my fears concerning the fate of the paper Money. Shou'd the bank give it a Credit that will promote its efficiency and perhaps their fears for their charter may have its weight with them.  I have seen a petition to the Assembly published in the Philada. papers and republished here against the Bank---;what number of signers had it? has it been presented? will the Assembly take any steps upon ---;---;---;? The bank in this City is not Very secure---;there is a general suspicion that banks are all conducted too much upon principles of favoritism, after repeated applications they have been refused a charter. A few days ago an act for the abolition of Slavery took place here nearly upon the principles of the Pennsylvania one. The Country party in the New York Assembly are a Majority and generally carry their measures in opposition to their Senate and their Council of revission as they are called. Rhode Island has passed the 5 per Ct. in a limited manner to be collected in their own way and by officers of their own appointment. They have appropriated eight thousand dollars out of it to pay their proportion of the intrest of the foreign debt and for this purpose have directed it to be paid to the order of Congress, the residue is to be applyed in paying the intrest of the domestic debt to such of their Citizens as are public Creditors and the redemption of their State notes.(2) This is not Satisfactory to many of our Gentlemen but less is said about it than would be owing to difficulties a similar bill finds in its passage thro' the legislature of this state. Numbers have petitioned the Assembly in favr. of it (principally Citizens) notwithstanding Many MARCH 19, 1785  of the leaders in the house are determined to give it every opposition in their power. Our Grand Committee of ways and Means have not yet reported but it is probable that a requisition will be made of three Millions dollars or thereabout nearly upon the Same principle as last year's for exigencies of the Current year(3)---;facilities as they are called or in other words notes for intrest will be received in payment of two thirds certainly, and more if the intrest of the publick debts due in the State mounts higher. The late Indian treaty has put the U.S. in possession, according to several calculations which I have Seen and Made, of near twenty five Millions acres of land in the Western Country. Congress wish soon to avail themselves of this fund to extinguish as much as possible of the domestic national debt. The arrangements for disposing of this property has been some days ago committed to a grand Committee of one from every state.(4) We have met frequently upon this business but have concluded nothing. Many important questions arise upon this Subject. How large are the States to be? how bounded, whether by natural Marks or parallels of latitude? Is it to be granted regularly one Joining upon another where lands not arable don't intervene? or are the purchasers to be suffered to roam at large (as in Pennsylvania) and to take up as much and where they please? If the tracts are fixed how large ought the largest and how small the smallest to be? How much shou'd the price per hd. acres be? Or shou'd there be different prices according to the Value of the lands? Shoud there be any reservations of hundreds or Manners for the use of schools or other publick uses? Salt Springs and licks and what has usually been called royal Mines how ought they to be disposed of? The land Speculators already Smell a rat and expect fine picking. Many of them are here and waiting with anxiety the event. There will be a scram[ble to] the land offices in this new Country, Many hav[e al]ready applied. Another treaty will be held this Summer in June perhaps at Post St Vincent both for Peace and purchase. If this shou'd succeed as is expected thirty or forty Millions more will be added. We are informed all the Indians in that country are disposed to sell and many of them mean moving over the Missisipi. The question upon Mr L---;---; has not been mentioned for some time. We recd your pamphlet.(5) We have kept it agoing with those who understand french. Nothing is said of the Wyoming affair, do the Assembly mean to take it under consideration? We wish to know in order that we may govern ourselves accordingly. The representation is generally compleat Georgia alone unrepresented only one attending. I am &c. Jos. Gardner  ""

Our family, which is increased by Mr. J.

Congressional Affairs are nea[r]ly as you left them. Mr. Jefferson was unanimously elected for Versailles, and Tomorrow most probably Mr. Rutledge will be appointed to the Hague. Your motion for limiting the period within which the public Creditors should be allowed to exhibit their Claims, has passed into a resolve and will be transmitted to the respective executives.(1) Story returned on Friday.(2) Mr. Wythe accepts. Grayson has been here some Days, and as Monroe and he are informed of the period within which an answer is expected, they will probably give their answers tomorrow which is the last day. No other answers from any of the commissioners except Mr. Harrison & Mr. Johnson, have been received.(3) You understand the Situation of this business, and its importance. The Agents must attend to it. Willson is here for this with other business. I have not the original second Agreement, & without it nothing farther can be done. Two letters from Osgood to you came to hand the day you left us. I knew the character, and supposing, as in fact was the case, that they might be on the subject of his appointment, I opened them, found his objections to the extent of the bonds and procured an explanatory Resolve, that places the business in the train, that corresponds with my own opinion.(4) I inclosed the Resolve to Mr. Osgood last Post,(5) & hope it will be satisfactory. The situation of the Treasury requires his immediate attendance here, provided he accepts.

  Dear Hannah, N 24 Tuesday March 22. 1785 Upon going to the Office on Monday morning I received yours of the 19 N 12 and at the same time dispached mine of the 20 N 23.(1) I find we pass our time much in the same manner. You in your parlour at Philadelphia, I in my room, dark and gloomy enough, for it has not even the advantage of looking into the street, at New York; often thinking of and writing to each other at the same time. The people of this place have in general been attacked with a cold; it has been so general that it is considered as epidemical, very few having escaped it. I have had a slight visit, it occasioned a hoarseness; but as I combated it with wine, whey bathing the feet and the flesh brush, I found I succeeded in preventing its gaining possession of my breast-works or capital. You know it is of great importance to be able to resolve the question, How have you got such a cold? I had the satisfaction of being able to tell. On Saturday the 12 I attended a conference between the senate and assembly of this place in a cold church which had not been opened for some time. And to appoligize for my imprudence I had only to say that our old acquaintance Paine was one of the persons appointed to conduct the conference. The subject was a bill for the gradual abolition of slavery.(2) The assembly were willing to admit the freedom of the Negroes; but they wanted to exclude them from the right of voting or being elected to any place of post in government And to prevent their entermarrying with Whites under a penalty of a hundred pounds. To these disabilities and penalties the Senate were opposed. To the first because they thought it contrary to their Consti- MARCH 22, 1785  tution and to the latter because in so important a connection they thought the free subjects of the state ought to be left to their free choice. Mr Paine was on the side of the Council, being one of that body and he conducted his part of the conference just in his own way, with some degree of wit, a great deal of sarcasm with scraps of Scripture & strokes of wit & humour some of them it is true low but all delivered with so many contorsions of the face and original attitudes and gestures, as to divert the audience & render his opponents ridiculous. It was really a high entertainment and sufficient to make one even risque a cold to hear it. However as I had heard him so often before I did not stay till the conclusion. Next day my hoarseness came on, and I have not since ventured abroad except just to Congress and home again. I am now got pretty well. The arts of Mrs. M & her daughter are very amusing. They discover too much and not enough. They seem like the girl in the pastoral who meeting with her lover affected to run away from him but with the fond hope of his pursuing and overtaking her or as the poet expresses it The wanton laughed and seemed in haste to flie But often stopped and often turned her Eye. Plain dealing after all is best. The honest friend came sooner to his point and obtained his end who addressed his fair with \""Off or on Martha.\"" I was much amused with the adventures of the blind philosopher and the poet. The doctor I presume did not know that the Poets study is the Street or did not recollect that bards mounted on Pegasus fly too high to observe such groveling objects as gutters, lamp posts or bundles of skins. You have twice asked me what sort of Quakers we have here. I really cannot tell as none of them have called on me and I have visited none but such as have. I last evening asked Mrs Depeyster who knows every body. She informs me they are a very good sort of people, kind, civil, obliging and friendly and more liberal in their sentiments than your Pleasants & Fishers. She told me of one of the principal men whose daughter lately married one Capt Willet. The friends went to deal with him for giving his consent, and he told them freely that he left his children to the exercise of their own judgment & prudence and that in a matter of such consequence on which their peace and happiness so much depends they ought not to be too much restrained. She could not tell me whether the girl was read out or disowned. I have not heard of any complaints among the Members except what arises from the dearness of living. Delaware is come on, so that we have now 12 states represented. My love to Jon, Rob, Am[elia] & Charles & compliments to all friends.

  Dr Sir, New York the 25th March 1785 The principal business now before Congress is the disposing of the lands lately purchasd and the making of a second purchas.(1) Much time has been spent by a Commitee of one from each of twelve states on the first and it is probable the lands will be sold by Districts of ten or twelve miles squair to the highest bider above sutch price as Congress may fix for the acre. A number of districts will probably put up to sell in the different states perhaps nearly in proportion to their demands. The Commisioners are authorised to make the second purchas to the Mesasipi, and as the Indians have ofered those lands fore sale there will probably be little Dificulty on purchasing them. Commisioners are apointed to hol[d] a Treaty with the Creeks, Chirokees &c. The place for holding the federal Court for Massachusetts and New York is not yet determind. Longchamps affair was to have beeen brought foreward this day but is again gon off by an ajornment to Monday nixt.

 Charles Stewart to William Livingston Sir New York 25th March 1785 When I took the liberty of naming your Excellency as Minister to the Court of Uni[ted Neth]erlands it was from a full assurance that the m[easure?] was so proper that it must succeed. I [...] it attract the attention of every person on the Floor of Congress, and that the Gentlemen who had previously named Mr. Harrison & Mr. Rutledge returned but faint if any hopes of success & Mr. Harrisons friends hinted they would withdraw his name. I did not quite like your Answer; & therefore shewed it only to Mr. Beatty, under an injunction not to give out that it was a refusal, & left it with Mr. Jay. I did not look on it as a positive refusal and [am inclined] not to withdraw Your name, or suffer it to be done, unless I have your express Orders so to do.(1) Your excuse about Old Age and Abilities are needless to Me, I guess at both, and compare them with Doctor Franklins powers when He went last to Europe. Permit me to deal plainly with you. I know there are persons in the State who would wish you abroad to make room for a new Governor. And I see there are others who wish you not to go, for [...] were sure You were too Old, and I am sure they are sorry they did not name You old as You are.

  Dr. Sr. New York March 26th. 1785. I have receiv'd, I imagine all your favors down to the 10th Instt. & thank you, as I am obliged to do other Friends for them all at once---;as well as for those which I hope to receive for I can write but little indeed. It is not, I assure you, any aversion I have contracted to it, much less any neglect, but of real disability of writing a legible hand unless so slowly as it cuts me off from any extensive correspondence. Besides, between Business, which I will not neglect, & Company, which I cannot avoid, you cannot concieve how few Moments I have left in which I could write. I attend however, to all yr. Intimations & endeavour to make a good Use of them. I have not been able to serve our Friends Capts. Lamb1 & Harding so effectually as I could wish. The Case of the latter was Reported upon against him, & in Consequence he is in Goal.(2) I will not yet say unfortunately, because I have made that the ground of a second warm Application to Congress in his behalf, which MARCH 26, 1785  has produced a recommitment of his Petition, & I have hope may cause something to be done for him. How hard is our Fate, that the brave & deserving Servants of the Publick must lie in Goal, & be subjected to a thousand hardships for want of that Money which their services have merited, which we acknowledge we owe & wish to pay them! It is not however the inattention or negligence of Congress that occasions This, but their inability alone. They Pity, but cannot relieve And it is with great Concern I acquaint you, that all the flattering hopes we had formed of soon seeing a remedy for this enormous Evil are now Dash'd by the refusal Yesterday of the Senate of New York to grant the 5 per Cent Impost. The Bill for that purpose was rejected by a Majority of two. I have been perfectly attentive to your particular Interest, but With it to little purpose other than that of laying foundations which may perhaps be built upon hereafter. You have no Idea, at least I could form none, of the innumerable pressing & even vehement solicitations here for Office & Emolument, nor of the assiduities & Arts which are applied to give success to them. I have much more to say to you on this & several other subjects than it is possible or proper for me to write. I hope I may have the happiness to see you sometime in May, & give you the detail.

The Jealousy of the circumscribed States, who thought that under the Idea of making peace with the Indians we had some under hand designs, which might be fatal to their claim of an eaqual partition of unlocated western territory among the members of the Union---;Occationed a Mr. Danl.

They thought these two persons would be a check upon any designs that the southern States might have. This of course gave very great dissatisfaction to the southern States, and occationed a  MARCH 27, 1785  motion to be brought forward, for the Appointment of two additional commissioners, as neither Virginia, So.

  Sir, Secretary's Office March 28. 1785 In the latter end of January last Congress received information of a wicked attempt to defraud the public by counterfeiting the certificates of final settlement given to the Officers and soldiers of the United States by the Commissioner for settling the accounts of the army.(1) The fraud appeared the more alarming as the villains concerned seemed to be possessed of a secret which tended to destroy the credit of all writings and to produce the most mischievous consequences by rendering all written contracts insecure. For it appeared that though the words were altered and the sums changed, the paper remained undefaced. In Consequence of this information Congress issued the Proclamation of which I enclose a copy.(2) Last week one Davison came to this city for the purpose, as he said, of disclosing the whole scene of villainy. A Committee was appointed to take his examination. This morning they brought in a report accompanied with his deposition, which for the greater dispatch and secresy Congress were pleased to refer to me to take Order.(3) I therefore embrace the earliest opportunity of transmitting to Your excellency a copy of the said report and deposition, which will sufficiently evince the necessity and importance of adopting the most speedy and effectual measures to put a stop to villainy so injurious to private property and destructive of public credit, by securing and bringing to justice the individuals of so dangerous a combination.

  Sir, New York 2d April 1785. I a few days ago did myself the honor of forwarding to you the Jour- APRIL 2, 1785  nals of Congress as far as they were printed---;And at the same time Mentioned every necessary Occurrence that I could recollect.(1) By this opportunity I Send a resolve for holding a treaty with the Southern Indians.(2) As you'l find the whole of this business fully recited in the resolve and as my late letters and the Journals of Congress enclosed---; Contained every Material Information respecting the proceedings of Congress I shall now hasten to announce to you that the whole body of Congress are become so clamorous against our State, that I shudder for the consequences; but, as my late letters have all gone fully into the particulars---;I shall therefore now only assure you (as I think it my duty to State facts) that it is very seriously talked of---;Either to make a tryal of Voting Georgia out of the Union or to fall upon some means of taking coercive measures against her. In truth I do not think at any one time since the Existence of Georgia she has been in a worse situation than at present. Her conduct is more particularly marked as for the last six weeks we have had the whole twelve States upon the floor---;she stands alone only half represented---;And as it is reported here that she is a rich & flourishing State---;the most infamous Motives are imputed to her. As we were much connected with the So. Indians I took the liberty to mention that I thought a Commissioner ought to be appointed from our state---;but, I was very severely replyed to for suggesting that the least Countenance ought to be given to so unworthy a State---;And one that had not taken a single foderal measure. From your known patriotism, I doubt not Sir, you must feel sensibly for the dreadful situation of our Country, with respect to her lost reputation in that quarter where it is her Interest---;as well as her duty to stand high---;and I can't help still hoping on your making such Exertions as may redeem her. For my own part I am really so fully affected that I almost curse the hour that placed me in a situation to be privy to such cruel aspersions against that Country that gave me birth. And sir my breast is so wrung with reflecting on these things that I do not find myself competent to write with that precision that might be expected from me. With respect to my own immediate situation it is more distressing than I ever expected from my Circumstances in life, I could be reduced to. I Sir, as well from a disinterested Zeal, God knows, of serving my Country---;as from the warm persuasions of those who paid more attention to public Matters than to my private Interest---;agreed to leave a comfortable place in the midst of my relations & other friends---; where If I was not amassing wealth I was however Making more than my daily Expences & of course laying by money---;to come to a strange land amongst Strangers---;under a full Confidence that my Country whilst I was making every Sacrifice in my power to serve her, would not abandon me, and make the ungrateful return of giving me up as a Victim. But sir now so it is---;for after I had exhausted every shilling of my own altho' desirous of returning home still from reasons that were Convincing to me that I could be of much use to our State (as well by   defending her from the very unfavourable Attacks that were Constantly made upon her and wh. might have been followed wt. something more substantial, and keeping her Interest in the same forwardness & as her Sister States as many other things of much Consequence.) I was seduced to remain in Congress---;thinking there could not be a doubt but that I should at least have my Expences Remitted to me & I from time to time have been borrowing money in this Country for which I am now exceedingly pressed & so much involved that it is impossible for me to think of moving till I receive a pecuniary Relief sufficient to extricate me And in the mean time must be perplexed in finding farther Means for my support. I hope sir every principle of Justice as well as the Respect due to the Character and office I bear, will induce you to transmit to me, as soon as can be, the necessary supplies for my immediate assistance---;as much as will enable me to return home, which is my earnest desire, or if it should be the will of the state for me to remain longer, as will allow to Stay at least without dishonour to my self or Country. You'l Recollect sir that I have never received any thing from the state except a bill for a hundred & odd pounds before I left Savannah. It is therefore much in arrear to me, I shall be ready upon oath to give an account of the unavoidable Expenditures I have been put to---;and freely to loose such sums as I raised upon my private account and have spent in the Public Service. My Case is singularly hard, as Every other State since the peace has made ample provision for their Delegates thinking it a Matter of the first Consequence---;And altho' some of them have four Members on the floor they regularly send them their Supplies and keep them satisfied and at their Ease. My office is doubly labourious as I am obliged to pay Constant attention to public matters---;and to employ such time as I can get in working for my daily support without any visible means. I appeal to the Journals if I have ever been absent from Congress one day since I first took my Seat notwithstanding all the difficulties I have had to struggle with. I feel a Consciousness that I have been the Instrument of preventing some very opprobrious measures against the State---;and that I saved her some thousands of dollars in fixing her last quota. With Respect to the Rest of my conduct I am prepared---;and desirous to meet the most accurate Scrutiny. I should not Sir have been thus prolix did I not conceive there must be some prejudices in the State agst. Me or surely no Christian people could treat me so unworthyly. It is now four months since I have Received any account of the proceedings of the state. I have by accident heard who was elected Governor. I have been able to collect from the Delegates of So. Carolina that they are in momentary expectation (from their Governors Letter) of receiving Instructions for an application to Congress in Respect to the disputed Territory between the two States(3)---;as   there was not the least prospect of the Commissioners being able to adjust this matter. I am aware your Honor will pay that due Consideration to this very important point which it deserves. I shall only Mention that the rooted prejudices in Congress agst. our State may subject us to disadvantage. And from the great number of Members in Congress (more I believe---;than were ever known at any one time) Spirited Measures will certainly upon every occasion be adopted, and carried into Execution with force---;As Congress are apprized that they never possessed so many resources, so much power, and so much Consequence as at present. I shall now conclude with repeating and beseeching you to give serious attention to my situation as it is a Stake to me of the most alarming nature. I have the honor to be, with all due respect, Your Honors most obt servt. Wm Houstoun N.B.

  Sir New York April 2d. 1785.

States, & instructing him to furnish Mr. Dunscomb with a commission to act in the room of Mr. Turner, and those resolutions which are necessary for them in the discharge of the duties of the office.(1) These two commissrs. are to act independently of each other, in the districts assign'd them, and each to judge of the resolutions of Congress as they apply to the cases before them upon the same principle as if they held their appointments to different states; the only object in the additional appointment being that of expediting the settlement, a claim the larger states are entitled to from the consideration that such a portion of these debts when liquidated are admitted in payment of the late requisition. The resolution admiting of circumstantial evidence where  APRIL 2, 1785  the vouchers have been lost or under particular circumstances have never been obtain'd is so clear & explicit that neither Congress nor the delegation could conceive how a doubt could have been entertain'd by Mr. Turner respecting its import. We presume it will be impossible for any other person to misunderstand it and therefore flatter ourselves that those who may be now appointed, will proceed without delay in the accomplishment of this very important business. Agreeably to a condition of the act of cession of the territory no. westward of the Ohio we lately mov'd that a commissr. be appointed to liquidate the claims of the state arising under it, in the manner stipulated, and that the advances of the state for the purposes therein specified, be deducted out of the requisition for the present year. The motion was committed and the report brought in authoriz'd the appointment of the commissr. but took no notice of the claim for the deduction of the amount out of the riquisition.(2) We consider the claim of the state in that instance as standing upon very different ground from those debts due from the U. States to individual states, wh. arose under the common occurrences of the war, and of course that the method of payment shod. be different. This from a solemn compact between the two parties deriv'd its force from their accession to it, and of course any limitation to the paymt. not contain'd in the act itself, must be considerd as a contravention of it. We shall obtain the decision of Congress upon this point as soon as possible & transmit it to your Excellency.

Sunday April 3. 1785 The badness of the weather having as I suppose prevented the arrival of the post, I have not had the pleasure of a letter from you since that of the 29 of last Month N 16, which I acknowledged the receipt of, in my last of the 31st No. 28.(1) I mentioned in that letter that C had come to a decision on the business of my Office.(2) Though I had strong suspicions that the moving this matter originated in the ambition of one and the malice and resentment of another, I determined to let it take its course without deigning to interfere or to converse with any members upon it least I should seem to be courting favour. The Committee indeed to whom it was referred desiring to have my Opinion on the duties of the office & the necessity of erecting a new department, I gave it freely & subscribed my name, leaving them at full liberty to make what use of it or to shew it to whom they pleased. At the first opening of the business it appeared to be precipitated, and that though the plan of ambition might have been laid the measures of accomplishing it had not been concerted or fully arranged. However being brought forward it gave an opportunity of sounding the disposition of the states, but this was done with so little skill in political manOEuvres as to turn the attention or at least direct their suspicions to an individual and to point out the measure as an object of ambition rather than of public utility, & the disposition of the house was shewn in such a way that whether the suspicions were well or ill founded, the feelings & pride of the individual must have been a good deal hurt. The plan and schemes of malice were deeper and better laid. Under pretence of collecting in one view the duties of the Office An Ordinance was prepared with such art that it should be rather for the purpose of establishing a new office than for ascertaining the powers of one already established. This would give an opportunity of a new election, and provided there was any probability of gratifying resentment in that way to say nothing of the term of continuance in Office, but if that could not be obtained, then to introduce a clause for an annual election. This plan was deep laid,  APRIL 3, 1785  but much hurt by a sort of coalition with the other. However it was prosecuted with that persevering cunning & malice for which the author of it is distinguished.(3) Unfortunately for him what he conceived a masterly stroke & which he thought to have given from a masked battery displayed the author in his true colours and produced an effect the very contrary of what he wished. I shall explain myself further when we have the pleasure of meeting. For as you observe I must reserve something for Conversation & not commit everything to writing. We had last evening a violent storm of hail, snow & afterwards rain, with two or three severe claps of thunder. This I hope will prove the breaking up of the winter, which though it could not be called severe when compared with last winter yet has been long and tedious. From what I hear, the roads are extremely bad. Indeed it cannot be otherwise. The ground being so deeply soaked, and the surface so often frozen all last month & to this time no warm sun or drying winds to exhale the Moisture, I hope now for clear weather and fine roads. I have been to look at the garden or rather lot for a garden for it is altogether a waste behind the house I have taken. The Landlord has engaged a carpenter to make up the fence & make the necessary repairs about it. I do not think it will be worth while for me to do any thing towards putting it into order, till we take possession, especially as the stable is so situated that the horses are led to it through the garden. I have examined what used to be called the study and think it will answer extremely well for William and Ruth. There is a lamp just by the front door as you mentioned. My love to Rob, Am. & Jonathan and to all friends. On Friday I recd. a letter from Gervais informing that he declines the Office of Commissioner so that there is an opening & chance for our friend G.C. I wish with all my heart the place was filled and the board set to business. Adieu my dear Hannah, with unfeigned affection I am Your loving husband, Cha Thomson [P.S.] Monday April 4.

  My dear Short.(1) New York 5th. April 1785. By Colo Smith who is appointed Secretary of Legation to the Court of London I avail myself of an opportunity of writing.  You will I doubt not before this reaches you, have heard of the adjournment of Congress to this place. This event took place under an Ordinance pass'd the 24th of Decbr at Trenton, which fixed the erection of a fOEderal town on the banks of the Dellaware & the temporary residence of Congress in the intermediate time in this City. From your knowledge of the views of Virginia respecting a Communication between the Potowmack & the Western Waters, you will readily conceive that the building a fOEderal town on the banks of the Dellaware was not a very palatable Measure to her. It is one to which she is very far from being reconciled, & the uniform opposition which it consequently meets with from her Delegation & that of Maryland will I think ultimately defeat the Ordinances. The opening a land Office for the sale of Western territory to enable us to do justice to the public Creditors & retrieve in some degree the public Credit is at this time one of the principal Objects under the Consideration of Congress. No plan is yet absolutely agreed on & it is difficult to conjecture what it will be. But you are on a Theatre where Objects present themselves so much more important than the opening a land office, or the erection of an hotelle or two on the banks of the Dellaware; that you will think the information insipid & pronounce perhaps that the Mind must be limited indeed to be engrossed by such trifles. Trifles indeed they appear to be, when compared with the armies of sixty, & a hundred thousand Men which we are told are on foot in different parts of Europe. Is it possible that such preparations for War should terminate in nothing? Is it possible that the Emperor of Germany who has the rep- APRIL 5, 1785  utation of possessing talents much above the common level should have set up a claim, and after having advanced as far as he has in support of it, should recede without fighting? Having left Virginia only a few Weeks after you I can give you no particular information of your friends there. I saw your Brother several times after your departure; he is a Candidate for the County of Surry & it was then supposed would be succesful. The Assembly of Virginia at their last session pass'd a law for instituting Assize Courts. Its operation commences in April 1786. I need not tell you that it is a law which affords me considerable pleasure. Present my compliments to Mr Jefferson & believe me to be with every sentiment of regard, Your sincere friend & humble servant S. Hardy(2) ""

  Dear Hannah Wednesday Morning April 6, 1785. In the postscript to my last I acknowledged the receipt of your two letters N 17 & 18. As soon as I had sealed my letter I sent Thomas with it to the post office. On his return he called and examined the kitchen. He says it is a very fine kitchen. There is a crane which belongs to the house and a smoke jack, But was told the chain of the jack belongs to the family. He repeated over & over, it is a fine kitchen & has a fine prospect into the garden and as Thomas from his profession is or ought to be a good judge of a kitchen I am inclined to think it is convenient. By what I learn the charter is not yet taken from the bank, but that the committee, who were appointed by the assembly to examine it, have reported unfavourably and that leave is given to bring in a bill for repealing the law that incorporated it. However I have no doubt they will carry their point. I am told the principles of the report are alarming & strike at all property. I have not seen it and therefore can say nothing of it. The state is...The minds of the people are not settled down to their condition. Those that have suddenly got wealth or power are grasping at more. Those that have neither are pressing for them not by virtue & the fair deeds and honest paths of industry and frugality, but by knavery and tricking. So that till some have their deserts and others are reduced to their former insignificancy I expect little else but confusion. Hazard the postmaster genl has in consequence of the order of C come here and has been trying to get a house. He meets with difficulty & wishes to have leave to reside in Philada at least for some time. Whether he will get leave or not I cannot tell.(1) I wonder what Hillegas will do.(2) His salary will not support him here and he will not like to quit his office. I have not heard a word of him. I had a letter from Milligan(3) wherein he says it was the opinion of some that C wants only the papers in the Offices, but not the Officers & wishes to know if that was the case. I told him, the very suspicion was dishonorable and advised him to come forward and bring the papers with him. APRIL 7, 1785  You see by the tenor of this letter I write just for the pleasure of writing to you. The ancients had the advantage of us in point of conciseness. When Cicero who wrote almost as often to his Terentia as I do to my dear Hannah had nothing particular to say, he used to make his whole letter consists of these few words. Si vales bene est et ego valeo. Vale. That is, I say you are well, that is well, I am well, farewell. You remember our good friend S. Emlin's sermon when he quoted a scrap of latin and desired the women to apply to their husbands for an explanation of it. As you have not the opportunity just now of making an immediate application to yours, though I hope you soon will, I have sent the translation of mine and conclude in the true Ciceronean stile with most earnest entreaties to take care of your health. I am, Dear Hannah, with sincere affection, Your loving husband, Chas Thomson. MS not found; reprinted from PMHB, 25 (1901): 430--;31. 1 By resolve of February 7 the postmaster general, Ebenezer Hazard, had been directed to move the post office from Philadelphia to New York by March 21.

Allan, it came from our Door-keeper who told me that it had been picked up on Long Island. I received it however, with that true content that your letters always bring with them. You have certainly done me justice when you have taken me for an Unchanging Friend. I endeavor not to take up friendships lightly, and therefore I am not capable of lightly laying them down. But in this case, I am much too sensible of the honor done me by your friendship not to wish most sincerely for its continuance. And the true reason for want of punctuality in writing, I assigned to you in my letter of March 14th last. The reasons there assigned will, I hope, secure for me your pardon for having employed an Amanuensis (my Nephew Shippen) upon that letter. Your recommendation of Messrs. Kirkland & Allan are very sufficient to procure for them my utmost favor.(2) Here you observe that I  APRIL 7, 1785  have personal knowledge of the deserts recommended. I have, but it was not necessary when I reflected who it was that recommended. I hope that we have gained your approbation by sending our Patriot friend Mr. J. Adams Minister to London. I hope also for good things from that Mission. Spain seems mal-affected to us, but as she has a commencing dispute with Great Britain about the Musquetto shore, perhaps we may find in her Minister, expected here this month, a more accommodating spirit concerning the Mississippi than has yet appeared.

Congress are generally imbarrassed, by daily demands upon them; & how we are to support the public credit, is a matter that requires great consideration: under these circumstances, I can't but say, it would have been as agreeable to me, if we had not received the instruction from the honorable Court respecting the proposed fOEderal buildings,(2) which must require an additional requisition from the states, if the resolutions respecting them, are to be carried immediately into effect. A large western country now considered to be within the line of the U.S. & not within the boundaries of any one state, has taken up considerable time in Congress & is likely to take up much more; however, I am of opinion, that if it is managed well the sale of the lands will pay a considerable part of our national debt, but it will take up much time before it can be done; & the public creditors press so hard, there is not much pleasure in being a member of Congress, unless a man can bear duning very well. The late Financier has informed Congress, that he has caused his accounts while in office to be printed and bound, & that 500 copies are nearly compleated, however, I think they ought to be approv'd by Congress, before the good people, consider them as the state of their finances.(3_ I wish you very happy, & have the honor to be, with perfect consideration & respect, your friend & humble servant, S.

  Dear Sir New York April 12th 1785 Since my last I have recd. yours of the 11th of Novr. & 10th of Decr.(1) the former by Col. LeMaire, from whom however I did not receive it altho' I saw him, nor untill after his arrival nearly a month & then I believe by post from Phila. I have had the same difficulty with the cypher but from a different cause. The copy of that I sent by Mr. Short I left in Virga. when I sat out for the westwd. & have not since been able to command it, but shall most probably by the next post, so that whether you send me one or not our embarrassment will in future be at an end. That you may read my first letter I send you the cypher by which it was wrote.(2) Fully impress'd with the disadvantages which must always arise to the States from a free intercourse with Canada I propos'd an instruction founded on the principles which my letter contains,(3) to the ministers authoriz'd to form the treaty with GB: the committee have reported in favor of it, but the delicacy of our situation  APRIL 12, 1785  with that court, upon that of the posts & other subjects, is a con--; sideration wh. inclines me to decline for the present bringing it to the view of Congress. The restrictions on this intercourse can only be carried into effect by possession of the posts and the more disadvantageous to them their surrender will be, the longer they may delay it. I enclose you the report of a committee in favor of a change of the first paragraph of the 9th of the articles of confideration for the purpose of investing Congress with almost the entire regulation of the commerce of the Union, in exclusion of the particular States.(4) I am inclin'd to think it will be best also to postpone this for the present. Its adoption must depend on the several Legislatures and to carry it with them the preferable way perhaps may be to let it stand as it now is. It hath been brought so far without a prejudice agst it. If carried farther here prejudices will take place, at least I fear so, & those who oppose it here will in their St[ates]. The way then will be to present it to them in its present state, wh. may be effected by obtaining the permission of Congress for each delegation to take copies for that purpose. If this shod. be its course I shall have time for your answer & opinion on it. A committee is appointed to revise and report what alterations if any are necessary in the instructions to the comrs. authoriz'd to form commercl. treaties.(5) What will be the result I know not, but the object of the appointmt. was, to change the principle upon wh. those existing were form'd. To instruct them to make the best bargain they can with each power, such an one as the advantages wh. they respectively derive from a commercl. intercourse with us, intitle us to expect. If the convenience & advantage of the trade of either of these powers with us is equal, the condition upon wh. it is conducted for commercl. & other national purposes, shod. be equal also. The object is to connect us [to] each power independently of other powers, & to extricate us from the complicated system with which their connections with each other is involv'd, a system which they well understand, have been long accustom'd to the exercise of, & to turn to their particular advantages by every possible means of fraud and chicane. I doubt much the advantage of forming treaties for the present with any of the powers with whom you are authoriz'd to treat (the piratical States excepted), for what advantages can we give here in consideration of advantages there, or rather in consideration that they remove some of the restraints wh. now exist, which they do not at present possess, or possessing that we can deprive them of. The more I investigate this subject the more I am confirm'd in this opinion. But all these embarrassments in the restrictions laid upon us by other powers, will I am persuaded have a good effect. They will operate more powerfully than the utmost force of argument cod. do for the strength'ning our govt. From Spain we expect a Mr. Gardoqui in quality of chargé des affrs. All our measures with that court have of course ceasd untill his arrival  APRIL12, 1785  wh. is weekly expected. Whatever we leave to transact with the ct. of G.B. is committed to Mr. Adams, the formation of a commercl. treaty only excepted. Upon his removal from the Hague it was resolv'd to appoint a minister in his room: Mr Rutledge & Mr. R. H. Harrison, C. Justice of Maryld. are in nomination as is likewise Govr. Livingston of Jersey; it is not known whether either will serve.(6) My first letter will advise you of our embarrassment respecting a particular affr. upon which you wrote me as you left Phila., an attention to which falls now within your province. It is unfortunate upon this acct. your cypher wod. not expose it to you. You will please write me as soon as possible upon this subject.(7) You will receive instructions respecting the piratical states of Barbary.(8) I fear from the information you give me they will not obtain fully the objects which they have in view. From what I have been able to collect here a treaty commencd on our own ground independent of any European power, will be most successful, since I am told they disregard the most powerful among them as much as they do us, & in that instance we might plead ignorance of the presents or amount, which would be acceptable to them. It is agreed to raise 700 men for the purposes of guarding the publick stores & giving security to the frontier settlements of the States. At Annapolis Mr Gerry protested agnst. the right of Congress to require men in time of peace; his conduct was approv'd by his State & the delegation instructed to oppose & protest upon all occasions agnst. the exercise of the power. It is agreed that by requisition men cannot be rais'd upon a few States or less than the whole but under particular circumstances of some, & then under a particular modification. It was thought in this instance necessary to have them in the field, in a short time, to protect the surveyors of the land & as this consideration superseded the propriety of a requisitn. on the whole it was agreed to recommend it to the States, most contiguous, to raise them.(9) The land office is not yet open'd. A report drawn principally by Colo. Grayson will be deliver'd in in a few days. It devia[tes] I believe essentially from the one at Annapolis, but in what points I cannot say as I have not compar'd them together. The object of this is to have the lands survey'd previous to the sale, & after the survey to have the lots drawn for in the right of the States & sold in each by the Loan officer at publick vendue for specie or certificates.(10) I shall transmit you the journals of Congress as far as they are printed. They will give you at least the resolutions which determine the erection of buildings at the falls of the Delaware & our intermediate residence here. Our dependence for their erection at Georgeton had been on the southern States & as soon as Congress conven'd we found they had given it up. All further opposition we therefore considerd as useless One hundred thousand dolrs. are appropriated to it. Between Phila. & this place we were indifferent as a temporary residence; we consider'd our   State as no otherwise interested than as it might respect the delegates attending in Congress; upon fOEderal principles that this shod. have the preference. It must have a good appearance for the fOEderal govt. to pay attention to the part, wh. hath suffer'd most, from the depredations of the war; add to this the province of Canada in possession at present of the fur-trade---;the first exertion of the States must be to draw it thence & afterwards it may take its direction thro' the Potowmk. or whatever channel is open'd to it. But the 100,000 dolrs are upon no fund. Whether they are to be requir'd from the States or not will become the question. It wod. be fortunate if a delay cod. take place. The conduct of our delegation at Trenton was founded upon an acqu[i]essence with the voice of the majority of the Union. We acted together & voted unanimously upon every point respecting these measures. Grayson only was absent. Be the event of this town as it may I think the proportion wh. will fall to our State will be well dispos'd of if [it] annexes the Idea of stability to our councils & measures. I cod. wish no more movements untill we take our final position. I send you this by Colo. Smith Secry. to the legation for London. Mr Trumbull only was his competitor. He was formerly an aid de camp to Genl. Washington. He is desirous of being known to you & as I hear from every person who knows him a fair & respectable character, I take the liberty to present these circumstances in his favor to your knowledge. Be assurd I shall pay particular attention to that circumstance which is more personally interesting to yr. self mention'd in your first letter. What can or will be done is incertain but satisfied of the justice of the measure, I shall with the utmost pleasure seek the attainment of it in a manner wh. will be most delicate & honorable to you. Indeed I think all our ministers shod. have at least 5 or 600£ stirg. more annually. I thank you for subscribing for me for the Encyclopedia. I have not at present the money but will send it as soon as possible. I sincerly wish it were in my power to join you this summer but it is impossible. The next I have it in contemplation & shall then be under no necessity to hurry myself so quickly back, & I cod. wish to rem[ai]n in Europe if I ever visit at least 12 months. Colo. Smith hath my instructions not to send this by post but some safe hand provided he doth not deliver it himself. Whether Congress will or not adjourn during the summer is incertain. I think they shod. not, but the fact is our application to business hath been so close during the winter that we wish a relaxation. I think Congress shod. sit untill our affrs. with every for. power were finally & most amicably settld; and untill the commerce of the Union was properly regulated. The Confidracy might then stand secure & not be expos'd to injury or danger. Mr. Butler, Walcot & A Lee were on the Indian treaty at fort Stanwix; the State of N. York also held a treaty. They quarrell'd with the comrs. of N. York & disgusted   the State. This is attributed to one of those gentn. only. Mr. Mercer hath been absent since we left Trenton & hath married Miss Sprigg. Mr. Read hath been less active than at Annapolis---;he is sd. to be engag'd to K. Van horne of this place. He left this for So. Carolina 2 months since, it is sd. to prepare matters for this event. A Mr. Carbonneau from the Kaskaskias petition'd Congress to take the people under their protection; a committee hath reported wh. is so far adopted that a comr. be appointed to repair thither instructed &ca. Mr A Lee is in nomination.(11) The three comrs. of the treasury elected at Annapolis declin'd serving, in consequence of wh. Gervais, Osgood & a Walter Livingston were elected. Gervais hath declin'd & Mr. A Lee who hath upon every occasion been a candidate is agn. in nomination. Mercer & himself were in nomination at Trenton & we gave the former the preference. The fact is we can get none better than Mr. A. L. & shall upon this occasion vote for him.(12) Your letters still contain doubts of the event of the interfering claims between the Emperor & the Netherlands. Mr. V. Berkel hath presented a full & able statment of those of the U. Net. & of the progress of either party to the commenc'ment of the winter in support of their pretensions. A war between them cannot be injurious to us; provided our merchts. have enterprise. As we stand on neutral ground, they may turn it to theirs & the genl. advantage. Believe me to be dear Sir your affectionate friend & servant, Jas. Monroe(13) P.S. The alteration wh. this report proposes in the whole system of our govt. will be great. It is in fact a radical change of it. [I] beg of you to write your sentiments fully on it. If it is car[ri]ed it can only be by thorough investigation and a conviction carried to the minds of every citizen that it is right. The slower it moves on therefore in my opinion the better. ""

  Dear sir New York. 13th April 1785. In a letter, a few days since to Your Excelly.,(1) I hinted the probability there would be, of some Acts of Congress, which would require the Attention of the Legislature of our State, at an Earlier period, than that to which they stood adjourned. Those I had principally in View; were the Requisitions, on the States for Men and Money. The former of these was passed on Yesterday, and the Number assigned to N. Jersey, the same as last Year; but the Ter[ms] of their Enlistment is for three Years. A Copy of [the] Act Mr. Secy. Thompson will forward to Your Excelly. by this Conveyance.(2) Two reasons Might be given why this Measure ought not to be long delayed---;first---;The Troops (both Officers & Men) are to be raised upon much lower Terms, than those last year; so that the sooner the former are discharged the greater the saving will be to the United States; but a more principal reason is; That no Measures having as yet been taken by Great Britain for the Evacuation of the Western Posts; it becomes expedient for the U. States to pursue such steps; as may tend to aid the Negotiations on that Subject, of her Minister at the Court of London; give Security to the Frontier Settlements; facilitate an intercourse with the Indian Nations; and to protect and promote the Navigation of the Lakes by her Citizens. These Objects will in a great Measure be Effected, by raising a Competent Force for this purpose & placing them in such situations, as must tend to render the Posts now held by the Troops of his Britannic Majesty Void and useless. The number proposed to be raised cannot wholly do this; but if we can alienate the Trade, now carried on by Means of the Canadians, under the protection & for the sole Emolument of the Military Establishment in that Province; Change the Channel & throw the Trade into the Hands of the Citizens of these States; I am persuaded, it will operate, not only as a Source of great wealth; but will be the Means of facilitating a delivery of those Posts. The requisition for Money is in part Acted on & will shortly follow the other. The Agregate Amount will be Three Millions of Dollars; of  APRIL 13, 1785  this the Quota assigned N. Jersey stands at 166,716 Dollars.(3) The Necessity of the States taking Measures for immediately carying this Act into Effect is so apparent, that I should forbear saying anything on this head; were it not for some circumstances, which Your Excelly. or at least the Legislature cannot be acquainted with. The Minister of France and since his return to Europe; the \""Charge des Affaires\"" has in a Number of Instances represented to Congress the Uneasiness of his Master, the most Christian King, on the Subject of his Loans to the U. States; That he finds no Effective Funds have been provided, for either securing the Principal, or discharging the Interest accruing, & already accumulated thereon: That an injurious discrimination has been Made by some of the States, between their own Citizens, and the subjects or Citizens of France holding Loan Office Certificates; in the partial payment of Interest arising on this debt. This has Created disgusts & discontents among that Class of Creditors; which may eventually prove pernicious to the good Understanding prevailing between the two Nations. Mr. Morris, in a letter of the 23d Feby last informs us, \""That he had not been in a Capacity to make any payments due in France, the last Year.\"" This Circumstance, will not abate their Jealousy, but rather heighten their Demands; more Especially when they learn, That the Funds, on which they principally relied, for discharging, as well [the] Interest as the Principal of the National Debt. \""Viz. By the Establishment of Certain Imposts and providing Suplementary funds for a given Number of Years, as recommended in the resolutions of the 18th April 1783\"" are (if not wholly frustrated) procrastinated to such a period; that their Hopes are but very slender, with regard to the preservation of our Faith and the Establishment of a National Credit. Your Excelly. must have learned with pain, That the states of New York & Georgia have wholly rejected this proposition, and that Rhode Island have acceeded to it, under such limitations & restrictions as are antifOEderal & cannot of Course bind the other states: Indeed I almost dispair of seeing a Continental Impost Established or rather the duties resulting therefrom, going into a Common Treasury: Certain I am it will not be Conceeded upon the present System. Under this State of things, it is apparent, that other Measures must be resorted to, for the purpose of discharging the growing Interest---;That on the Foreign Debt, as also the Supplies for the Services of the present Year (the latter amounting to near Half a Million of Dollars) can be discharged with no other than real Money. Facilities may be made use of, by the States in discharge of the Interest arising on the Domestic debt; so far I observe the State have already made provision, and anticipated the Views of Congress, by their Revenue Act, passed in the close of 1783;(4) and altho it is not exactly in the Train, which they may recommend, yet still substantial Justice is done thereby to the Creditors within the State. The Necessity of the Measure then, I   trust is undeniable; but how far the State is able to bear this additional Tax, is a question I am not able, nor is it my duty to Answer. I am well aware of the great Exertions of N. Jersey during the War, and of her consequent impoverished state on the return of Peace. I am not insensible too, of her Situation, between two great Commercial Citys, which not only cut her off, from every Benefit resulting from Trade, but also necessarily subjects her to Contribute to their Wealth & Revenue, in a Ratio proportionate to her Consumption of imported Articles and under this impression I had prepared a Motion (a Copy of which I inclose Your Excelly.) which I intended to have Made in Congress, with a View to alleviate in a small degree, the present sum demanded of the State---;finding however little or no probability of its being adopted; I have for the present laid it aside; well hoping, that our Legislature will conceive it an Object worthy of some attention since the Idea of an Impost for FOEderal purposes, seems almost wholly Extinguished & the Mode of raising Money by Requisition & for Quotaing the National Debt, may continue for some Years to Come. Before I conclude this long letter, I must beg Your Excellys. further Indulgence, w[hile] I mention one other Circumstance, that may have some weight in calling the Legislature together Earlier, than the time to which they are adjourned; I mean the representation of the State on the Floor of Congress. I hope I shall be believed by Your Excelly. & the State, when I assure you, it is with the utmost reluctance, I relinquish the very Honorable Trust, they have been pleased to repose in Me; but Necessity and Candor obliges me to declare I cannot longer serve them in Congress. Not born to an Affluent fortune; and my little Patrimony, gradually Mouldering; from a Want of that attention which my Engagements in public life, since the Commencement of the Revolution has prevented; I am Constrained by the Dictates of Humanity & the duties I owe to a dependent family, to retire to a private life & to provide by my Industry for those, who have a right to require it of my Hands. I feel myself extreamly flattered & gratefull, for the appointment the State have Conferred on Me; but I must say, the Salary they have been pleased to Anex to it, is not more than barely sufficient for my single Maintenance while attending on the Duties of it. Mr. Houston Informed me he should certainly decline. I have wrote Mr. Dick, pressing his attendance. He is silent on the subject, and I am inclined to believe does not mean to attend. Mr. Cadwallader is absent for the present, but Expects to return in May.(5) Mr. Stewart assures me it will not be in his power to Continue much longer. In this dilemma we now Stand, and I greatly fear the State will not Continue to be represented, Unless further appointments are Made. I hope your Excelly. will excuse me for this particular detail and attribute it to a sincere Wish I have, that these Vacancys May be supplied & the reputation of the State preserved.  With sentiments of the Most perfect respect and Esteem, I have the Honor to be, Your Excellys. most Obedt. Hum Servt. Jno Beatty ""

  Dear Sir New York 13th, April 1785. I had the pleasure to write you about a fortnight ago(1) by the Brig Capt. Hollister for New Bern in which I thanked you for your favour of the 14 Ulto. which is the only one I have Received from you since I came here. I find from Mr. W. Blounts Letter to Mr. Spaight by S. Tinker that it is supposed I was then on my return home, it was this supposition I presume that induced them not to write me by him. From the pressing necessity for my return home I have submitted to the inconvenience of paying a very exorbitant Interest per Month for Money to enable me to pay my Expences here & on the road, (for I propose avoiding the sea hereafter as much as I possibly can) the sooner therefore that remittances can be made me for repaying this Money (which will be something more than 200 £) the sooner shall I get rid of an intolerable peice of Usury, I am sure my dear Sir this hint to you for a Necessity for Money is wholly useless, I know that without it you wou'd do whatever was in your power but it is a subject which engrosses so much of my Attention that I cannot begin a Letter to you without touching on it. Give me leave to observe to you that remittances will be more advantageously made to Philadelphia in (I beleive) any kind of No Carolina produce than to this place, Trade here is very confined & stagnate. 4 or 500 Barrels of Naval stores will any time reduce the price of them here 25 or more per Cent. There will be no difficulty in transferring Money from Phila to New York & I think it is pretty certain that Markets are generally better at that place than at this. But shou'd you find it more convenient or proper to ship to New York on my Account I will beg the favor of you to address & consign the same to Messrs. Stevens & Hubbell, Water Street No. 145. Inclosed are the two last papers one of which contains an Edict of the King of France which no doubt is interesting to every American Merchant to know.(2) APRIL 14, 1785  The prices current which I enclosed you in my last must not be relied on, our produce, particularly Naval stores is much lower now. Please present my Compliments to Mrs. Blount &c. and Mr. Wm Blount, I shou'd have written him was I not about leaving this soon therefore I cou'd write him nothing which I cou'd not with more pleasure tell him in person very shortly. I shall if I can conveniently leave this about the 20th of this Month & will make no considerable Delay on the road.(3) You shall hear from me at Philadelphia if any thing offers worth Communicating.

We have the acceptance of Mr. Wythe, and if his engagements will not permit him to come northerly, we now have the engagement of N. York to go to him. You ask why the commission has not been made out. The mode of conducting the business in Pennsylvania & Connecticut has  APRIL 14, 1785  become a precedent and there, one commission only was made naming all the Judges, an attested copy whereof was put to each Judge, the original commission delivered to the Court, and returned by them to Congress with an indorsed certificate that they had executed the Trust.

It is long since I have written to you, but much longer since I have had the honor of hearing from you, and I am perfectly satisfied that both these effects have been produced by causes not fairly within our controul---;perhaps the same obstructions may not so fully prevail hereafter, and if they do not, I shall be happy.

The untoward circumstances in which both countries are found to be placed, may have arisen from a neglect of decent and proper respect having been heretofore paid by each to the other. And if so, this advance on our part, may lead to the establishment of better conduct and happier consequences. That it may be so, may God, of his infinite mercy, grant.

  Sir, New York 14th April 1785 The grand Committee have reported the Ordinance for the Land Office. It was reported on Tuesday, obtain'd its first Reading on its Passage to day and may probably obtain its second & third during the next Week.(1) The Order for raising Troops, 700 men, has passed.(2) The Plan proposed in the Ordinance, now on its Passage, is to have a Geographer for the U S and thirteen or more Surveyors under his Direction. No other Officers are proposed. The Treasury & Officers of the Loans in difft. States are to mannage the Mony matters. The Geographer is to see that the Surveyors execute their Work with some degree of accuracy & to make out a Map of the Country from their Works.

  Dear Sir, New York Apl. 15th. 1785. I did myself the honor of writing to you by Post the 10th of March last in answer to your favor of the 22nd of January, & I hope my letter has before this got safe to hand. On my being appointed one of the Commee. for draughting the Ordnance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of lands in the Western territory, the President was kind enough to furnish me with an extract of your letter to him on the subject of the back Country, which now induces me to conclude it will be agreable to you to be informed of the farther progress of this important business.(1) The Ordnance was reported to Congress three days ago, & ordered to be printed, & I now take the earliest opportunity of sending you a copy; The idea of a sale by public Vendue, in such large quantities, appears at first view eccentric, & objectionable; I shall therefore mention to you the reasons which those who are advocates for the measure offer in it's support; They say this cannot be avoided witht. affording an undue advantage to those whose contiguity to the territory has giv'n them an opportunity of investigating the qualities of the land; That there certainly must be a difference in the value of the lands in different parts of the Country, and that this difference cannot be ascertained witht. an actual survey in the first instance & a sale by competition in the next. APRIL 15, 1785  That with respect to the quantity of land offered for sale in a township, it will not have the effect of injuring the poorer class of people, or of establishing monopolies in speculators & ingrossers: That experience is directly agt. the inference, for that the Eastern States, where lands are more equally divided than in any other part of the Continent were generally settled in that manner; That the idea of a township with the temptation of a support for religion & education holds forth an inducement for neighbourhoods of the same religious sentiments to confederate for the purpose of purchasing and settling together; That the Southern mode would defeat this end by introducing the idea of indiscriminate locations & settlements, which would have a tendency to destroy all those inducemts. to emigration which are derived from friendships, religion and relative connections; That the same consequence would result from sales in small quantities under the present plan; That the advantages of an equal representation, the effect of laying off the country in this manner; The exemption from controversy on account of bounds to the latest ages; the fertility of the lands; the facilities of communication with the Atlantic through a variety of channels, as also with the Brittish & Spaniards; the fur & peltry trade; & the right of forming free governments for themselves, must solicit emigrants from all parts of the world, & insure a settlement of the country in the most rapid manner; That speculators & ingrossers, if they purchase the lands in the first instance cannot long retain them on account of the high price they will be obliged to give & the consequent loss of interest while remaining in their hands uncultivated; That if they however should make money by ingrossing, the great design of the land office is answered which is revenue; and that this cannot affect any but European emigrants or those who were not at hand to purchase in the first instance; that if it is an evil, it will cure itself, which has been the case in Lincoln County Virginia, where the lands were first in the hands of Monopolists: but who were forced to part with them from a reguard to the general defense. That the expence & delay would be too great to divide the territory into fractional parts by actual surveys, and if this is not done sales at public vendue cannot be made, as witht. a previous knowledge of the quality of the lands no comparative estimate can be form'd between different undivided moieties; That the offering a small number of townships for sale at a time is an answer to the objection on account of delay, and at the same time it prevents the price from being diminished on acct. of the Markets being overstocked. That the present plan excludes all the formalities of warrants, entries, locations, returns & caveats, as the first & last process is a deed.  That it supercedes the necessity of Courts for the determination of disputes, as well as that of creating new officers for carrying the plan into execution; That the mode of laying out the same in squares is attended with the least possible expence, there being only two sides of the square to run in almost all cases. That the expence will be repaid to the Continent in a ten:fold ratio, by preventing fraud in the Surveyors. That the drawing for the townships and sending them on to the different States is conformable to the principles of the government, one State having an equal right to the best lands at it's market with the other: as also of disposing of it's public securities in that way. That if the Country is to be settled out of the bowels of the Atlantic States it is but fair the idea of each State's contributing it's proportion of emigrants should be countenanced by measures operating for that purpose. That if the plan should be found by experience to be wrong, it can easily be altered by reducing the quantities & multiplying the surveys. These were the principal reasonings on the Commee. in favor of the measure and on which it would give me great satisfaction to have your sentiments,(2) as it involves consequences of the most extensive nature, and is still liable to be rejected altogether by Congress, or to be so altered as to clear it of the exceptionable parts; perhaps the present draught might have been less objectionable, if we had all have had the same views. Some gentlemen looked upon it as a matter of revenue only & that it was true policy to get the money witht. parting with inhabitants to populate the Country & thereby prevent the lands in the original states from depreciating. Others (I think) were afraid of an interference with the lands now at market in the individual States: part of the Eastern Gentlemen wish to have the lands sold in such a manner as to suit their own people who may chuse to emigrate, of which I believe there will be great numbers particularly from Connecticut: But others are apprehensive of the consequences which may result from the new States taking their position in the Confederacy.

  Dear Sir New York 15th Ap. 1785. The best return in my power to make you for your ingenious communications on the mode of disposing of the western territory, is to inclose for your examination the form of an ordinance reported to Congress on the subject---;you will find thereby that your ideas have had weight with the committee who reported this ordinance;(1) and I have only to add that I shall hold myself particularly obliged by your farther communications on this subject. I likewise inclose you the Report of a committee on a motion for the exclusion of Slavery from the New States.(2) Your Ideas on this unjustifiable practice, are so just that It would be impossible to differ from them. I shall receive a farther proof of your goodness, if you can procure and send me a pamphlet written in Pennsylvania by Doctr.

It was the intention of Mr. Gerry & myself that his draft shd. be recalled and mine substituted in its place---;pray let my Draft be forwarded to Mr. Russel, and then the business will stand right.

  Dear Sir. New York, April 18, 1785. I should before this have thanked you for your favour of March 15th,(1) if I had not been in daily expectation that the arrival of the packets would bring us some intelligence from Europe worth communicating to you; the February packet has but just come in after a passage of eight weeks, and neither she or other vessels in short passages, bring us any thing interesting. War or peace in Europe, hangs yet in doubtful balance; both parties arming with assiduity, and nothing determined upon. Mr. John Adams, is sent plenipotentiary to the court of London, and Mr. Jefferson is the minister at Versailles, Dr. Franklin having leave, at his own request, to retire. Returning appearances of good humour, and a proposition first made by the British court, to treat of our differences in London, has induced hopes of an amicable adjustment of disputes. Mr. Gardoque is not arrived, but expected about the last of this month from the Havana, to which place he went from Spain previous to his coming here. If the commenced bickering between Madrid and London on the Musquito shore should go on, we may probably have easier work with both courts in our business with them. I have the honour to enclose you the report of a respectable  APRIL 18, 1785  committee on the subject of selling the western lands, which has not yet been acted upon, though it speedily will.(2) What changes may be made in this plan before it finally passes, cannot yet be told, but probably there will be some. Your idea of settling a state at a time, would most certainly be the wisest and the best, if the excessive rage for taking lands there could be possibly restrained. But really it seems that either Congress must sell quickly, or possession will be so taken as to render doubtful this fine fund for extinguishing the public debt. It has been impossible to get a vote for more than seven hundred men to garrison all the posts to be fixed in the trans-Alleghanian country, from north to south; a number very inadequate, I fear, to the purpose of even suppressing illegal trespasses upon the western lands. Our friend the Marquis La Fayette, arrived after a short passage, but I believe it was a very boisterous one. Your letter for Mr. Lee I sent after him to Virginia,(3) whither he was returning before I received it. My best respects attend your lady. I have the honour to be, with the truest esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very humble servt.

 William Samuel Johnson to Roger Sherman Dr. Sr. New York April 20th. 1785. I am sorry to hear by Genl. Woolcot, that you are not coming to N. York, as Capt. Wooster gave me to expect you would, about this time. I extremely want your Opinion & Advice relative to the pursuing Mrs. Woosters Petition before Congress.(1) The difficulty is this. Congress have very lately, upon the Petition of Genl. Thomas's Widdow of Massachusetts, fully explain'd the Doubt there was, whether he was entitled to Bridagiers or Colonel's Pay, deciding it in favor of the former. Thus, one of the grounds of Mrs. Wooster's Petition is effectually remov'd. What remains, is, only that the State of Connecticut will not pay it, tho' the Requisition of Congress is as full as they can make it, if they sho'd take up the subject again---;And is it to be presumed that Congress will take it upon themselves, merely because Connecticut will not do what she ought? Nay will the Finances of the United States admit of such a measure? Yet more, can they do it when the other  APRIL 20, 1785  Portrait of William Samuel Johnson  States have actually taken upon themselves, & are now in the Payment, of similar demands, as N York of Mrs. Montgomery, N. Jersey of Mrs. Barber, &c &c? Would not this derange everything? Will not the matter now stand solely upon the ground, & appear in the light, of a complaint against the State? If so, can I advocate it? Will not everything of this Nature come with a very Ill Grace from a Delegate of the State? Finally, for I dare not presume to ask any more Questions, Is it not most adviseable, since Congress have explain'd the only doubt there was in the Case, & that the session of the Genr1. Assembly is so near, for Mrs. Wooster to apply once more to the Assembly before she pursues the matter further here. Your sentiments upon this subject would give great relief to, & extremely oblige, Dr. Sr., Yr. most obedient humble Servant, Wm. Saml. Johnson [P.S.] Genl. Woolcot will tell you our situation here, since the Blow we have rec'd from N York. I am loath to revive the Idea of so severe & fatal a defeat.(2) [P.P.S.] After I had written the within, I had the Honor to receive your favour of the 12th Inst!(3) That I had nothing agreeable to acquaint you with, must be my Apology for not writing, & I presumed you had long since heard that N York had, in Senate, finally rejected the 5 per Cent Impost. It will not be resumed again this Year. Georgia too has neglected to grant it. In consequence whereof a most respectable Grand Jury of the State, have, before their Supreme Court, Indicted the whole Legislature of a high handed Misdemeanor.(4) This however, will produce no immediate benefit to the United States, & their Credit must for the present languish. Our only actual rescource is the Western Territory, (for I consider requisitions as extremely precarious) this we have been diligently at work upon for some time, & I hope shall now soon complete.(5) I think I may assure you, it will be settled to sell in Townships, of about 7 Mile Square, to be divided for purpose of sale to the several States, to be disposed of at Auction, fixing however a price, say 6/ per Acre, below which it shall not go. The Army also to take in Townships. I could wish the plan you propose with respect to the Impost could take place, but it is so bold & decided a measure that I fear we are not at present sufficiently in Spirits to adopt it. The Cession of Connecticut has been long depending before a Committee of 5, most of whom attend with reluctance, but when they meet contest it with vigour.(6) It will nevertheless be pressed, if possible, to a decision. The Massachusetts Cession has been just now Accepted which is no unfavourable circumstance.(7) The wish is that we would Cede the whole of our right, or at least as far as New York & Massachusetts have done viz: to a Line twenty Miles West of the Streight of Niagara. But I am of Opinion that if Connecticut proceeds in the affair with firmness & prudence, she may yet retain the Boundary she has proposed, but   something must be determined upon soon, for the reserved Territory will be included in the Sale proposed by Congress, except that part of it reserved by the Indians. The runing the Western Line of Pensilvania, which is to be done this Spring, will give us clearer, & more determinate Ideas of that Country. The Case of Vermont has not been bro't before Congress, owing to its having been depending all Winter before the Legislature of this State, under a general Expectation, which had taken place, that they would declare them Independent & request Congress to receive them into the Union. It appears now, within a few days, that it will not be done this Session, & why Vermont is not here to pursue the matter in Congress I know not. We have pretty certain Intelligence that the Western Inhabitants of Virginia; & of North Carolina, are Erecting themselves into seperate & Independent States. This renders it extremely Necessary that the United States sho'd take immediate Care of their Western Territory. Seven hundred Men are Recommended to be raised for this, & other purposes.8 I wish this Number may be sufficient. Mr. Kirkland has just now been with me. He appears to be a worthy, & well informed Man, & I sincerely wish he could be reestablished among the Indians. I shall certainly do all in my power to give facility & effect to his applications to Congress.(9) But the feeble Finances of the United States give a check to every liberal & enlarged Idea. They damp the Ardor of the generous, & are an effectual screen for the illiberal & contracted. I do not despair, however, that something may be done. Coll. Cook leaves us tomorrow.(10) I beg your Influence to send on some other Gentlemen in the Delegation, as well to supply his place, as to relieve me that I may, about the middle of May, attend the Genl. Assembly, where I have business of Importance, for a few days, after which, if it be tho't expedient, I will without hesitation, return here again, & am with the sincerest Esteem & Respect, Dr. Sr., Yr. most obedient humble Servant, Wm.

I am so perfectly well acquainted with your justice and humanity, that I am very sure of success, when I recommend to your friendly care and powerful protection the cause of an innocent but injured Gentleman, and of a very worthy family. It is Mr. Charles McEvers of this City, whose property in your State has, I understand, been confiscated upon a mistaken principle that he was a british Adherent. It is most clear that a misconception of this Gentlemans Character has drawn this misfortune upon him, as appears incontestably by the proofs that he possesses of a very early attachment to our suffering friends at Boston, and by Governor Clintons letter, which out of doubt acquits him of all attachment to our former enemies. Eagle-eyed as this State is, and has been, to discern its foes; and prompt to confiscate the property of all such, it is a demonstration of the innocence of Mr. McEvers that he has not been here considered as an Adherent to the British. And what is a very remarkable truth that has come under my own observation, the warmest and most virtuous Whigs of this place are the most decided friends of Mr. McEvers, and wish to see justice done him by a restoration of his property lost in your State.

You state it as an affair that took a serious direction, and which may injure your business. I hope this idea is more the result of apprehension, then an opinion founded on facts. At any rate, the best plan is perseverance, and temper. You have near you, a number of persons of too much candor, and good sense, to support an erroneous opinion. These individuals will become dearer to you, and interesting themselves particularly in your affairs will give them an appearance, such as you could wish. My particular friend you say remembers me---;and bids you make assurances, the sincerity of which, I will not doubt---;but in return say, that I reciprocate the good wishes with the most lively attachment---;of this, it remains not to furnish a proof, it has already been satisfactorily given. You obligingly inquire of my affairs; I reply that I never have spent any period of my life with so close an application to business or with so few amusements, as since I left you. In a situation, the duties of which may subject me to public examination, & with some little ambition, I have been desirous of pursueing a Conduct, that would not hazard me in the first view, nor dishonor me in the second. As to my victim condition, that you say is reported, I assure you that there could no report be circulated concerning me that would be less true. At present I think it improper to bow to beauty, or bend to fortune---;so negligent have I been on this subject, that upon my honor I assure you that I think of neither except when I think of home.

  Dear Sir, N. York 27th Apr. 1785 I receiv'd your favor; in consequence of which I shall write to Mr. Graham for the receipt which you desire. Indeed I should have done this sooner, but I have been a little indispos'd till within these three days; Before I arrived at this place, Genl Knox was elected Secretary at war;(1) he has since come here, and is now acting in his office; from what I can learn he has accepted of the appointment under a supposition that his house rent will be paid. Poor Carlton is in a distrest situation; he will shortly be out of pay and un-pensioned; I am striving to get something allowed him by way of compensation though I am afraid no great matter can be affected, as it is not among the vices of republicans to be prodigal in the article of rewarding for services which are past.(2) Since my arrival I have been busily engaged in assisting about framing an ordinance for the disposal of the Western territory; I think there has been as much said and wrote about it as would fill forty Volumes, and yet we seem far from a conclusion, so difficult is it to form any system, which will suit our complex government, & where the interests of the component parts are suppos'd to be so different. I made a motion for Amendmts. three days ago,(3) which has nearly divided the Continent into equal moieties; the object of it was to double the quantity of surveying, & to sell the lands in townships & sections alternately; this I did under the impression that it would accomodate both the Eastern & Southern States. However this has been strongly objected to, & both sides adhere to their opinion; so that here we stick, witht. any movement either retrograde or progressive. I inclose you the draught of the Ordnance as it stands; which you will be kind enough to keep in your hands in such a manner as to prevent it from being published this being against rule. I believe it will pass ultimately in a shape very like this, at least none of the great principles except perhaps the one alluded to will be changed. By it you will observe that there is no office created by it worth your acceptance. If in the arrangement of the Post Office or any other matter any thing occurs which may be worth your notice, I will do myself the pleasure of informing you of it; and I can assure you with great truth it will give me real satisfaction to do every thing in my power towards accomplishing any object which you may have in view.

  Sir, New York April 29, 1785. In the journals, which are regularly transmitted by the Secretary of Congress, you will observe the proceedings of Congress down to the 7th Instant. Since which much time has been spent on the Requisition & the Land-ordinance; neither of which have yet passed; the latter proves to be the most complicated & embarrassing Subject before Congress since peace has taken place. Infinite pains are taken by a certain sett of men vulgarly called Land robbers, or Land-Sharks to have it in their power to engross the best lands; while it is the duty of Congress to open their Land-office on terms which will at once secure the greatest possible revenue therefrom & give no undue advantage to any class of citizens, or to any district of the Foederal Union. APRIL 29, 1785  The public papers must have informed your Excellency that the Legislature of Georgia, after solemn argument, rejected the Impost of 5 per Cent & that the Grand jury of the County of Chatham, in that State presented the Legislature to the Supreme Court as guilty of a misdemeanor relative to the premises.(1) Whether indictment & conviction ensued has not yet transpired. It is with no vulgar degree of satisfaction that I have it also in my power to mention that the 5 per Cent Impost has also been rejected by 13 against 7 of the Senate of this State.(2) And that the public paper of this day announces to us that the Gentleman who brought in the bill has been left out of the Senate on the late election in this City. I have been told, on good authority, that three quarters of the members of the Assembly approved of the doings of the Senate. And that the popular current sets strong throughout this State against that exploded measure. It gives me additional pleasure to mention these facts as they justify the information & opinion I gave the Hon. the Genl. Assembly last June relative to this State, which were then controverted by persons of respectable characters. The lands to be exposed to sale within the late purchases of the Indians are estimated I find by the best judges at about 18 millions of Acres. Another large purchase it is expected will be made in the course of the ensuing Summer. So vast is the revenue already in the power of Congress. What proofs they will give of their wisdom in the management thereof is yet uncertain. The lands are to be quotaed to the States in proportion to the requisition for money so that a proportional quantity thereof will be sold in each of the Loan-offices in the different States. One dollar per acre in public securities will be the lowest price. It is not in my power to say how long Congress will continue their present session, or how long your delegates may remain on the floor. I have been so much from home of late that it is my ardent wish to return: although I confess I should leave Congress with reluctance before the important business is finished. Captn. Lawton, who arrived here yesterday, informs me that he has brought me 150 dollars; this will compleat the payment of the grant made me at October session, as I presume the Bill in favour of Messieurs Hews & Anthony for the other moiety must have been paid. Your Excellency has informed me of a grant of 300 dollars made to me at the last session of the Assembly---;permit me to request that measures may be taken for making payment thereof as it will be indispensably necessary to enable me to discharge my debts here before I return. I shall draw for the same as soon as I may receive notice that my bills will be paid: I am very unwilling to draw any more at uncertainties. After praying your Excellency to assure the Hon. the Legislature of my constant attention to their affairs & of my zeal to serve them as  APRIL 30, 1785  well as of my gratitude for the very disting[u]ished marks of their confidence & esteeme with which I have been honored I beg leave to subscribe with the most profound respect, Your Excellencys most obedient & very humble servt.

  Dear Sir. N. York May 1st. 1785. I am afraid my silence since I came to this place has giv'n you some reason to suspect me to be impregnated with that vis inertiæ, which has been so often attributed to me:(1) the only apology I have to make, is that I wish'd to have some thing to write to you worth your acceptance. However as there would be some danger in risquing a farther delay, I shall give you what I have in the manner. The New England delegates wish to sell the Continental lands, rough as it runs; what I miss in quality I will make up in quantity. All our attentions here have been for some time turned towards the hostile preparations between the Emperor & the Dutch; as it was thought the event might have a considerable influence on the affairs of the United States. The packet which arrived yesterday has brought different accounts of what is doing respecting this business; however I take the following to be nearly the truth of the case:(2) That the Emperor has only made the opening the Schelde a pretext for marching his troops into the low Countries while he has been underhandedly treating with the Elector of Bavaria for an exchange of his territories in the low Countries for Bavaria: That France has not only been privy to the negotiations but has actually countenanc'd them; While no other power has entertain'd the most distant suspicions of what was going forward: That the prince de Deux Ponts presumptive heir to Bavaria, on recieving the first notice of it, made application to the King of Prussia, supposing that old Statesman would exert himself to the utmost, to prevent Bavaria from becoming part of the domains of the House of Austria. It therefore seems to be probable that all those who wish to preserve the proper ballance of power in the Germanic  MAY 1, 1785  body will unite with the Prussian Monarch against this accession of weight to the Austrian scale; Should this confederacy take place in its fullest extent, it will be very formidable, & in all likelyhood produce a bloody contest before the matter is finally decided. War therefore seems to be as probable as ever although the ground of the contest may be altered. For my own part I cannot clearly find out from any informations wch. I have had, what have been the views of the Court of France; they seem to have departed from their antient principles in assisting the Austrian family to increase their power; 'tis true they adopted this system in the last reign, but then the French Statesmen say, that nothing done during that period ought to be quoted from their history. If the Queen of France has drawn in the Ministry to countenance the measures of her brother it is an evidence of her great influence in the Governmt. but from what appears at present, it is no proof of the cridence of the public-councils as it is obvious if France keeps up large standing armies, she must neglect her marine by which she will risque her foreign possessions whenever she happens to be engaged in a war with G. B. The Parliament has so lately sit, that little has yet transpired; the Minister is to bring forwd. a plan for a Parliamentary reform, which it is thought will require all his interest & ability to support. The Wallachians who were so oppress'd as to be drove into a state of open resistance are on the point of being subjugated; they are in number about seven hundred thousand; & I heartily wish they were all here. Congress are engaged in ascertaining a mode for the disposal of the Western territory; I send you the first draught as reported by the Grand Commee. also a second edition with amendments in Congress.(3) The matter is still under consideration, and other alterations will no doubt take effect. An amendment is now before the house for making the Townships 6 Ms. Sqe. & for dividing those townships by actual surveys into quarters of townships, marking at every interval of a mile (in running the external lines of the quarters,) corners for the sections of 640 acres; Then to sell every other township by sections: The reservation (instead of the four corner sections,) to be the central section of every quarter; that is to say the inside lot, whose corner is not ascertained:(4) Whether this will be carried or not I cannot tell, the Eastern people being amazingly attached to their own customs, and unreasonably anxious to have every thing regulated according to their own pleasure. The construction of the deed of cession from Virga. has taken up four days, & at length it is agreed not to sell any land beween the little Miami & Scioto untill the conditions respecting the Offs. & soldiers are complied with.(5) Some Members of Congress think they have a right to have the land laid off for the Offs. & soldiers in such manner as they please & by their own Surveyors, provided they give good land   & square figures: others are willing it shall be laid off in the same manner as the rest, & the Offs. & soldiers to chuse by sections. If the State insists on the right of surveying agreable to their own laws I shd. suppose that Congress could have no objection to appointing Commrs. for deciding that question as well as all others that might arise respecting the Compact. Mr. King of Massachusets has a resolution ready drawn which he reserves till the Ordinance is passed for preventing slavery in the new State.(6) I expect Seven States may be found liberal enough to adopt it. Seven hundred men are voted for protecting the settlers on the frontiers, for guarding the public stores & for preventing unwarrantable intrusions on the lands of the U. S.(7) I inclose you a plan for altering the 9th article of the confeder- ation,(8) also a newspaper informing what the people of Boston are about.(9) The requisition for the present year is before Congress; one article to wit 30,000 dollars for fOEderal buildings at Trenton, I objected to, & was supported by the delegates of Maryland, Delawar, & New Hamshire. N. Carolina was divided. Unfortunately for me the rest of the delegates for our State do not think as I do; (This is entre nouz). I shall notwithstanding do every thing in my power to frustrate the measure. We shall in all probability get it struck out of the requisition, because nine States will not vote for it; I understand however that it is intended to get seven States to vote for the sum out of the loans in Holland supposing that as a hundred thousand dollars were voted at Trenton by nine States, generally, that seven can direct the particular appropriation. This matter I have not yet considered, neither do I know how it will turn out on investigation however I hope I shall find means to avoid it for the present year, & I hope by the next the Southern States will understand their interests better.(10) Congress have refused to let the State discount any part of the monies paid for the Western territory, out of the requisitions for the prest. year, & I believe if they don't help themselves, they will never find Congress willing to discount.(11) In the mean time they will sell the lands. A treaty is directed to be held with the Barbary States to purchase their friendship. Treaties are also to be held with the Cherokees, Chickesaws &c---;also, with the Western Indians shortly. I am sure you are surfeited---;therefore conclude with great sincerity, Yr. Affect. friend & Mo. Obed. Serv. Willm. Grayson ""

  My dear Sir New York 1st. May 1785 This is Sunday Evening, we have been adjourned since Friday. A Packet yesterday arrived from L'Orient in thirty days; the president in MAY 1, 1785  forms me that there is a joint Letter from the commissioners on the progress of their commission. I don't yet know the contents---;Tomorrow will possess me of it. From private Letters of authority, I fear little will be done with England, Spain, or the Emperor---;embarrassments as to place perplex at present---;there may be real difficulties, but they are as likely to be ostensibles. I find that the ideas of the commissioners touching the sum necessary to treat with the Barbary powers, are far more extensive than those entertained by Congress. Whether the sums in their power will be sufficient to begin the Treaty with, or whether they will do nothing until they state their sentiments to Congress, I cannot form an Opinion. I am inclined to suppose they will commence a negotiation---;the danger to the American ships from these Robbers is real, but for mercantile purposes magnified. The resolves of Boston have reached us, and the flame will communicate from state to state.(1) There is a report this Evening that a ship is comeing up the harbour, which has fled from Boston; if so I believe she will not better her condition. The Whig merchants will make opposition to the landing of her Goods. If this well founded uneasiness, is attended to by wise, and moderate men, in the several States, it may be improved to purposes the most beneficial, to our national Government, as well as to our national commerce. You understand me, without my adding. Too much precipitancy may injure us---;moderation & delay have ever served our true interest. A fresh proof of this sentiment, it gives me pleasure to mention to you; you remember the anxiety the Marquis discovered at Trenton concerning the demand made by his Court,(2) for satisfaction for a violation of national law in the affair at Philadelphia. We now have it in our power to conduct the business in a mode consistent with our own honor, & satisfactory to the other party. I cannot be particular---;the Delay of a decision has been very convenient. Mr. Lowell wrote me under date of the 25th of April, mentioning the intention of the Agents to come on about the 7th of this month. I conclude that they had not received my two last letters; I think I wrote you to the same purpose. No commission is yet made out---;the number of Judges is incomplete---;no supply can be made until you come on. No answer is yet returned from Mr. Wythe. In short there is no possibility of trying the cause in June. I think the business is in a good train---;but Doct. Johnson joins me in Opinion that the Trial must be postponed until the fall---;the Agents of New York are of this Opinion likewise.(3) I shall write again to Mr. Lowell to this purpose by this post---;pray see him and explain the situation.  By the bye, the Secretary has given me no Notice of my appointment as one of the Agents. I don't understand the reason. Should I choose to attend the trial, I have no authority. I observe by the papers that Dalton is not included in the list of Senators for Essex---;what is the reason? Did he decline? Your Letters I believe have all come to hand, but the badness of roads detained them long on their way---;their number I cannot ascertain now, Mr. Seymour is out with my keys, and I cannot come at my Letter files. I hope you will soon be with us---;indeed I earnestly wish you back; I should have a little respite was you here, as well as very great pleasure in your society. Never in my Life have I been so closely confined as since I have been in this City---;you know very well my situation---;constant watching fatigues the strongest & most experienced---;what must then be my condition? Our family are all well. Nelly wishes your return---;Mrs. M. & Grace request it as soon as you can consistently.

The principal design of this letter is, to introduce to you Mr. Graham, and his Lady the justly celebrated Mrs. Macaulay Graham,(3) whose reputation in the learned world and among the friends to the rights of human nature is very high indeed. Her merit as an Historian is very great, and places her as an Author in the foremost rank of writers. I am well pleased to find that she, as well as all other judicious foreigners, think themselves when in America, however distant from Mount Vernon, obliged to pay their respects to you. I believe that this has been her only motive for going so far South as Virginia. We are amused here with an account that does not indeed come officially to us, but however, in such a way as to merit attention. It is, a plan of the Emperor of Germany, which seems calculated to quiet his quarrel with Holland, altho perhaps it may not prevent a war in Europe. He is said to have made a treaty with the Elector of Bavaria, by which he exchanges his Netherland dominions for those of Bavaria, and transfers with the exchange, all his rights and claims upon Holland: reserving Namure and Luxembourg with a district of country around, as a douceur to France for obtaining the consent of that Court to the exchange. The Bavarian dominions being much more contiguous to the Austrian than those of the Netherlands, must greatly increase the Emperors power by a concentration of his force, heretofore so much divided, as to render the Netherlands of no great aid in case of war. This however, by increasing the Austrian power, must of course excite greatly the jealousy of Prussia in particular, whose King will propably risk a war rather than see his rival thus strengthened. Holland in the mean time will be relieved, by injurious claims being transferd from a strong to a weak land, and the Emperor may find himself brought to a more equal contest by combating one, instead of three powers lately combined against him. What may be the issue of the new System, time must develope. I wish that I may be enabled by Mr. Sitgreaves to furnish you with the final sense of Congress upon the momentous business of selling the western lands, in doing which, the first and greatest object seems to be, the discharging effectually the great weight of debt that the war has created, and which obstructs so effectually every arrangement for future security.

There have appeared so many interfering interests, most of them imaginary, so many ill founded jealousies & suspicions throughout the whole, that I am only surpris'd the Ordinance is not more exceptionable; indeed if the importunities of the public Creditors, & the reluctance to pay them by taxation & the direct or implied had not been so great I am satisfyed no land Ordinance could have been procured, except under such disadvantages as would in a great degree have excluded the idea of actual settlements within any short length of time; This is not strange when we reflect that several of the States are averse to new votes from that part of the Continent & that some of them are now disposing of their own vacant lands, & of course wish to have their particular debts paid & their own countries settled in the first instance before there is any interference from any other quarter. With respect to the different places of sale, it is certainly open to the objections you mention, but it was absolutely necessary to accede to the measure, before we could advance a single step. Since the receipt of your letter I have hinted to some of the members the propriety of altering this part, but find that the idea of allowing the Citizens of each State an equal chance of trying the good lands at their own doors, was one of the strongest reasons with them for consenting to the ordinance. As to the individual states interfering in the sale, it is guarded against; and in case the loan Officer who is responsible only to Congress cannot dispose of the land in a limited time, it is to be return'd to the Treasury board: With re- MAY 5, 1785  spect to the fractional parts of Townships the Ordinance has now provided for all cases which can occur, except with respect to the Pensylvania line---;The Course of the new State from the Ohio will be due North, and the dispute with Pensylvania will be open to discussion hereafter. I am sorry to observe that throughout this measure, there has been a necessity for sacrificing one's own opinion to that of other people for the purpose of getting forward. There has never been above ten States on the floor & nine of these were necessary to concur in one Sentiment, least they should refuse to vote for the Ordinance on it's passage. The price is fix'd at a dollar the acre liquidated certificates, that is the land is not to be sold under that; The reason for establishing this sum was that a part of the house were for half a dollar, and another part for two dollars & others for intermediate sums between the two extremes, so that ultimately this was agreed upon as a central ground. If it is too high (which I am afraid is the case) it may hereafter be corrected by a resolution. I still mean to move for some amendments which I think will not only advance the sale, but increase the facility of purchasing to foreigners, though from present appearances I own I have but little hopes of success. After this affair is over, the requisition for the current year will be brought forward. The article of 30,000 dollars for the erection of foederal buildings at Trenton I have already objected to, & shall continue to oppose by every means in my power, as I look upon the measure to be fundamentally wrong,(5) & I am in hopes nine States cannot be found to vote for it; should those in opposition to the measure be able to put off the execution for the present year it is to be expected that the Southern States will open their eyes to their true interests & view this subject in a different light. What I at present fear is, that failing to get this article allowed in the requisition they will attempt to draw the money from Holland by a vote of seven States inasmuch as a hundred thousand dollars were voted at Trenton for that purpose although no particular fund was assigned. I own this matter has giv'n me some disgust, as I see an intemperate ardor to carry it into execution before the sense of the Union is known; and I have no doubt that some gentlemen have come into Congress expressly for that purpose. I take the liberty of introducing Mr. StGreave (6) a delegate from North Carolina a gentleman of great worth who is travelling through our State to his own Country. He will he very happy to communicate to you the news of this place. I inclose you the report of a Comme. for altering the first paragraph of the 9th article of the confederation,(7) & which embraces objects of great magnitude, & about which there is a great difference of sentiment. I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Yr. Affect. frd. & Most Obed. sert., Willm. Grayson.  ""

  Dear Sir, New York, 5th May 1785. I have rec'd your kind & polite address you did me the honor to write the 13th ultimo. The Assembly of N.Y. are up without grantg the impost and I have no reason to think, that Congress being in this city, has had a tendency to obtain it or I might have said, that some of their members being here, has not been a means of forwarding a compliance. You signify a wish to be informed whither a commercial treaty between the U.S. & G.B. is likely to take place; I can only say that we have persons in Europe fully authorized to treat upon the subject, & that I think it most likely they are now at the court of London for that purpose; yet I have doubts whether such an event will take place at present. The late proceedings of the good people of Boston gives us some concern here,(1) least they may carry the matter too far, I wish they could be prevailed upon to wait 'till the several states shall have given Congress powers to counteract the British in their commercial plans; which you may be assured Congress would attend to immediately. MAY 5, 1785  An ordinance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of Lands in the western territory, has taken up much time in Congress of late & it yet remains uncertain when it will get through, but I believe it is the expectations of the members that it will be passed upon in a few days.

  Dear Sir New York May [5?]. 1785(1) Your favor of the 12th of April accompanied with the cypher I receiv'd yesterday.(2) The appointment of Mr. Adams to the Ct. of G. B. was soon afterwards succeeded by that of Mr. Jefferson to that of France. Their commissions have been some time since forwarded & before this they are no doubt station'd at their respective courts. The removal of the former gave uneasiness to Mr. V[a]n Berkell but as it was immediately resolv'd to appoint a successor, it hath probably abated. Govr. Livingston, Rutledge, & R. H. Harrison C. J. of Maryld. are in nomination.(3) {Great Britain}(4) is still possess'd of the {posts} [on] the {lakes nor have we reason to suppose she means to evacuate. Of this however Mr. Adams will inform us}. Our affairs with {Spain is suspended untill the arrival of Mr. Gardoqui. He is expected}. The affrs. of {Langchamp} hath not been acted on; for particular reasons it hath hitherto been deferr'd.(5) A recommendation hath been made to the States of Connecticut, N Yk., Jersey & Pena. to raise 700 men for the protection of the frontier settlements. It was question'd whether it were not better by requisition & upon the Union, since it might be the commencment of an establishmt. wh. might last for ages, & if the right of requisition existed, the effecting by other means might tend to weaken & ultimately destroy it. The delegation of Mass. at Annapolis protested agnst. this right & their state approv'd their conduct. But as the right of requisition existed only when exerted on the Union & it seem'd generally preferr'd to raise them from 3 or 4 of the States most conveniently situated, it was ultimately agreed to adopt the mode of recommendation.(6) An ordinance regulating the mode of survey & sale of the lands ceded by Virga hath lately engag'd the attention of Congress---;it hath not yet pass'd but as all the points of variance seem at length accomodated, it will perhaps in the course of the succeeding week. The original report admited of the sale only of tracts containing 30,000 acres call'd townships; this was adher'd to with great obstinacy by the E. men & as firmly oppos'd by the south- MAY 5, 1785  ern. At length however the Eastern partly [party?] gave up the point at least so far as to meet on middle ground. As it now stands it is to be surveyed in townships, containing abt. 26,000 acres each, each township mark'd on the plat into lots of one mile square, and 1/2 the country sold only in townships & the other in lots. 13 surveyors are to be appointed for the purpose to act under the controul of the Geographer, begining with the first range of townships upon the Ohio & running north to the lakes, from the termination of the line which forms the southern boundary of the State of Pena., & so on westwd. with each range. As soon as five ranges shall be survey'd the return will be made to the Bd. of Treasury, who are instructed to draw for them in the name of each State in the proportion of the requisition on each, & transmit its portion to the loan officer in each, for sale at publick vendue, provided it is, nor any part, sold for less than one dolr. specie or certificates the acre.(7) Thus stands the ordinance at present.(8) Sometime since a treaty was order'd to be held with the Indians in the southern department, to wh. commission Mr. Hawkins of No. Carolina, Joseph Martin of Virga. & some others were appointed.(9) A treaty is also to be held with the Indians westward at post St. Vincents or somewhere on the Wabash or Missisippi for the purpose of extinguishing the claims to soil of the tribes who inhabit in that direction. The late comrs. are continued in the appointment.(10) The interest on the loans in Holland for the last year we understand is paid but not on those of France, by the completion of a loan order'd to be effected before the peace. No new loan is orderd nor will there be as I conceive. A requisition is before Congress for money for the payment of the interest on the domestic debt to the 31 of Decr. 1784 & on the foreign to the 31 of 85 amounting to 3,000,000 of dolrs., inclusive of the current expences of Government; the monies to be applied to the payment of the interest on the foreign debt & the expences of govt. amounting to abt. 1,000,000 of dolrs. to be recd. in specie only & the application to the interest on the domestic debt in certificates under the modification of the late requisition being abt. 2 thirds. I am strongly enclin'd to believe the western lands will absorb all the domestic debt Eastwd.; the gentn. from that quarter think so. I am also fully persuaded that when the accts. of Virga. & No. Carolina shall be liquidated the amount will be greater than is expected here. The delay in this business from the negligence of Mr. L. Wood prevents the operation of these requisitions having relation to us, & when these accts. shall be liquidated most probably ours will comprehend the greatest part of the domestic debt. No doubt we shall be paid but we had better go on pari passu with our neighbours. To expedite the business we lately obtain'd the addition of a 2d comr. to the State for the purpose.(11) They are, each to act in a district. We have had returns from but few of the States changing the 8th article of the confideration; several have already adopted it. The requisition is on the princi-  ple, in that respect, of the late one. A report sometime since pass'd Congress for appointing a committee to wait on the legislatures of R. I., New Yk. & Georgia to advise the immediate passage of the impost, but hath never been taken up.(12) R.I. hath adopted it, with a seperate credit, for sums beyond her quota, & the appointment of her own officers. N. York hath had it before her legislature this winter & negativ'd it. I believe a bill hath been publish'd for inspection of the people in Massachusetts wh. had the objects you mention in view but that it hath not pass'd as yet into a law. Of this however in my next I will inform you. Yr. friend & servant, Jas Monroe ""

  Dear Sir, New York May 7th. 1785 This will be delivered to you by the honorable Mr. Sitgreaves a very worthy delegate to Congress from N. Carolina;(1) who has been long detained by his desire to see the Land Ordinance passed, but he is obliged at last to quit us before it is finally so. The reasons he can give you. I had some time ago written a letter for you in answer to your last favor & kept it to go by this Gentleman, whose detention has been so long as to render a new letter more fit. I have now the honor to enclose you the Ordinance above attended to, which meets the assent of nine States & every member of these Nine States, except one Man, who keeps the Ordinance from passing by the joint causes, as he alleges, of indisposition & dislike.(2) I incline to think, however, that it will pass in the form you now receive it, with very little alteration, if any. I think there is no doubt of the agreement having been made for change of dominions between the Elector of Bavaria & the Emperor as mentioned in my last, yet, altho we have letters from our Ministers in Europe of the 9th of February,(3) we are yet in the dark upon the question whether there will be war between the Emperor & the Dutch, or whether it will settle finally between the former & the King of Prussia.

  Dear Gerry, New York 8th. May [17]85 I this morning received yours of the 28th of April which is the ninth since you left us.(1) Mr. Graham & Lady are yet here, and attended to in a manner that will be very agreeable to all their friends. I have not been out, as usual on Sundays, but will deliver your Letter in the morning. A subscription paper was handed into Congress for the printing of Mrs. Grahams works,(2) the president and ten or twelve members subscribed. We are not yet through the Land Ordinance, it has consumed a great deal of time, but I think will have a third reading and pass this week. I will send you a copy as soon as it passes. I am pursuaded great benefits will result from it---;you will find that it bears strong features of an eastern System. When I tell you the History of this Ordinance you shall acknowledge that I have some merit in the business. As soon as this affair is over, we shall pass the Requisition if states sufficient are in Congress. We have Letters from the Commissioners in Europe but nothing new---;ministerial correspondencies &c &c containing many compliments, and little sincerity. I intend writing to or rather for the Legislature next post. I observe in some of the eastern papers that it is affirmed that congress have established a plan regulating the Duties of Consuls &c---;pray where  MAY 8, 1785  does that information come from---;nothing of that kind has been transacted since your departure---;and what is very singular nothing is said on the subject by Doct. Franklin. We have a Letter from Mr. Wythe in answer to a Letter sent since your being in Boston, wherein he expressly declines coming northward to attend the federal Court. New York are now concluded and easy. We must go in the fall to Williamsburgh. Rutledge has given no answer, Grayson and Harrison have declined---;if you and one of the Agents, or the Two agents, will agree on two Gentlemen from our List, to supply the places of Rutledge & Grayson, and make & sign a proper certificate thereof which we may sign here and present to Congress---;we may complete the Number of commissioners without the trouble of the Agents making a special Journey for that purpose. You may make & sign a blank certificate for to be filled up here, by agreement with the N York Agents, with some person to supply the place of Harrison---;in this case you would advise us of such persons as would be agreeable to you, and from those named, undoubtedly we may agree with the N York agents on one. It will be necessary in this mode of supplying the vacancies to send on the original agreement if the same is found. Sitgreaves goes home tomorrow, Williamsons time expires this week, and Spaight has been confined to his Room for six weeks with a scorbutic complaint. Jersey have been absent these ten days, so that I have had no opportunity to laugh at Steward.(3) Delaware are absent---;Houston only from Georgia, and Doctr. Johnson gone home to bring his Colleague---;or perhaps to receive the right reverend Bishop Seabury who is daily expected in Connecticut.(4) I am very much dissatisfied with the appointment of this Bishop. I never wished to see the lawn sleeves in America---;this Bishop may be the channel of improper information to his spiritual head the King of England. I never liked the Hierarchy of the Church---;an equality in the teachers of Religion, and a dependance on the people, is an republican sentiment---;but if the C[l]ergy combine---;they will have their influence on Government. Adieu your real friend, R King [P.S.] Pray communicate to Lowell what concerns the federal Court, as I can not write him by this Post, but will rely on your giving the information. P.S.

  Dear Sir, New York 8th May 1785. When Congress accepted the cession of western Territory from Virginia, they engaged to reimburse Virginia the amount of her expences in protecting the lands ceded during the late war. A commissioner is to be appointed by Congress, another by Virginia, and a third by the two first, who, or a major part of whom, are to ascertain the sums to be reimbursed as aforesaid.(1) If your engagements are such, as would permit your acceptance of the appointment under Congress, it would give great satisfaction to a number of your friends, and remove an apprehension that at present obtains, that the United States are in danger of being charged with a very enormous sum to defray the expences of Genl. Clark's expedition against the Kaskaskeis. It may require three months or more, to execute the business---;the salary is at the rate of 1500 Dollars the year, and authority to employ as many clerks as may be necessary, at 500 Dols the year---;the pecuniary considerations I am sensible cannot be an inducement, but the opportunity of essentially serving the United States will be a powerful motive. If you can consistently accept this appointment I should thank you to know it: I think Congress will know the interests of their constituents too well not to elect if you can serve.(2) The Lands ordinance is not yet through. We have been obliged so far to give up the Plan of Townships, as to admit the sale of one half of the Townships in lots of a mile square. I will inclose you the ordinance so soon as it passes---;which I hope will be the case in two or three Days. With great respect your obedient Servt. Rufus King ""

The notice you have been pleased to take, respecting my late indisposition lays me under renewed obligations. I have done myself the honor of communicating your compliments to the Ladies of our family & you having left it with me to make use of such language as I thought most proper, therefore, I choose the impressions of your address, perceiving they exceled in kindness as well as politeness. The late proceedings of the good people of Boston has given us some concern here, least they might carry the matter too far.(2) However, I trust they will be prevailed upon to wait 'till Government can take proper measures to counteract the British in their commercial plans, or compleat a treaty with them. No answer has yet been given to the demand I conclude you have reference to; but I understand it was largely debated, while I was confined at home & produced only a commitment. I hope the Gentlemen appointed to manage the dispute with New York will not set out at present, as I see no prospect that the cause can be tried 'till September; Mr. Wythe has declined attending unless the court is held at Williamsburgh but requests to be excused, so that I now conclude that the agents of N.Y. must consent to attend there. The ordinance for disposing of the western territory has taken up much time in Congress, & we have some expectation of its passing this day, but Congress are greatly embarrassed, there being only nine states representd, when all the members attend, & Messrs Spaight & Howell are indisposed. The proposed requisitions upon the states are not yet passed upon & many other important matters, so that the prospect of a recess of Congress this summer I think is not so great as when you left us. As to family affairs Colo. Cook has left us, Genl. Webb has your late apartment, Mrs. Duykings has the chamber opposite my apartment, and I expect some other changes may take place, in a short time. Mrs. Cary is with us, & makes a good addition to the circle of Ladies who are still as agreeable as ever, & for your polite compliments, wish to return you the like salute.

He had delivered to the United States in Congress assembled the petition which he brought from the Settlers on the Northwest of the Ohio, I was not in Town when he delivered it but understand that it was read and no further Notice taken of it.(2) From which circumstance I ventured to give the bearer my Opinion that it would be in vain for him to wait and spend his time and money in expectation of any favourable Answer. Congress have on sundry Occasions testified their disapprobation of such intrusions, and have issued proclamations against them. It cannot therefore be supposed that they will do any thing to countenance an Act which they have warned people not to commit. They have taken & are still taking measures to purchase the Indian claims to that Country, and when they have extinguished the Indian Claims, they will then I doubt not fix the terms on which the lands may be bought and settled. But till that is done no person ought to presume to settle on the lands.

The time is arrived that I might have reasonably expected to have returned, & been able to have made you my personal respects; but fortune seems to have determined that it must be otherwise, for to leave the state unrepresented when so many important matters are &c pending before Congress, could not be justifyed. I have lately (in a formal manner) been made acquainted with the proceedings of the good people of Boston, respecting their commer MAY 16, 1785  cial affairs, and I find that what I predicted to many of the merchants a year ago is coming to pass;(2) for where the imports of a country are greater than their exports, the balance of trade must be against them, & the circulating specie must of course be carryed away, & the people become poor, so far as the wealth of a country depends upon commerce. I am sensible the people have just reason to complain of the conduct of the British; but that is an old story for we have been complaining of them for more than 20 years past, and the same policy seems yet to govern their public councils, for 'tho' they could not subjugate us by arms, they endeavor to distress our trade in ordr. to prevent our becoming a great & wealthy nation; I consider this as mistaken policy, & only fit for little minds, for America will with the blessing of heaven become great & powerfull notwithstanding all the British can do; & I have no doubt but in time, they will be convinced, that it is both for their interest & policy to be closely connected with us.

  Sir, New York May 16th. 1785. I thank you for your obliging congratulation on my appointment to the Chair of Congress, and I do with particular pleasure return my congratulation on your sole appointment as Minister of the United States to so eminently respectable a Court as that of his most Christian Majesty. My ill state of health, added to the business and the ceremonies of my Office, has hitherto prevented me from paying my respects to you, which certainly would have been the case if the former of these circumstances had not principally prevented me. Altho' my health is now better, yet I am very far from being well. I can judge how anxious you must be for minute information of public proceedings in the United States, and of such other matters as your letter imports a desire to be acquainted with. But unfortunately all letters are inspected, and thus the impertinent eye of curiosity may be gratified with such communications as were intended only for you, and which  MAY 16, 1785  wicked selfishness may make a bad use of. This imposes great restraint, which will remain until Congress shall establish a system of Packets and Couriers of their own. How detestable is this dishonorable mode of obtaining intelligence---;the virtue of Lord Falkland, when Secretary of State, would never suffer him to obtain information by such nefarious means. The appointment of Mr. Adams to the Court of London will probably draw out quickly the sense of Great Britain upon the points in dispute with them---;and the Authority given by Congress to treat with the Piratical States will, I hope, accommodate all differences with them, and give future security to our Commerce with the South of Europe. I am much obliged to you for the pamphlet.(1) I think it is greatly to be regretted, that the avaricious, monopolizing Spirit of Commerce and Commercial Men, should be suffered to interrupt that diffusion of benefits, and communication between the human species in different parts of the world, which would probably take place if trade were put upon more liberal principles and less shackled than it is. The first attempt made by these States for the trade of the East Indies was from this City. A Ship has gone to, and returned from Canton in fourteen months with a valuable Cargo, and met with the most friendly treatment from the Chinese.(2) Other Vessels are gone and soon expected back. The great Object with the United States now is to dispose speedily of the western lands for the discharge of public debt, and a way for this is opened by treaties already made, and making with the Indians. Coinage, requisition, and Post Office are also objects of great moment and subjects of discussion---;effectual measures are taking by the Assemblies of Virginia and Maryland---;and by the former alone, for opening the navigation between the Potomac and James Rivers with the western waters. Laws with suspending clauses have passed in Virginia for establishing a single Port on each river and for circuit Courts---;a general assessment for religion is also a subject of much discussion with us.

 Richard Dobbs Spaight to John Francis Mercer Dear Mercer, New York 16th May 1785. You no doubt are surprised at my long silence, unless my friends Hardy & Monroe have acquainted you with my indisposition; Indeed my friend I have been sorely afflicted and at no time of my life have I suffered so much by Sickness. Tomorrow will be seven weeks since I was attacked with an inflamation in my left Eye and it is only within this week past that I have been able to make use of the right eye either to read or write, as to the left I have little or no Sight with it, and am fearfull I shall never recover it fully; if so I must charge it to the improper treatment of the two Doctors that first attended me; this you'l say is but poor satisfaction for an Eye. I have been making enquiries about you; but can hear nothing of you, tho' unable to write myself I expected to have heard from you. Not having been in Congress since the 29th March I can give you no Acct. of that body, only, that they have done little or no business, and there are so few States represented at present that they can do none.

  Dear Gerry New York 19th May 1785 Mr. Lowell, Sullivan & Parsons arrived here yesterday. The Negotiation will commence soon, for filling up the federal Court.(1) I am disappointed in your not coming on with these Gentlemen. We shall want your good assistance in this business; and I am anxious for your society in Congress. We have no public information whatever. A very great uneasiness is discoverable among the merchants & traders generally through the States, from the disordered condition of Commerce. What can be done? Eight states only have complied with the recommendation of last year for granting to Congress power to prohibit certain importations & exportations. Nothing therefore from this quarter can be expected at present---;indeed it may be questionable, whether if all the States had complied, the power granted which is only to prohibit, and not to regulate, certain courses of Trade, can give a remedy to the Difficulties which threaten fatal mischiefs to our commerce. Pray examine the recommendation to the states by Congress last year. Suppose a complete compliance on the part of the several states. Could Congress proceed to regulate the foreign trade carried on in this country by imposing Duties? The situation of the impost laws you know---;the unprosperous condition of commerce you must have entire information concerning---;the disposition of Congress you cannot be a Stranger to. What can be done? Repeted recommendations on the same Subject will produce consequences unfavorable to the measures of the Union; and the Delays in compliance will be ruinous?

  Sir New York. 21st May 1785. I have seen and perused the Letter, you addressed to Majr. Adams Yesterday; and altho I cannot Identify any, nor with precision Certify as to the amount of the Expences, the Major has incurred while acting as Deputy Comy. of Prisoners at the Post of Eliz, and which your letter  MAY 21, 1785  seem to require; Yet I conceive, My Duty obliges me to declare generally as to his Situation so far as my Information Extends.(1) During the Year 79 and part of 80, while I was at the Head of the Department; This post being established by the Comr. in Chief as the only Communication with New York, the Nature of my office often demanded my being present there, both in the Exchange of Prisoners & for the Purpose of holding Conferences with the British Comy on that subject: At these times I have always observed, and I believe some times remarked to the Major, the great Expence that Post subjected him to, not only in the Common Civilities necessarily due to Prisoners, (as well British as American) but in his Actual Charitable distribution of provisions among them: And what Contributed greatly to heighten this Expence was; its being a Post, only occasionally occupied by our Troops & of Course seldom any Rations Issued; And from its Vicinity to New York, the provisions to be purchased were extravagantly dear & only to be procured with Specie. The Finances of the United States, not admitting any disbursements at that time in Specie to My Deputies (as but a scanty pittance could only be obtained for the Prisoners in Actual Confinement) I was led to Enquire from whence these Supplies came, and learned with pain, that the Majr. was dependent on his Friends for them. In Justice to the Merits and sufferings of this Gentleman, I am sorry I cannot be more particular, but I am Confident in declaring, that he always discharged his Duty in the office, with great punctuality & Fidelity & that I verily beleive his present Embarrasments in a great Measure arise, from the sums of Money he was Necessitated to borrow, while Acting as Depy.

  Sr. New York 27th. May 1785. We now at length inclose yr. Excelly Copy of the Ordinance for the disposition of the Western Territory(1) not such as we could have wish'd & long hoped it would have been, but such as after the utmost efforts of publick argument & private solicitation it could alone be. Opinions were so unaltarably fix'd upon the one extreme & the other that nothing could have pass'd but by mutual Concession & Composition. The Necessity there was for doing something upon a subject of so much importance to the Interest of the United States, will we hope Apolo- MAY 27, 1785  gize for our consenting to a mode of disposition which we could not perfectly approve. We hope however it will answer the end to begin with at least & if inconveniencies shall arise upon Experement it will be in the Power of a future Congress to remedy them before they can have very extensively fatal effects. The Geographer of the U.S. Mr. Hutchins will be directed to enter upon the Survey as soon as possible, in Order to this you see a Surveyor to Act under his direction is to be Appointed from each, State,(2) for the purpose not only of an Accurate survey, but of diffusing as generally as possible thro' the States a knowledge of the Nature & Quality of the Country so that the Citizens in general may be enabled to make their Purchases with Judgment & Discretion. The Gentn. to be appointed sho'd therefore not only be well skilled in the Art of Surveying but possess Talents for Observation & discovery so that at his return he may be able to give his Countrymen a full & faithful Idea of the Country & prevent their being imposed upon by the representations of Artful, interested & designing Men. It do's not occur to us who among us thus Qualified we can Nominate that will probably undertake & be soon ready to enter upon this business, & it is of much importance that there sho'd be no disappointment in this regard by a declining of the Appointment after it is made. We therefore beg yr. Excelly to point out to us as soon as possible a Gentn. who will undertake this important & arduous trust. An early day is Assigned for the Election of them & several States have already made their Nominations. The Requisition, tho' it has been several times discuss'd, is not yet completed. The Recommendation relative to the Trade of the U.S. will we apprehend be taken up in a few days. Several other very important matters are under consideration. The Envoy of Spain Mr. Gardoquoie is expected to arrive here in a few Days from Philada. when a Negotiation will commence upon the important subject of the Missisippi Navigation & other consequential Topicks. As we see little Prospect that Congress can soon rise, & still less of our being relieved by the Attendance of any other Gentn. in our room, we beg leave to mention to you that our Finances are already at a very low Ebb & will very soon be totally exhausted, And to entreat yr. Excelly if it be wished that we sho'd continue here that farther provision may be made for us. We cannot yet obtain a report of the Committee upon the Connecticut Cession.(3) The subject has been much Debated, & the Commee. so often changed that no less than nine Gentn. have already sat upon it. That point which labours most at present is an Idea that the Virginia N.W. line will include a great part, if not the whole even of the 120 M reserved by Connecticut, that Virginia having Ceded to the U.S all to the N.W of the Ohio, Congress will consequently by accepting the Cession of Connect. under the reservation in fact give to Conn   that 120 M. instead of receiving anything from her. This Constructn. of the Virginia Patent is in our Opinion clearly unfounded & untenable, but it is difficult to eradicate preconceiv'd Opinions, especially on the side of Interest. Mean time some part at least of the reserved 120 Acres(4) is within the Territory now proposed to be surveyed & sold under the Ordinance tho' as we conceive not affected by it.

  Dear Gerry, New York 27th May 1785 This accompanies the land ordinance which hath at length obtained its passage through Congress(1)---;I hope it will meet your approbation. We are now occupied by the business of a requisition for monies. The Recommendation of the 27th of April 1784 is the source of great embarrassment---;Congress thereby declare that they will not call for farther monies until the States have all paid up former deficiencies, and they engage to credit advances over the Moiety of the eight Millions of Dollars in the next Requisition.(2) South Carolina by management with Mr. Morris have obtained a credit for specific supplies equal to their quota of the Eight millions of Dollars, and now contend that as they have obtained a credit on their quota of Eight millions equal to the whole amount thereof, the present demand on the States being for the remaining moiety of the Eight Millions, they ought not to be called on for any part of the Sum necessary for the current year. The recommendation of last year, which is a very complex affair, also states that before the residue of the Eight and two Millions of Dollars not thereby called for should be required, Congress would revise the rule of apportionment, and make it conformable to Justice upon the best evidence in their power at the Time. S. Carolina in the Apportionment of the Eight Millions stands at the same sum as New Hampshire. Revise the Rule & conform it to justice, and South Carolina will stand at a larger Sum and other States at a less. This is what I contend for, and if it succeeds we shall bring in S. Carolina. Indeed it may be questionable whether we ought not to reconsider the recommendation of last year on this Subject---;to enjoin it upon the states to comply with the expectations of congress in paying a moiety of the quotas of the Eight Millions last year required; and make a new Requisition for the monies necessary for the present year, without referrence to former acquisitions. MAY 27, 1785  It will be the occasion of confusion and intricacy, if every new requisition upon the States for money is to operate as a ballance Bill to all preceding demands.

I inclose you a copy of the Ordinance:(2) & if it is not the best in the world, it is I am confident the best that could be procured for the present. There was such a variety of interests most of them imaginary, that I am only surprised it is not more defective. The Eastern people who before the revolution never had an idea of any quantity of Earth above a hundred acres, were for selling in large tracts of 30,000 acres while the Southern people who formerly could scarce bring their imaginations down so low as to comprehended the meaning of a hundred Acres of ground were for selling the whole territory in lots of a mile square. In this situation we remained for eight days, with great obstinacy on both sides, untill a kind of compromise took effect.(3) As to foreign news we are entirely uninformed: neither can [any] body here say with certainty what will be the event of the present hostile preparations in Europe. I imagine you have heard of the arrival of an American vessel at this place in four months from Canton in China laden with the commodities of that country. It seems our Countrymen were treated with as much respect as the Subjects of any other nation: i.e. the whole are looked upon by the Chinese as Barbarians: & they have too much Asiactic hauteur to descend to any discrimination.

  Dear Sir, New York May the 28th. 1785 I had the honor of writing to you by Colo. Smith, which letter I doubt not but that you have, or will in due time, safely receive.(1) My hopes are great, that your wisdom, and the good sense of the British Administration, will extinguish the mischievous discord that has been so artfully and industriously fomented by the enemies of both countries to the essential injury of both, and in violation of the best principles of humanity. A set of acrimonious disappointed people, who meaning the gratification of their own malice and self interest, are poisoning the minds of men with plausibilities, and theoretic reasonings, that are opposed to the true state of things; and whose counsels if pursued, will tend only to plant dissention and distress, where mutual good & common happiness should be cultivated, and will flourish. The enclosed ordinance will shew you the measures that we are taking to dispose of western lands for the extinguishment of the public debt. It seems probable that this will have very powerful operation in effecting the end designed by the System. For the country is fine beyond description, both in soil and climate---;Abounding with all those primary and essential materials for human industry to work upon, in order to produce the comfort and happiness of mankind. Don Diego de Gardoque has just announced to me his arrival at Philadelphia in quality of Plenopotentiary from his Catholic Majesty,  MAY 28, 1785  & that he will pay his respects in a few days.(2) The enterprise of America is well marked by the successful voyage made by a ship from this port, that has returned after a voyage of 14 months from Canton in China with a valuable eastern Cargo. Our people met with great civility from the Chinese. And the Europeans at Canton, altho civil to the stripes, were not a little surprised to see them there so soon, and at the celerity with which their voyages were effected. The gentleman who writes the letter, of which the enclosed is a copy, is a near relation of mine by marriage, and my Godson also.(3) Added to this, I am his friend because of his real worth and deserts. He is the youngest son but one of a numerous family. Possessing talents, industry, and enterprise, he determined very early to shake off that indolence too common with youths of his rank in Virginia. In quest of fortune, after having finished his education, he went 15 years ago to Sea, and pursued his system to the East Indies some years before the late war commenced, and he remained in the East engaged with the country trade there. His letter will inform you of his misfortunes, of his present situation, and his future views. My acquaintance has ceased with all who might have promoted his interest in the East Indies. Under these circumstances I venture to beg the favor of you to assist him to the utmost of your power in the way of procuring for him the appointment that he desires in the Company's service. I know that it has not been uncommon in England for foreign Ministers to interest themselves in favor of Individuals, by which means the latter have been essentially served. I am sure that you will in this case oblige a worthy able man, and, a greatful mind. That your friend, the writer of this letter, requests this favor of you, will I am very sure be a motive of strong inducement with you to exert yourself. The letter that I have enclosed for him under your cover be so kind as to get forwarded by some of the India Ships bound to, or near to Calcutta. It may go with any letter in his favor that you are so good as to procure for him. It seems probable, at present, that Congress will not adjourn this year---;if they should, it will not be sooner than the middle of August. Your letters for me will be in a good way when they are deliverd to the care of Messrs. Wallace, Johnson & Muir Merchants in London.

  Sir New York May 29th, 1785. We have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency copies of the late Indian treaties as also sundry resolutions of Congress for entering into a treaty with the Cherokees and all the other Indians southward of them within the limits of the United States for the purpose of making peace with them and receiving them into favour and protection and removing all causes of future contention quarrels(1)---;and at the same time enclose the ordinance opening a land office in the several states which passed the 23d instant(2) by the unanimous voice of all the States present---;and we flatter ourselves is so adjusted as to give satisfaction to the State we have the honor to represent and at the same time we have the most confident expectations that in its operation it will considerably diminish the domestic debt by absorbing a great number of the public securities. The general opinion of the goodness of the soil in this western country & of the happy temperature of the climate, has been increasing with every new investigation of it, and we think it beyond a doubt that many of the creditors of the United States in the middle and southern parts of the Union have fixed their attention to this as a fund from which they shall soon be able to pay themselves. We submit it to the citizens of New Hampshire whether associations may not be formed for the purchase of townships in this territory for future settlements or dispositions with advantag the distance notwithstanding. It was the inclination of the eastern states in conformity to the usual mode of locating lands in that part of the country by townships---;to have adhered to that method throughout the whole country to be disposed of by the ordinance but as a different method had always been adopted to the southward---;it became necessary to agree to alternate by lots and townships on the principle of compromise. The design of a surveyor from each State was that by going into the country they might be able to communicate information to the state for which they were appointed of the quality of the lands, and such other circumstances as may direct the citizens in making their purchases. We have nominated Mr Nathaniel Adams of Portsmouth as a surveyor who is unanimously chosen, we wish he may accept his appointment,(3) but should he decline we ask the attention of the legislature to this subject---;and that they would send forward some suitable person who would undertake the business and we doubt not his im- MAY 29, 1785  mediate appointment---;there is a committee who we expect will report (tomorrow) a sum to be advanced to the several officers and men who are to proceed on this business.(4) The estimate and requisition in the several states for the current year is reported by a committee and is now before Congress we hope it will soon be passed but are afraid from the opposition we expect some parts of it will meet with in Congress that it will not be sent out soon enough to find our court in session. When that is finished we shall think it our duty as one of the foremost of other things to call up a report of a committee on old paper money and get it adjusted in such a manner as a resolution may be had thereon. By a letter from Don Diego De Gardoqui from Philadelphia we are informed of the arrival of that gentleman in that city, but in what character he is appointed by his catholic Majesty to the United States we at present are not able to inform you as his credentials have not been laid before congress. With the greatest reluctance we beg leave to inform your Excellency of our immediate want of money to defray our expences here---;we have been borrowing of our friends for about two months---;hope an opportunity will present whereby we may soon get a sufficient supply.

Similar proceedings are in examination touching the Department of the commissary of military Stores.(1) Since the Secretary at war is expressly charged with the care of the last mentioned Department, I can see no reason for keeping it up separately.

It is proposed to have a treaty on the Wabash to obtain a cession of indian Claims to the Lands between the Ohio and the Mississippi southerly. Would it not be preferable to try the sale of the lands already obtained before we purchase farther? Will not the indian claims prevent imigrants on the western side of the Ohio?

  Dear Sir New York May the 30th 1785 Two days ago, and not sooner, your favor of March the 20th(1) was deliverd to me, so that you find it has been more than two months travelling thus far. It seems to me that our Assembly were influenced more by the letter than the spirit of the Confederation. The consequence will certainly be, if our meetings are slow as usual, that Virginia will be unrepresented for some time after the federal year commences.(2) Tho no great mischief arises from this, the appearance is not so handsome as it should be; besides that it partakes too much of that too common inattention to the great Council of the U. S. upon the wise conduct of which so much depends. I am very happy to see by the Newspapers that the business of opening Potomac goes on so well. Tis certainly an object of great consequence to extend our internal navigation. Concerning James river I have heard nothing.(3) When I was in our Assembly it appeard to me rather to be the wish, than otherwise, that Kentucky should apply for separation---;And I should suppose that if, when they found themselves compitent to the business of Self Government, they properly applied to our Assembly, no good objection could be made to a separation---;For they have, & will remain for a long time, if not always, more expence than profit to the rest of the country.(4) Washington County seems to be stimulated by a troublesome person who for self aggrandisement appears willg. to dismember that part also, & join with the Revolters from N. Carolina. This last seems to merit the wise & firm attention of Government & the Legislature.(5) We have, after much debate indeed, & great waste of time, at last pass'd an Ordinance for disposing of such part of the Lands N. W of the Ohio as belongs to the U. S. & have been purchased of the Indians. If this proves agreeable to the public, it will extinguish about 10 Millions of the pub debt. And the remaining lands, going southward to the Mississippi, will nearly discharge all the domestic debt---;Besides the probable prospect that  MAY 30, 1785  we have of considerable cessions from N & S. Carolina & Georgia. This Source does indeed deserve our warmest cultivation as it seems to be almost the only one that we have for discharging our oppressive debt. Dr. Franklin has leave to retire, Mr. Jefferson remains in France---;And Mr. J. Adams is sent to London. If the Court of this last country is sincere, we may expect an amicable & easy settlement of existing differences between us. The Minister (Mr. Pitt) does appear willing to be liberal in Commercial regulations, but the avaricious spirit of Commerce that is so great every where, but which in England has ever been excessive, opposes his views---;And so we find it is in France, for the Marquis de La Fayette writes that the advantages already granted us are most violently exclaimed against by the Trading people of the Kingdom.(6) Mr Gardoque (who calls himself Plenepotentiary Charged with Affairs is arrived at Phila. and we expect him soon here(7)---;So that we shall quickly know whether he can or will do any thing conclusive concerning the Navigation of Mississippi. He reports a great scarcity of provisions at the Havannah, but yet we dont hear of the ports of that Island being opened to us for supply. It is reported that the frigate which brought him is taking in flower. The American enterprise has been well markt by a short and successful Voyage made from hence to Canton in China. The Chinese were kind to our people and glad to see a new Source of Commerce opened to them from a New People, as they called us. The Europeans there were civil but astonished at the rapidity of our movements, especially the English. I fear that our Countrymen will overdo this business---;For now there appears every where a Rage for East India Voyages. So that the variety of means may defeat the Attainment of the concurrent end---;A regulated & useful commerce with that part of the World. It seems very questionable now whether Congress will adjourn or not this Year---;if they do, it will not be until late in August. Inattention, Sickness, and a variety of causes occasion business to go on very slowly. I(8) ""

  Dear Sir ClerMount 1st June 1785 I am now to express my obligations to you for your favors of Feby & March Last. I delayed answering them in hopes of being able to give you some information relative to our monied arrangements a subject which has been under consideration in Congress for many months without any thing effectual having been yet concluded. The fact is that they have but few resourses independent of the will of the separate State[s] & as these can seldom agree in measures to which they are not compelled by necessity scarse any thing that can be recommended will be adopted till some present or approaching calamity evinces their feelings. The imposts laid by particular states have been extreamly productive, had the general system been established it would have rendered it easy to fund our debt which is all that ought to be wished in our present situation. I have reason to think that had it not been for the mistaken policy of New York, which rejected them, the recommendations of Congress on this subject would have been complied with in a few months even by Rhode Island. I am not without hope many of the members of the late legislature having been since changed & the general sense of the people being for vesting the duties in Congress that the next session will produce an alteration in their measures. In the meanwhile Congress have been using means to lessen their debt by opening their Land office for paper at one dollar an acre. What the effect of this will be I cannot say tho' I must own that I am much less sanguine as to the sums it will instantly absorb than many others---;but I have no doubt that with proper management it may be rendered a certain & effectual sinking fund. I thank you for your congratulations on my resuming a seat in Congress. This I was only led to do with a view to the controversy that is now on foot between us & Massachusets which is of the last importance to our State as their claim includes by much the greater part of it & with the then distant hope of Rendering New York the place of residence for Congress. The last has been happily effected as you have heard & the first is in a fair way of being brought to a conclusion by the appointment of a court for the purpose of determining the claim. To the variety of other interesting objects that have taken up the time of Congress I have been able to give very little attention, the business of my office(1) leaving me no leisure for any other. I am very sorrey to learn from yr Letters the indisposition of Mr. Jefferson since shd. he resign I am persuaded that it would be long before we should agree in the choice of a person equally qualified for this Station he holds. Nothing can be more flattering than what you say to me upon that subject since it be- JUNE 1, 1785  trays a partiality that I consider as the strong proof of friendship but I have little thoughts of going abroad in any character. I have already been nominated for Spain & at my particular request withdrawn. I was against my consent opposed to Mr. Adams & Mr. Rudledge for England. Happily Mr. Adams's interest prevailed & saved me the pain of refusing an honor which I knew to be above my [merit?]. I have since had the offer from almost all the states in Congress to replace him at the Hague which I have peremptorily refused tho I might I believe have been unanimously appointed. The contest now lays between Govr. Livingston & Mr. Rutledge. The first of these I am confident will not accept should he be elected. I mention these circumstances to give you some Idea of our present politics & to justify your partiality (which stands in need of some appology) by the example of others. But more particularly to give you a favourable Idea of this country by shewing how hard it is to find men who are willing to quit it---;tho' a foreign war might save our commerce. I rejoice for the sake of humanity that the Emperor is like to recede from his demands tho the interest I take in his character makes me lament that he should a second time have entered easily into measures which he wanted force or firmness to support & tho' it might not be very courtly it could at least be friendly to repeat to him a line from Shakspear---; Beware the entrance of a quarrel, but when your in Then bear it bravely that men may fear thee(2) The pleasure I take in writing to you makes me careless of intruding upon your patience but once I have intered upon a new page I will get to the bottom of it by telling you of what I am sure will give you pleasure as it adds to our national importance. That the general sence of the States runs violently for giving to Congress an unlimmited right to restrict trade & turn it into what channel they think proper. Most of them have already passed laws for that purpose & on the first meeting of the respective Legislatures it is expected that all will do it. I hope that such use will be made of this power as to render our commerce as serviceble to our friends as it has hitherto been to our enemies. Mrs. Livingstons & my Mothers family conceive themselves much honoured by your polite remembrance & desire me to return you with their comps. their sincerest wishes for your happiness---;how much my own correspond with theirs upon this occasion you are too well assured of my inviolable attachment to need being told.

Anderson's appointment under the State of Virginia;(1) there is a doubt subsisting in Congress about the right of surveying, and I presume that the nomination of Anderson might have giv'n some uneasiness; With respect to Ludeman, I will whenever he applies do every thing in my power in his behalf. A few weeks since we made recommendation to the States to raise 700 Men, for the purpose of protecting the frontiers & of preventing unwarrantable intrusions on the lands of the Continent: some gentlemen are of opinion though the number of troops are small, that they ought to be commanded by an Officer of rank.

  Dear Sir New York, 4th June, 1785. A few days since, I had the honor of forwarding a letter addressed to you, by Mr. Sullivan. The enclosed was brought into Congress yesterday from the post office here; I observed it was not sealed, & took charge of it immediately, & you may be assured it has not been unfolded since. Messrs. Lowell, Sullivan, & Parsons are still with us, but nothing more, at present, I conclude, will be done, respecting our fOEderal court than filling it up,(1) & concluding upon a place to meet, as several of the gentlemen that were first appointed did not accept. We are waiting to hear who is appointed Governor of Masstts.; & by the list I have seen of the honorable court, I should suppose Mr. Bowdoin will be the man. I conclude before this comes to hand, you will have seen the late ordinance, respecting the western territory, which took up much time in Congress, but passed unaniminously at last: I wish that the persons that are so sanguine in their opinions, that the sale of the lands will extinguish so great a part of our national debt may not be disappointed. I remain, with perfect consideration & respect, your most obedient, S. Holten(2) ""

  Dear Sir New-York June 4th 1785 I have to crave your pardon for not answering your obliging favor of the 30th April Ult before this time---;my apology however I hope will be sufficient to account to you for the delay; for some weeks after your  JUNE 4, 1785  favor came to hand, I was tormented with the ague & fever in such a manner every other day, that I had scarce life & spirits left to attend to any thing & when I had in some measure recovered, I found you had set out on the Western circuits, so that I waited your return from thence. I will now promise a punctual correspondence & shall thank you very kindly, whenever leisure will admit, to give me a detail of the principal political & domestic occurrences that happen at Philada. There are very few of importance which escape your observation---;to me they will be particularly amusing & instructive & I will promise in return a detail of the same nature from hence. You have seen the Land ordinance.(1) It was but little in the house untill it was ready to pass---;it does not please me fully---;it was a compromise between the prejudice of education (if I may use the expression) in the eastern & middle states with respect to their original mode of locating their lands---;the eastern people contending for the propriety of locating by townships, & the middle & some of the southern folks being in favor of a division in small tracts, so as to suit the circumstances of all classes. I think also that the price is fixed two high---;we attempted on the day of passing to reduce it to two thirds of a dollar per acre, but it was carried in the negative. I will thank you for your candid opinion on this ordinance. You have heard of the North Carolina cession of western territory to the United States in June 1784---;they gave Congress untill the first of June 1785 to except of the cession; but previous to that time revoked the act of June 1784 & forbid their delegates in Congress to execute the deed of Cession agreeable to that act. The people of that western part of No Carolina which was included in the act of cession have since declared themselves an independent State by the Name of Franklin & plead the act of Cession as aforesaid for so doing & have sent a memorial to Congress praying to be received into the fOEderal union.(2) This naturally brot the act of cession of North Carolina on the floor,(3) indeed I cannot conceive why it had not been accepted before the act revoking made its appearance; it was contended by almost all the gentlemen of the law that the act of cession was still good (the act revoking notwithstanding) provided Congress accepted within the time limited in said act, & that the execution of a deed in form by the delegates of that State, which they then refused to do, was not necessary to vest the title in the United States, for that this was done by the act itself fully & completely. It was therefore moved that Congress now accept the cession as aforesaid; this was overruled on the score of policy, that as Congress had delayed to accept the Cession untill the term limiting the acceptance was on the point of expiring & that as it had not been taken up at all, untill a memorial had made its appearance in Congress from a part of that state (stiled by some in rebellion) praying to be admitted into the federal union---;that taking the matter up at this late hour & as things   now stood would be taking rather an undue advantage of No Carolina, rather tending to favor a seperation at any time of a State whenever a few turbulent people were so disposed, that the measure would very probably irritate the State to so great a degree as to induce them to withdraw from the union---;that it was best for the present to use lenient measures; that in all probability No Carolina would in a very short time, again make the desired cession, for that she could not possibly long hold those people beyond the mountains subject to her jurisdiction. The matter then ended with a resolution as you will have seen in the public papers recommending to No Carolina to reconsider this matter & act on liberal principles &c. No Carolina I think makes but a foolish figure in this business---;she made a sort of an Indian gift, which she had scarce parted with before she called it back into her possession. I have no doubt but she will at her next session of assembly confirm anew her former cession, for from all accounts the people beyond the Apalachian Mountains which have now declared themselves an independent State will never again return under the jurisdiction of No Carolina, nor is it in the power of that State to force a compliance. Congress have not yet finished the requisition on the States for the year 1785---;it ought to have gone out at least five months ago & at this time some preparation ought to be making for the business of 1786---;however 1785 must precede---;in determining the requisition for this year on the report of a grand committee for that purpose, there is 30,000 dollars called for, to be appropriated for the purpose of erecting fOEderal bu[i]ldings.(4) Whenever this comes on the carpet the propriety of erecting those buildings, will also become a subject of discussion. I confess I have not yet been able fully to make up my mind on the subject having never heard the arguments pro & con on this business, but am rather inclined to give it my negative; I query whither in this I should be joined by my colleagues, especially Mess P---;---;t & W---;---;n.(5) The letter is expected every day when our delegation will be full. I can easily account for the prejudices of those two gentlemen in favor of a measure of this nature---;be pleased as soon as convenient to give me your opinion on this subject; it will have great weight with me in forming mine. I am much pleased to hear, the paper money seems to keep its ground & is in pretty general circulation. The Bank stopping all fresh discounts is greatly in its favor. You have Don Gardoqui with you, we look for him here shortly---;we have had letters announcing his arrival & rank. The navigation, full & free to the United States of the Mississippi must of course become a matter of enquiry, & subject of discussion with his court---;that is a matter the United States can never give up, otherwise our territory in that quarter would be of little consequence. The Continental Treasurer would wish to stay in Philada, altho' he together with all the other officers of Congress residing there have   been directed to come to New-York---;from the present disposition of Congress, he will find it absolutely necessary either to come to N. York or resign.(6) With much esteem, I remain Dear Sir, Your Obdt Servt, David Jackson ""

  New York 5th June [17]85 I have yours of the 27th of May with the history of electioneering;(1) I am satisfied with all that has been done, and with all that has not been done. There is but one piece of information that you give me that I am not content with, and that is your intention to remain until the 15th instant in Massachusetts. I have for six weeks past daily been saying, that you would be here, in twelve or fifteen days; and these assertions have not only been made to the best and most respectable men in congress; but to a number of the most beautiful women in this City, all of whom laugh at my credulity in believing that you seriously intend leaving Massachusetts this summer.  Now Sir this has become a very serious business, I am not only disappointed in the society of my friend, but am pointed at as a very weak man in my understanding, and a very great man in faith. But this aside, seriously your friends wish you here and I have been disappointed in your not returning. However as you have tarried so long; for the greater good, I will consent to your remaining a few days longer, for the appointment of Delegates. I wish to know who is talked of and who will probably be chosen---; you well know the importance to Massachusetts and to the Eastern states, that Massachusetts should always have not only a full, but an able Delegation. The State requires abilities, in the present condition of her affairs, but I fear she will not obtain them, although she hath many able men who would serve her, provided when they are taking care that the Commonwealth takes no harm, the commonwealth would take care that their private affairs received no detriment.

  Sir, New York 5th June 1785. On the 15th of May Mr. Cocke arrived here in the Character of Agent, for the inhabitants of the Counties of Washington, Greene, & Sullivan, whom it appears have declared themselves an independent State by the Title of \""The State of Franklin.\"" The day following he presented, to the President of Congress a memorial from the Assembly of that State, praying Congress to accept the cession of No Carolina, and to admit them into the Union. The memorial was laid before Congress, and read, but no Order either moved, or, taken on it. A copy of the memorial I enclose to your Excellency.(1) A day or two after a motion was made by a delegate from Massachusetts, that the Acts of the Genl. Assembly of the State of No. Carolina, granting & repealing the cession, should be refered to a Committee, in order that they might report whether Congress had, or had  JUNE 5, 1785  not a right to Accept the cession, & whether it was not still binding upon the State, notwithstanding the repealing Act. They were accordingly committed, and a report made on the 20th May. Contrary to the established rule, the report was taken up, and Acted on, the same day, without allowing any time for consideration or giving any notice to the member from the State. As I had been indisposed for some time before & was at that time, far from being well, I was not in Congress, tho' had I known that, that subject would have been before the house I should certainly have been there. Notwithstanding I think that congress have in this instance, treated the State and myself with a great degree of indelicacy, I shall only Observe upon their proceedings, that in my Opinion too great an avidity, in a part of Congress, for Western Territory, have harried them into a Measure, the consequences of which they have not considered, and I am sure in their cooler Moments, & abstracted from interested motives, they wou'd condemn. A copy of the report and proceedings thereon I enclose to your Excellency. The Report does not do much credit to the Abilities of the gentlemen who drew it, (tho' it convinces me, that my opinion is right---;\""that they are willing to have the land on any terms,\"") as the latter clause, which is the only one agreed to, is an Absolute contradiction to every other part of it.(2) I inclose your Excellency a note I recd. from Mr. De Marbois, respecting the debt due by the State to the Government of Martinique.(3) I forward to your Excellency the Ordinance for ascertaining the mode of disposing of the lands in the western territory.(4) In my Opinion it never will answer the End proposed, for before this formal & hitherto unheard of plan can be carried into Execution, the lands will be possessed by persons, who, have already, & are daily crossing the Ohio, in great numbers, so as to put the United States to more expence to dispossess them, than the soil will afterwards sell for. The State of South-Carolina have applied to Congress, for a foederal court, to determine the dispute about Jurisdiction & territory subsisting between them & the State of Georgia.(5) They claim all the territory lying to the northward of a due west line to be drawn from what they call the head of the River Savannah, (that is where the Tugelo & Keowee Join when it takes the name of Savannah,) to the Mississipi, & to the south of our line: And all the territory lying to the south of the Altamaha & a due west line to be drawn from the head of that river to the Mississipi, & to the North of the Floridas as bounded by the Treaty. North-Carolina has not been represented since Doctor Williamson's time expired, nor do I hear any Accounts of the Other delegates coming. I shall leave this city in a few days to return home.(6) The requisition for the present year is not yet made, and several other important Matters remain to be acted on, from which I am led to believe that Congress will not have a recess this Summer.

But amidst all these pleasing Scenes there is something that damps our spirits and casts a gloom over the whole. At about half a mile distance from our lodgings lies the wreck of a ship which was the Jersy Prison ship, from which so many thousands of our poor Countrymen, who had the misfortune during the late war to be taken prisoners were thrown. I wish I could say, buried, for then some part of the British inhumanity would have been concealed, but that was not the case. The Banks near which this Prison ship lay are high & sandy: the dead bodies of our friends only wrapped up in old blankets were laid at the bottom of the bank, and the sand drawn down over them. Soon after we came to live upon Long Island several of us took a walk that way, and were struck with horror at beholding a large Number of human bones, some fragments of flesh not quite consumed, with many pieces of old blankets lying upon the shore. In consequence of a representation made to Congress they were soon after taken up and buried,(1) But walking along the same place not many days ago we saw a number more which were washed out, and attempting to bury them ourselves we found the bank full of them.

  My dear Friend, New York June 10. 1785 By Mr. Alexander White of Frederick, I had the honor of writing to you from Trenton before Christmas last,(1) but I have not had the pleasure of hearing from you in return, which causes me to doubt your having received that letter. Our intelligence from Europe is not very interesting. The Ministry & Parliament of G. Britain seem to be absorbed in the dispute about the Commerce of Ireland, a subject of important discussion, & which will probably produce great discontent whichever way determined. Congress has sent Mr. John Adams Plenipotentiary to the Court of London for the settlement of our remaining disputes. Upon the Continent of Europe their differences appear to be settling without bloodshed---;The Emperor having yielded (so far as we are informed), his claims upon the Scheld. A Plenipotentiary from Spain has arrived at Philadelphia and is daily expected here. We shall soon learn from him whether or not his Master is disposed to consent to our free use of the navigation of Mississippi with Spain. You will see in the public papers the Congressional ordinance  JUNE 10, 1785  for selling the lands lately purchased of the Indians Northwest of Ohio for the pay[men]t of our public debt. This will offer 10 millions of Acres for Sale at a dollar pr. Acre of liquidated Certificates for debt due from the U. States. This, with the Lands to be sold hereafter between the Southern bounds of the present Sale and the Mississippi, will I hope, discharge the great burthen of debt created by the late war---;And make us realy a free & independent people. We have an American Coinage in view, and a better regulation of the Post Office, with such further Treaties with the Indians as will secure peace with them, and extinguish all their claims to Land within the limits of the U. States. Having thus given you a detail of affairs here, will you permit me to enquire of you how all things do with you---;does the Wheat, Oats, rye, Barley &c, &c, &c grow kindly---;Are the people healthy, sociable, & happy---;And above all, is my esteemed old friend General Stephen happy & in good health? If you please, remember me affectionately to Colo. Martin, Mr. White, & Colo. Thruston.(2) I am dear Sir yours with the sincerest esteem & affection, Richard Henry Lee ""

  My dear Nephew, New York June 13. 1785 Your favor of June the 11th has been just now put into my hands, and had it come sooner would have renderd unnecessary some parts of my letter to you of yesterday,(1) which, with this will be delivered by Mr. Joseph Harrison. I am very sure that without incurring the smallest danger of being charged with self applause, I can safely appeal to all those acquainted with my political progress, for a full testimonial that neither indolence, inattention or neglect have marked my proceedings---;And most certainly I should not have first commenced such practice with so respectable a character as Doctor Franklin. When Congress determined to indulge the Doctor, upon his request, with leave to retire, the business of communicating that determination was expressly assigned to the Secretary for foreign Affairs among the other duties of his Office(2)---;And did not enter at all into my business. In me it would have been a work of Supererogation and I think myself warranted in doing justice to the honorable Secretary for foreign Affairs by assuring you that his information was sent by the earliest good opportunity that offered after the Act of Congress passed.(3) I thank you for your obliging attention to my affairs---;but you say nothing about the covering for my Charriot---;is it gone, or in what State is that affair?

  Dear Sir, New York June the 13th. 1785 I am much obliged by the goodness with which you have been pleased to remember, and to comply with my request that you would write to me, and I am thereby encouraged to hope that your correspondence will be continued. It may always be safely conveyed, even when I am away from Congress, by enclosing your letter to the Virginia delegates in Congress. It is a point of much uncertainty whether Congress will adjourn or not this Summer---;but if they do, it will probably not be before the middle of August. When they adjourn I shall go home, but if they do not adjourn, I shall of course be detained here until the end of the federal year, the first Monday in November. The very great uncertainty to which the conveyance of letters is exposed under the present System, discourages exceedingly all free communication of sentiments. And upon this occasion, as Mr. Mazzie will probably visit you at Paris, he will render unnecessary much writing on my part respecting Virginia; as he has come from that State long since I left it. The principal topics of discussion there at present are, An Act for a General Assessment---;A Circuit Court Law---;And a plan for opening the interior navigation of Potomac, James, & Elizabeth rivers. The two former were favored by the last Assembly, but meet with much opposition since the recess. The latter of these measures was also a favorite with the last Assembly, and the Legislature of Maryland has joined ours in the Potomac business. How they succeed in the South I know not. But already £40,000 has been subscribed for clearing Potomac. A Corporation for the purpose is ligitemated, and Gen. Washington is President of the Society. You well know his persevering spirit, and attentive character. These qualities promise success to the Potomac plan. Congress has just finished an Ordinance for surveying & selling that part of the Land N.W. of Ohio that has been lately purchased of the Indians, for the purpose of discharging our public debts. This will present about 10 Millions of Acres for sale at one dollar an Acre of Liquidated Certificate debt. Subsequent treaties to be held with the Indians will extinguish their claim to about 20 millions  JUNE 14, 1785  more which it is intended to devote to the same purpose, & which will very nearly pay off our whole domestic debt. The foreign will then not be found oppressive. An American Coinage, & the regulation of the Post Office, with some other affairs of importance are now under consideration of Congress. We hope that the powers & directions given by Congress to our Ministers abroad, will secure peace for us with the Barbary States and free our Trade from the embarrassement threatened by them. I incline to think however, that Commercial finesse has been more operative than the enmity of those people to distress the American Commerce. Being much engaged with public business at this time, I must conclude with presenting my best respects to my old friend Mr. Jefferson. I am, with much esteem, Sir, Your most obedient & very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. ""

  Dear sir, New York 14th June 1785. Your favor of the 29th of January, which is the second only I have received from you since your arrival in Paris came to hand a few days ago. It would have reached me rather earlier; but I have been detained in Virginia during the Months of April & May in making some small advances in the line of my profession previous to my leaving Congress.(1) I saw your Brother Peyton & the most of your friends & have the pleasure of informing you they were well. As to any great fund of public information you will scarcely expect it from this quarter. We have but little that is worth giving, but even that little it is imprudent to commit to paper but in Cypher: I have every reason to suspect that your last letter had been opened before I received it. I cannot however forego the pleasure of informing you that I think our Affairs on this side the Water begin to take a more favorable turn. Public Credit is encreasing, & the fOEderal Government begins to acquire some small degree of respect. Could we but rescue our Commerce from the restrictions to which it is subjected in several ports of Europe but more particularly in those of Great Britain, the effects would be immense. As to the policy or situation of particular states, removed at the distance you are I presume they hardly come within your view: under this presumption I shall but slightly mention to you two or three subjects which engross the Minds of the Citizens of Virga at present. The Port bill as it is termed, I think had passed before you left America; it is  JUNE 14, 1785  one among several other things that seems to have given birth to a spirit of Enquiry in the State of Virga that I think may be productive of future good. The Bill for instituting Courts of Assize has also become a subject of almost general discussion; The laws for opening James & Potomack Rivers I make no doubt but you have heard of; The latter I presume will be began some time this summer. Believe me My dear sir I shall not be inattentive to the Subject of the Postscript you enclosed. Indeed I had anticipated the request it contain'd very long before it came to hand.(2) The only difficulty that will oppose itself on the first Appointment of the kind that is made, will be the Grandson of Doctr. F---;---;klin & Colo. Humphreys. The Character in which the first of these Gentlemen has long acted, & the one in which the latter was sent to Europe aided by an honorary engagement on the part of Congress to Gen. Washington, to make some provision for him, will I expect be considered as giving them the first Claim for preferment in that particular line. After this, a road will be opened for you, & be assured I shall not let an Opportunity of serving you pass, during my continuance in Congress. Several of my friends in Virga enquired how long you would be absent from America & whether I conceived you would return in time to succeed either Monroe or Myself in the Appointment we hold at present. Adieu My dear sir, I shall write you with as much punctuality as I can: but the Missing of a single Opportunity or two you must not attribute either to a diminution of friendship, or a disinclination to correspond. The business of Congress & some Measures which I am taking preparatory to settleing myself very much engross me. Once more Adieu, S Hardy P.S. I forgot to mention that Judge Dandridge is dead & Tazwell succeeds him on the bench. P.S. I this day brought on the question of Appointing a Minister to the Hague;(3) merely to collect the sentiments of Congress relative to foreign appointments in general. The views of Gentlemen on this subject appear various indeed. Some are for having Ministers plenipotentiary at the several Courts of Europe. Others are against adding to the number of those already appointed. Some are decided on the propriety of appointing a Secreatary to each Minister (as a Secretary to the Legation) so soon as they become fixed at the different Courts where they are to reside: & others are averse to such appointments on the ground of oeconomy & a supposition that private Secretaries only will be sufficient. With an Eye to this particular business I some time ago advocated the appointment of a Secreatary of legation to the Court of London. And on its being very easily carried did conceive the principle so well established that my surprize was great at the Opposition it has now indirectly met with. But whatever may be the System I shall act for you as under similar Circumstances I should wish you to do for  JUNE 15, 1785  myself: I shall not risque a nomination without a pretty good ground of success, nor shall I omit any Opportunity that appears to promise it. Present My Most friendly regards to Mr Jefferson, & assure him that my not writing him arises only from a Conviction that he has from Monroe every information which I could give him, & that too numerous a train of Correspondents is rather a source of Embarrasment than pleasure.

  Dear Sir New York June 15th. 1785. Your favor by the packett has been duly recieved for which I am much obliged to you, and I make use of this opportunity by Mr. Mazzei to answer it. I arrived at this place early in March, since which nothing of any great importance has taken effect except the land ordinance which is herewith inclosed. A difference of sentiment between the Eastern & Southern part of the Continent & an imaginary difference of interests has made the Ordinance less perfect than it might have been. Congress are about directing a treaty to be held with the Western Indians at Post Vincent on the Wabash this summer for extinguishing their  JUNE 15, 1785  rights to the territory between the Miami & Missisippi; should this be effected, I expect the Ordinance will be made to apply to that country, immediately as the paying the domestic debt in this way seems to be an object which every one has very much at heart. Indeed the necessity of the measure is glaring, for while the Taxes continue high, we shall have no emigrants from beyond seas, & the want of inhabitants is perhaps our only calamity. A very considerable part of No. Carolina has revolted; They have assumed the powers of governmt. & a Capt. Cocke was here the other day with authority from them to solicit admission.(1) Georgia has laid off a county on the Missisippi called Bourbon & settlers are gathering fast about the Natches.(2) There is a report that the province of Maine begin to make speeches respecting independance; Vermont remains as it did when you left this. Inclosed is the report of a Commee. for altering the 9th article of the confederation.(3) 8 States will be for it, but whether or not it will suit the 5 Southern States, is a point very questionable: perhaps some modification may be found out that will make it palatable. As the sending this report is against rule, I hope you will take good care that it is not made public indeed I think it would be best to keep it a secret. It seems to be a doubt in Congress whether the instructions to the Commrs. ought not to be changed. The principle of making treaties & granting to all the right of the most favored nations, begins to be disputed. This though entre nouz, & what I would not chuse should be mentioned to any one.(4) Congress have had two ineffectual tryals for the election of a Minister to the Hague vice John Adams---;Rutledge of So. Carolina, Governor Livingston & R. H. Harrison of Maryland the persons nominated. As the Dutch Minister grows uneasy I think that Rutledge will be elected very soon, & in all probability to-day.(5) Don diego de Gardoqui, chargé des affaires from the Court of Spain is arrived at Philada.(6)---;& is expected here every day; what are the objects of his mission, we are at a loss to determine. I have the pleasure to inform you the subscriptions to the Potowmac Co. goes on well: At a meeting the other day, it was found that forty three thousand pounds were subscribed: They are therefore by the Act established a Company. Genl. Washington is elected President & there is a good prospect of success.(7) I imagine you must have heard before this, that an American vessel had arrived here in four months from Canton in China laden with the manufactures of that Country: & that our countrymen at that place had as much respect & civility shewn them as those of any other nation. The opinion here is that this trade can be carried on to great advantage. I remain yr. Affec. frd & most Obed Serv, Willm. Grayson.  [P.S.] I inclose also the journals of Congress. W.G.  ""

 David Ramsay to Thomas Jefferson Sir, New-York June 15th 1785 Presuming on a slight acquaintance with your excellency in the year 1782 or 1783 in Philada. by the introduction of our common friend Mr Madison I take the liberty to inclose a part of a work which is now in the press written by myself and entitled the \""History of the revolution of South Carolina from a British Province to an Independent State.\""(1) It originated when I was in confinement in Augustine in the year 1781 and has employed my leisure hours ever since. I am printing it at my own risque & expence & have already advanced above fourteen hundred dollars for it. When completed it will consist of two volumes & will contain over and above the civil police of South Carolina the whole of the Military operations in Georgia & both Carolinas & also the reduction of Lord Cornwallis in Virginia. The importance of the subject & of the contents of the second volume is great, & may perhaps excite the public attention. Your Excellency knows the infant state of literature in the United States & the risque a person runs who undertakes a work of this kind without subscription. I have from principles of delicacy perhaps excessive avoided this; but it is no part of my plan to lose by my publication. It has cost me a considerable sum of money & a great deal of labor. What I wish upon this occasion is to concert with your Excellency the best plan of introducing it into France. M. De Marbois the Consul General has seen a great part of it &  JUNE 15, 1785  approves it & had it not been for an accident a copy of what is printed would have gone from him to General Chattelleaux with a recommendation that he should have it translated & published in France. I would thank you for your candid advice on the subject. Would it be best to send over a number of copies in English & if so to whose care should I address them? Or would it not be more advisable to contract with a printer & translator & have a French edition of it. The French nation will have no reason to dislike it as it contains many things to their credit & much to the dishonor of the British on the score of their plunderings & cruelties in South Carolina, all of which are circumstantially related. If you think that a translation of it would be well received I would be obliged to you for engaging on my part with a printer & a Translator so as to give us all an interest in the profits of the sale on equitable conditions. The work will be finished in this country by the middle of August. It will contain about 700 pages octavo & will be in two volumes. If it should be translated it might very well be comprised in one volume & several local matters omitted as uninteresting to foreigners. I send you by this conveyance all of it that is printed & the successive packets shall take the remainder as fast as it comes out. The printer does about forty pages a week. The importance of the materials of my work, the circumstance of its being the first of its kind together with the prepossession the public will have for an history of the late revolution written by a member of Congress will introduce it notwithstanding its imperfections under favorable circumstances to the public. It has occurred to me that a pirated European edition might not only defraud me of my just rights but also involve me in considerable expence as that could be afforded much lower than an American copy. I therefore propose to be aforehand with them, & if any advantage is to be made of the work in Europe I think myself entitled to it preferably to a piratical printer. I submit the whole matter to Your Excellency. If you think any advantage would arise from a French edition I will be obliged to you to set forward the work so as that it may appear soon after the American edition which would perhaps check piratical adventurers. If you think it would not answer I shall be contented. At all events whatsoever engagements, you make on my behalf shall be faithfully executed by me & you shall receive my most grateful acknowledgements. I am sorry for the trouble I propose to your Excellency but hope you will forgive it as I could not with propriety apply to any other person.(2) I am again in Congress for this year & shall receive any answer with which you may honor this letter in the city of New-York. With the most exalted sentiments of esteem for your public & private character I have the honor to be, your Excellencys most obedient servant, David Ramsay  ""

  Dear Sir New York June 16. 1785. By Colo. Smith Secry. to the London Legation I wrote you in April last very fully upon our transactions previous to that date.(1) I also enclos'd you the journals that were then printed with the copy of a report upon the first paragraph of the 9th of the articles of Confideration proposing a change in it and the absolute investment of the U. S. with the controul of commerce. I now enclose you a copy of the journals as well those sent by Colo. Smith, as those since printed, likewise an ordinance for surveying and disposing of the lands beyond the Ohio. Unfortunately I have not been able to command my cypher from Virga. so that yr. communications in the last & preceding letters, have been hid from my view.(2) I left it with Mr. Jones who hath plac'd it among his papers but where he knows not. He promises to search agn. on his return home which will be shortly. I hope to receive the one by young Mr. Adams wh. will terminate the difficulty. The report upon the 9th article hath not been taken up. The importance of the subject & the deep and radical change it will create in the bond of the union, together with the conviction that something must be done, seems to create an aversion or rather a fear of acting on it.(3) If the report shod. ultimately be adopted it will certainly form the most permanent & powerful principle in the confideration. At present the alliance is little  JUNE 16, 1785  more than an offensive and defensive one, and if the right to raise troops at pleasure is denied, merely a defensive one. The political OEconomy of each State is intirely within its own direction and to carry into effect its regulations with other powers to attain any substantial ends to the State they must apply as well to the States of the union as other powers---;and such a course as this will produce very mischievous effects. On the other hand the effect of this report will be to put the commercial OEconomy of every state intirely under the hands of the Union. The measures necessary to obtain the carrying trade, to encourage domestic by a tax on foreign industry, or any other ends which in the changes of things become necessary will depend intirely on the union. In short, you will perceive that this will give the union an authority upon the States respectively which will last with it & hold it together in its present form longer than any principle it now contains will effect. I think the expedience in a great degree of the measure turns on one point (especially to the southern States) whether the obtainmt. of the carrying trade and the extention of our national resources is an object. And this depends entirely upon the prospect of our connection with other powers; if like the empire of China we were seperated and perfectly independent of them it might perhaps be unnecessary: but even in that event a question arises wh. may be of consequence, \""whether the giving our own citizens a share in the carrying trade will not otherwise be advantageous to them than as it obtains the particular object wh. the regulations necessary to effect it have in view; whether it will not in effect encrease the value of land, the number of inhabitants, the proportion of circulating medium, and be the foundation upon which all those regulations which are necessary to turn what is call'd 'the balance of trade' in our favor, must be form'd.\"" A preference to our own citizens is the foundation of the carrying trade and upon it I suspect will depend all these consequences. Yet an opinion seems to be entertain'd by the late commercl. writers and particularly a Mr. Smith on the wealth of nations that the doctrine of the balance of trade is a chimera in pursuit of wh. G. B. hath expos'd herself to great injury. If it shod. be found that the carrying trade was only useful as it ad[d]ed to the national strength & it of no great consequence, I shod. suspect that the apprehensitions already entertain'd and which will no doubt form great embarrassment to the passage of this or any such measure, should have great weight---;\""that the pursuit of this object will put it in the power of those States more immediately interested in it, to carry the regulations further than the attainment of it may make necessary, so as to give them advantages that will be almost exclusive and operate essentially to our prejudice: so as to lessen the price of our produce, discourage its cultivation and throw the monopoly in the purchase principally in their favor.\"" Whether this under the report will probably be the case or possibly is doubtful: the  regulation of the fishery is as much under our controul, even without the bounds of the States, as the tobo. of Virga., and all the states have produce, so that I am inclin'd to hope that the productions of the south, though disproportionate to that of the East, wod. not induce, more especially as the revenue accrues to the State, and not the Union, any unequal restrictions. The subject [is] of great magnitude and I very earnestly wish to hear from you on it before it obtains its fate and this I am persuaded may be the case especially if the letter by Colo. Smith obtain'd a ready conveyance. I inform'd you in my letter by Mr. Smith that a Committe was appointed to revise the instructions subsisting to our commissrs. authoriz'd to form commercl. treaties and report what alterations if any were necessary. This Committee hath reported and repeal'd the two first articles. I think it will be adopted. As I have no cypher I cannot risque anything upon this head further than to observe that the letter I allude to will serve to give you some idea of the alteration. It is prefac'd with reasoning upon the propriety of the alteration, upon which it is form'd and of course if the reasoning is illy founded the superstructure falls to the ground. I hope the whole will either be adopted or negativ'd, for it will, if adopted, enable our ministers to investigate the truth of the positions and represent them to us, which their situation enables them to effect.(4) There seems in Congress an earnest disposition to wind up our affrs. as they respect foreign nations, exclude their interests totally from our councils, and preserving our faith with the utmost punctuality with those to whom it is plighted make such regulations as will effectually promote our interests. Information and a knowledge in what it consists are the only points in which they are defective. I have never seen a body of men collected in which there was less party, for there is not the shadow of it here; I think there will be no adjournment and I sincerely wish there may not be for I fear it will not be easy to collect men from the States with more upright intentions. That you may have in view whatever is in agitation respecting the western country, to judge of the system, if there is one, I enclose you the copy of a report now before Congress wh. comprehends whatever is propos'd to be done respecting it, for the present.(5) Upon the report of the Indian Commissrs. the matter will again be taken up and then it will be determin'd what authority Congress will exercise over the people who may settle within the bounds of either of the new States previous to the establishment of a temporary govt, whether they will leave them to themselves or appoint majistrates over them. I think the enclos'd report will be adopted: it hath been several times before Congress & each time there were 8 states; tomorrow it is believd there will be 9. The plan of a requisition is before Congress.(6) The States have fail'd essentially during the last year in making their payments. Virga. hath pd. I believe more than all the rest. The present plan is the pressure   of the requisition of 8,000,000 as was that of the last year. The amt. necessary for the current year abt. 3,000,000. 1. for the interest upon the foreign debt & expences of govt. & 2. the domestic debt. For the latter purpose facilities are propos'd to be admitted. I must confess I doubt the propriety of pressing old requisitions & think it wod. be better to ascertain what had been pd. by the several States upon that requisition, & upon the apportionment under it, what claims those paying most had on the others, and then begin anew making also a new apportionment; this wod. be more simple & better understood. I am also rather doubtful of the propriety of doing anything whatever in the domestic debt. Several of the States, Pena. in particular hath appropriated her money to her own citizens only. From her & the other States, taking the same course, we shall have no support. It appears then better to recommend it to the States to take on themselves the debts of the U. S. to their citizens respectively, let them be pd. by State operations & then after liquidating the whole, and the quota of each is ascertain'd, of the proportion of expences, of the late war, let the balance which either shall have advanc'd beyond its proportion be paid it by the union. This is a new idea nor do I know that I shall suggest it further, but perhaps may hereafter more especially if it shall appear founded in justice and expedience. During the recess of Congress last year No. Carolina made a cession of territory to the U. S. authorizing her Delegates to make the deed. Before Congress conven'd she repeal'd it. Lately a motion was made & a report upon it accepting the cession supposing the acceptance conclusive on the State.(7) I was surpris'd to find it had so many advocates, there being six States in favor of it. I suspected it wod. have again been taken up but was agreeably disappointed. The act gave Congress a year to accept it in & uses the term at the end of it \""provided it shall not be accepted within that term it shall revert to the State.\"" Yet I wod. not conceive it obligatory on the State untill accepted by U. S. and of course untill that event within the controul of the State. The people within the said territory had seperated themselves from the State & declar'd themselves an independent state under the name of Franklin; their agent was also here at the time upon that subject.(8) He recd. no countenance whatever, and all that was done relative to it was to renew the recommendation to the State to make a 2d cession. It is in contemplation to send a committee to No. Carolina and Georgia upon the subject of western land & of finance to press their attention to those subjects.(9) But of this as well as of the other objects to which their attention may be turn'd I will write you more fully in my next. The great points which will be before the Union as well in those lines as that of commerce will perhaps have taken their ultimate direction here in a few months or in the course of the year and then the several legislatures will be the theatre of investigation.

  Dear Sir New-York June 22d 1785 I promised in my last to give you some information respecting the new mode of punishing certain criminals in the City of New-York. I have not been able to possess myself fully on the subject, but from the inquiry I have made find that confining to Bridewell (which is a kind of large work house) & obliging the criminals to perform such labor as should be appointed them by the directors of the house, originated some time ago with the mayor & corporation, as they found the city over-run with vagrants after the brittish army evacuated the palce [place], without any express law of the State to authorize such punishment. After sometime this mode of confinement was complained of as rather a matter of arbitrary proceeding in the corporation, & they were threatned with the habeas corpus in favor of some of the criminals. Those threats intimidated the city police & for sometime they slackened in their new adopted mode, but the utility of the mode had been found so great; that at the last meeting of the legislature, a law was enacted authorizing the mayor & corporation to punish by imprisonment & hard labor limiting the time of duress to a term not longer than six months. I send you enclosed an Extract of the law for this purpose---;the effects of this mode of punishment are found exceedingly beneficial---;crimes within the cognizance of this law are become much less frequent, & the vagrants, intimidated with the mode, banish themselves from the place. There is a large lot of ground adjacent to the Bridewell belonging to the corporation which they intend to improve & beautify with walks for the benefit of the city---;here I have seen the criminals at labor, under the direction of an overseer, each chained to a wheel-barrow, the chain not very ponderous. They are very active in fitting their machines & transporting the materials from place to place as found necessary. This very appearance in my opinion has a much greater influence in the eyes of the vulgar to prevent the commission of crimes than either hanging or whiping. It is true the neighbouring States who have not adopted any punishments of this nature will find themselves much incommoded by the banishment of the rascality of this State in consequence of their present mode; but they have their remedy by adopting something similar. JUNE 22, 1785  The constitutions of several of the fOEderal States recomme[n]d the making punishments for crimes less sanguinary; Pensylvania particularly. It would be much better for civil society probably, if this was more attended to by the legislatures, but it is difficult to depart from long established usages...... Congress passed a resolution yesterday which may probably give offense in Philada, yet as far as I could judge none was by any means intended. The resolution is that three Commissioners be appointed to examine the receipts & expenditures of the late superintendant of finnance & to report thereon to Congress---;also that, three commissioners be appointed annualy to examine the receipts & expenditures of the Board of Treasury & report thereon.(1) The late superintendant of finnance has published a folio volume of the accts & expenditures of the United States during his administration---;probably you have seen this work as it was done in Philada.(2) I never had seen it before yesterday & find that to form an opinion on its merits will require a perusal with much care & attention. I suppose the example of Mr. Neckar late superintendant of France had some influence with Mr Morris on this occasion. With much esteem I am Dr Sir, Your Obedt Servt, David Jackson ENCLOSURE \""And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it & may be lawful to & for the Mayor, Recorder & Alderman of the said city for the time being, in all cases where by law they or any of them are authorised to inflict corporal punishment for any crime or misdemeanor, to substitute, at their discretion, instead of such corporal punishment, a confinement of the offender in the house of employment, or Bridewell, belonging to the said City, to be kept at hard labor therein, or at any work or employment within any part of the jurisdiction of the said city & county, for a longer or shorter period, according to the nature of the offence; and also to confine & set to hard labour in manner aforesaid, all idle & disorderly vagrants not having visible means of a livelihood, and all common prostitutes who now are or from time to time shall come into or sojourn within the said jurisdiction. \""Provided always, that no person shall be confined in manner aforesaid, by virtue of this act, for any term longer than six months.\""(3) ""

  My dear Sir,(1) New York 23d. June, 1785. I have found by experience that there is real pleasure & satisfaction in writing to an absent friend, altho' I have nothing material to communicate; & in this light & under such circumstances you will permit me to address you. The time is arrived, when I expected that Congress would have had a recess; but there is so many important matters before them unfinished, that I believe their recession will be short, if they have any this year, & having but one colleague with me at this time I am obliged to give my constant attendance. The greatest embarrassment Congress meet with at this time is the support of public credit, for some of the states have not granted the impost, or otherwise complied with the requisitions of Congress for money which puts us in a very disagreeable situation & therefore, one necessary qualification for a member of Congress, at this time, is that he can bear duning, very well, & not for his own debts, but for the public. The merchants, in many of our seaports, are very uneasy that Congress have not greater powers respecting the regulation of trade, & it is more than a year since Congress were sensible that further powers were necessary & recommended it to the several states, but some of them have not yet complied; however, I have reason to think that the merchants at this time may be willing to give Congress more extensive powers, than I should think it adviseable for the good people to give up. All sovereign powers will regulate their own trade, as they think most for their interest; but some times they make mistakes, & this may be the case with G.B. at this time, & when she is convinced of it no doubt she will alter, & it is not worthwhile for us to worry ourselves too much about the matter but take care of our own. Congress are much united in our public counsels, which adds great strength to our new government, & this can't but be agreeable to a mind like yours. Since I have been in this city, I have usually attended public worship at Dr. Rodgers's meeting, & am happy in having formed some acquaintance with him, for he appears to be a worthy man;(2) the Dr  JUNE 23, 1785  lately gave me one of his sermons, deliverd. on a public occasion, which I will do myself the pleasure of inclosing to you.

I embrace the present favorable opportunity to offer you my best thanks for the letters you were so obliging as to write in my favor, which have procured me very friendly tenders of service at Philadelphia and this place. From our being so long unrepresented, and the indifference shewn to FOEderal requisitions, I was led to suppose we should frequently be reminded of the delinquency of Georgia; but whether it is because the States have all been in some degree culpable, or that our distresses and consequent inability are considered, the subject has seldom been touched upon. A Commissioner was appointed before our arrival for  JUNE 24, 1785  the purpose of setling the demands of our State against the United States, and will go from hence about the first of November next.(2) Was he to go sooner it would answer no good purpose, Mr. Wereat being at Augusta and as I understood him not quite prepared for an adjustment of the business. You will observe by some of the inclosed Newspapers that Town Meetings have been held in different parts of these Northern States to consider the present distressful situation of American Commerce; the result has been that they have agreed to recommend to their respective Legislatures the investing Congress with full power to regulate Trade. This is a nice subject to come before Congress, and ample, indefinite, powers will hardly go down. Nevertheless something that would enable Congress to counteract the oppressive Systems of foreign Nations, is undoubtedly necessary, as without it they will never be brought to act on equal terms with us. Mrs. Habersham and our little Daughter (who has got over the small pox) are well.

  Sir. New York June 27th. 1785. I have recieved your favor of the 29 May(1) acknowledging the receipt of my first letter, though making no mention of the last,(2) which I presume has not yet come to hand. Since the date thereof the affair of the treaty with the Western Indians which was decided on the 18th March last, has been opened again & very much canvassed; the result however is that the treaty is to be held; & for the double purpose of procuring peace and for extinguishing the rights of the Indians to the territory lying between the Great Miami & the Missisippi.(3) Accounts from Colo. Harmer Commandr. at fort McCintosh, mention that the emigration to the Country already purchased from the Indians is very considerable; that at the mouth of the Scioto there are about 500 Settlers, & at the mouth of the Miami & other parts about 1500. That he has agreable to orders dispossess'd all those who were convenient to him; Congress have directed him to move his garrison to such a point as shall be most convenient for removing all the intruders. Should his force be inadequate to the business, it is expected the troops which go down with the Commer. will be sufficient to make a general sweep.(4) The requisition for the current year is still before Congress, and there are considerable disagreemen[t]s respecting it; it is very certain  JUNE 27, 1785  public credit ought to be supported by every nation who wishes to exist; but it is also as certain that requisitions will not support credit unless there are payments consequential thereon. The requisition for 1784 has been illy complied with; Some of the States have not done anything & the remittances of most of them to the Continental treasury (except Virginia) has been inconsiderable. It is therefore no mystery why those who pay least should be most anxious for new requisitions. The delegation of our State are desirous of a requisition on terms not ruinous, and despairing for the present to accomplish an exaction of past delinquencies wish only to have it so modified as that the Interest on such portions of the £750,000 (as are Continental) which our Assembly has liquidated shall be considered among the facilities as fast as they are audited & past by the Continental Commes. They also wish the expenditures of Cash or certain parts thereof annually may be admitted in the hard money portion of Virginia as paymt. pro tento. Congress after several unsuccessful efforts have at length elected Governor Livingston for the Hague.(5) Mr. Gardoqui, chargè des affaires Plenipotentiary from the Court of Spain is at length arrived at this place; but I believe very few have seen him. I understand he has been bred to the business of a Mercht. & is an agreable man; he has resided some short time in Philada. & the people from thence represent him in a favorable light. The Commrs. appointed to make commercial treaties, have made no great progress therein; which is rather agreable to Congress than otherwise, as they begin to dislike the idea of granting the right of the most favored nation to powers whose commerce is of so little importance as not to promise any essential advantage to the U. S. The Pope without a treaty has opened Civita Vecchia, & Ancona for the commerce of America; In the same manner Leghorn & Messina are made free for us by the respective sovereigns.(6) The treaties with the Barbary States are in train, & I hope will be completed in the course of the summer, though the expence will be considerable.

  Sir, New York June 27, 1785. We do ourselves the honor to transmit to your Excellency the copy of an ordinance for surveying and disposing of the lands northwestward of the Ohio, with the acts of Congress regulating the government of the new States previous to, and the conditions upon which they shall be admitted, into the confideracy.(1) The resolution of the 18th of March last directing a treaty to be held at post St Vincents for making peace and obtaining an additional cession from the Indians, being found insufficient in the means necessary to carry it into effect, upon resuming the consideration of it, it was found expedient to appropriate additional sums of money for the purpose and to extend the powers of the Commiss'rs as well in the objects of the treaty as to the other important duties which have devolv'd on the Union respecting that territory. The acts of Congress upon these subjects we herewith transmit to your Excellency.(2) It is with concern we find the motives which induc'd us to request from Congress an additional Commiss'r to settle the accounts of the State against the U.S. hath not been sufficiently understood, arising we suppose from our not having sufficiently explain'd them to you.(3) The duty of these commiss'rs by the resolutions of the 20th of Feby. 1782 is to settle the claims of States, and individuals within each, against the U.S. up to the 31 of Decr. 1782 upon principles which had been previously agreed to. Under these resolutions he is only to give publick notice of the time and place at which he will proceed in discharge of these duties, but by those of the 3d of June 1784, he is instructed to remain stationary or move from county to county as the Legislature or executive of each State may advise. He is also at liberty to appoint what number of clerks he may find necessary to assist him. All the duties and rights which belong'd to one are extended to both. In several states they move, we have been inform'd, from place to place for the convenience of the people; how far this may be necessary in ours we submit to your Excellency and the Council to determine. Dispatch in the settlement of these accounts was our only object; we presum'd the Executive might direct one to settle with the State, and the other with individuals, or if the former are already set- JUNE 27, 1785  tled, that particular counties might be assign'd to each for the settlement of the accts. of individuals within them. Certificates given by Quarter Masters or Commissaries or other officers who had a right to give them for supplies or services render'd to the U. States, will of course be taken up by the Commiss'r as his vouchers, so that no danger can arise from the number of Commiss'rs employ'd in the business. In addition to this he may take the oath of the party that he lives in the county or district assign'd to him or require such other evidence of it as may be satisfactory. Every delay your Excellency will readily perceive must be injurious to our State, we are not only depriv'd of the advantage of certificates of discount upon the interest of these debts admitted in the requisition, but our citizens of the payment of the interest due them, one of the principal objects of it, while the money drawn from ours is applied to the discharge of such debts in other States. While the Commiss'r hath an annual salary depending upon the time he may procrastinate it to, it may be expected he will be averse to measures which may hurry the conclusion, but as they are respectively subject to the observance of the several Executives it is to be hop'd their views in this instance, if such exist, will be defeated. We have the honor to be with great respect and esteem yr Excellency most obt. and very humble servants, S Hardy Richard Henry Lee Jas. Monroe Willm. Grayson ""

  Sir, Edenton 27th June 1785 Yours of 23rd inst. came to Hand. When I wrote on the 18th(1) I was in haste as the Express was just setting out and there was indeed the appearance though it was only an appearance of some Neglect on my side in making the proper Communications. My Trunk containing my Cloaths, the Journals of Congress and all my public Papers had been ship'd at New York for this Place on the 26th of May & the Vessel did not arrive in this Bay till on this Morning. My Baggage is not yet landed. I have there a Copy of some of the Papers not all of them For as Mr Spaight continued in Congress after my Time was out and the  JUNE 27, 1785  chief Debates respecting the Western Country took Place after the 14th of May it was Mr Spaights Duty not mine to communicate the same to the Executive. I mentioned the subject to him and understood from him that he had ordered a Copy of the whole to be made out. I presume he brings it with him or has sent it by Post.(2) I thought that interfering after my service was legally ended might seem to imply a want of Confidence in his diligence. In fact there has no act pass'd in Congress but a single Recommendation to the State to renew the Cession; but there was much Debate, & many Yeas & Nays were call'd; the Questions lost.(3) On the last day of my sitting in Congress(4) which was two days before the arrival of Cock in New York it was moved by a Member from Massachusets & seconded I believe by one from N Jersey that Congress should accept the Cession of Western Territory made by N Carolina. Whatever my sentiments might have been respecting the Policy of the Cession or the Repeal you may presume that when the Honor or even the competence of the State to make good & proper Laws was squinted at I was not silent. The Motion was after considerable Debate withdrawn. That was on Friday. On the Monday or Tuesday following the very same Motion was made & was, as you will see by the Journal, very nearly carryed. Cock was then in Town, but I think his Presence produced no Effect pro nor con. I question whether Mr Spaights Health permitted him to attend during the whole of this debate. I am fully informed that the Question was lost by the negative of some Gentlemen who wished very much for the Cession but who were very unwilling to give offence to a state that is admitted on all Occasions to be observant of federal Measures.

  Dear Sir, New York 30th. June 1785 Being informed by Mr. Pierce (PMG)(1) that you are probably now at R. Island, I venture to write at you as at that Place. You have heretofore been informed of the Wreck of Col. Biddle's Affairs.(2) I am one of those to whom it is committed to save what we can from the Wreck. Among other objects, our Attention is drawn to the Lands in this State near Kaatskill in which you are interested as Tenant in common. Mr. Biddle seems confident you will readily join us in making an entire Sale of the Whole; but before we can safely act on that Plan we must know your Mind more directly. Mean Time we are giving Orders, through Mr. A. Gilchrist, to a Mr. Cockburne, to lay off the Land in Lots of 200 to 300 Acres, with a View to sell it in such parcels, probably at Auction, as we must sell Col. Biddle's Estate with all practicable Expedition. I fear the Lands will sell at a low Rate. I can get no Encouragement to expect more than a dollar per Acre, tho' Col. Biddle's Ideas were raised to 20/ or upwards. If you should think proper to join in the Sale, it may be well for you to impower some Person to act for you in the Business by special Power of Attorney. Mr. Adam Gilchrist, who formerly lived with Mr. Biddle, now resides in this Town & I believe is worthy of trust. If you were disposed to lodge this Power with me it would perhaps be best to put it into other hands on Acct. of my Trust in Col. Biddle's Estate. I have been in this Town 4 or 5 Weeks, studying Forms in the temporary School established by the U. States. As yet I am but a Novice, & like most Boys on first going to School, see so many Difficulties before me, that wish myself at home again. We triffle away much Time, but luckily the Doors are not open to expose many of our Follies; I wish our Journals would testify more Wisdom & System in our Decisions than I can perceive in them. We have long been choosing a Minister for the Hague. The Choice of 7 States fell on Gov Livingston; he has declined. The Friends of Gov. Rutledge are offended, but he is again in Nomination without their apparent Approbation. Chancellor Liv- JUNE 30, 1785  ingston is also named. On a former occasion he refused to be run for this Place, tho' he wanted to be appointed, as I am told, for London. A third Comr. of the Treasury is wanted to add to Mr. Osgood & Mr. Walter Livingston---;it is said it must be a southern Gentn. Mr. Gervais was appointed & refused. Mr. Eveleigh has been named & withdrawn. Mr. Cuthbert (Treasurer of Georgia) is named but not much known. He & Mr. A Lee, in various Attempts, have each had from 4 to 6 Votes but get no higher. Can you help us to a Name from the southward that is suitable.(3) I am told I have been in nomination some time ago, but I have been in the Q M Departmt.(4) & besides I do not reside far enough south, the Northern & Middle Regions having each one already. If I had been chosen I believe I should have accepted it from no other Motive than to get clear of the Politicks of Pennsa. I have been lugged in there against my wish, & I know not how to get out with honor but in some such way as this. I fear the Event of the next Election. What would be flattering to some Minds, I shudder at the Apprehension of---;recent Examples enhance the Danger in my View. And yet I feel a Desire for the Success of a particular Interest in that State, from various motives, but I would rather see their Measures conducted by an abler Pilot than my fears admit will be found.

  Dear Sir New-York July 1st 1785 A case has lately come before Congress which is supposed to be of considerable consequence---;it contains a dispute between the United States & some of the citizens of Pensylvania; the case is this. Fort Pitt stands in one of Mr Penn's manors of which he has lately sold a considerable part to several purchasers---;that part of the fortification & garrison which has been occupied & much improved during the late war is sold among the other lot's---;I mean the ground on which the improvements stand. JULY 1, 1785  The purchasers have made application by memorial to Congress to be put in possession of the ground so purchased & the buildings standing thereon. The memorial was referr'd to the Secretary at War to report---;he has done so & gives it as his opinion that the United States still require to have a millitary Store house at that Post & that it cannot be given up; this report lies on the table ready to be called up & acted on.(1) I observed in the house, that the case was deemed to be new & that there was rather a reluctance in gentlemen from giving their opinion. I think the merits of the case will turn on the act of Assembly of our State passed Feby 20th 1780 entitled \""an act for the preservation of buildings erected upon the lands of divers inhabitants of this commonwealth for the use of the United States & vesting such land with the buildings in the United States during the war,\"" &c&c. If at the conclusion of the late war, the property vested in the United States by the act above recited absolutely ceased---;then the premises must be given up---;but if upon a still existing necessity tho the war was over, the property could be retained, then I think it would be of use to the United States still to have it in possession for sometime to come untill the country below was more fully settled. I will be much obliged to you for your private opinion on this act & how far it may be supposed to operate in the present case. I will further inform you that from accts lately transmitted from the commanding officer at Fort Pitt, an ejectment has been bro't against him, under the act above aluded to, because he refused possession. All accts here from the country below Fort Pitt agree that the people are flocking there in great abundance; & possessing themselves of the lands lately ceded to the United States without leave or licence. I could wish that country surveyed as soon as possible so as to have the lands at market in a legal way---;some late accts from Col Hamar at Fort McIntosh inform that he had driven off near 300 families who had settled in this irregular manner---;this seems rather a species of cruelty, yet something must be done to prevent more confusion & bad consequence hereafter. Capt Hutchins will leave this City on Monday to proceed to the business of his mission into that country immediately---;there will be six Surveyors who will attend him immediately. The Spanish Frigate from your Port is expected here daily. I thought she was to sail immediately for the Havana. There is no immediate prospect of Congress rising---;much remains to be done, that ought to be done before that event should take place. I remain, with much esteem, Sir, your very Hbl Servt, David Jackson ""

  Dr. Sir. Philadelphia 4 July 1785. I have been on a visit to this place for a few days. Mr. J. Henry is to leave New-York to-morrow whither I return with a great deal of reluctance and much inconvenience to my private affairs.(1) It is absolutely necessary however that our State should be represented---;the requisition for 75(2) having not yet passed the old- paper-money being still before Congress---;besides many other important questions in which we are peculiarly interested. But altho' I return immediately to New-York I do not conceive that it will be in my power to continue beyond the latter end of August. I have drawn upon you accordingly for two months which I presume will be the last. In the mean while I hope it will suit some other gentleman to come forward. JULY 2, 1785  By the requisition for 74 [i.e., 84] the States are permitted so to model the collection of taxes and their payments into the fOEderal treasury, that three fourths of any sum being paid in actual money the other fourth may be discharged by the interest arising upon liquidated debts due by the United States to any of their citizens. Any state therefore being in possession of certificates of liquidated debts due to her citizens may pay the interest thereon in part of that requisition agreeably to the proportion thereby established. Our State I suppose has the original loan office certificates which she received from her citizens who adopted her for their debtor, the interest upon which she may use as far as the same will apply in the discharge of the requisition of 74 [84] or any future requisitions on the same principle. In addition to these loan office certificates I have been thinking whether it might not be so contrived as to obtain from the pay-master or person authorised to settle with our late line, certificates to the amount of the partial advance made by the state, without the consent of Congress, either in the names of the officers & soldiers themselves or in your name as their representative. Nothing can be more reasonable and just than that the state should be put in the situation which her troops would be in had she made them no advance. They would get a certificate intitled to and bearing an interest to be paid annually by the United States. Any individual who had purchased their right to five months pay would have got a certificate. The state purchased such right and ought to have such certificate as they themselves would have obtained. Should the State only get a credit for her advance to her line, it would be getting nothing. A State credit intitles a State to no interest until a final adjustment and partition of the public debt; and then only, if it appears that she advanced beyond her proportion, in which case she will be intitled to an interest upon what she has exceeded that proportion. Now as the day of partitioning the advances of the several States, as some have conjectured, may be as remote as the day of judgement, such a credit is not likely to be of much service to our State. Perhaps you will have it in your power to carry this operation to many other advances made by our citizens to the United States, which our state has either assumed the payment of or has actually paid, and which is not yet adjusted by the fOEderal commissioner who has power to settle such accounts. But I have another object in view besides obtaining certificates for the use and benefit of the State. Impressments were made within our State for the support of the army employed in the siege of York, and I believe at the pressing instance of General Washington. I wish to be provided with authentic copies of his letters on this occasion, for I think it behoves us to endeavour to get a credit for what was then furnished out of the next requisition. The supplies drawn from the eastward for that siege were paid by contract; and there can be no doubt   but that what we furnished would have been also on contract, had not the army required a more instant mode for its support. You will therefore be good enough to hasten forward with as much expedition as possible a copy of the documents and act upon which the impress was founded. It would be a great relief to the State could we obtain a credit in the next requisition for what we then furnished. At all events it is our duty to try to obtain it. If there was a reasonable hope that a final adjustment and apportionment would take place in a reasonable time these matters would be of less consequence---;but under present appearances you will perceive, whether the States be called upon for specie to pay the whole of the interest on the domestic debt, or whether they be permitted annually to pay a part thereof by discounts in the mode proposed by the last years requisition that in either case it is equally important and to the interest of our State to get certificates in as many instances as possible instead of a State credit which cannot be a present convenience to the State, and which eventually may prove of no service. Present my cordial regards to Mr. Stone. Advise with him on these matters for he understands them better than I do and believe me to be Dr Sir yours very sincerely, James McHenry [P.S.] I must ask your forgiveness for this letter as I have not time to make a fair copy.

Cook having found it necessary to return home for a few Days, it is incumbant upon me singly to Acknowledge the receit of yr. Excellys. several favours of the 16th, 21st & 27th of June with their inclosures. Genl. Parsons having before we rec'd his Nomination to the Surveyorship been appointed to another Office by Congress we tho't it expedient to suspend the Nomination till he sho'd have determined with respect to the other Appointment, which I hope we shall soon be inform'd of.(1) Mean time having stated the Circumstances of the Affair to the Geographer, such arrangements will take place as to prevent any Inconvenience from the delay. The Attention of the Genl. Assembly to make provision for our support here & yr. Excellys. Instruct[ion]s to expedite the Collection of the Money are very obliging, & lay us under the strongest Engagements to Endeavour strenuously that our Attendance here may be of some use to the public. The solicitude the Genl. Assembly have express'd for the speedy settlement of the Accounts of the State of Connecticut with the United States is extremely laudable. It is an Object of the highest Importance, & the want of such a settlement among all the States in the Union gives extreme Embarrasst & Delay to all Fedaral Measures, Every State contendg that they are in Advance. Strongly impress'd by the experience of these Inconveniencies, Congress have for some time past turn'd their Attention to this subject & have very lately refer'd it to the Board of Treasury to consider & Report Measures & Arrangements to facilitate & expedite the settlement of those Accounts, & with the greatest dispatch to effect a complete adjustment of all the Accounts of the Union.(2) What that Report will be, or what Measures may finally be Adopted it is impossible to foresee. But I conjecture it may probably terminate in the Appointment of new Commissioners where it shall be found Necessary whose Attention shall be confined solely to the State accounts with the Union, and to Oblige the several States to Exhibit their Accounts within a limited time under some Penalty, perhaps the loss of the Interest upon every Account which shall not be Exhibited to the Commr. by the time specified. These measures anticipate in some degree the Views of the Genl. Assembly of Connecticut & will I hope produce effects eventually correspondent to their Wishes. In the mean time they have the less reason to be deeply Anxious about their particular Accounts, as few States, I believe are so forward as Connecticut, some have hardly as yet enter'd upon the business & of those States who have begun, very few I fancy have made so much progress as Connecticut And till all are compleated no final Adjustment you are sensible can be effected. JULY 9, 1785  Notwithstanding the Measures already adopted I have laid your Excellys. Letter upon this Subject & the Remarks received some time since from the Commee. of Pay Table, before the Board of Treasury & shall with the Assistance of my worthy Colleague pursue every measure requisite as well to obtain an early Report from the Board, as to expedite the eventual Measures to be taken by Congress thereupon. The Requisition still labours under multiplied Obstructions which no Efforts hitherto exerted, tho' they have been extremely vigorous, have yet been able to remove.(3) Congress have lately spent some time upon the subject of Commerce, as well as that of a Mint,(4) but have yet come to no final Conclusions upon either.

  Dear Sir New York July 12, 1785. I enclose a copy of the journals so far as they are printed. They contain nothing you will find respecting the requisition nor the commercial interests of the union. The former upon the report of a committee hath been frequently before Congress of late and as often recommitted, in which state it now lies. As the principal part of the debt which in other States forms a part of the present estimate, for the payment of whose interest the requisition is in that degree made, contracted by Qr. Masters, commissaries &ca with individuals in the liquidation whereof the commissrs. of the U S. with those of each State are now engag'd was contracted in ours by State impressments and of course consider'd and provided for as a State debt, we thought it our duty to propose \""that in all cases wherein claims of individuals by payment of the principal or other satisfactory compensation have been transfer'd to the States of which they are citizens, the sd. States shall be consider'd as Standing in the place of the individuals and entitled to all the benefits which wod. otherwise have belong'd to them.\"" Two thirds of the amt. requir'd will be necessary to discharge the interest upon the domestic debt, & this may be so modified in the collection as to admit certificates of interest in discount upon the liquidated debt. Our object therefore was to extend this facility to the State to obtain for her a discount of so much as she paid to her citizens of those debts due them by the U States, and thereby prevent the payment of double her proportion, for the discharge of similar debts  JULY 12, 1785  within other states while she was exhausted by making it to her own citizens. To complete the facility to the States whose accts. were unliquidated, we also propos'd, \""that for that reason and as each State suppos'd she had advancd her fOEderal quota and requisitions upon a contrary principle, untill they shod. be liquidated, might be injurious to those with whom it shod. be the case, so far as they applied to the domestic debt that the requisitions might be so modified in their collection as that the States might pay in their quotas in either the principal or interest of such accts. as shod. be liquidated.\"" We presum'd the U States wod. be benefited by a State's availing itself of this facility, as it must always be the interest of the debtor to diminish the principal in preference to the interest of a debt where the engagment is not to pay interest upon interest. Lastly we propos'd \""that dolrs. shod. be deducted out of the requisition in payment of that amt. of the advances of the State for the expedition to the Kaskaskias &ca.\"" These propositions were not recd. in the most favorable manner.(1) As to the first they said \""that the assumption on the part of the State & payment to its own citizens of the debts due by the U S. were voluntary acts, that such advances therefore must be consider'd as State-advances and to be taken into consideration upon the final liquidation of State accts. when the advances of all the States and their respective quotas were ascertain'd and apportion'd. That these advances also were in discharge of specific requisitions to which the State had given its assent in a motion by her delegates when the detachment of Wayne was marching southwds.\"" We answer'd that the failure in specific requisitions (and we would grant we had absolutely fail'd which however was not the case) was like failures in all other requisitions, that if we paid less in that than other States we had exeeeded in equal degree in other instances, that these payments or failures under requisitions stood on the same ground & were to be settled on the same principles. That the resolution respecting Wayne was confin'd only to the troops under his command and untill he shod. reach the Marquis of Fayatte, or if extended to all the regular troops then in the State or during the campaign it had no connection with the Militia and State impressments for militia & regular troops; or if extended to the whole in either instance and untill the payment of the whole requisition, for the extra-advance there shod. be some consideration. In opposition to the 2d proposition it was urg'd \""that here is the estimate of the publick debt for the payment of whose interest a requisition is to be made; how can the interest be paid upon the estimate when the money necessary for it is to be applied to the discharge of the principal in some of the States.\"" Upon the 3d proposition we had previously taken the sense of Congress but we thought proper to bring it again to their view that we might know what they intended doing in it. They were all three committed after several days debate & the opinion of   the committee being agnst them after a few days obtain'd a discharge. The report of the requisition will probably be brought in to day. All the States Eastwd. of Pensyla. inclusive are interested in keeping up the present estimate and regulating the collection of the sums call'd for so as to pay the interest of it and of it alone. In vain it is argued that it is not founded on the true state of the domestic debt and therefore improper & oppressive. That untill the liquidation takes place it shod. be accomodated as much as possible to the convenience of the States. That it cannot be expected whilst some of the States fail altogether & present at the same time an assylum to those who fly from the duties of govt. that others will continue to harrass their citizens in making payments. I intended saying something upon the commercl. subject but have not time. Don Diego de Gardoqui hath arriv'd & been presented to Congress. He presented a letter of credence from the King & has full powers to treat upon the subject of the disputed boundary &ca yet he is stil'd Encargado de negotios, in consequence of the character of our resid[en]t at Madrid. We take his stile from his letter of credence & call him Encargado de negotios. He is a polite & sensible man. I have enquir'd into the report of the commissrs. of Georgia to treat with those of Spn. & find it hath arose from the application of a vain old man(2) to the Georgia Legislature who recd. for answer \""they wod. attend to it in good time\"" returning home under an impression his affrs. were in a good way & gave those he conferr'd with reason to believe he was authoriz'd to treat.

  Dear Sir New York July 13th 1785 A little excursion for a few day on long Island prevented my attention before this time to your two last favors of the 7th & 9th Inst. I am sorry to find the Wioming people so very obstinante in their resistance to the laws of Pensylvania, they must have secret abetors from some interested persons in Connecticut, otherwise ever since the decree of Trenton I should have thought it their interest peaceably to have submited. They have it is true many of them been cruelly treated by interested citizens among ourselves, but when the legislature interfered in their behalf & afforded them every relief, they were bound at least in gratitude to an acquiescence to those laws which gave them such liberal protection. Mr Wilson when here last week showed us the Report of the Committee of the Assembly to Council on this Wioming business(1)---;it is not very favourable to those people, as the assembly meets in August next, it was thought best not to move in this business here untill their sentiments was known on the subject in consequence of the Report of their Committee---;accordingly Thursday the 15th of Septr next is fixed by the delegates of this State with the approbation of those of Connecticut, to introduce the business in Congress---;in the mean time the sentiments of our Legislature will be obtained. I should suppose the previous question when the matter comes to be agitated in Congress will be, whether those people are entitled under the articles of confederation to a fOEderal court, to determine the private right of soil?(2) Should this question be determined in the negative, then the Legislature & the Executive of the State would be at full liberty to adopt such measures as to them should seem meet to bring those offenders to justice, but before this point is settled, coercive measures on the part of Pensylvania would probably be premature. The buildings at Fort Pitt solicited to be given up I believe were built principally during the war; I am told they are somewhat remote from the old Fort; they seem to me to come fully within the acct. of 28th Feby 1780, but I think it rests with the United States to judge whether they are necessary to be retained or not.(3) I do not know that any Quarter Master or other officer of Congress has any concern in the matter. There is however something mysterious in this subject. The delegation a few days ago received a letter from President Dickenson in Council, desiring them to procure directions from Congress to the commanding officer at Fort Pitt, that on his removal from that place, he deliver up the possession thereof to John Ormsby, Michal Huffnagle, John Proctor, Thomas Galbraith & Robt Galbrath Esquires or some of them citizens of the State---;no reasons are assigned to us why the measure becomes necessary. The business of appointing commissioners to investigate the accounts of the late superintendant of  JULY 13, 1785  finnance, has been for sometime at a stand, because suitable characters seem difficult to be found. I confess myself at a loss on the subject---;the influence of the great man is so extensive in Philada, that few probably of the citizens there properly qualified could be found perfectly free from bias---;Can you point out any persons either in Pensylvania or elsewhere which you would suppose fully qualified? I believe there is not much to be feared, provided General M. should ascend the Presidential chair in Pensylvania(4)---;he has not steadiness sufficient to pursue any plan long enough to render it very mischievous, provided he was so disposed---;great as the honor may be, yet the seat will be irksome & the tax heavy on the score of peace of mind. I perfectly coincide with you in opinion that the test laws may now rather be of a mischievous tendency & that there is not so much danger to be apprehended from their repeal as is generally supposed; but the great difficulty is to persuade the real Whigs of this truth---;it will require some delicacy & perhaps a little management to make this matter agreeable to their feelings, & indeed considering their sufferings & services in this revolution they ought not to be wantonly offended. The famous Dr Chandler formerly an episcopal clergyman at Elizabethtown in New Jersey,(5) but who absconded early in the contest, arrived here a few days ago from Shelburne, I do not understand that, in consequence of his sufferings for his royal master, his head is adorned with the Mitre, notwithstanding it is generally supposed to have been his most anxious wish---;his parish is still vaccant at Elizabethtown, & it is supposed by many here, they will be disposed to receive him again with open arms. Will this conduct be justifiable even on the score of policy? if we cease to punish obnoxious characters, surely it is as much as can be expected, but why reward & court them. I remain Dr Sir, Your Obdt Servt, David Jackson ""

I now do myself the honor to inclose to you all that is now printed---;which is to page 328. M.

You wish to be informed when \""You are to be one of Us\""? the Answer is easy, when You please. I have enquired of my Friend King whether any Order is taken for enabling your Colleagues to draft Money, & he informs me, that while I was absent the Matter was committed to the Board of Treasury, & he thinks they have made the proper Arrangements. With Respect to the Money which You have borrowed & applied to discharge Mr Morris's Drafts, three Commissioners are to be appointed to examine his Accounts & if You can transmit to the Board of Treasury a State of the payments to Mr Morris, they will deliver it to the Commissioners. The States begin to act with Spirit respecting Commerce. N Hamshire & Massachusetts have by legislative Acts prohibited the Exportation in british Bottoms of any kind of American produce, & laid heavy Imposts on british Manufactures, especially such as can be carried on in those states. Congress are considering of the best Mode of obtaining additional Commercial powers for the Regulation of internal & external Trade, but the Measure is embarrassed & they have come to no Conclusion at present. The Department of foreign Affairs under Mr Jay, of the War Office, under General Knox, of the Treasury under Mr Walter Livingston & Mr Osgood, with a third Commissioner to be elected who will probably be Mr Eveleigh of So Carolina are well administered. Mr Gardoqui has had an audience & Mr Jay will probably be appointed to negotiate with him. Governor Rutledge is appointed Minister to the Hague. Congress have passed a land ordnance which having been printed in all the papers You have undoubtedly seen. I think the price at a Dollar an acre too high, but the Lands properly managed may be a good fund for sinking the greatest part of the national domestic Debt. Mr Jay has made an excellent Report respecting the Consular Convention signed at Paris, which You may be assured (I think) will not be ratified. JULY 14, 1785  Our Finances are a little embarrassed but I conceive the Way is clear for retreiving of publick Credit. The Debt of the public as I mentioned before may be greatly lessened by the sale of Lands, if properly managed. A short Time will I conceive increase our Staples; which have been greatly lessened by the War, so as to exceed our Imports, which happily for Us are daily decreasing. A Ballance of Trade must then ensue, which will supply Us with Bullion, & facilitate the payment of Taxes, to which We are now competent, if We had but a Medium---;to be very honest with You, I think America will by being pressed by public & private Creditors, be brot to her Reflexion, & discover that she has acted like a foolish young Heir who with a great Fortune has embarrassed himself by Imprudence & Extravagance; & after this Discovery she will retrench her Expences, adopt a System of oeconomy, discharge her Debts, & then subsist independently & with Dignity on her own Means.

This lady is the author of the history under her name. She hath been on a visit to Mount Vernon, hath been well receiv'd by Genl.

The report respecting the treaty with the western indians hath been adopted, ex- JULY 15, 1785  cept in the change of the place at which it will be held, being the mouth of the Big Miami or the falls of the Ohio, instead of post Vincent, and the article respecting the people of the Kaskaskias & neighbring villages, wh. altho' first adopted was afterwards repeald, from an apprehension it wod. create too great an expence.(2) The report proposing a change in the first paragraph of the 9th of the articles of confideration hath been before Congress in a committee of the whole for two days past.(3) The house are to take it up again on Monday in the same manner. It hath been fully discuss'd and in my opinion the reasons in favor of it are conclusive. The opposition however is respectable in point of numbers as well as talents, in one or two instances. From our State you will readily conjecture the sentiments of one, Hardy is for it, Grayson doubtful but I think rather in favor of it. Some gentn. have inveterate prejudices agnst. all attempts to encrease the powers of Congress, others see the necessity but fear the consequences.

  Dear Sir, New York, 18th July 1785. I have rec'd the letter you did me the honor to write the 28th ultimo. I think the good people of Masstts. can't but be happy under the administration of their first Magistrate. I have lately conversed with the President & Mr. Gerry, respecting your sons being appointed consul at Lisbon,(1) & perceive it would be agreeable to them, but how we shall bring it about, I am not able to say, for Congress at this time are much engaged in considering what is most proper to be done, respecting the embarrassments of our trade, & untill this business is determined, no appointments of consuls, I think, is likely to take place, but you may be assured of my attention to the same, as it would give me sensible pleasure, if the appointment would be made before I leave Congress. I find by a Boston newspaper, that the court have authorized their delegates in Congress to consent to the proposed alteration in the confederation, respecting a valuation, which I fear will operate to the disadvantage of the eastern states: and as farther alterations may be proposed, I can't but declare my opinion against any change, at present, for more reasons than may be adviseable to mention at this time.  Your noticing my not being in the new delegation, I consider as a mark of respect, & I assure you, I feel myself embarrassed how to conduct with propriety for if I should leave Congress at this time, it might look as if I had taken some exceptions, yet, I shall not be content to tarry here, if I should have reason to believe that it would be more agreeable to my constituents that I should return immediately. With great consideration & respect, I have the honor to be, your most obedient, S. Holten ""

  Dear Sir New-York July 18th 1785 I have had several conversations with Doctr Johnston lately on the subject of the Wioming business & Connecticut claimants. He seems highly to disapprove of their late riotous measures, & supposes such proceedings will both disgrace & injure their present cause. I scarcely think that he has been consulted on the occasion by those people---;as a citizen of Connecticut he has prediliction on their behalf, but wishes their claim to be adjusted without adopting violent & unjustifiable proceedings. It certainly would have been more for the peace & honor of the State to have adopted in the first instance with regard to those claimants, the same line of conduct as was done in the case of the Virginians which fell within the Pensylvania line on the adjustment of boundary between those two States. But the interest of those companies & persons who pretended a prior right to the lands in question from Pensylvania prevailed, hence all those mischiefs have arisen, party views have also had their effect in this business---;in whatever way those evils have originated or from whatever cause, it now becomes the State to interpose & rectify former errors & also to restore peace & good order to that distracted district. Dr Smith will present you with a New York paper---;it contains the New-Hampshire navigation act & also an act of that State for empowering Congress to regulate the trade of the United States for the space of fifteen years.(1) We are told Massachusetts have passed similar acts.(2) One spirit on the subject of investing the United States in Congress assembled with the power of establishing commercial regulations which shall be general on the Union seems to pervade all the States to the northward of Virginia. Those to the south will not so readily acquesce in this measure---;here a northren & a Southren interest seem to clash---;the former are carrying States, the latter are not, tho they have great exports; they will therefore be very jealous of any regulations imposing restrictions on foreign vessels at entering the American Ports, lest a monopoly of the carrying business should be created in favor of the northren States; to reconcile those jaring interests & draw a line on which both the northren & southren interists can fully combine & unite is an object of great importance & one on which the deliberations of Congress have been frequently of late engaged---;whether they will be happy enough to succeed in this business, time will determine. A power to reciprocate advantages or disadvantages is a principle essential in our commercial System. This power is now certainly wanting---;the vessels & merchants of all foreign nations enter our ports & transact business on equal terms with our own citizens. The American vessels enter the ports of forreign nations, except in some few instances as, aliens & subject to great restrictions. The principles of reciprocity  JULY 19, 1785  ought always to govern between the manufacturer & purchaser, for it is as much the interest of the one to vend his manufactures, as it is of the other to purchase them. Mr. Pettit left this last week for Philada---;his private affairs called him off from Congress for a few days---;as for Mr Wilson, we need not expect him again before September & probably then he will make no more than a flying visit. Most respectfully, I am your Obdt Servt, David Jackson ""

  Dear Sir, New York July 19. 1785 I have received your letters of the 12 and 16, but am greatly at a loss how to answer them. It must be allowed that the federal government  JULY 19, 1785  is weak and inefficient. But the question is to what cause is this owing? To an imperfection in the Confederation or to a defect in the constitutions of the several States? to a want of energy in the executives or a disinclination in the people to submit to such regulations, restrictions & government as are necessary for the general defence, tranquility & glory of the Confederacy? Will the vesting greater power in the federal council conquer the aversion which the people too generally seem to have to a strict government? Will it reconcile them to a more punctual payment of taxes? Or rather, taught as too many have been of late to think & speak disrespectfully of Congress, will not an Attempt to exercise power, should it be granted, render the federal council odious, & in case of a failure, contemptible? Notwithstanding all this I am clearly convinced that it will be impossible to manage the general interests of the United States and to give dignity, respect, security & tranquility to the Confederacy, unless more power is entrusted with the national council. Great caution however should be used in conferring this power. I am not for unnecessarily overturning foundations already laid; nor for attempting to give at once all that may be necessary. For this reason the power \""of punishing the officers of the confederated republic in some prescribed manner of proceeding\"" may be deferred for some time. The granting a power \""of adjusting the quotas of all charges & expences by an equitable & certain Mode\"" would in my Opinion be useless, until the states shall have done their part & furnished the proper data, which will lead to that equitable & certain Mode. There are three rules for adjusting the quotas of the several states; One by the value of property, another by the number of inhabitants, & a third by a compound ratio of the two former with a due attention to the quantity of money in circulation. The Confederation has fixed on the first. Whether this would be a just and equitable mode cannot be determined on as the States though repeatedly called on seem not to be disposed to take any measures for ascertaining the value of property. The difficulty I know is urged against entering on the task. But as some rule is necessary to guide the judgment in adjusting the quotas it ought to have been attempted. The Confederation directs that the number of land forces, which each state should be called on to furnish, be in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such state, and yet though it has been recommended to the states to make returns of the inhabitants, few have complied. If the states will not furnish either returns of property or of inhabitants, how would it be possible for congress to exercise the power of adjusting the quotas? I wish therefore that the states would in the first instance turn their attention to this Matter and adopt some regular plan, dividing their territory into districts, for obtaining once every five years as exact an Account as possible of the quantity of land & number of inhabitants in   each district, the state of agriculture, the staples for commerce, the distance from Market, the means of communication with that Market, the number of towns or villages, the price of commodities foreign and domestic &c. This being done & regular communications thereof made to the federal Council, it may then be proper, if the mode pointed out by the Confederation be found inadequate, to empower Congress from the documents and information given to adjust the quotas of the several states according to their best judgment. A due observance of the law of nations is undoubtedly necessary; but whether it will be proper to entrust Congress with the power of enacting laws for punishing the infractions of it is a matter of doubt; nor do I see how it could be done without entrenching too much on the sovereignty of the several individual states. Before this is moved I would wish to see a law drawn up by Congress and sent to the several states for their adoption, providing for the expeditious, examplary and adequate punishment of all violators of the law of Nations. This would give dignity & respect to the states as well as to the Union. The end would be answered and the sovereignty of each state preserved. When Congress come to have a fixed & permanent place of residence it will no doubt be proper for them to have an exclusive jurisdiction over a small district by which they may be enabled to provide for the security of their own immunities as well as those of foreign Ministers in the place of their residence. As to the power \""of imposing and collecting certain defined internal duties to be applied only as a sinking fund,\"" considering the present temper and disposition of the people it would be in vain to propose it. It would only tend to awaken jealousy & might enable designing men to divert the people from what a concurrence of circumstances seems to be preparing them to grant; and which if granted would in my opinion answer our present purpose; give weight to the federal council and dignity to the nation, and would relieve us from the embarrassed & humiliating state under which we now labour: I mean the power of regulating commerce and of imposing duties at least on importations for the purpose of raising a revenue. The conduct of our late enemy since the peace has done a great deal towards preparing the minds of the people to grant this. The urgent calls of the public creditors and the difficulty of levying taxes to satisfy those just and reasonable call concur in facilitating it. The opportunity therefore is favourable & ought to be improved. There is a tide in the opinions as well as affairs of a people which if carefully watched and improved facilitate great events. If to this were added a power of raising a revenue from the post office, public credit would soon be restored and the nation placed in a respectable light. But whether it would be prudent even to mention this latter at present is doubtful. I am rather inclined to think it would not. I believe it will be best to follow the maxim of DeWitt(1) & do one thing at a time. I   therefore wish you to turn your whole attention to the sole object of vesting Congress with the power of regulating trade & raising a revenue by duties on importations. This once vested and exercised and the benefits arising from it being sensibly felt, the minds of the people will be better disposed for granting other necessary powers and the federal government will without any convulsion be gradually improved as circumstances require, until it attain some degree of perfection.

My proposition about borrowing money was to join you in any security for any sum at the rate of five per cent per month till paid. If money can be got at that rate it is an exceeding good speculation for the one interest covers the other & the capital is eight folded. I rejoice in the prosperity of your college in Carlisle.

  Dear Sir, New York July the 23d 1785 I lately had the honor of forwarding a packet for you by Post that came enclosed to me from France, by the author of a Dramatic peace on the former situation of Capt. Asgil.(1) The subject is not a bad one, but the Author of this work seems not to have made the most of it. On the 1st of May Mr. Du Mas writes us,(2) that the parties still continue to negotiate the peace in a very threatening manner.(3) In truth, this whole affair is involved in much mystery, and perhaps the truth is only known in the interior cabinets of the greatest powers. The Marquiss de la Fayette, in a late letter seems to think that the collected combustibles may be put in flame by various accidents. The Emperor he says is restless, the Empress of Russia ambitious, the King of Prussia old, with other combining causes renders the peace of Europe precarious. The Marquiss proposes to visit this summer the ManOEuvering Troops of Austria & Prussia in the North of Europe.(4) We have lately receivd a letter from his most Chn. Majesty, in answer to one from  JULY 23, 1785  Congress to him recommending the Marquiss, in which his Majesty is pleased to express himself in such a manner of the Marquiss as promises well for the future promotion of that Nobleman.(5) Mr. Adams writes that he has been received in due form at the Court of London, has had his audience, and deliverd his Credentials to that Sovereign.(6) No treaty when he wrote had been commenced, but we expect soon to hear of the commencement & progress of that business. Mr. Jay is commissioned by Congress to open negotiations with Mr. Gardoque the Spanish Plenepo here, concerning the navigation of Mississippi, Boundary, Commerce &c.(7) The Spanish Minister appears to be well disposed towards us. It gives me singular pleasure to hear that the plan for opening the navigation of Potomac goes on successfully, as it promises such capital benefits to our country. It is sometime since I wrote to Colo. Fitzgerald desiring that he would put me down for a share.(8) Is it possible that a plan can be formed for issuing a large sum of paper money by the next Assembly? I do verily believe that the greatest foes we have in the world could not devise a more effectual plan for ruining Virginia.

  My dear Sir New York 25th. July 1785. I have yours of the ninth instant for which accept my thanks, little is to be immediately expected remedial of the embarrassments which almost the whole of the american commerce is exposed to. The Gentlemen in trade almost universally through all the States are uneasy and complaining. It has been the fashion to suppose all greivances originated with the British nation; but in this instance much of the pressing difficulty of which constant complaint is making is to be carried to  JULY 25, 1785  the account of the excessive importations made on credit, and the mismanagement of the importers in the Sale of their merchandize. Congress it is said must have additional powers or commerce will be totally ruined; do those who make this observation, know the difficulties of effecting what it only costs them a breath to express? Have they considered the mode of effecting their wishes? Do they know that one third of the States are individually interested in opposing any commercial treaty, or regulation whatever? Have they heard the Southern States remark, that their countries yielded a plentiful and valueable export in their Indigo, Rice, Wheat, & Tobacco, that the freer the Trade the more valueable to the states possessing these Staples---;that the more numerous the nations are who come to their countries to buy their Produce, the greater the competition among the purchasers, and consequently the higher the price at which the produce will sell; whilst the quantity of Goods in different hands suitable for their market may be purchased at a lower price than if the laws of trade restricted any power or nation in their intercourse. These are some of the Difficulties which will authorise an opinion that little can at present be expected from Congress; the eastern states will consent to vest powers in Congress competent to a regulation of foreign commerce, but the Southern States will never consent to regulations which will effect what the northern States desire. I wish I could meet you, we would converse more freely than we can write. I am convinced of your friendship, and desire you to beleive mine pure and inviolable. The last clause in your Letter gave me uneasiness, could I consistently leave congress at this Time I would see you, but at present it is out of my power.

Young Mr. Adams(2) arrived here a few days since having left his father about the middle of May on his Departure for London---;as late as the last of May the Drought had continued to be most severe, the Corn will be short in Europe, the Herds are greatly diminished for want of forage, and the apprehension is great as common in populous Countries that the human race will suffer from famine. This remark may be drawn from this information, that if the United States had energy sufficient to prevent the supply of provisions to the W. Indies, and Wheat to Europe, we should be able to negotiate commercial Treaties on more advantageous terms than at present.  ""

  Dear Sir New York July 26. 1785. Since my last a report proposing a change in the first paragraph of the 9th of the articles of confideration hath been taken up & acted on two days in a committee of the whole.(1) It proposes to invest Congress with power to regulate trade externally & internally. Those in favor of it were of opinion that the exercise of this power in the hands of each State, wod. be less advantageous to its particular interests, than in those of the union, because if in the regulation of trade it was sought 1. to encourage domestic industry in any line, by a tax upon foreign, which however remote at present may hereafter be the case. 2. if to obtain reciprocity in its commercial intercourse with foreign nations, either with or without treaties. 3. if to establish a commercial interest within, in contradistinction to a foreign one, and thereby keep its councils independent of foreign influence. 4. or to raise a naval strength for the publick Safety, all these ends might be obtain'd more effectually by the exercise of the power in the hands of the union than of each State; for unless they act in concert in every instance instead of counteracting the regulations of other powers, they will become instrumental in their hands to impede & defeat those of each other: that there was but one alternative either to act together or against each other, that the latter plan establish'd deep-rooted jealousies & enmities between them, at the same time that it wod. be unsuccessfull; greater under its operation for any length of time than they wod. have against other powers, since being more convenient & better able to  JULY 26, 1785  frustrate each others measures, their restrictions must be more severe and pointed agnst each other than agnst other powers. That such a course tended to throw them apart & weaken the present rights of the confideracy. That their interests were nearly similar being all exporting & importing States---;that it was of little consequence whether they exported the same or different materials, since the restrictions which tended to restrain exportation, wod. injure the whole, & they were all equally interested in getting their admission upon the best terms into the ports of foreign powers. That they imported nearly the same materials & of course had the same interest in that line.(2) On the other side it was argued 1. that it was dangerous to concentrate power since it might be turn'd to mischievous purposes; that independent of the immediate danger of intoxication in those entrusted with it, & their attempts on the govrnment, it put us more in the power of other Nations. 2. that the interests of the different parts of the Union were different from each other, & that the regulations which suited the one would not the other part. That 8 States were of a particular interest whose business it wod. be to combine to shackle & fetter the others. 3. that all attacks upon the confideration were dangerous & calculated even if they did not succeed to weaken it. These I think were the principal arguments on either side, tho' they were carried out into great extent. I think Colo. Grayson inform'd me sometime since he had transmitted to you the report otherwise I shod. now do it.(3) I wish very much your sentiments on the subject. By the packet we are inform'd that Mr. Adams had arriv'd in London, been presented to the King & well receiv'd. The ceremonial had only taken place when his dispatches were forwarded, so that he had not proceeded to business. Mr. Gardoqui is here; Congress have authoriz'd the Secretary of foreign affrs. to treat with him upon the subject of his mission. I am your friend & servant, Jas. Monroe P.S. I inclose you a treatise of Mr. Mazzai in favor of the port bill in Italian.(4) I promis'd him to attempt a translation of it but really I distrust my knowledge of the language too much to attempt it provided I had leasure, which is not the case; he undertook it upon the desire of Colo. Innes for whom principally the translation is intended. By committing it to you I trust I promote his views more than I shall otherwise have it in my power to do.  ""

  Dear Sir New York July 27th 1785 My last to you was better than a week ago, since which I have not been honored with any of your favors. The business of finishing the requisition (which is by far too late) for the present year has occupied the attention of Congress every day for this week past.(1) It labors hard in the passing from the doctrine of facilities or discounts of interest with the domestic creditors being allowed. The amount proposed to be raised is 3 millions of dollars; the interest both of the foreign & domestic debt down to the end of 1784 is intended to be paid---;one third of the sum to be paid in coin, which will cover the interest of the forreign debt & two thirds to be paid in facilities or certificates to be given for the interest due on Loan office & other liquidated debts of the United States. These facilities to be receivable in taxes throughout the Union in the proportion of two thirds, to one of coin, upon the particular States quota under the requisition.(2) This plan poor & inefficient as it is, meets with much obstruction from those particular States who have but a very small proportion of the domestic debt due to their citizens. They suppose it will operate as a hard money tax on them altogether, while other States will have the benefit of those facilities, never adverting to the ruinous situation the poor public creditor is thrown into by receiving his interest in this kind of paper instead of coin which having no basis of redemption but dry taxation must in the course of a year depreciate probably one half or more. Pensylvania has been rather considered as anti fOEderal on acct of her funding Bill. An idea prevails among many of the members of Congress that she will not nor cannot comply with the present requisition consistently with the principles she adopted in her present plan of finnance. I have told them that to suppose Pensylvania will not comply, is rather taking a matter for granted without sufficient foundation wheron to ground the supposition---;that as she has ever discovered a promptitude in compliance equal if not superior to any State in the Union heretofore whenever a recommendation of Congress was laid before her, she ought not to be suspected of delinquency on this occasion untill the Trial is made---;that when her legislature has the requisition laid before them, if they find their present system too narrow to comprehend it fully, they can so enlarge & modify it as to comprize & substantially comply with what is desired of them. I find it is not one of the least of Pensylvanias faults among some gentlemen, that she has dared to make provision for her own citizens only. The public papers will have announced to you the arrival of Mr Adams at the Court of London & his being presented to his Majesty. He is apprehensive that considerable difficulties will attend his mission at that court & that it will be objected by the Brittish ministers  JULY 27, 1785  that under the Confederation he has not sufficient powers to form a commercial treaty which shall be obligatory on the Union. A private Letter from the Marquis L Fyatte mentions that the Court of France is disposed to drop the demand of Lonchamps being satisfied with what has been done here in his case.(3) The Charge des affairs however has said nothing yet official on the subject. Dr Franklin may soon be expected over. In a conversation I had yesterday with a gentleman here who is a friend of Mr R. Morris's, he did not entertain a doubt but that the great man would be in the Pensylvania legislature next year---; what are the sentiments of people with you on this head? I think a seat in the assembly would be much more the object of that gentlemans wishes, than the Presidential Chair.(4) The interest of the Bank & other matters greatly important to a particular party would then be fully attended to---;it behoves the friends of the constitution to be vigilant & active---;they will find their opponents are not asleep. Most respectfully I am, Your Obdt Servt, David Jackson P.S. This moment I recd your favor of yesterday in the Congress Chamber, but time would not permit me to peruse it before the return of the post. ""

  My dear Sir, New York August the 1st. 1785 I received your letter by your Son with the pleasure that will always attend such communications from an old and much esteemed friend.(1) But on this occasion I have been the more happy as it furnished me with an opportunity of shewing civilities to the Son of my friend. I have had as much of his company as our mutual affairs would permit because I have had the satisfaction to lodge him in my House. Your plan for his education I cannot but approve, since it is the very one that I had chosen for my own Son. It may be admitted as a truth little to be doubted that Merchants are generally keen to discern and  AUGUST 1, 1785  ready to persue their true interest. This perhaps may be as good a rule as any by which to judge of the propriety of giving time for payment of the debts due from the U.S. to G.B. previous to the War. Now it is certain that the most knowing Merchants Creditors upon that ground here, have expressed the greatest willingness to consent to receive payment by regular instalments, allowing reasonable time between---;the reverse of this, & a rigorous demand of payment as quickly as law pursuits would enable them to recover, they are well aware would be much less conducive to their interest than the first method that I have stated---;And this seems to be the plan generally agreed upon, by instalments I mean. Permit me Sir to animadvert a little upon the strange objection taken up in G. Britain by some ill informed writers, whose mistakes appear to have affected even Government itself. It is, that Congress have not power to make effecient Treaties of Commerce. You know Sir that the Confederation has obtained the solemn legal sanction of every Legislature in the U. States; and is therefore a compact as binding as can exist among Men. What then does the Confederation say? By the 9th Article Congress have a clear right to make whatever treaties of Commerce they shall judge proper, subject only to two limitations. One, that foreigners may be compelled to pay as high duties & imposts as the people of any state pay. The 2d that any State may in Toto prohibit the export or import of any particular species of Goods. With respect to the first limitation, is it not one that all states upon earth ought to possess & do actually (I believe exercise). And can a British Minister be serious in refusing to make a Commercial Treaty with Congress because they have not power to permit the Subjects of G.B. to Trade with the U.S. under less oppressions than the Citizens of the States pay? Or Can it be supposed that if Congress possessed this power that so unequal a system would ever be agreed to by Congress. It is not a supposable case, & therefore this limitation can be no true or just ground of objection. The second & only remaining one, seems to have no little force, because a State must be evidently insane that will in toto prohibit any species of export or import unless its very existence depends upon such prohibition. And in that case, the power and the exercise of it is indispensable, and reaching to Self preservation must for ever & will for ever be exercised. 'Tis evident that the interest of States will effectually prevent any such total prohibition unless in the extremity above stated---;And interest is the surest principle for judging how Men & States will Act. Now then, I say again, that these two limitations excepted (which for the reasons already assigned are no just objections to the making a treaty of Commerce with Congress for want of power) Congress have a clear & unquestioned right to make any treaty the[y] choose. And it is remarkable that except some factious writers in G. Britain, the objection exists not. You   know that very discerning Nations have treated with us under perfect knowledge of our Confederation, without producing any objection of this kind. When therefore the people here are informed of such an objection from G.B. they conclude universally that the objection is too feeble to be real, & that the true cause is something else. That something they are not at a loss to discover, and therefore the general outcry now is, let such regulations be instituted as will put the Trade of G.B. with us under such restraints as may satisfy them that they are mistaken in the supposition that their share of our Commerce will be large as they please, & therefore that no Treaty is necessary. Let us give decided preferences to the Ships not only of our own country, but to those of the nations with whom we have Commercial Treaties. It is very evident that these measures will take effect if Britain does not soon depart from her present System, and take up one more liberal. To be sure, the consequence least prejudicial to them, but which is yet very important, must inevitably take place under their present plan---;to wit, a very contracted use of British Manufactures, because their regulations prevent the means of paying for them & of course will greatly limit the use & the purchase of them. I lately wrote to you concerning my friend Mr. Thomas Steptoe in India(2)---;have you received my letters, and have you had it in your power to do any thing for him? I wish much to know. Congress have taken measures for exposing to Sale Several Millions of Acres on the N.W. side of the river Ohio, a part of the late cession from Virginia, for the purpose of paying off a considerable part of our domestic debt. The Soil & Climate of that Country is incomparably fine, and I have no doubt will be greedily purchased with the public Securities. If this plan succeeds, our debt will soon be removed. Be so kind as present my respectful compliments to Doctor Price, and tell him that I received his packet of pamphlets(3) distributed them among the Members of Congress who received them very thankfully, and with the respect due to so great & able a defender of the liberties of Mankind and rights of human nature. I shall always be happy to hear from you, and am, with the highest esteem and most affectionate regard Yours, Richard Henry Lee. ""

  Dr. Sir. New York 1st Augt. 1785. Whilst the Marquiss de la Fayette was on his late visit to this country he suggested to me that if I could recollect the train of his military proceedings and commit them to paper, that you would send them to Doctor Gordon who is engaged in writing a history of the revolution;(1) at least as I understood him on this occasion; for the subject being delicate I did not seek explanation. My desire that the military and patriotic proceedings of the Marquiss may be truely stated by the Doctor has been a further inducement with me to execute his wish notwithstanding it interfered with my other avocations. I have therefore comprehended in the inclosed sketch every material feature of that noblemans history, so far as the same is connected with our revolution, which I hope you will introduce to Doctor Gordon in such a manner as may render it of utility to his undertaking.(2) It is incumbent upon history to render him aid in paying a debt to those characters which America cannot pay. The Marquiss writes by every packet such information as he thinks may be of service to the union, and frequently tells congress what they do not hear from any other quarter, and does them acts of kindness which no other person could do them. The court of France (through his mediation I imagine) has ordered their charge des affairs to withdraw the demand made some time since for the surrendry of Lonchamp, which relieves Congress from much serious embarrassment. Yet one can see that the French Court is not pleased, and hence, that we are not likely very soon to have a French minister---;unless Congress do something more than what has been done to satisfy the insult.(3) Since I have entered upon Congressional politics I must take the liberty to detain you a little longer. Congress have had it under consideration to recommend to the several States to vest them with the power of regulating the trade of the States as well with each other as with foreign nations. This power to constitute a part of the consideration and to be exercised by nine states in congress assembled. Its object to enable Congress to lay as heavy duties and restrictions upon the trade of foreign nations as foreign nations lay upon the trade of the United States. I apprehend that both the genius and interest of the Southern States will be found to be opposed to granting this power. I believe the Eastern States, New York & Pennsylvania are exceedingly anxious for it; but I do not wonder at their anxiety to obtain a monopoly of the carrying trade of the union. What would be the consequence to the Southern States in particular, were foreign vessels  AUGUST 1, 1785  to be prevented from exporting their products. They would for example, having only American vessels to carry off their commodities of export, have fewer purchasers for them, hence their prices would be unavoidably lowered. They would also have less foreign goods imported, which would oblige the consumers to pay dearer for what they must buy. It would seem therefore to be good policy in the Southern States to encourage the number of buyers for what they have to sell, and the number of importers of those articles they must buy, till they become as well peopled as the Eastern States, when a naval defence will be easily established, or come of itself without the aid of restrictions. In the mean while however it may be said, that we ought to lay the foundation for a marine, and therefore ought to begin by discouraging foreign shipping and encouraging our own, for that the riches arising from buying what we want cheap and selling what we raise dear will avail us nothing without a navy to protect them. But is it true that a navy is at present necessary, and if necessary is it true that our people could go to the expence of supporting it? Would it be right to add to our present burthens; can we pay our present debts? Are we in a situation to enter into a war of imposts and prohibitions to force Great Britain or France to open to our shipping their West India possessions? Have we shipping enough to carry on our exports and imports? When Great Britain passed the navigation act she had in her harbours more than a sufficient number of vessels for her own trade. Great Britain too was well peopled at that period and the capital of her traders equal to the exportation and purchase of her products. But our situation is different in both respects, and yet it is said we ought to force a navy, that we ought to prohibit British ships from exporting our products. Perhaps the point of true policy lays between forcing the growth of our shipping and doing nothing that may forward their increase. Perhaps the Southern States should give up something, and the other States should not ask everything. Were Congress under the latter idea to frame a navigation act, the operation of which would gradually and slowly tend to augment the seamen and shipping of the States without sensibly wounding in its progress the interests of any State, and recommend the same to their adoption, is it not highly probable in such a case that the good sense of the States would readily induce them to come into the measure. Upon this plan they would see what they were to give---;that it could not hurt them---;and that it might work a general benefit. They could repeal it too, if it was found to hurt them, which alone would be a great inducement with some states to pass it. You will excuse me for being this particular; but the subject is among the most interesting and that lead me to it, well knowing that although you have withdrawn yourself from all public employments, yet that there is nothing so near your heart as the public welfare.(4)  With respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington and ardent wishes for your health, I am Dr. Sir very sincerely, Your obdt.

They must therefore be checked, & if in doing this, they loose Reputation, they may with Justice impute the Blame to none but themselves. I think You will before November hear that the Matter has been agitated in Congress.(4) Our Commerce is in a chaotic State, I have no precise Idea of it myself. The Ballance of Trade is against Us at present & drains Us of our Money. But Importations are lessening, because our fundless Speculators cannot get Credit in Europe, & because the Merchant who has Funds, finds no great profit on those Articles from abroad which are not Necessaries, & are classed under the Head of Conveniences & Luxuries. Add to this, our Staples are daily increasing, as well those that are taken from the sea, & that are manufactured, as those which  AUGUST 3, 1785  are the produce of the Country. The Decrease of our Imports, & Increase of our Exports, afford agreable prospects, & must in Time make the Scales preponderate in our Favour; more especially when by Treaties of Commerce, We shall be able to carry our Staples to the best Markets, & purchase what We Want of those who sell cheapest; When in short We shall be able to make the European Merchants bid on each other for our Exports, & undersell each other to have the Advantage of supplying Us. The Requisition is before Congress: but We can do nothing with it at present.

  Dear Sir,(1) August 6th 1785 Your favor of the 21st of July came safe to hand by Doctor Gordon. For your friendly sympathy in my late bereavement I am much indebted to you.(2) It has been an awful admonition to Me of the uncertainty of human happiness. When I thought myself at the summit of enjoyment both in public & private life to be tumbled down into the depth of distress was insted a trying dispensation; but it came from that hand which wisely governs the Universe & directs all things for the best. I sincerely rejoice with you in your domestic happiness. May it be lasting. May it never or not till late in life be your lot to drink of that bitter cup which I have been twice obliged to drain off to the last dregs before I had completed my thirty fifth year. Model my compliments in the most agreeable manner to Mrs. Elliott & assure her that it would give me pleasure to see the amiable partner of the happiness of my friend. I feel with you the declension of our public virtue. Liberty which ought to produce every generous principle has not in our republics been attended with its usual concomitants. Pride, Luxury, dissipation & a long train of unsuitable vices have overwhelmed our [coun]try. The noble spirit seems to break forth as usual in the north. The Press, the pulpit & all the powers of Eloquence should be exerted to counteract that ruinous propensity we have for foreign superfluities & to excite us to the long neglected virtues of Industry & frugality. I see by the papers that you celebrate Independence with an anniversary oration. That is a practice I much applaud. To the many obligations you have already laid me under you would add a very con- AUGUST 8, 1785  siderable one by sending me a copy of the performances on that occasion. On the tenth instant I sail for Charleston in South-Carolina there to reside the months of September & October. I propose to be in New-York next November & to spend the winter here.(3) There or here I shoud be happy in your correspondence & rejoi[ce at] every opportunity of evincing that I [am], with great respect & es[teem], Your very humble servt & sincere friend, David Ramsay.

  Dear Sir, New York, 8th Aug, 1785. I have been honored with your attention of the 28th ultimo. As to coining of copper,(1) several persons have been making proposals, but Congress have not yet determined any thing farther upon the subject, than what I perceive you are acquainted with; Whether they will contract to have it done, or cause it to be made themselves, is uncertain, & to give an opinion upon a matter that is to be determined, by such a body as Congress, you must be sensible is a little uncertain: however, proposals given in, I conclude, will be taken up & attended to, when that part of the business comes under consideration; but I rather incline to think, by what I have heard said, by the members, that Congress will cause it to be made themselves:2 notwithstanding, you may be assured of my attention to the same, if it should come under consideration while I tarry, as it would give me sensible pleasure to render you, or your friend, services. I consider my self under renewed obligations for your intelligence & kind expressions respecting my not being re-elected,(3) & I have not the least doubt, after what I have heard, but the court proceeded in the choice upon the idea you mention; and I am as well informed, that pains were taken to make the members believe it was so, when it was well known, to persons concerned, that I was not only eligible to March next, but for one whole year from the 1st Monday in November next; however, I will observe to you (as a friend) that had the true reason been known why some persons wanted me out of Congress next year, it would have been most likely to have secured my election, and I submit it to you, whether it was not additionally unjust & unkind to hint that Dr. Holten had once agreed to remove from Trenton to  AUGUST 8, 1785  Phila. & with an expectation of being appointed President; but I will only say that it had not the least foundation in truth altho' it has answer'd the purposes intended; & having had some intelligence of what was doing against me, before the elections came on was the reason of my hinting it to you in a former letter. I have now determined to give my constant attendance in Congress as usual, untill the time for which I am elected expires, that the same persons may not have it in their power to say, I left Congress on account of my not being reelected. With perfect respect, I have the honor to be your most obedient ""

  Sir, New-York August 8th 1785 In conformity to my promise I continue to send you my history as it comes out.(1) The notes of the first volume though necessary to strangers are well known to Americans who have been in public Stations. I flatter myself the second volume which you will next receive will be more worthy your attention than the first. It contains the brilliant campaigns of 1780 & 1781 which were superior in materials for history to any that preceded them. Mr De Marbois has flattered me with an assurance that the work would be acceptable in France & that a translation of it would be desired. He transmits copies of it with a view to this to the Chevalier de Chatellux. Should an European edition and a translation be thought advisable I have taken the liberty of suggesting a few alterations & hints. I leave this matter wholly to yourself & Mr Marbois correspondent to determine. Perhaps you will not be so well able to decide on it till you see the whole text which I hope you will by the next packet. If there is any merit in the work it is in the chapters that are now striking off. Whatsoever you shall do in the matter shall meet my approbation.

  Sir, Office of Secretary of Congress, Augt. 9th. 1785. In my letter of the 3d which went by the Neptune, Capt Guest, I forwarded two copies of the continuation of the Journal of Congress up to the 29th July. The design of the present is to recal your attention to an Act of the 23d of March 1784, which You will find enclosed, together with two other Acts on the subject of keeping up a representation in Congress.(1) By these Acts Your Excellency will perceive it is the earnest desire of the United States in Congress assembled, that the several States, should not only keep up a constant representation by three members at least, but that there should be a uniformity throughout the Union, in the commencement of the Year for which the Delegates are appointed. Both the letter and spirit of the confederation, point out the first Monday in Novr. as the commencement of the fOEderal year. Nine of the States in the Union view it in the same point of light, and have made their appointments conformable thereto. I trust therefore that Your excellency will recommend this matter to the consideration of your legislature, And that they will adopt measures to comply with the wishes of Congress in this respect.

  Sir, New York Aug'st 10th, 1785. We did ourselves the honor of writing to your Excellency the 24th  AUGUST 10, 1785  day of June last;(1) since which we are honored with your favors of the 24th & 30th June & 1st July last. His Excelly. Governor Livingston, declining the appointment to the Hague, the Hon'ble. Mr. J. Rutledge has been unanimously elected in his room---;we flatter ourselves that he will accept, as it is an office in which his abilities may be exerted for the general benefit of the Union and the particular interest of our State(2). The Treasury department is filled by the election of Mr. A. Lee.(3) We feel much satisfaction in communicating to your Excellency, that the cloud which threatned a degree of coolness between the court of France and these United States is happily dispelled, by that courts relinquishing their demand [for the] delivery of [Longchamps]. This event gives very general joy to all the true friends of the Union.(4) A general adjustment & final settlement of the accounts of individual States against the Union is a matter which Congress have much at heart, to effect this purpose there is now before Congress a proposition to the following effect---;That the commissioners of the United States for settling the accts. of individual States, shall settle all accts. that shall be exhibited to him before the 31st Decr. 1786 & transmit the same to the Board of Treasury who shall order the same to be passed to the credit of the State & the balance shall draw an interest of 6 per Ct. which interest shall either be a deduction from or an addition to the States quota as the balance shall appear for or against the State & shall be included in the next & each ensuing requisition. And that the commissioners shall continue to transmit to the board of Treasury annually the accts. of the States made up to the 31st [of December in every succeeding year] which shall [in like] manner be passed to their credit, until the whole are closed & settled. This proposition takes into its purview all supplies of what ever kind---;all monies paid by States and each States quota of 200,000,000 dol's emitted during the war, which quota (subject to future revission) is ascertained by resolution of the 18th March 1780.(5) We think it our duty thus early to give this information to your Excell'y, that if the proposition should be carried into a resolution the gentleman who has the settling of our accounts may be urged to close them as speedily as possible and that the legislature may at their next meeting adopt such measures as to them shall seem proper for calling in 15,600,000 dollars, our quota of the 200,000,000 dol's emitted during the war---;but whether this proposition takes place or not a speedy settlement of the public accts. is a matter much to be wished, as on a view of the Treasury books of the Union our State stands debtor upwards of Twenty five Millions of dollars. [This includes our quota of the one] Million two hundred thousand [dollars required by the] resolution of the 4th Septr. 1782 for the express purpose of paying interest to domestic creditors, And our quota of 8 Million dollars required by resolution of   the 30th Octr. 1781, which we imagine will be balanced by the payments we made in supplies & monies in 1782 & 1783. While on the adjustment of public accts. we beg leave again to mention, with respect to those assumptions which the State has made to individuals for demands against the Union, that where it can possibly be done our Commissioner should be directed (if he has not followed that method) to take the certificates as the representative of the individual & not generally to the State---;our reason for this is that in the first instance we shall be entitled to receive an annual interest which will go in alleviation of our quota, but if we take it as a general certificate to the State it will not give this relief but be passed to our credit at a final settlement of the accounts of the Confederacy. As we have mentioned [ ] our quota of the 1,200,000 for the payment of domestic interest, we beg leave to observe that the appropriation of this sum was totally left to the respective States & is not held as a transaction of the federal treasury, but on the contrary Congress have supposed that each State has complied by paying their citizens the interest due them by the Union, as will appear by resolution of 27th April 1784 to which we beg leave to refer---;therefore the supposition of the Committee of ways & means in our last session of assembly, that this sum might be deducted out of our supplies furnished in 1782 is a mistake & this sum is yet to be provided & appropriated to the discharge of the interest due on loan office & other certificate which was due antecedent to 1st Jany. 1782. There are other resolutions of Congress which our legislature have not acted upon, those which at present occur and which in our opinion are of much consequence [are the resolution of] April [18, 1783, calling upon our] State [for] 96,183 dols as a supplementary fund in aid of the impost and recommending an alteration of the eighth article of the confederation, and resolution of 30th April 1784 recommending to the States to grant a power of regulating trade for 15 Years. There is one other matter we beg leave to trouble your Excell'y upon, which is respecting the returns to the War office, we find that there has been no returns made from our State for the years 1777, 1780 & 1781, the two last years our line being prisoners may make it difficult to ascertain their numbers, but if it could possibly be done altho not perfect it would have a good effect. The Delegates of Massachusetts have requested us to forward to your Excell'y the inclosed Act of their State & have desired us to inform you that the intention of their Legislature is to counteract the machinations of the British nation, but that they are fully convinced their efforts unsupported by those of their Sister States [will not only fail to accomplish this aim] but will fail to effect those [other important pur]poses which they aim at, they therefore hope the assistance of the States in perfecting this laudable design, by passing such acts as   they judge proper to effect these good purposes, until Congress shall be empowered to make general regulations respecting trade.(6) The Hon'ble J. Adams has had his Audience at St. James's & was most graciously received. Don Gardoqui had his audience of reception the 2d July as Encargado de Negotios of his Catholic Majesty. The Hon'ble. Mr. Jay Secretary in the department for foreign affairs is appointed by Congress to negotiate with him. The intelligence we have received from our Commissioners for negotiating treaties of commerce in Europe is that they are on the eve of concluding treaties with the courts of Berlin & Tuscany, And we have no doubt but that treaties are in great [state of forwardness with] the regencies of Tunis, Tripoli & Algiers. The Secretary of Congress will transmit to your Excell'y the journals of Congress. We have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Your Excellencys Most Obedient and very humble Servts.

  Dear Sir, N.Y. Augt. 11. 1785 Your favor of July the 7th(1) was long coming to hand as I find my letter of the 20th May(2) was in getting to you. This joined to the uncer- tainty of letters ever arriving safe is a very discouraging circumstance to full & free correspondence. I have the honor of according most perfectly and entirely with your ideas for regulating our severance from Kentucky. It is unquestionably just that this district should assume her fair & full proportion of the debt created by the War because the benefit being Common so should be the expence procuring  AUGUST 11, 1785  it and that this country shall be a fundamental article in the Act of parting; as well as that they shall be a component part of the Federal Union. The Contract should be Tripartite; the parties, our State, Congress, & Kentucky.(3) Mr. Jay is commissioned to treat with Mr. Gardoque, but as yet nothing has been done. The exclusive navn. of Miss'ipi will be earnestly contended for by Spain, who to quiet us on that head will probably grant large commercial benefits. But if we remain firm, I incline to think that the Navign. will be consented to. As yet we only know Officially that Mr. Adams has arrived in London, received his Audience & delivered his Credentials. The next packet will probably inform us of his feeling the B[ritish] pulse & how it beats at the subjects that he is to try them upon. I think with you that there is not great room for hope of Commercial advantages from a Nation whose Appetite for Commerce has ever been ravenous, and its wishes always for Monopoly---;And the more especially as we have no compensation to make. I believe that we may dispose them to be reasonable, by a very careful, and considerate restraining of their Trade, in all cases where we shall not injure ourselves more than them by the restraint. But it seems to me clearly beyond doubt, that the giving Congress a power to Legislate over the Trade of the Union would be dangerous in the extreme to the 5 Southern or Staple States, whose want of ships & Seamen would expose their freightage & their produce to a most pernicious and destructive Monopoly. With such a power 8 states in the Union would be stimulated by extensive interest to shut close the door of Monopoly, that by the exclusion of all Rivals whether for the purchasing our produce or freighting it, both these might be at the Mercy of our East & North. The Spirit of Commerce thro'out the world is a Spirit of Avarice and could not fail to act as above stated. What little diffculty there would be in drawing over one of the 5 to join the 8 interested States must be very discernable to those who have marked the the progress of intrigues in Congress. In truth it demands most careful circumspection that the Remedy be not worse than the disease, bad as the last may be. I could say much on this subject, but it is not necessary, for I am sure that your good sense reflecting calmly on the subject will sufficiently discern the danger of such an experiment. Nor do I believe it necessary, being perfectly satisfied that a well digested system of restraint being properly laid before the States by Congress would be universa[l]ly adopted by the different Assemblies. I think so, because it will be most evidently the interest of all to do so. It is true that the price of our Staple has been for some time greater at Phila. & here than in Virga. But it is as true the European price did not warrant the price at these two places as the great losses & bankruptcies of the Adventurers plainly prove. Indeed this excess of price at P. & N. Y. was occasioned by sinking Speculators, who to swim a while longer, would go any lengths to keep up appearances by making some remittance to their Creditors aboard. But this business is   now chiefly over & here at present there is neither money nor inclination to purchase Tobo. The crowd of Bankrupts at P. has, I believe, nearly produced the same effect. ""

  Sir New York 12th August 1785 Messrs. Turnbull, Marmie & Co having, by Memorial, stated to Congress their Claim to the Land on which the Fortifications at Pittsburg were erected, and prayed that the Possession thereof may be delivered to them,(1) the Delegates from Pennsylvania took an early Occasion to mention the Desire of Council, communicated to them by your Excellency, that the Possession should be delivered to certain Commissioners of the State whenever Congress should think proper to remove the Garrison & Continental Stores from thence. Such Removal will probably take Place shortly, tho' no formal Resolution for that Purpose has yet been passed; and as it is understood that Possession of that Post was taken on Behalf of the United States without any Treaty or Contract, it seems to be the Intention of Congress to relinquish it in the same Manner, in order to avoid meddling with the Claims of the State or of Individuals as to the Right of Possession; more especially as some have supposed that as it was formerly the Seat of a british Garrison, it became the Property of the U.S. by Conquest. To avoid Embarrassment on any of these Accounts it will probably be abandonned, rather than delivered up as a Possession to any Claimant. I have therefore advised Messrs. Turnbull, Marmie & Co. to make their Application to Your Excellency & the Council on the Subject, presuming that the State Commissioners will be directed to take the Possession,(2) on its being relinquished by the United States.

  Dear Sir N. York August 14th. 1785. Yours of the 28th of July I receiv'd by the last post. The rout from hence to Boston may be effected by stage in 5 days; to lake George in the same time, thence to St. Johns in three perhaps less, to Montreal one, & thence to Quebec in two, but in the latter instance it must be posted. In either rout you will have no difficulty for the boats and stages are under good regulation. I have been in doubt for some time which to prefer, the trip to Boston or the Indian treaty (having gratified my curiosity as to Canada) & have at length given way to the circumstances which urge in favor of the latter, viz. the security & facility of travelling with the Comrs., an opportunity wh. may not offer again whereas a trip to Boston will be always equally practicable. It wod. give me pleasure to meet you in Phila. but as you delay yr. mov'ment untill you hear from me, cannot expect it, since I sit out hence on the first of Sepr. to join Genl. Butler in Carlisle. I shall return from the treaty thro' the Wilderness & see you at Richmond as you will be on the Assembly. By the first of Sepr. we expect the most important business will have been decided on ultimately, or postpon'd for the winter. The requisition will have pass'd, unless new difficulties arise. This subject hath been sifted thoroughly with the advances of the several States during the contest & their claims upon each other under them respectively. We cannot but lament that the state of our accts. agnst the union is in such a situation as to leave us totally in the dark with respect to it. We have no documents & have therefore only conjecture to build our most important measures on. Several men have been in pay for years in Richmond and yet have reason to believe they have done little. Surely the state will pursue the most efficatious measures upon this head & no longer suffer her interests in that line to be neglected. Those states whose accts. are unsettled are not only subjected to great disadvantages in the requisition but are criminated as avoiding it designedly for the purpose of evading the payment of what they owe to the other States, having fail'd as they presume to advance their federal quota. The contrary of this will, we suppose, appear upon a settlement, why then, say they, delay it? Does it arise from our refusing any thing you ask to effect it, or the negligence of your government? The report upon the 9th of the articles of confideration will not I believe be finally determin'd untill the winter.(2) It will however probably be taken up merely for the Sake of investigation & to be committed to the journals for publick inspection. You have I understand a copy of & I wish much yr. sentiments on it. A navigation act by recommendation hath been propos'd in conversation & Debate but not submitted to  AUGUST 14, 1785  the inspection & consideration of Congress. This is the other plan & shod. not be adopted but in the ultimate decision, that it is improper the power shod. rest in Congress: if this shod. be the decision it might be well to collect better information from the merchants of each state than congress now possess on the subject, indeed with or without the power, this information shod. be obtain'd or we may err in the act. If this report shod. be adopted it gives a tie to the confideracy wh. it hath not at present nor can have without it. It gives the states something to act on, the means by which they may bring abt. certain ends---;without it god knows what object they have before them, or how each State will move, so as to move securely, with respect to fOEderal or State objects. A report revising the {instructions to our ministers forming comm[er]cial trea[t]ies}(3) changing the principle & substituting to that of the {right of} the {most favord nation} a simple bargain with each founded in the nature {of our intercourse with each} respectively, hath been twice before Congress & postpon'd.(4) It investigates fully the impolicy of those form'd on that principle, since in the opinion of the committee, they obtain nothing from the powers not having {posesions} [in] the {west indies} wh. we may not obtain without them & embarrass us in any restrictions we may lay on the {trad[e]}, of those who have, it being the only means by which we are to remove the restraints which now exist. This alteration seems to obtain the assent of Congress & will most probably be acceded to if there will be a sufficient number of States in the ensuing week. A {consulate convention} with {France} enter'd into under instructions of long standing, (but from wh. the secry of f. affr. thinks there are substantial deviations) by {Dr. F[ranklin] for ratification} universally disapprov'd will most probably be postpon'd for the present.(5) I shall write you again before I sit out if any thing arises worthy communication.

Often it has been in my thoughts, to write to you, before this, but engagements of one kind & another, takes up my attention, & therefore, I wish you to consider, me as not wanting in dutiful respect. Every week I have the newspapers sent me from Boston, & I can't but observe, that by many of the publications, I should suppose the people, yet, consider themselves as subjects of the British King, or why do they keep complaining of his Laws, for surely he & his court have a right [to] make such Laws as they think proper, for their own subjects, but [if] the citizens of the United States, have no more to do with their Laws, [th]an the Laws made by the Pope of Rome, unless they interfere [m]ore with our than his Laws; It is to be expected that every sovereign power will make such Laws as they think most for their interest, and don't Congress & the several Genl. Courts do the same. I answer, they do, if they do their duty to the good people they represent; but I suppose, I shall be asked, what is to be done when the Laws of G.B. are so much against our trade; I answer, be sure to make our own Laws so as to counteract them, & by that means convince them that theirs were not founded in good policy, & then they will repeal them; for I know, of no friendship between nations, farther than interest makes it so; however, it is necessary there should be a balance of power in our Genl. Court, between the commercial & Country interest, so that neither should have too much influence, & by that means the Laws will be likely to be made most to the advantage of all the good people. I now consider an apology necessary for writing so much upon state matters, but I hope you will excuse it, when I assure you, my head happened [to] be engaged in politicks. AUGUST 15, 1785  I will now recollect in what state this may find you, much en[ga]ged in haying, no, nearly finished, supposed, & I hope you have not injured your health by labour this hot weather.

  Dear Sir New York August 15th. 1785. I have had the pleasure to receive yours by Mr. Adams with the cypher accompanying it & am happy to hear of the recovery of your health.(1) I have only fail'd writing you by two of the packets the first of wh. sail'd before, I had been advis'd, she wod., & the 2d while I was ill of a pleurisy wh. I caught by walking in the rain to Congress & had like to have given me my final repose. Colo. Smith, Mr Mazzai & Mrs. Macaulay Graham have since carried my letters to you, or rather took charge of them for that purpose. In those letters I gave you full information of the previous transactions in Congress as well as of the important business still before us. It therefore now remains to give you the progress since that time. {The report proposing to invest Congress with the power to regulate commerce hath been twice before Congress in committee of the whole.}(2) It met with no opponant except {the president}, by this I do not mean that there were no others oppos'd to it, for the contrary is the case. They however said but little or rather committed their side of the question to his care. In favor of it there were but few speakers also. {The committee came to no [conclusion?] but desired leave to sit again}. A second plan hath been propos'd, {a navigation act digested here} & {recommended to the States}. This hath not been presented but probably will be. One wod. expect in a {particular quarter of the union perfect concert in this business} yet this is not altogether the case. The 2d plan above attended to takes its origin {with MacHenry. The Eastern people} wish something more lasting & will of course in the first instance not agree to it. They must therefore come in with that propos'd in {the report}. You will ask me why they hesitate? To be candid I believe it arises from the real magnitude of the subject, for I have the most confidential communications with them and am satisfied they act ingenuously. {They fear the consequences} may possibly result from it. The longer it is delay'd the more  AUGUST 15, 1785  certain is its passage thro {the several states} ul[ti]mately. Their minds will be better inform'd by evidences within their views of the necessity of {committing the power to Congress} for {the commerce of the union is daily declining; the merchants of this town} own I am told not more than {two ships}. I wish much to hear from you upon this subject. I expect it will be brought on again shortly, if for the purpose only of {committing it to the jousnals}. It may then be delay'd for sometime untill we may obtain full {information on it: the report changing the instructions for forming commercial treaties} will I believe be adopted.(3) {It changes the principle} & puts an end to that {of the right of the most favored nation}. The policy of forming {a treaty with powers} not having {possessions in the West Indies is doubted} since from them we can obtain as much without as {with a treaty}, and such {treaties} whether upon that or any other {principle} in effecting the main object we have in view, {the opening the islands by treaty} with those who have them, may embarrass us. This is conceiv'd to be the only end wh. can be obtain'd upon principles of expedience to us {by treaty}. Of course that with {Sweden} &ca is unfortunate. Mr. {Adams} seems to suppose {the principal object in his mission to the court of London was the formation of a treaty}; but the contrary was certainly the case: it was merely {to conciliate}, & prevent {a variance} wh. seem'd to threaten at that time. He might however readily make this mistake under the present instructions. {A treaty} is not expected & I am satisfied the majority here wish all propositions on that head to cease, at least for the present, and untill {our restrictions on their commerce have effected a different disposition}. Mr. {Jay is authorised to treat with} Mr. {Gardoqui} upon {the subjects arising between the two parties. He is to lay every proposition before Congress before he enters into any engagement with him. As yet we have heard nothing from him}. The {consulate convention lately formed with France} is universally {disapproved}. It was form'd under instructions {but} in the opinion of {the secretary of foreign affairs hath been deviated from}.(4) I have not had time to examine it attentively so cannot decide as to this fact. I shall sit out on the first of Sepr. for the Indian treaty on the Ohio & return thence thro Virga., & provided I shall be continued in Congress, to this place. I shall however attend the fOEderal court for the trial of the controversy between Massachusetts & New York in Novr. so that I doubt whether I shall reach this before Decr. or Jany. next. The requisition will pass I expect this week & most of the important business remaining in a train for decision or be postpond for the winter. I have however no expectation that Congress will adjourn for the present year. I intended to have given you something of domestic news but am inform'd the mail is just closing. By this however, do not suppose that I have anything worthy communication for the contrary is the case, I shod. be forc'd to look about me to find out any thing   you wod. have patience to read. A Lee is elected in the Bd. of treasury---;we were under the necessity of having someone from the State(5) and advocated his appointment. How is Miss Patsy? How is Short? How are they pleas'd with France. I must observe that {Congress} seem to expect {the court of France will send a minister here}. To visit you wod. give me infinite pleasure---;whether I shall be able or not depends on circumstances. If I do it will be in the spring after Congress adjourn or at least the most import[an]t business is finish'd. I send you the journals and am dear Sir yr. affectionate friend & servt., Jas. Monroe ""

  Sir, New York Augt. 18th. 1785 I have received a letter from Col. Sherburn(1) officially informing me that the Genl. Assembly, at their last Session, had appointed me Chief Justice of the Superior Court. This appointment, which was intirely unsollicited for and unexpected by me and my most intimate friends, in itself consider'd, dos me great honour; but when I consider it as a mark of their approbation of my conduct in an important public character the honour is increased and demands my most grateful acknowledgment. Please, Sir, to permit me through the channel of this letter to present my thanks to the honble The Genl. Assembly for this fresh instance of their favour and confidence. But honorable as this appointment is, there are some objections to my accepting it, which I must beg leave to mention, together with a few reasons in support of those objections. The objections are, the precarious tenure by which the Judges hold their offices, and the small salaries annexed to them.(2) I am a friend to annual elections in general, and to moderate salaries; but it may be a question whether it would not be more beneficial to a State to appoint there judges during good behaviour, or for a term of years with a capacity of re-election at the termination of the period, than to appoint them annually. Almost every State in the Union hath adopted one or other of these tenures: And it is to be presumed that an assurance of continuance in office for a few years only might be an inducement to gentlemen to qualify themselves to fill the bench with respectability, and to such as might be qualified to accept when they should be chosen. With respect to the salaries of the Judges of the Superior Court, I believe there are but few who would think them immoderate if a considerable addition should be made to them. In establishing the salaries of officers, a regard, I think, ought to be had to the importance of the office, and to the qualifications requisite  AUGUST 18, 1785  to a right discharge of it. The office of Judge of the Superior Court is one of the most important offices in a State; for in that court decisions are had on the property, the character, the liberty, the life of the citizen; and is it probable that a man would employ so much time and attention as are necessary to form a proper judgment on those important questions, without a compensation proportioned to his services? Unless a man is possessed of a steady income sufficient for the decent support of himself and his family, his attention must be divided between the duties of his office, and the duties of his family, and amidst this distraction I should think he could not give that constant, undisturbed attention to the former, which I deem requisite to a proper discharge of it. There are but few men in the State possessed of such an income, I am not, and I believe it would be difficult to find, of that few a sufficient number of qualified persons so disinterested as to quit their ease to serve the State for nought or next to nothing. Honorable salaries may be some security, perhaps, against corruption; but in my opinion the best guard is an uniform character of virtue and integrity. Poverty subjects a man to many temptations; but Lord Bacon, who could not really want money, was corrupted. To these objections, and the arguments in support of them which I have briefly touched upon I must add, that there are several important matters before Congress that require nine States, and the present representation is not so complete as to admit the absence of one State. Notwithstanding these objections, to show to the Honorable Genl. Assembly that I am disposed to serve the State in any honorable employment they may be pleased to bestow upon me, I will accept of the appointment to the Judge's seat, provided there are a sufficient number of Judges to constitute a court without me, and my absence can be dispensed with until the adjournment of Congress:(3) Relying that the Genl. Assembly will make such a decent provision for the support of the Superior bench as shall be suitable to the circumstances of the State, and the importance of that bench. I am with sentiments of the highest respect for your Excelly., and The Honorable The General Assembly Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, William Ellery  ""

  S'r, Stratford(1) 18th Augt. 1785. Your Excell'ys favr. of the 8th Instt. was forwarded to me here from N York having arrived there at a time when Congress was in recess for a few Days.(2) The Vote of Congress which occasioned the Request mentioned by yr. Excell'y will be most effectually complyed with by transmitting copies of the New Statute Book.(3) The purpose of the Vote was that Congress and the States respectively might be better informed than they at present appeared to be of the several Systems of Law and was Limited in the manner you see because in most of the States all the Laws previous to Septr. 1774 have been disanulled, and in few of them, if any, has there been so effectual a Revision of their laws as in this State, and it was tho't that the Laws passed since the connection with G. Britain was dissolved would give a tolerable Idea of the Jurisprudence of each State. The object is to be informed of the present state of the Laws in each State which with respect to Connecticut can only be known from the New Revised Law Book. One copy only will be reserved by Congress, and the remainder transmitted to the 12 other States in Exchange for which you will Receive Copies of the Laws of Mass'tts and other sister States. The intention was also that all future Acts sho'd be continued to be Exchanged in like manner so that Congress and each particular State sho'd always be informed of the Laws Enacted and in force throughout the Union, which it was conceived would probably be productive of much Harmony and Uniformity, as well as other beneficial Effects to the United States. By the desire of the Delegates of Massachusetts Bay I enclose yr. Ex'y Copy of the late Navigat'n Act of that State which as they said they were directed by their Legislat'r to transmit thro' their Delegates to the several States in Union with their wishes that this or something similar to it might be adopted by the other States.(4) I am sorry to acquaint yr. Excell'y that I have been impatiently waiting here more than a fortnight for such supplies from the Treas'y as were necessary to enable me to return to N.Y. I wrote the Treas'r from thence that it would be necessary for me to receive a remittance from him before I could return and hoped I sho'd be detained here only three or four Days, but received a Letter from him two Days after my Arrival acquaint'g me that there was no money in the Treas'y but that I might depend upon the first that came in. Since which I have sent again to Hartford but received the same answer. I am extremely chagrined at my situation as I know the most consequential Business of Congress is now unavoidably delayed for want of a fuller Representation and I cannot endure that Conn't especially being now an adjoining State to the residence of Congress sho'd be in any regard deficient or occasion any delay in the important affairs of the Nation.(5) Could I  AUGUST 18, 1785  have relieved myself by my own resources or particular Credit I sho'd have returned immediately but I have hitherto found it impossible there seeming to be no Money left in this part of the Country. I am extremely happy to find yr. Health is so happily restored. Augt. 19th. P.S. Since writing the above I received yr. Excell's Letter of the 10th Instt. something similar to wh'h from the impatience I know Congress feel at the neglect of Representation I expected to have recd. 10 Days ago. The sole reason of my Absence is as above mentioned. But I have the pleasure to acquaint yr. Excell'y that by the very obliging Interposition of the Hon'l Judges of the Supr.

We have delayed any communication with congress upon this subject, with an intention to state to your excellency our sentiments upon the probable tendency & consequences of the measure should it be adopted by Congress and acceeded to by the states.(2) We are sensible that our duty points out a prompt and exact obedience to the acts and instructions of the Legislature, but if a case arises wherein we discover most clearly consequences so fatal; that had they been known perhaps the measure adopted would not have been proposed, it may not be improper to delay a final execution untill we have the instructions of the Legislature after such pernicious consequences of the measure shall have been submitted to their examination. But this may be a questionable opinion, we will therefore, ask the advise of the supreme executive concerning it; & that they may truely know our situation, we will fully communicate our sentiments on the plan proposed for a revision of the confederation.

  Dear Sir New York Augt. 21st. 1785. Your favor of (1) has come to hand; I am sorry to hear the doc- trine of paper money begins to rear up it's head in our State. This subject has been so well investigated at different periods that I can hardly think any reasonable man can advocate it, unless for the purpose of advancing some object of interest; I remember in the old Government that our exchange rose to 65 Per Ct. This alarmed the merchants so much that the King determined to give his assent to no more paper money bills. Agreable to your request I have made inquiry respecting the paper money of Pensylvany; I understand from Colo. Biddle that it is in a state of depreciation. It will however buy goods, under the inconvenience of an additional advance; almost every body says it is mighty good, yet nobody will part with ready money for it at an equal exchange. As I go through Philada. on my return to Virginia I will make the most minute investigation into the matter and furnish you with the result of my inquiries in time for the meeting of our Assembly. We have done very little since I wrote you last; the States have been so irregularly represented, that it has been impracticable to act upon any matter of consequence; the requisition is still before Congress, and I expect will pass as soon as a sufficient number of States are upon the floor. It rests however at present on principles which are not intirely advantageous to our State;(2) although from a disposition which has lately appeared I think the State will be able to get better terms. I agree with you intirely as to the necessity of a requisition at any rate. Otherwise the public Creditors might be so clamorous, as to render the Govermnt. in some degree odious. The Mint is still before Congress, and it is uncertain whether anything will be done in it this year.(3) The Post Office is also under consideration, and I am apt to believe the following alteration will take effect: To transfer the transportation of the Mail to the Stages; & to oblige all Sea Captains to deliver in their letters to the Post Office before they are admitted to an entry. The first alteration will furnish three mails a week through our State, & with much more expedition. AUGUST 21, 1785  A Post to Canada from New York is talk'd of, also one from Alexandria to fort Pitt.(4) The change of the 9th article of the confederation hath been the subject of debate for two day's, & I expect will be taken up shortly again; there appears to be a variety of objections to the change, & I imagine the Members will not even consent to a recommendation witht. previous instructions from the legislatures. A commission has pass'd Congress to negotiate with & Mr. Gardoqui, under the direction of Congress; nothing has as yet transpired, neither can I form any idea of what will be the result. There has been no other information from Mr. Adams, except that he hath been received according to the established forms. Mr. Marbois has withdrawn the application for Lonchamp. A nephew of mine has been here & giv'n me an account of the Convention at Kentucki: from which I conclude an application will be made to our legislature to grant them independance.(5) This matter has been the subject of conversation here, & an opinion begins to prevail that a State has no right to dismember itself witht. the previous consent of the U. S. Indeed this doctrine appears to me to be founded on the nature of things, & to require no comment to support it. Should our legislature take up this opinion I presume the negotiation will be carried on through Congress, when an admission into the confederation may be stipulated at the same time the actual dismembrement takes effect. I do not know that it will be for the interest of our State to withhold independance from them although asked at an unreasonable time for themselves, yet it surely is a matter of consequence to her, that at the time they cease to be a part of Virginia, they become a part of the fOEderal Union; The different States can have no other interest in this event than that of dismembering the State of Virga. of whose magnitude they are jealous: They are then gratified with a simple dismembrement witht. admitting the new State into the ConfOEderation; Will it not therefore be proper to make the dismembrement & admission into the Union Co-existent acts & mutually dependant on each other. There seems to be another reason why this mode should be preferred; the conditions for the security of property & other matters will be more likely to be observed, if the pacta conventa are tripartite, & the U. S. as one of the dramatis personæ can be induced to guaranty them; indeed if the new State is to take upon itself the payment of any part of the public debt I should think it proper the U. S. should admit it to become debtor pro tanto & the old one exonerated in the same proportion. These are thoughts at first new, and I do not doubt but ideas on this subject much more proper have suggested themselves to your mind. The fOEderal buildings at Trenton seems rather to lose than to gain ground. A third Commissioner is wanting without whom the other two are useless & a sufficient number of States has not yet been found to  AUGUST 21,1785  appoint him. I believe the 30,000 dollars in the requisition for the construction of these buildings will not stand.(6) Some of the Eastern States have kick'd up about the money. If it was not for fear of the imputation of instability I would as soon as No. Carolina is represented move to adjourn to Philada; perhaps this is at present the properest place at least till we can see our way clearer to the Westward. Mr. Jay is directed to report the number of Consuls necessary & the places of destination. Some gentlemen are of opinion we may have Consuls witht. treaties.(7) Our friend Colo. Monroe sets out in a day or two for the Indian Treaty at the mouth of the Great Miami: from thence he proceeds to Kentucki on some private business & so through the Wilderness to Virga. From yr.

  Sr. New York Aug. 21st. 1785 Your Excelly. no doubt in perusing the late Journals of Congress have seen your delegates, negative, to every motion respecting the building a federal Town, our reasons therefor were not because we disliked the measure, But that we supposed ourselves very unable at this time to engage in a matter of such moment, when we were in no  AUGUST 21, 1785  condition to pay the intrest arrising on our public debts---;and if the land was to be purchased---;and the Town built, it must be done with moneys to be borrowed. It has been suggested that should we miss this oppertunity of erecting this Town on the Deleware, that the southern gentlemen will have influence sufficient to get the permanent residence of Congress on the Petomac. For my part I have no such fears about me, nor do I think it can possibly be admitted by a mind susceptible of consideration---;when we reflect that their are thirteen states in the union, Six to the No. Ward, & six to the southwd. of Pennsylvania, that, that state having the castg. vote, will consent that the town shall be built on the Petomac in preference to its being on the Deleware, and until we have another southern State, acknowledged & that cannot possibly be agreed to, I think (unless that power can be ballanced by acknowledging a Northern State) we are very well as we are, and run no risk of going far from the Deleware. I expect the question for advanceg. money for the purpose of building this Town will soon come forward(1)---;and my wishing for advice from your Excelly in this matter has induced me to beg your opinion respecting the same, as soon as you can with convenience. I wrote a letter and Joined my Colleague in another to his Excelly the late President on the subject,(2) but was never so happy as to get an answer, or any directions. Your Excelly must be convinced that our opposition to this measure arises from a conviction of our inability, only. For you may be assured that were we able no person on earth would be more in earnest to bring about the same. For when Congress has a fixed residence, they will be better respected both at home and abroad---;Their Acts & resolves paid more attention to---;And the Union so cemented, that a dissolution could not possibly take place. In conformity to your directions Mr Sullivan was elected by Congress a surveyor of lands in the Western territory for the state of N.H. I did myself the Honr. to advise your Excelly. thereof by Mr Sheafe who left this City 4 or 5 days ago.(3) And by whom the Secy. of Congress has gave Mr Sullivan Official notice that he may proceed on the business of his appointment without loss of time.

  My dear Sir, New York 22d Aug. 1785. I think I am indebted to you for a letter before, I had the pleasure of seeing you last: but this is to inquire after your health fearing it may have suffered in your late journey. You may recollect I mentiond to you my opinion respecting altering the confederation, or making farther attempts to do it. And I am more confirmed in that opinion since you left us, from the debates in Congress, upon the necessity of each State being represented by three members, or that three members should always attend Congress while they are sitting; this appears to Congress to be of the greatest importance to our new Government, & unless the States can be convinced of it, & effectual measures taken to keep up a full representation, our federal union will soon tremble to the foundation, & I fear this will be the case before the states will be convinced: the business of Congress, in my opinion, this year, might have been done in six months, and we have been together almost ten, doing the public business, and endeavoring to make a Congress to do it; and a great part of the most important business is still unfinished, & there, for ought I know, must remain forever; but this may be said to be owing to a fault in the confederation. I answer, that will not be allowed by the most observing persons here, for I believe Congress, would be at a great loss what to propose as an amendment if the confederation was now before them for that purpose. Congress have taken several methods heretofore, by writing to the supreme Executives, and otherwise, to bring on the members of Congress, but nothing as yet answers the purpose: a few days since they have come into a number of additional resolutions upon the subject, & ordered a list of the attendance of the several members to be laid monthly before the several Legislators,(1) & to endeavor to convince them of the absolute necessity of their attention to the same and that whatever the consequences may be to the Union, from the States not being fully represented, the members attending have done their duty. Congress have taken into consideration the conduct of Capt. Stanhope to Govr. Bowdoin, & I hope his Excellency will be satisfied with their proceedings; I would forward him a copy, but it is ordered to be done officially.(2) I believe you was sensible while here, that I had taken pains to have Doctor Rodgers appointed one of the chaplains of Congress,(3) & it gives me satisfaction to find he is so well liked, by the members in general. The President of Congress being out of health, has taken leave of us for the present, & by a resolution of Congress; a chairman is to conduct  AUGUST 22, 1785  the affairs in his absence, & being honored with the appointment,4 I do not expect to have the pleasure of making you my personal respects till after the first Monday in November.

  My dear Sir New york 22d Aug. 1785. I have been favoured with your attention of the 23d of July & thank you for the intelligence therein contained. All my correspondents give me nearly the same Account, that there was no intention in the court to cast a slight upon me; but that some particular members were willing that I should be considered as not eligible might be the case, & votes prepared accordingly. The matter has been taken notice of by my particular friends here, and inquiry made for the True reason, & it is said by all that it appears to be a mistake, supposing me not eligible, and that being the case, they say surely the court will set the matter right when they come together again, as they have appointed but five gentlemen when they have a right to elect seven; however, the honorble court will conduct as they think most proper. Last week, the President of Congress being out of health took leave of us for the present, and in that case a chairman is to be appointed to conduct the affairs in Congress, & the ballots being taken I was unanimously elected. I am sensible of the high honor done me by the united States in Congress assembled & am endeavoring to discharge the important business expected of me but I fear it will be too much for my health this hot weather.

  Sir, New York Aug. 23, 1785. In pursuance of the instruction of the Hon. the General Assembly a motion has been made in Congress by your delegates for the settlement of the accounts of Mr. Thomas Greene.(1) As to any loss, or derangement of accounts or vouchers the resolutions of June 3, 1784 seemed to your delegates to vest the Commissioners with every necessary power to enable them to do justice;(2) and these powers of Chancery are, by subsequent resolutions expressly extended to the Commissioner of army accounts, & to the Commissioners for settling the accounts of the five great departments: The only necessary additional measure seemed to be that the Commissioner for the State should be authorised to settle Mr. Greens accounts which by the existing arrangements of Congress ought to be settled by the Commissioner for the department under which the accounts arose. A resolution to this effect was obtained one day & repeated the next day as the journals will discover; and the motion of your delegates finally referred to the Board of War to report, & their report has not yet made its appearance.(3) The settlement of accounts as well those exist[ing] betwixt the several States & the U. States, as those existing betwixt individuals & the U. States is an object of great extent & importance & engages much of the attention of Congress. Individuals contribute to the public exigences with great reluctance while they are not only kept out of the principal & even interest due to them from the public, but cannot even obtain a settlement of their accounts: And an apprehension in each State almost in the Union that they are in advance compared with their Sister States retards, or prevents those exertions which are  AUGUST 23, 1785  necessary to put them in capacity to send forward annually their Quota to the Common Treasury. To a settlement of accounts betwixt the several States & the U. States it ought to be remembered that a fOEderal rule of apportionment is indispensable. It therefore becomes necessary for every State to decide whether they will adhere to the rule established in the eighth article of the Confederation; or adopt the alteration recommended on the 18th day of April 1783.(4) It has been & still is my private opinion that the whole, instead of three fifths of the Blacks ought to have been taken into the estimation. In that case the rule might have approached so nearly to justice as to have been admissible, especially as it has a superior facility in Execution: But whether it ought not even as it is to be adopted in preference to no rule---;or the hazard of delay & embarrassment in all our pecuniary operations is a question of policy & which is, in my humble opinion, entitled to a very serious consideration. I am happy that I shall be readily pardoned for not giving my advice on this Subject. An attention to the actual Situation & population of the Southern States where the blacks are most numerous will suggest a probability that in time the proposed rule of apportionment will become less objectionable. After you leave the Sea cost, the moist & intervail lands near the mouth of the great rivers & pass on westward towards the mountains & more especially over the mountains westward, the lands are cultivated by white people, whose method of life & manners are similar to the middle & northern States, from which they are mostly supplied with settlers. So that the number of blacks compared with the whites even in those States will probably diminish in future. And for the sake of humanity this is greatly to be desired. Should a wise policy discontinue the importation of blacks their ratio to the whites will on this account also diminish---;And even the ratio of the States, in which the blacks are numerous, to the aggregate of the U. States will gradually diminish as the tide of population rolls westward & new States arise peopled from Europe where the Slavery of the blacks is unknown, or from the northern States where it is reprobated. On all these accounts the proposed rule of quotaing the States will probably in future approximate to justice. In this as in many other cases a choice of difficulties only presents itself. As it happens this is only a question of property which does not affect the Liberties of the States. The consequences therefore may be faced with less reluctance. The reception of the Hon. Mr. Adams as Minister plenipotentiary at the Court of London has been announced in the public Newspapers. From the communications he has made to Congress it appears that his reception & treatment hitherto has been unexceptionable; but no   conjecture can be founded as to the probable success of his negotiations. Common report says that the Western posts will be given up before next Spring. While the British hold possession of those posts the fur trade will be forced through Canada; but the natural channel for it is through the U. States. And it is well known to be a very profitable trade. While these posts are held by the British too the Indians will hardly be prevailed on, by seeing only paper & parchments, to believe that the U. States are in fact the Sovereigns of that Country; hence it is that ill minded people, who have studied to disquiet the minds of the Indians & frustrate our designs as to sale of the Western lands, have so far succeeded as to induce several of the Sachems of the six nations to apply to Colonel Harmar, commanding officer of our troops to the westward, to take back the original instruments of the two late Treaties, alledging that they had been informed that they were imposed on at those treaties when they were told that the Great king over the Water had ceded that Country to the thirteen fires, &c. But after interchanging a friendly talk they returned to their homes apparently satisfied.(5) Another object of Mr. Adams's mission & which is of principal importance is to obtain a commercial Treaty with the British nation founded on principles of reciprocal advantage. One great obstruction in his way, it is apprehended, will be the incompetence of the powers of Congress to make specific & effective Stipulation for reciprocating commercial advantages with the other party. It seems to be the opinion even of Congress, or of a great majority thereof that they ought to be vested with power to regulate commerce generally. Many propositions & plans have been suggested. One is an alteration of the confederation so as to vest Congress with the power of regulating trade without limitation of time. Others propose a limitation of 25---;15---; or 10 years: Others have proposed that a navigation act be framed & laid before the Legislatures of the several States for their adoption for a term of years. Others there are, who are of opinion that we can go on very well in the present way. They say that the produce of the Southern States, being delivered from British monopoly & admitting to the ports the competition of all the World, fetches as good a price & frequently more & better pay than it did before the revolution. And they fear that the consequences of a navigation act, or of power to regulate trade in the hands of Congress might eventually be throwing a monopoly of the carrying trade into the hands of a few States, who would set their own price also on the produce to be exported, whereby they apprehend a very great injury to the Southern planters. Amidst   this division of sentiments & clashing of interests little is to be expected from the deliberations of the present Congress on this Subject. The voice of the people must come forward & give birth to some System.(6) Some days ago the President of Congress asked permission to make a tour in the Country for the benefit of his health. He proposes to visit the calybeate waters in Pennsylvania & to return in two or three weeks. At present only seven States are represented in Congress. Letters have been lately written to the delinquint States & a fuller House is expected soon. It is about three weeks since my Colleague has been confined to House & of course the State has not been represented: He is now happily recovering & expects to take his seat soon.(7) Having been in hopes of returning before now I have made no application lately for money. I am now reduced to my last penny, nay I have not enough to pay my debts here. I am therefore under the necessity of requesting that effectual measures may be taken by the State to forward me some Cash by the first oppertunity. I have not enclosed a copy of the journals as I conclude they are regularly transmitted to your Excellency every month by the Secretary of Congress. With the most perfect consideration, I have the honor to be Your Excellencys most obedient & very hble Servt. David Howell ""

  Sir, New York 23d August 1785 We had the Honor under the 18th Instant, to inform You generally that the Dispatches received from your Excellency, to that Date, were disposed of agreably to your Communications. Having a leisure Moment, which is not often the Case, We shall be more particular at this Time in our Answer to your Excellency's Letters. We have delivered to Congress the Act of the Legislature for altering the 8th Article of the Confederation:1 their Resolve respecting Samuel Stearns:(2) another Resolve authorizing Congress to appoint Commissioners, for running a boundary Line (therein described) between the States of Massachusetts & New York, the Delegates Whereof have met on the Business but have not yet been able to agree on suitable persons for the purpose mentioned:(3) a Copy of Governor Carltons Letter respecting the eastern Boundary of Massachusetts, a Report relative to which, being now on the Files of Congress, We shall call for, as soon as nine States, which rarely meet in Congress, shall again be represented.4 We have also delivered to each Delegation, the Act of Massachusetts for  AUGUST 23, 1785  regulating foreign Commerce, & urged the Necessity of similar Measures, to be adopted by the Legislatures respectively.(5) The three Letters from your Excellency to Governor Clinton are likewise delivered, & agreably to your Request, We have conferred with him on the Subject of that which respects the Sale of Lands claimed by the two States.(6) As the Governor's part in this Matter is merely executive, he can do nothing but communicate the same to the Legislature: & assures Us, that this shall be done at an early period. The Governor conducted with his usual Candour on this Occasion; he nevertheless appeared to be strongly impressed with the Idea, that as Massachusetts were merely Claimants of the contested Lands, & New York not only claims but have ever been in possession of them, there is a manifest propriety in the Conduct of the latter, in continuing to administer Government & to dispose of the Lands, untill a Decision shall be made in Favour of the former. We endeavoured to shew the Impropriety of such Conduct, by stating to him amongst other Considerations, that if the Decree of the fOEderal Court shall be in Favour of Massachusetts, the State must adopt one of these disagreable Alternatives: they must either confirm those unconstitutional & illegal Grants of New York at the Expence of the Value of the Lands so granted; or annulling the Grants, be under the Necessity of constraining & perhaps of coerceing the Grantees to relinquish their Claims under New York: unless the Legislature thereof should consent to a Measure not to be expected, a Reimbursement of the Money (excepting Charges) which may arise from the Sales: & even in this Case, Massachusetts might be dissatisfied both with the Sales & Expence attending them. We likewise suggested to the Governor, that in the Case of Vermont, Congress were expressly opposed to a sale of the contested Lands; that if the State of New York should be permitted to proceed in this Business, the Settlers under those Grants would probably be so prejudiced against the Government of Massachusetts, as to produce such unfortunate Consequences as those which resulted from the inveterate Hatred of the Wyoming Settlers to the Pennsylvania Grantees: We likewise hinted to the Governor, that Massachusetts being desirous (let the Result of the fOEderal Court be pro or con,) to preserve Harmony with N York, had taken mild steps at the Commencement of this Business, but that if the latter should persist in her Measures, the former would probably issue a proclamation forbidding Settlements under the Authority of N York, & would also remonstrate against her proceedings. Your Excellency is undoubtedly informed that Mr Royal Flynt is proposed by the Board of Treasury, as a Commissioner to liquidate the Accounts of the U. States with Massachusetts.(7) We have no Knowledge of his Character but what is derived from Letters to the Board from   General Knox, & Colonel Wadsworth: they speak of him in high Terms, as a person of Integrity, abilities & Assiduity, & our Confidence in him is established by their Opinion. We have communicated to the Board, \""the Sentiments of the Committee for stating & methodizing the publick accounts\"" & also your Excellencys Desire, that the Commissioner abovementioned, should attend his Business in Boston untill the Accounts referred to are adjusted: & We have no Reason to doubt, that the Board will make the necessary Arrangements. We observe that the honble Legislature are concerned to find \""that some States in the Union have paid no part of the last requisition of Congress, & that others have applied Monies raised for the Use of Congress to other purposes.\"" We felt a similar Anxiety, previous to the Receipt of your Excellency's Letter, when the Requisition of the present Year was under Consideration, endeavoured to have this Matter so conducted as to guard against those Evils. Should We succeed in our Measures, & a sufficient Number of States be collected to pass the Requisition, We flatter Ourselves the Evils will be principally remedied. We have therefore tho't it best to defer a Remonstrance against the Departure of States, from the Applications made by Congress of Monies raised in pursuance of their Requisitions, lest the Harmony of Congress should be interrupted & the Requisition of this Year be negatived. We shall most assuredly discharge our Duty in promoting public oeconomy & in satisfying public Creditors; as well as in preventing foreign Loans, to which unless indispensibly necessary, We have been ever averse. We are happy to find our opposition in the first Instance to a standing Army, approved by the Legislature: being clearly of opinion, that should such a power vest in Congress, it would sooner or later terminate in the Subversion of our Liberties. Inclosed is the Copy of a Resolution of Congress for obtaining from the States such of their Acts as respect the united States.(8) We think it necessary that the Communication of the Acts of Congress & of the Legislature of Massachusetts should be made by the supreme Executive & the Delegates of the State for their Information respectively; but this Communication will on the part of the Delegates be often impracticable, as their Engagements, without the Assistance of a Clerk, will not admit thereof. We have the Honor to be with perfect Consideration your Excellency's most obedt & very humble Serts, E Gerry S.

  (Circular) Sir, Office of the Secretary of Congress, August 24th. 1785 I beg leave to remind your Excellency that all the calls which Congress have heretofore made on the States for money or supplies have been on this express condition, that the sums or supplies assessed should not be considered as the proportion of any State, but that being paid or furnished, they should be placed to their respective Credits, bearing an interest of six per Cent per Annum until the quota should be finally ascertained and adjusted by the Congress of the United States agreeably to the eighth of the Articles of Confederation---;And if then it should appear that any State had been assessed more than its just quota, it should continue to receive interest on the surplus, and if less it should be charged interest on the deficiency until by a future tax such deficiency shall be properly adjusted. From the progress that is made in settling the Accounts between the United States and individual States and private Creditors within the same, and the measures taken to hasten & facilitate the progress of such settlements, there is reason to hope that this great work will soon be compleated. And as almost every State seems to think its advances have exceeded its just proportion, it is therefore become necessary and essential to the harmony of the Union that Congress should be furnished with the means of settling the proportions to be borne by each State as well of the general expences of the War and the requisitions made since the conclusion thereof, as of the sums which may from time to time be requisite for the common defence and general welfare. To this end I beg leave to call your attention to sundry Acts of Congress on this subject, which you will find enclosed---;Viz. One passed 20th February 1782,(1) which is founded on this consideration, that the States having been variously affected by the War, the rule of the Confederation strictly adhered to might not produce that equal justice, which is desireable in this important object. One of the 17th of Feby 1783(2) which calls for a return of the quantity of land in each State granted to, or surveyed for any person, the number of buildings thereon, distinguishing dwelling houses from other buildings--and AUGUST 24, 1785  the number of Inhabitants, distinguishing white from black. And one of the 18th of April(3) recommending an alteration of the 8th of the Articles of Confederation, and perpetual union, and the adoption of a new rule of ascertaining the quotas of the States. This is comprehended in the act, and is a part of the plan at that time recommended to the States, for restoring and supporting public credit; for obtaining permanent and adequate funds, to discharge the Interest and principal of the debt contracted and for providing for the future exigencies of the Union. The necessity of a rule to apportion the common expence, and the difficulties, delays and expence in the way of obtaining that pointed out by the Confederation, induced Congress to recommend this change; and the rather as the number of Inhabitants, at least of the white Inhabitants, is required for other purposes of the Confederation. Besides it was conceived, that this rule would do more Justice, and produce less discontents among the States; and, although not altogether free from objections, that it was liable to fewer than any other, that could be devised; and that therefore the application of it, to ascertain the quotas of the State, would supercede the necessity and save the expence and trouble of making a valuation of the lands, with the buildings and improvements thereon. The favourable reception this recommendation has met with, induces a belief, that this alteration will be finally adopted. By examining the files in this office, I find that eight States have agreed to it---;namely Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.

Dandridge, \""Proposals of Nine Printers for a New Edition of the Journals of the Continental Congress, 1785,\"" University of Virginia, Bibliographical Society, Studies in Bibliography 2 (1949): 189--;96. Thomson's recommendation that these proposals be referred to committee for evaluation was eventually adopted on December 28, and the committee subsequently reported on January 30, 1786. Congress' failure to act on the committee's recommendations was undoubtedly the product of its poverty, as the expense of a new edition of the journals would greatly exceed its resources. It was later decided that Thomson instead simply procure a printed index to the journals already printed, but this August 15, 1786, directive also came to naught.

  Dear Sir. New York 28th August [17]85. I was honored with your Excellencys favor by the last post.  It affords me pleasure to hear that your health is amended, I very much hope that your excursion will be productive of benefit fully equal to your own expectations & the wishes of your friends. I have conferred with Colo Grayson on the subject of procuring a loan from Holland for the purpose of discharging our public debt in Virga. He does not seem to approve the idea of incurring a foreign debt; but concurred heartily in the propriety of appointing Doctr. Lee to the Hague. But however such a nommination may be favoured by  AUGUST 28, 1785  the wishes & efforts of the Virga Delegation I am induced to doubt of its success. On consulting Maryland I found they had it in Contemplation to nominate Governor Paca & seem'd to have calculated on us, in consequence of their union with us in the election of Mr Lee to the Office he now holds.(1) Rhode Island would join us with pleasure; but the Committee of qualifications are unanimous in the Opinion that the time of that Delegation has expired, & I expect daily there will be a vote of Congress to that effect.(2) On the other States to the Eastward there is no dependance; & on South Carolina & Georgia there is still less, as both those states are still sore on their late disappointment. In this situation I have thought it expedient to defer nominating Mr Lee untill I discover a greater prospect of success. The moment I do; it will afford me pleasure to bring to the view of Congress the wishes of the state, & to pursue the most effectual Steps to accomplish them. Mr Holten is elected Chairman;(3) we go on nearly as we have done for some Weeks past, sometimes with seven & never more than eight States on the floor.

  Dear Sir New York 3d. Sepr. 1785 I received your obliging favor by Captain Walden, and he has done Mr Gerry and myself the favor of conferring with him upon his proj- ect of introducing from Sweden coined copper to the amount of £100,000 Stg.(1) We called upon Mr. Livingston of the Treasury board, Mr. Osgood being absent, and introduced Captain Walden to him. We were induced to this measure because a Letter written by Capt. Walden to Congress before he left Boston had been referred to the board, who have under their consideration the whole subject of a mint. From the conversation that passed, and the proposals of Capt Walden as I understood them, I am induced to conclude that his plan is of that kind that would by no means advance the interest of the States---;the profit on the coinage of copper is very considerable in Great Britain and in most other nations of Europe. The value of coppers or British Half pence is nearly thirty per cent above their intrinsic value; the difference between this excess and the price or value of the Labor employed in the coinage, is a clear profit to the coiners. Very little profit can be made on the coinage of silver, less upon that of Gold, but take the copper coinage in connection with that of Gold & silver, and the mint will support itself. The United States have Eighty Tons of copper in their magazines; a company are here who brought with them from England the various machines & implements necessary for a coinage, and have rendered their services---;a coinage in our own Country is more pleasing than one abroad. Nevertheless Capt. Waldons proposals may be beneficial. Mr. Osgood will inform you fully of our situation relative to a federal court & other things. We have sent private Letters; and the Secretary has sent duplicates, and Triplicates, to Mr. Flemming & Mr. Sitgreaves, but no answer has come to hand.

  Sir, New York 3d September 1785 We have deferred a Communication of the Reasons which urged Us to suspend the Delivery to Congress, of your Excellency's Letter to them for reviewing & altering the Confederation, & to each of the Executives of the States on the same Subject; in Expectation of an Answer to the Letter which We had the Honor of addressing to You the 18th of August last:(1) but lest any Inconvenience should result from a longer Delay, We now beg Leave to suggest our Sentiments on the Subject. It may be necessary previously to observe, that many are of Opinion, the States have not yet had Experience sufficient to determine the Extent of powers vested in Congress by the Confederation; & therefore, that every Measure at this Time, proposing an Alteration, is premature. But admitting the Necessity, of immediately investing Congress with more commercial powers, it may be expedient to enquire. First. Whether good policy does not require, that those powers should be temporary? In determining this question, We are led to consider, the commercial Evils to be remedied: the Efficacy of temporary powers for this purpose: and the Disposition of the several States touching the Subject. The Evils principally consist, in the Impositions, Restrictions, & prohibitions of foreign powers on our Commerce; & in the Embarrassments resulting from the commercial Regulations of our own States. How far temporary powers can remedy these Evils, perhaps Time & Experience can only determine. Thus much may nevertheless be suggested, that as the several Treaties which are now negotiating by our Commissioners in Europe, are not to exceed the Term of fifteen Years; if the commercial powers to be vested in Congress should be of a similar Duration, they may remedy the Evils for that Term: & at the Expiration thereof, a new commercial Epoch will commence, when the States will have a more clear & comprehensive View of their commercial Interests, & of the best Means for promoting the same; whether by Treaties abroad, or by the Delegation & Exercise of greater commercial Powers at Home. Whatever the Disposition of the States may be, it can only be known by their Acts: but the different Views which they have had of the Subject give Reason to suppose, that  SEPTEMBER 3, 1785  some Legislatures will think temporary commercial powers elegible under present Circumstances; & should this be the Opinion of but one, an attempt immediately to delegate perpetual commercial powers, must fail, & may prevent a delegation of temporary powers---;for in politics as in private Life, by aiming at too much, We oft-times accomplish nothing. Secondly. If the States are unanimously disposed to increase the commercial powers of the Confederacy; should not the additional powers, be in the first Instance temporary; & the Adoption of them as part of the Confederation, depend on their beneficial Effects? This is a Question on which We propose not to venture a decided Opinion; but Experience teaches Us, that in the Formation of Constitutions & Laws, the wisest Men have not been able to foresee the Evasions & Abuses, which in the Operation have resulted from vague Terms & Expressions; latent Inconsistencies, artful Constructions, & from too full & unguarded a Delegation of powers. Whether the Subject of Commerce, & the Danger to which the States may be exposed by a Surrender to the Union of their commercial Authority, are so fully understood as to justify the Consideration of an immediate Alteration of the Confederation, is a Matter that the Legislatures alone are competent to determine---;any of them, who may not be clear with respect to either of those points, will probably (as in the other Case), be in the first Instance in Favour of temporary commercial powers, & if approved by Experience, of adopting them as part of the Confederation. But should all the States be in Favour of an immediate Alteration of the Articles, will it not be expedient for them, previously to consider? that, however great the abuse of this Trust may hereafter be; however greivous to a considerable part of the Union; the powers, once delegated in the Confederation, cannot be revoked without the unanimous Consent of the States---;that this, may be earnestly sought for, but never obtained?---;that the fOEderal & State Constitutions, are the great Bulwarks of Liberty---;that if they are subject, on trivial or even important Occasions, to be revised & re-revised, altered & re- altered, they must cease to be considered as effectual & sacred Barriers; & like land Marks frequently changed, will afford no certain Rule for ascertaining the Boundaries, no criterion for distinguishing between the Rights of Government, & those of the people. And therefore, that every Alteration of the Articles, should be so thoroughly understood & digested, as scarcely to admit the possibility of a Disposition for a Reconsideration. Thirdly. Shall any Alteration, either temporary or perpetual, be proposed in a Way, not expressly pointed out by the Confederation? The thirteenth article provides, \""that the Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, & the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any Alteration at any Time hereafter be made in any of them: unless such Alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the   united States, & be afterwards confirmed by the Legislature of every State.\"" Here, no provision is made, for or against a Convention, & therefore it may be said not to be inconsistent with this Article; but as the proceedings of a Convention would not be binding on Congress, should the latter think themselves under the Necessity of rejecting the Report of the former, would not the States, after having thus incurred a considerable Expence, be dissatisfied on the Occasion? would not the Members of the Convention, who, it must be supposed, would be Men of the first Abilities & Influence in the several States, be hurt, & opposed in this Instance to Congress? & would not parties, in the Legislatures & amongst the people, be the Consequence? if so, may not an Apprehension of these Evils, have a Tendency to influence some Members of Congress to give up their Opinion respecting the Report, rather than to be considered as pertinacious, & involved in Contentions? And if such are the prospects of a Convention, will not Congress consider it as being contrary to the Spirit of the Confederation? Indeed, We are doubtful, whether a Measure of this Kind, would not be veiwed as manifesting a Want of Confidence in Congress, & on this Ground, meet their Disapprobation. Fourthly. If an Alteration, either temporary or perpetual, of the commercial powers of Congress, is to be considered by a Convention, shall the latter be authorized to revise the Confederation generally, or only for express purposes? the great object of the Revolution, was the Establishment of good Government, & each of the States, in forming their own, as well as the fOEderal Constitution, have adopted republican principles---;notwithstanding this, plans have been artfully laid, & vigorously pursued, which had they been successful, We think, would inevitably have changed our republican Governments, into baleful Aristocracies. Those plans are frustrated, but the same Spirit remains in their abettors: And the Institution of the Cincinnati, honorable & beneficent as the Veiws may have been of the Officers who compose it, We fear, if not totally abolished, will have the same fatal Tendency.(2) What the Effect then may be, of calling a Convention to revise the Confederation generally, We leave with your Excellency & the honorable Legislature to determine. We are apprehensive & it is our Duty to declare it, that such a Measure would produce thro out the Union, an Exertion of the Friends of an Aristocracy, to send Members who would promote a Change of Government: & We can form some Judgment of the plan, which such Members would report to Congress. But should the Members be altogether republican, such have been the Declamations of designing Men against the Confederation generally: against the Rotation of Members, which perhaps is the best Check to Corruption & against the Mode of altering the Confederation by the unanimous Consent of the Legislatures, which effectually prevents Innovations in the Articles, by Intrigue or Surprize, that We think, there is   great Danger of Report which would invest Congress with powers, that the honorable Legislature have not the most distant Intention to delegate. Perhaps it may be said, this can produce no ill Effect; because Congress may correct the Report however exceptionable, or if passed by them, any of the States may refuse to ratify it---;true it is, that Congress & the States have such powers, but would not such a Report, affect the Tranquillity & weaken the Government of the Union? We have already considered the Operation of the Report as it would respect Congress; and if Animosities & parties would naturally arise from their rejecting it, how much would these be increased, if the Report approved by Congress & some of the States, should be rejected by other States? would there not be Danger of a party Spirit's being thus more generally diffused & warmly supported? far distant We know it to be from the honorable Legislature of Massachusetts, to give up a single principle of Republicanism, but when a general Revision, shall have proceeded from their Motion, & a Report which to them may be highly offensive, shall have been confirmed by seven States in Congress & ratified by several Legislatures, will not these be ready to charge Massachusetts with Inconsistency, in being the first to oppose a Measure, which the State will be said to have originated? Massachusetts has great Weight, & is considered as one of the most republican States in the Union; & When it is known that the Legislature have proposed a general Revision, there can be no Doubt, that they will be represented as being convinced of the Necessity of increasing generally, the powers of Congress, & the Opinion of the State will be urged with such Art, as to convince Numbers that the Articles of the Confederation are altogether exceptionable. Thus, whilst Measures are taken to guard against the Evils arising from the Want in one or two particulars, of power in Congress, We are in great Danger of incurring the other Extreme---;\""more power in Congress\"" has been the Cry from all quarters; but especially of those, whose Veiws, not being confined to a Government that will best promote the Happiness of the people, are extended to one that will afford lucrative Employments, civil & military. Such a government is an Aristocracy, which would require a standing Army, & a numerous Train of pensioners & placemen to prop & support its exalted Administration. To recommend ones self to such an Administration, would be to secure an Establishment for Life & at the same Time to provide for his posterity. These are pleasing prospects, which republican Governments do not afford, And it is not to be wondered at, that many persons of elevated Veiws & idle Habits in these States are desirous of the Change. We are for increasing the power of Congress, as far as it will promote the Happiness of the people; but at the same Time are clearly of Opinion, that every Measure should be avoided which would strengthen the Hands of the Enemies to a free Government: And that an administration of the present Confederation with all its Inconveniences, is preferable to   the Risque of general Dissentions & Animosities, which may approach to Anarchy & prepare the Way to a ruinous System of Government. Having thus, from a Sense of the Duty We owe to the United States as well as to our Constituents, communicated to your Excellency, our Sentiments on this important Subject; We request You to lay them before the honorable Legislature at their next Session, & to inform them, that their Measures for a general Revision of the Confederation, if confirmed, shall be immediately communicated to Congress; that no Time will be lost by the Suspension, since the Requisition & other important Matters before Congress, would have prevented them from an early Attention to the propositions of Massachusetts; & that, if these had been approved by Congress, many of the Legislatures, being now adjourned, could not take the same into Consideration.

Murray & others who are named in an Act of Assembly passed in 1783 (which Act it appeared to me ought not to have been made), and the Cases of some others, I have laid before Congress.(2) I got them referred to a Committee of whom I was one, but finding little probability of getting any new Resolution in their Favor, and conceiving those in existence would admit their Claims, if they could establish the Facts they set forth, I consulted the Paymr. Genl., who on examining into the Matter, agreed with me in Opinion as to Col. Murray & his Associates---;but as to the others I could not perceive a prospect of Success, & therefore withdrew the Papers. The Allowance of Depreciation, I presume, is to be settled by you---;the Commutation, by Mr. Pierce, I therefore inclose to you the Opinion he gave me in writing that you may give to the Applicants the proper Information, as I suppose they will apply to you. In Consequence of your Letter of the 19th Ult. I presented to Congress the Petition of Capt. McLean;(3) it was referred to the Secry. at War, whose Report I have not seen, but he has told me it must be against the Claim---;that he was of Opinion that what was done for the Invalids when at West Point & on their being sent from thence, was quite as much, if not more than the Resolutions of Congress would warrant; and Congress having passed their Ordinance of June last as a final Provision for the Invalids, will not farther meddle with the Business unless something extraordinary should appear in a Case to claim their Notice. You cannot be unapprized of the Importance of getting the Account of the State of Pennsa. with the United States settled. A settlement with all the States seems to me essentially necessary to their wellbeing, as we can take no radical Measures in Finance, nor draw any Revenues on Federal Principles till that shall be done and the Quotas established. There is such a Backwardness in the States on this Subject that we are contriving a Mode to give advantage to such States as shall be most forward in the Business, and I would wish the State of Pennsa. to be among the foremost in this as it is generally in all federal Measures. I hope to be in Phila. in the course of a Week or two, & shall wish to be furnished with the best Information you can give me as to the State of our Acct. with the U States---;I doubt not your readiness to give me this Information, nor your Judgment in the mode of stating it, I therefore think it needless to be more particular.

  Dear Sir, New York, 4th. Sep. 1785. Our townsman Mr. Dexter is here for the purpose of registering a quantity of public securities; among the certificates produced at the office of the Treasury there is one which is wholly a counterfeit. Mr. Peirce the late paymaster of the army, has requested me to direct him to some person in Massachusetts, to whom he may apply for assistance in detecting this public fraud.(1) I have recommended to Mr. Peirce to transmit such remarks upon this subject as he may think proper to you, and to request your aid. I pray you to give such assistance in this instance as may tend to a discovery of a fraud so injurious to the public and private interest. I am uneasy that I have it not in my power to inform you that all the Gentlemen appointed Judges of the federal Court have accepted.

  My dear sir, New York 5th Sepr 1785 I am much obliged to you for your Favour of the 27th of Augt inclosing the proceedings of the Legislature respecting the Institution of the Cincinnati.(1) Congress have been ever tender of the Reputation of their military officers, & as far as I could collect the Sentiments of the Members at Annapolis, were in Expectation of a voluntary Abolition of the Institution. It was then conceived, that all the officers might have been mistaken with Respect to its fatal Tendency, & that many certainly were; but that seeing the Sense of their fellow Citizens & of some of the Legislatures on the Subject, no Time would be lost in putting a period to so obnoxious a Measure. In this Congress have been mistaken, for so far have the Cincinnati Congress been from an Abolition, that in my opinion the plan is worse on the last Establishment than it was on the first. My Reason is this, that in the first case it was too glaring to escape the Observation of any one, & in the last it may lull some into a Security untill the Cincinnati Nobility have so established their Influence as to control our republican Governments & then they may reassume their first Shape & bid Defiance to Opposition. I am not sure that Congress will take the Matter up; but sure I am, that if the Delegates of Massachusetts return their Health & Seats in Congress, they will put on the Journals some propositions that will sound a fOEderal alarm: being firmly persuaded this Institution must be abolished soon, as it will destroy our Liberties. We have by this post, given his Excelly Governor Bowdoin, our Reasons for suspending a Delivery of his Dispatches for a general Revision of the Confederation, which I presume he will officially communicate to his Council & I wish to have your Sentiments on the Subject.(2) My Compliments to your Lady & be assured I am Sir on every occasion your Friend & very hum Serv E Gerry SEPTEMBER 5, 1785  ""

  Sir, New York 5th Sepr. 1785. I was honored with your Excellency's Letter by Capt. Walden, & have received from him some general propositions respecting Copper half pence, which he offers to supply to the Amount of £100,000 sterling.(1) Previous to his Arrival the Business of a Mint had been under the Consideration of a grand Committee, whose Report I inclose,(2) with a Request that You will not impart it to any one, as it is not usual to send out such Documents untill they are passed by Congress. Indeed the Board of Treasury have the Matter, pursuant to order of Congress, under Consideration, & Mr. Osgood being absent, & Mr. Lee not arrived, I introduced Mr Walden to Mr Levingston the only Member in the City, & to Mr Duer the Secretary, who will examine minutely into the propositions, point out what part of them is admissable, & what not; & give Mr Walden an Opportunity of soon determining whether there is a prospect of his entering into such a Contract as Congress will probably consent to. I do not think there is such a prospect, because one Condition will perhaps be, that the Money shall be coined, in the U States, another in the Mint of the Confederacy, a third that the Coiner shall be on Wages & the profits which are estimated at about 30 per Ct shall accrue to the publick. Capt Walden thinks the profits will not exceed 28 per Ct, & supposing this to be the Case £22,000 sterling, the advance on £78,000, would be no trifling Sum in the foederal Chest, at this Crisis of its Evacuation. However thus much Capt Walden will be sure of, plain dealing & a preference if his Terms, amongst other proposals are entitled to it: or a polite Refusal, if they are not. The papers inclosed contain some particulars respecting Mr Adams Negotiations, which do not vary from the Truth, because they have not in the minutest Degree my Relation thereto.

The embarrassed state of our commerce has been largely considered by Congress, but nothing, yet, determined upon, and lays with other important business for a full representation in Congress; & unless the states, pay a greater attention to keeping up their representation, many important matters, in my opinion, will remain unfinished for some time, & to our great damage as a nation, & I will add farther that for want of such a representation, many of our public embarrassments arise, & are continued. If I recollect right, you are a member of the Genl. court of Masstts.(2) & therefore, I consider an apology less necessary, while I mention a matter that respects me personally; I conclude you are sensible that in the last appointment of delegates to Congress, I was passed unnoticed. No doubt the Honorable court had such reasons as were judged sufficient, & the Governor, as well as some others of my friends, has signified to me, that it was supposed to arise from the members in general conceiving that I was not eligible; but as it is to be presumed the court were acquainted with their own records, & that from them it must appear, that I had been elected but only for two years since the confederation took place, therefore, some other reasons may have opperated against me that I am unacquainted with; and 'tho' it don't amount to a recall before the year is out.

I cannot account for the Detention of your Letter by Colo. Le Mair:(2) And will give you notice, if the Commissioners' Letter by him to Congress, has not been received. Your Reasoning, respecting Entrepots corresponds with my own Ideas of the Subject: I cannot see any great Advantages from multiplying them in Times of peace: in War they may be more useful. With Respect to the commercial arrangements of the Court of France, in the West Indies, however favorable they may be veiwed by some, they affect our Fishery & have a direct Tendency to discourage it. A Duty on our Exports of Fish, applied as a Bounty to encourage theirs, is a Rule that has a two fold operation & has been very alarming. This I suppose was the Cause, why an Act of Massachusetts which originated before I left the State, to retaliate british restrictions, has since my arrival here been extended to other Nations. With Respect to the Oyl Contract, it does not raise the Expectations of those who were to be at the Head of it, in this Quarter, so far as to engage them in an Adventure. At least Mr Wadsworth &c appear to be cool about it, whether to secure the oyl at a cheaper Rate or from Motives of Dislike, I am unable to determine.

The Requisition labours exceedingly, & I am apprehensive of an Adjournment without compleating it.

General Howe is added to the Indian Commissioners & the Treaty is soon to be held. Colo Monroe left us, to attend it on private Considerations.

I have recieved your letter from Philada.(2) & I heartily wish it may suit your Convenience to visit this place, as it will give me particular satisfaction to have the pleasure of seeing you. Exclusive of this I could wish to consult you on some particular Matters respecting the State. The requisition is now in the last stage: it is formed on principles to suit only the Eastern & some of the Middle States; There seems also to be a radical unwillingness to allow us for our assumptions, although the debt was created for Continental uses; and a proposition (wherein the interest was dropped for the present) has been negatived by a considerable majority.(3) The Delegation is strongly impressed with the necessity of supporting public credit; they notwithstanding as well as the delegates of some other States, hesitate to pass the requisition in it's present form. They could wish it was made conformable to the different interests of the Union, & that certain principles might be adopted to facilitate the settlement of the general ac- SEPTEMBER 16, 1785  count. With respect to myself I never admired the idea of facilities:(4) the word implies a payment less than the thing itself: an inundation of a kind of paper money is also to be feared: but for the sake of peace I have been willing to consent as far as one third which is more than the Southern States can ever derive any advantage from. We have lately recieved a letter from the Governor inclosing one from Solicitor Wood furnishing a melancholy picture of the situation of the public accounts.(5) The Continental Comm. objects to every thing; says he can't proceed witht. fresh instructions & I fear it is not in our power to obtain such principles as will enable us to bring forward our Accounts. There is also a heavy party here for obliging the States to settle by a particular day, or to pay interest to those who do. I every day discover more & more the impropriety of remaining longer at this place. It is clear to me that it has an undue influence on our proceedings. Some of the Southern States begin at length to percieve this, & I hope it will not be long before the whole will view it in the same light.

  My dear Sir, New York 17th. Sep. 1785. You are sensible that I have been too intimately acquainted with your political industry, and information, not to be well satisfied with your appointment to Congress---;you must therefore accept my cordial congratulations with full belief of my sincerity. I pray you to re- examine the motives of the Legislature in recommending to congress, to propose to the several States a convention of Delegates for the express purpose of a general revision of the confederation, and to communicate to me the result of such investigation. It is true, that additional commercial powers vested in congress, under proper restrictions, and for a limited Time, is an object greatly to be desired; but it is, and I believe will continue to be, the reflected opinion of many, of the most republican, and best informed men, in this country that such delegation of power should be for a limited Time. If the measure upon experiment is found to be good, it may then be incorporated with, and become a part of the Confederation. The commercial Treaties formed, and forming, between the states, and the powers of Europe, are limited to the Term of fifteen years---;the expiration of that Term will give a new commercial Epoch---;a delegation of powers to congress for that term would be therefore highly proper. If the confederation is generally submitted to a revision, I foresee many and important Difficulties. The report will certainly be a confederation less republican than the present one. The larger States when the present confederation was adopted, objected to the  SEPTEMBER 17, 1785  Portrait of Rufus King  admission of the smaller ones upon equal rights with themselves. The surrounding dangers at that period, induced these States to give up their objections, and the small States came in with rights equal to the large ones. But at this Time, was the question again open to decision, the same objections would be made, the real inconvenience experienced, and the increasing principles of aristocracy, would strengthen them, and I think we should by the measure be thrown into total disunion. These, and many other objections, which occurred to the Massachusetts Delegates, have been stated in a Letter to Mr. Bowdoin, with a request that he would communicate them to the Legislature.(1) I wish you to examine that Letter, if the observations there made, are conformable to your own opinion, I am confident you will join in the sentiments of the Delegation; if not, be obliging enough to state the reasons which overbalance them. I have not yet heard who of the Delegates appointed for the next congress have accepted---;will you inform me?(2) I hope and wish that you will not decline---;if the Delegates are such, as I think I can serve with in peace & friendship, I will continue another Year---;otherwise if men of different Politicks from those which you and I should certainly agree in. With great esteem & friendship, Your obt. servt., Rufus King ""

  Dear Sir, New York 21st. Septr. 1785 The inclosed Letter from Mr. DeBerdt came under cover to C. & A. Pettit at Philada. & has been sent to me to forward to you. I presume it advises you of the noting & probability of Protest of the Bill you remitted for £180 Sterlg. and of Payment or Acceptance of the smaller Bill of £116. Having relied on these Bills as an effective Remittance for monies due to him before their Arrival, Mr. DeBerdt is rather impatient on the Occasion, especially as the London Merchants trading to America are really hard pushed on Account of the Disappointments they experience in Remittances. From these Circumstances & his Connection with Mr. Reed's Family,(1) I am particularly desirous to replace the Money as early as may be, & especially as we shall yet owe him a farther Balance. I must therefore beg your Attention to this Matter as early as may be, for tho' we pay him Int[eres]t for the Delay, it is urged that this is far short of a Compensation for the Shock it gives to Credit. I am therefore persuaded you will give it no unnecessary Delay. Dr. Franklin's Arrival in Phila. seems to give general Joy.(2) I know of no one who has, politically, more real occasion for rejoicing than I have, as an opinion had generally prevailed that I was to be a Candidate for an Office which he will probably obtain by general Consent.

  Dear Billy, New York Septr. 25th. 1785. I was much surprised to find that I had not enclosed the Accounts, which must have been occasion'd by my closing my Letter when I had Company about me talking about their affairs. I will endeavour not to omit again enclosing that of Mr. Stow. The one of Thomas it seems you have recover'd & will forward, only you may give him Credit for Eight Dollars, which he told me at Stratford he had paid me, & tho' I do not find any entry of it I would not dispute with him about it. SEPTEMBER 25, 1785  It may be difficult for you to make out a List of Mr. Apthorps Papers in my Absence, if Mr. Hillhouse could point out such as he immediately wants, you could see if they are there, & send them to him, for the remainder I sho'd chuse it to rest till I come up in October, & may probably then see him. I believe I mention'd to you that I expected the House would fetch £100.0.0 & sho'd not chuse to offer it for less till I can talk with my Friends & Acquaintances at N. Haven upon the subject. But if I can get a good price for it, shall be willing to make the payments easy, say three or four year, at equal Installments. But in that Case we must expect good security either by Mortgage or Bondsmen for we ought not to Trust so long to the single security of a Gentleman in Trade with whose real Circumstances it is so difficult to be acquainted. The Salt Hay I expected might all be let out at the usual Rate of one third deliver'd in the Barn. Henry is to have what he wants, & the reainder in the Common Meadow, including that of Osborn's, may be offer'd to Ephm. Burrith who knows it, or any one else. The Lordship I expected to Mow very little of, & if it is not likely to be taken on shares, as I imagine it is not, may be offer'd gratis, as it is an advantage to have it Mow'd. Mr. Kay must not be forgotten, who must also have what he wants, both of the Salt Hay & Lordship. Since the time limited for bringing a Writ of Error is elaps'd, I do not see what Vaughan can do, other than to Petition the Assembly, that he may be restor'd to his Property upon paying the purchase Money given for it on the sale under the Confiscation, pursuant to the Article to that effect, in the Treaty of Peace, & perhaps it may be best for him to Tender the Money to Towner, or whoever is the present owner of the Land, & request a reconveyance of the Estate, before he brings a Petition, tho' I do not consider this as absolutely necessary. The only objection, you know, against pressing payment of Miller's Execution against Rowland is the counter demand he has against Miller, upon which, if I do not forget, a suit is depending in which I am Cited as Agent, Factor, & Trustee. Let Mr. Hurd therefore talk with Mr. Rowland, & after that, if he thinks it best upon the whole, he may press the payment of the Execution, but, if there be such suit as I have mention'd depending against me, before he receives any of the Money he must Indemnifie me against the suit, & all loss & Damages I may incur thereby. I thank you for your favour by Mr. Verplank & Betsey, who arriv'd here last Night in the height of the Storm, but do not seem to have suffer'd any injury by it, tho' they are fatigued with the Journey. Jos. Munsons Note was not enclosed in your Letter, but probably Verplank has it & tho' I have seen him I did not think to ask him about it, and even if it sho'd not have come by this conveyance, it is not material, as Franklin is at Philadelphia, & it may be some time before I have an Opportunity to see him or send it to him. SEPTEMBER 26, 1785  I wish I could relieve you from your present suspence, upon clear & satisfactory grounds. A little time I hope will do it, as Capt. Bascomb tells me he soon expects to hear from his Friend in Burmuda, & I am unwilling yet to give up that plan, which has many strong inducements in its favour. Mean time I have in my last acquainted you with Genl. Parsons destination, & suggest'd my apprehensions that the Indian Treaty may be attended with too much fatigue for yr. present state of Health. This however you can better Judge of than I, & if upon the whole you chuse to decline it, that with the Circumstances you mention of there being no apparent fund for yr. Expences, must be sufficient excuses with the Genl. At present, I confess, it appears to me more eligible to go to Burmuda than to the Treaty, unless the General can offer stronger inducements, & give better Answers to those Objections, than any that occur to me at present. After all, you will not forget that I lay much stress upon your own Inclinations, in determining such Questions as these, for Nill invita Minerva is a good Maxim. If Capt. Hoit has not sail'd to day I may probably send the Porter by him, which Mamma desires, as Dr. Nicoll tells me he shall have things on Board him which must go round by water from New Field.

  Dear Sir.(1) [September 27--;28? 1785](2) Congress have at length passed a requisition for the supplies of the present year which I herewith inclose you.(3) I know not whether it will be satisfactory to the State; I only know that it does not please me. Its principles as you will perceive are only calculated for one part of the union; I mean for those States which are in possession of the great bulk of continental securities where they may be purchased at eight for one. To these States it will prove a blessing, to Maryland it cannot. The States which it favors are Pennsylvania, New Jersey and so on Eastward to New Hampshire inclusive. Considering the depreciation of the certificates these States have it in their power to discharge their two thirds of their quotas at a very easy rate, while one years interest upon all the loan office and other continental securities belonging to the State of Maryland or its citizens will hardly exceed one fourth of our quota. Of course Maryland must pay three fourths of her quota in specie or run in debt. Let us add to this unequal operation of the requisition the real situation of Maryland. Many of our people are of opinion that we are among the foremost in advances, and that when the accounts of the union come to be settled, that the other States will be found in our debt. I am very sorry to tell you that the reverse is the case. Maryland is one of the greatest debtor states in the union. We owe an immense sum to the other States as will appear from a statement which I intend to lay before the General Assembly. This debt of course will be greatly  SEPTEMBER 28, 1785  augmented by the new system of paying in interest, unless we can contrive to keep pace with the payments of the other States. Would it not under this view of things be advisable for the State to purchase a sum in certificates, (now when they can be got cheap) the interest upon which would equal two thirds of our quota.(4) The principal of the certificates would be to our credit on the final settlement of accounts, while the interest, as far as it went, would be an easement to our citizens in the annual requisitions of Congress. If the State should adopt this plan of easing its citizens from taxation, the certificates by proper management may be procured at 8 for 1. To you I need not enlarge upon the expediency of providing while we may for the present and for the future. I would only add that the States to whom we are in debt are numerous enough to compel us to pay them, which I dare say they will attempt as soon as a favorable opportunity offers. If Congress were in possession of a marine it is not difficult to divine in what manner it would be directed. There is one agreeable circumstance however attending this requisition. By the rule which governs the apportionments, and which was obtained after a great deal of squabbling, Maryland is rated at 10 3/4 of the whole estimate.(5) By the rule which governed last year we paid an eighth part of the whole. Being very much pressed for time, I beg you will make my excuse to Mr Worthington for not writing to him on this occasion and communicate to him the requisition. I am about setting out on a visit to Mrs McHenry for a few days who is in Philadelphia. I find that in case the Assembly should keep me six months longer with Congress which will close my three years that I shall be obliged to bring Mrs. McHenry to New York. In the mean time I am, Very sincerely and respectfully Yours, James McHenry ""

  Sir, New York October 1st, 1785. I do myself the honor to inform Your Excellency that Congress have appointed a Grand Committee to report the form of an Ordinance to expedite the Settlement of the public Accounts, and have referred to this Committee a report of the Board of Treasury upon a Motion of Mr Howell, which I herewith inclose.(1) This report will in some degree explain to your honorable Board the Views of Congress by the Appointment of this Committee: The Commissioners of the public Accounts in each State are already impowered to liquidate and settle both demands of individuals and States, against the United States, as far as the said demands are authorised by subsisting Resolutions of Congress, and if any difficulties arise, they must originate either from the Nature of the Claim or for Want of proper Vouchers. The latter part of the Report (and principal Object with the Committee) refers to Claims of individual States against the Union, for Money advanced and Services performed for the Common benefit of the States, but not covered by any subsisting resolutions.(2) A Question naturally arises, which of these or whether any ought to be admitted, and it is of the utmost Consequence to the harmony of the States, that this Question be speedily and prudently determined. OCTOBER 1, 1785  The Committee met yesterday the first time, and have Ordered, that each Member in behalf of his State, exhibit in Writing the general heads of the Claims of that State against the Union. I am unprepared to make this Statement barely upon my recollection, therefore I take the earliest Opportunity to ask your Advice and Assistance as soon as convenient. I do suppose that Pennsylvania was very careful to have a large proportion of her expenditures for the Common defence covered by resolutions for the express purpose to guard against disputes upon a final Adjustment, her proximity to the Seat of Congress enabled her to have this done. Nevertheless, there are within my own knowledge many very considerable Charges for which I think she has an undoubted right to obtain a Credit upon the Books of the Treasury. I will just take the Liberty to subjoin such claims as occur to me at present, which if they meet the Approbation of your honorable Board, will compose part of the Claims stated upon the part of Pennsylvania, vizt. Building and sinking Chevaux de Frize. Building Gallies, floating Batteries, fire rafts &c for defending the passage of Delaware. Arming, manning, feeding, paying &c the Officers and Seamen belonging to the aforesaid fleet. Fortifying Mud Island---;red bank and Billingsport. Recruiting, paying, Cloathing &c the three State regiments commanded by Messrs Miles, Broadhead and Atlee. Militia Service for the defence of the State, particularly the frontiers. Ranging Companies upon the frontiers. I would only beg leave to add, that it is only necessary at present to mention the heads and not the Amounts of the Claims.(3) I refer you for further information to the Honorable Charles Pettit, who will be in Philadelphia before this is handed to You. I am Sir, with due Respect, Your Excellency's very humble Servant, Jos. Gardner NB. I find I have left the Report alluded to this Letter at my lodging, therefore defer sending until next post. ""

The requisition is at length finished; & which I have now the honor of inclosing; the Article of 30,000 dollars for fOEderal buildings at Trenton is expunged; & I think the opposition to that measure is gaining strength. Some of the Southern States begin to view it in a different light.(1) Congress have passed a resolution authorizing the Post Master general under the direction of the Board of Treasury to contract with the Owners of the Stage coaches for the transportation of the Mail; it is expected the contracts will be formed in the course of the next month: after which there will be three mails a week through the  OCTOBER 3, 1785  Southern States. A new Ordinance for the Post Office is ready to be reported in which there are clauses for cross posts from Alexandria to Fort Pitt, & from Albany to the limits of Canada, but it is doubtful whether in this present Congress either will take effect.(2) Mr. Payne has a memorial before Congress, to be allowed a sum of money for his services, to which there is a favorable report from a Commee. but I am fearful that nothing of consequence will take effect.(3) I have the honor to be, With the highest respect, Yr Affect. frd. & Most Obed Serv.

  Dear Sir New-York Octr. 5th. 1785 We are very sorry to inform You of our Disappointment in procuring Continental Money.(1) We had built on getting 1,500,000 Dolrs. from Mr Marbois, who had that Sum in his Custody belonging to the King of France, but could not be prevailed upon to take less than one Spanish Dollar for 125 paper. We at first offered 250 hoping thereby  OCTOBER 5, 1785  to bring him to the Price limitted by You, but ineffectual. He has lately been appointed Intendant of St. Domingo, to which Place He sailed a few Days ago. Mr. Otto has succeeded him as \""Chargè des Affaires.\"" A Merchant of this City, who thought He should be able to furnish Us with 500,000 Dollrs. will He fears fall very short; if there is not a total Failure on his Part. He had flattered himself that his Debtors in the Country, whom He had Reason to believe were possessed of considerable Quantities, would have rejoiced in an Opportunity of paying it in Discharge of their Debts, but on knowing it would be received, immediately concluded that Congress mean to do something for the Redemption & therefore part with it reluctantly. We shall continue our Endeavors in procuring all We can. You will herewith receive the Requisition for Supplies, by which You will perceive that two Thirds of the Sum is payable in the Interest due on Continental Securities. Now sir, if You thought it warrantable, would it not be laying out Money greatly to the Advantage of the state of Maryland, to invest immediately what could be spared from the Purchase of Contl. Money in final Settlement Certificates, which are in a very depreciated State, they may at this Time be bought here at eight for one---;if We retain our present Sentiments, We shall deem it incumbent on Us to submit to the Consideration of the Legislature at their next Session, the Purchasing so large a Quantity of them as the Circumstances & Finances of the State will by any Means admit. We are, most respectfully, Yr. very humble servts., James McHenry Wm. Hindman 8th Octbr. Since writing the above Mr. McHenry has entered into stipulations for between two and one millions of the Continental money. This is a very fortunate circumstance as we understand some other States are in the same speculation which will of course raise the price.

  Sir, New York, 7th Oct. 1785. In a few weeks, by the leave of providence, I shall have compleated the time for which I was elected to a seat in Congress, & two years since the confederation took place. When I arrived at Congress on the first Monday in November last (or the place where it was expected Congress would be assembled) I found only four states represented, & that I was the only person attending from the eastward of New Jersey; the next day I informed the then Governor of Masstts., & the honorable court by letter, the situation we were in, and signified my fears that the public business would be delayed, unless we had a full representation: I conclude your Excellency & the honorable court will be convinced, that my fears were well grounded, as Congress have been together more than ten months, and a very considerable part of the public business, yet, remains unfinished principally owing, as I conceive, to the states not keeping up a full representation; but Congress having so fully expressed their sentiments, to the several states, upon the subject, it is unnecessary for me to add further. I am fully sensible, that there is several instructions from the honorable court to the delegates of Masstts., upon important subjects, which they have not been able to get a determination of Congress; but, surely, this is not for want of attention & exertions of the honorable gentlemen, that I have been joined with in the delegation, & in justice to myself, I may be permitted to say, that I have given my constant attendance: My particular situation, at this time, I hope will apologize for this address, when it is considered, that it is unknown to me in what light my conduct may have been considered by the honorable court. I shall sit out on my return, as soon as I can with convenience after the first Monday in November, & hope to have the honor of making your Excellency and the honorable court my personal respects & shall (if required) be ready to give a further account of the state of our national affairs, & of my particular conduct.

Business in Congress goes on as agreeably as can be expected, all circumstances considered: the requisitions took up much time, that, & the resolutions respecting the loan officer, are the most important  OCTOBER 8, 1785  matters that have lately been passed upon, I will inclose you newspapers containing them. As to a fOEderal town, I have no more expectation of it, at present, than if the ordinance at Trenton had not passed; for some months since two of the commissioners, vizt. Messrs. Morris & Dickinson attended in this city to receive further directions, & wrote a letter to Congress, upon the subject, but even a commitment of the letter could not be obtained, & upon the question whether any money should be appropriated for fOEderal buildings when the requisitions were under consideration only three states if I recollect right were in favor of it, when, I think, twelve States were represented, & after lengthy debates, & my honorable colleague Mr. Gerry was not inattentive to the same; being instructed I was obliged to vote in favor of appropriating mony for the purpose, otherwise, I should not have done it, for how can the good people pay the taxes now called for or bear any addition. As to commercial treaties, they remain much the same when you left us. Britain I conclude will form a treaty with us when they are convinced it will be for their interest. Two days have been spent in a come. of the whole, respecting our commercial affairs, but no report was agreed on further than asking leave to sit again, but it appear'd evident, that if Congress should ask for more powers upon this subject, they would be only temporary, by way of trial; I very much fear whether the several states will come into the measures adopted by Masstts. & N.H. & if that should be the case, I leave it with you to judge how the late laws will operate in these states. As to keeping our faith with Holland, I can only point you to the requisitions; but some of the citizens of Holland are not likely to be able to keep their faith with us. Messrs. De La Lande & Fynje have stoped payment, & they had in their hands, it seems, 118,000 florins, belonging to the U.S.(3) I have with pleasure complied with your request in making your compliments to the gentlemen in our family & have to return you the like salute. The Ladies at Mrs. Dunscombs we parted with in May last, having taken lodgings on Long Island, opposite to the city, but I will bear it upon my mind to make your public address to them, which I am sure will give them pleasure.

  Dear Gibbons, New York, 10th Octr. 1785. I had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 17th Ulto. yesterday, and am much obliged to you for the various articles of intelligence it contains. Your account of the prospect of Crops is pleasing; but from the severity of the Equinoxial Gale here, and accounts just received of the damage done in North Carolina, I am apprehensive you did not escape. I am truly sorry for the situation of your two Sisters; such re- OCTOBER 10, 1785  peated and severe indispositions will it is to be feared prove too much for Mrs. Telfair;(1) and I should think it would be well for both her and Mr. Telfair to change the Climate for a few Months. I lately received a letter from Joe, who sent me the enclosed letter to forward; he at the same time applied for the two half Johannes's and twenty Guineas you left in my hands, which I sent him. Doctor Smith was in Town yesterday. I saw and asked him how your brothers went on; he answered well. Joe I am informed means to study during the vacation, which looks as if he is in earnest. I think we shall leave this the beginning of next Month. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Houstoun both say they will return about the same time; tho' I think the latter cannot easily quit a certain beautiful object. Mrs. Habersham seems reconciled to returning by water, and I imagine we shall go in one of the Carolina Packets to Charleston. The going by land is extremely tedious and not quite consistent with the length of my purse. With hearty wishes for your welfare, I remain, Dear Gibbons, Yours sincerely, John Habersham [P.S.] Mrs. H joins me in Compliments to your good Mother, Mr & Mrs. Jones &Ca.

  Dear Sir(1) New York 10th. Oct.

This Determination was taken early in September. Mr. Barclay had asked leave of Congress to return for a short Time to America, and was indulged. He might have been expected here before this time---;his not having arrived, and the information that the Commissioners Mr. Adams & Mr. Jefferson had fixed on him for the Barbary Treaties, induced a hope that this business is in a good way.

  Dear Sir,(1) New York October the 10th. 1785 The public papers will have informed you of my having left New York, and the cause.(2) The benefit that I received from the use of the Chalybeate waters in the vicinity of Philadelphia has been very flattering and has enabled me to return to this City with a Stock of health that I hope will be sufficient at least to carry me triumphantly thro my Presidential year. The circumstance of ill health has been the principal cause that has prevented me from replying sooner to your favor of August the 8th last. Indeed the current news here has been too unimportant to trouble you with reading or myself with writing it, especially as it is well detailed in the newspapers. It is with infinite pleasure I learn that our Church Convention at Philadelphia have concluded their business with great concord, the surest pledge of the future success of their System. It was a circumstance of much advantage that their Councils were not disturbed by the mischievous high chu[r]ch principles that prevail with the Nonjuring Episcopalians of these Northern regions, who, with Bishop Seabury at their head would have been very sufficient to disturb the moderate councils of any Whig Assembly in the world.(3) Our public letters of this day from the Officers of the U. States at Pittsburg & its neighborhood, represent the Indian Nations, as Nations, in no unfriendly point of view, and seem to promise success as well to our treaty at the Mouth of Great Miami this month, as to the progress of business in surveying the Territory appointed for Sale Northwest of Ohio.(4) You have been misinform'd with respect to the violent proceedings at Boston. Both in that State & N. Hampshire they have indeed passed lately Commercial Acts respecting foreign trade generally that do not accord with our Commercial treaties both with France & Sweden, which have already produced memorials to Con- OCTOBER 10, 1785  gress from the Consuls of these nations.(5) However, as these laws were probably the product of haste & inattention, I have no doubt but that they will rectify the evil upon a proper representation from the federal head. So essential is the difference between the Northern & Southern productions and circumstances relative to Commerce, that it is not easy to adopt any general System that would well accord with all; and the Staple States shoud be feelingly alive to the proposed plan of vesting powers absolute for the restraint & regulation of Commerce in a Body of represen[tatives] whose Constituents are very differently circumstanced. Intrigue and coalition among the No Staple States, taking advantage of the disunion & inattenti[on] of the South, might fix a ruinous Monopoly upon the trade & productions of the Staple States that have not Ships or Seamen for the exportation of their valuable productions. You know Sir that the Spirit of Commerce is a spirit of Avarice, and that when ever the power is given the will certainly follows to monopolize, to engross, and take every possible advantage. I am free therefore to own that I think it both safest & best to give no such power to Congress, leave it to that Body to point out what is fit to be done in this [line] and founding their plans on principles of moderation and most accordant to the actual state & situation of the different States, to recommend their Systems for the general adoption. I am persuaded that this plan would be successful to every good purpose. A contrary one would, I verily believe, be more hurtful, much more hurtful to us, than even the crabbed selfish system of Great Britain. Mr. Adams, in a late letter to me from London, writing of Britain he says \""the Nation must be made to feel---;but this is a work of time, and it is dangerous work, because it may in such inflammable circumstances provoke War.\""(6) Indeed our proceedings with that Nation should be well considered, and cautiously practised upon. I am very fearful of the proceedings of our approaching Session---; Breach of Treaty---;Paper Money---;Violations of public faith---;are all, I am informed much talked of. Either of the three will be sufficient to injure us greatly, as well as the U. States. And I assure you Sir, from the best authority, that such things as those have already deeply & essentially injured the American character in Europe generally. Mr. Adams says in the same letter \""I hope that per[sons] & property in America will be held sacred.\"" On the 8th of next month I shall return to Virga. after thirteen months absence from my family. With very great respect & esteem I have the honor to be dear Sir your most obedient, and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. ""

  Dear Sir, New York October the 11th. 1785 I make no doubt but that you have seen in the public papers that my ill state of health had compelled me to quit this City and Congress to seek relief from leisure and the Chalybeate springs near Philadelphia. It is that circumstance that has prevented me from the pleasure of replying sooner to your favor of August the 22d,1 which I now do with many thanks for its obliging contents. The advantage that I received to my health from relaxation and the medical power of the springs I visited, has been very flattering, and will I hope furnish me with a stock of health sufficient to finish my Presidential year with some degree of comfort. I hear with singular pleasure that the very important business of opening the navigation of Potomac goes on so well. I well know how much the community will be obliged for success in this useful work to your exertions. By a letter lately received from  OCTOBER 12, 1785  the hon. Colo. Monroe,(2) who is at Pittsburg and intends to be at the Indian Treaty this month at the mouth of Great Miami; we learn that the temper of the Indian Nation as nations, is not unfriendly to the U. States, and promising success, as well to the coming Treaty, as to the execution of the plan for surveying and disposing of territory beyond the Ohio for payment of the public debt. Colo. Monroe represents the Intruding Settlers N. W. of Ohio to be very few in number and they disposed to obey quickly the orders of Congress. The negotiation with Mr. Gardoque proceeds so slowly, and as yet so ineffectually, that I fancy the free navigation of Mississippi is a point that we may take it for granted will not hastily be concluded upon. So that mischiefs from that source are probably postponed to a distant day. In G. Britain, they have been so engrossed with Irish affairs, that as yet Mr. Adams has done nothing at that Court. He represents the Ministry, or a majority of them, as seemingly well disposed to us; but fearing to do any thing decisive because of the discontent and irritability of the National mind, which he thinks only wants money to recommence the War with us---;On which account he recommends careful, steady, & moderate conduct on our part. The dispute between the Emperor & Holland is not yet settled that we know of. But a formidable league of Prussia, Saxony, & Hanover; with some other powers, is actually signed to preserve inviolate the present State of the Empire against the intrigues of the Emperor who is stated as being much alarmed at this League. My brother A. Lee, who will have the honor of delivering you this letter will also supply any defect of intelligence that may have happened on my part. I pray you Sir to present my respectful compliments to your Lady with my wishes for her health.

Allen to the extremity of puting him in Goal, since the matter might undoubtedly have been better settled, by more lenient measures. By your statements of the grounds of the Vote there must have been very great mistakes, & I am very glad you have prefer'd a Petition which, I trust, will set the whole matter right. I have been every Moment since I receiv'd yr. Letter, so incessantly engaged in business, that it has been impossible for me to call upon Osborn for the purpose you mention. But you may rely upon it that I will take the first opportunity to do it, & tho' from his strange conduct in all his affairs, & the situation he is in relative to Coll. Fitch, I have little hopes of obtaining any thing material from him, yet I will examine him effectually & have him sworn if I find he can say anything of consequence. As to my own affairs, I cannot leave Congress before the latter end of next week or beginning of the week after, when I propose to be at Stratford & New Haven for some time, at one of which places I sho'd be happy if I could see you. In the mean time, as I have no Papers with me, I cannot state to you the amount of my Debt, nor the value of the security I have, with any precision. Indeed, the latter must depend upon what the Lands Mortgaged at Milford, which is all I have, will sell for. But I am fully persuaded they will fall very far short of the amount of my debt. I shall therefore write my son to attend you upon this business, & beg you will give him every assistance in your power towards obtaining further security, which, I trust, the Coll. will have no objection sho'd be ample, as it is only security I ask, & hope the Coll. will still go on diligently, as was proposed, to sell his Lands, & let the securities for them go in discharge of his Debts. I hope with you, that the Event of his going to Goal will not bring his Creditors upon him. It ought not to have that effect when the Circumstances are consider'd. Yet it is to be fear'd it may cause some Alarm amongst them, & it is highly expedi- OCTOBER 14, 1785  ent you sho'd do all you can to prevent it.

Since your departure, we have been under great anxiety for the fate of Mr. Hardy; On a party to Haerlem heights about ten days ago, he unfortunately bursted a blood vessel, and from frequent hemorrhages, has been in extreme danger till about three days ago, when matters have taken rather a more favorable turn.(2) He has requested me to inform you of his desire to get a seat in the executive Council if practicable, as he thinks the climate of his own country will be more suitable to the situation of his health. He is the more anxious to have this done, as it is not only his own opininion but that of his Physicians, that he will never from the nature of the complaint, be proper for the bar; or indeed for any kind of violent public speaking. He desires you will do him the favor of shewing this to the Speaker & taking such measures as you may deem adviseable. Nothing new has taken effect since you left this, except that Congress have had information of war being declared by the regency of Algiers agt. these U. S.(3) I am afraid the information is too true: however I will write you again on this subject, the moment the news is confirmed in such a manner as to admit of no doubt. The suspicion here is that our friends the Brittish have done us this favor in order to make it indispensably necessary for us to imploy their vessels. Perhaps the Spaniards on making peace with the Algerines might wish that their arms might be turned agt. us. The Secy. for foreign affairs is for war with these pirates; but I cannot see the policy of this, & think we had better follow the scandalous example of the European powers, & make peace with them as soon as we can. Nothing has transpired from Adams, respecting the subject we were talking of, since you left this.(4) OCTOBER 14, 1785  The Report of the Secy. for foreign affairs respecting Consuls, has been recommitted, & he has made another report, principall[y] recommending the vesting the the American Ministers with Consular powers---;& giving them extensive limits, where they will have deputies.(5) I shall be obliged to you to let me know as soon as you can conveniently what are your sentiments respecting the price of the Western lands. Is a dollar too high all circumstances considered? By a letter from Colo. Monroe we are informed there are not above 80 families settled on the lands of the U.

In a former letter the Delegates from New Hampshire informed his Excelly. the late President,(2) that such measures had been adopted by Congress as we hoped would prove effectual to obtain treaties with the Regences of Algiers, Tunis, & Tripoli, but as yet their is no account of the despatches which were forwarded to France in April last having been received by our Minister there. And I have my doubts whether what was then thought necessary to purchase a peace, will now be adequate thereto. If it should not I am of opinion that it will be best to make such an addition as will effect it. At present we are not in a condition to be at War with any Nation, especially with one from whom we are to expect nothing but hard knocks; As Congress have not official Accts. of this war, hope the news is premiture, but am afraid from concur[in]g circumstances, Vizt. that of a peace havg. taken place between those Barbarians & Spain---;& That they are better prepared for war than they ever were, that the intelligence is well Grounded.

  Sir, Office of Secretary of Congress, Octr. 15. 1785 I have the honor to forward to your Excellency herewith enclosed an Act of the United States in Congress assembled of the 12 instant, by which the several states are earnestly called on to compleat without delay the whole of their quotas of the requisitions of Sept 1782 and of April 1784, copies of both which you will find enclosed.(1) Your excellency and the legislature have doubtless observed that in the estimate of 1784 Congress counted upon a compliance with the preceding requisition and therefore in the statement of the interest due at the close of 1782 they supposed its amount lessened by 1,200,000 dollars required and apportioned by the resolutions of the 4 & 10 of Sept 1782 and appropriated to the sole purpose of paying the interest of the public debt.(2) The requisition of 1785 provides for the payment of the interest of the domestic debt up to the end of the year 1784, on a supposition that the states have complied or will speedily and effectually comply with the previous requisitions of 1782 & 1784. Unless this is done the end will not be attained, and the measure of facilities will operate injuriously to the domestic creditors. For it being provided by the last requisition that the holders of loan Office certificates or other certificates of liquidated debts may have the interest due thereon settled up to the last day of the year 1784, and receive the amount in certificates receivable from the bearer in lieu of money in discharge of only two thirds of the sum required for 1785, it is apparent that so far as any  OCTOBER 15, 1785  state has been deficient in complying with the former requisitions will certificates be issued, to the redemption of which the requisition of 1785 will be inadequate. To obviate this inconvenience & guard against the consequent depreciation of the interest-certificates, Congress have passed the resolution of the 12th by a compliance with which effectual provision will be made for the redemption of all the certificates which will be issued & thereby their credit will be preserved. For further particulars I beg leave to refer Your excellency to the board of treasury who will write to you on this subject. With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's ""

  My dear Sir New York October the 17. 1785 I am well satisfied that your friendship has long since suggested an apology for my not sooner answering the letter that you did me the honor to write to me on the 7th of August last,(1) because you will have been informed that my ill state of health compelled me to quit business and Congress, to seek for remedy in the medical waters lately discoverd in Pennsylvania. I thank God that my health has been so restored as to enable me to return to my duty here, and I hope with a stock sufficient at least to carry me thro my Presidential year with some comfort to myself. The Governors letter concerning Capt. Stanhopes misconduct was immediately laid before Congress, and yours to  OCTOBER 17, 1785  me communicated to your delegates.(2) In my absence Congress determined to send the papers to Mr Adams in order to place the matter before Capt. Stanhopes Superiors. It is certainly very difficult to judge of Courts & Courtiers, because hypocrisy, simulation, and dissimulation reign throughout---;but so far as we may judge from the civilities shewn to Mr. Adams, and the professions made to him, we may suppose that the behavior of Capt. Stanhope (which seems to have been a complication of folly & insolence) will not be approved at St. James's. We do not find however, that the civil appearances about the Court of London have as yet produced any solid good effects---;for still they hold the Posts, still they encroach on our Eastern boundary, and still their Commercial regulations continue crabbed, and hurtful to themselves & to us. Perhaps time may heal the wound that yet rankles in the National breast. I fear it is too true that the Algarines, these Hostes humani generis, have commenced war upon our Commerce, and if we are not lucky enough to purchase a peace from these Barbarians before they taste the sweets of plundering our Commerce, it may be long before we can quiet them, and be most difficult to accomplish. As for warring with them, as some propose, thro choice I say that it is a very crude & strange opinion. In such a War we shall have every thing to loose and nothing to gain. Is it possible that G. B. can have been so wicked as to have stimulated this War for Commercial purposes, and in revenge for our separation? If it were not that all things are possible with the corrupt Politicians of this day, I should say that they could not be so base. I think it seems probable that Ireland will not receive the British regulation of their Commerce, and if they reject the propositions with proper spirit, it may terminate not only in relieving Ireland, but also in disposing the haughty Britons to be more reasonable in the Commercial system with us. I beg that my respectful compliments may be acceptable to Mrs. Adams, and that you may be assured of the perfect esteem and regard with which I am your friend and affectionate Servant Richard Henry Lee My compliments, if you please, to Gen.

  Dear Sir, New York October the 17. 1785 I have received the letter that you did me the honor to write to me from Pittsburg,(1) and I am much pleased to find by it that the Indian nations, as nations, are not indisposed to us. I think it augurs well to our treaty at Miami, and for the survey & sale of western territory. I am very unhappy to inform you of the death of our most worthy friend Mr. Hardy. He has been sick almost ever since you left this place and early this morning he departed this life, greatly reduced, and without much apparent pain. His loss to the public is great. I wish sincerely that the Assembly may be both able & willing to fill his vacancy with equal ability & virtue---;but unfortunately for the good of society, such characters as poor Hardy are rarely to be found, and too frequently bad men are ready to oppose merit & to thrust themselves forward into places that should be filled alone by sense & virtue. Colo. Grayson proposes to sell the horses that you & Mr. Hardy had in partnership, as they will soon eat their heads off here, and where no Owner wants their use. We have too much reason to apprehend that the Algerines have declared war against our Commerce. These pirates having lately made a profitable peace with Spain, they have now (to the shame of Europe be it said) almost the whole of Europe their Tributaries, so that having little plunder now to get from that quarter, the Arm of rapine is sketched out against us. It is most clear to me from Mr. Adams's account of what passed between him & the Secretary of State concerning the British debts, that if our Assemblies do not irritate by throwing obstructions in the way of the Treaty of peace we shall obtain every reasonable wish concerning time for payment. He seems to be apprehensive of Violence---;for he says \""It cannot be too strongly recommended to let persons & property be held sacred.\""(2) You will find that the business of Facilities,(3) insultive as it is to us who have few or none, has been forced upon us as contended for when you were here. It is to me most plainly proper, that our Assembly should Tax our people, only for Federal purposes, what will suffice to pay our Quota of the foreign interest, and the expences of the federal government; and not admit any facilities to be received in discharge of the Taxes but such as have originated with our own Citizens. This last will disappoint the plan of purchasing our produce with the certificates of those Northern States which will pay the domestic Creditors in these States whilst our own go unpaid. And thus we shall realy give  OCTOBER 17, 1785  a bribe to prevent the settlement of our Accounts and consequently prevent the payment of our own Citizens who are at least as large Creditors of the U. States as the Citizens of any other State. I shall be very happy to see you at Chantilly before you leave Virginia to return to Congress. I am dear Sir, your friend and servant, Richard Henry Lee P.S. Poor Hardy is to be buried in the evening of tomorrow under the directions and Auspices of Congress---;for his funeral we are adjourned two days.(4) R. H. Lee ""

  Dear Sir New York October the 23d. 1785 I received the letter that you did me the honor to write me on the 15th of July(1) with the pleasure that always accompanies the receipt of letters from my old and much esteemed friend. I see with pleasure that your reception at the Court of London has been such as to promise you an agreeable residence there; which may be somewhat pleasant altho you should unfortunately fail in the principal objects of your mission. This last however I yet hope will not be the case, since you represent the majority of the Ministry as able, and thinking rightly with respect to us. The national mind cannot sure continue long under the delusion created by the most vindictive and abominable characters in the world. I mean the Tory refugees, who by themselves, and by those, who for sinister purposes, have suffered themselves to be imposed on by these people, are industriously keeping up on both sides of the water a contentious and mischievous spirit, to the great hurt of both countries. We know them here, and by this time they ought to be known in England, to which country they have caused by their misrepresentations such infinite evil. In the mind of a person acquainted with the true state of things, there can remain no doubt but that this moment is the most favorable one that will probably occur again for G. Britain to make a favorable Treaty of Commerce with these U. States. The events that took place immediately succeeding the war, and which have produced such wrong conclusions touching the British security of possessing our Commerce exclusively, cannot prevent our Trade from going, as it is fast proceeding to do, into other channels, where it is driven by the mistaken discouragements that are imposed by Britain. I have myself no doubt but that smart duties of Tonnage will be laid by all the States on the Vessels of those nations with whom we have not Commercial Treaties. And that such will be prohibited from importing into our Ports productions or manufactures not the growth or manufacture of the Country importing them. Thus these States, forced into it by the intemperance of G. Britain, and led by her example, will be forming laws to discourage a Commerce that might be so mutually beneficial if wisdom and temper prevailed over passion and folly. The project of a Treaty proposed by you  OCTOBER 24, 1785  to the Court where you are, is so perfectly just, and will be so greatly beneficial to both, that I cannot help hoping it will yet be agreed to. I am greatly obliged to you Sir for your good intentions respecting Mr. Steptoe,(2) and I entreat that you will so have him in your mind as that you may effectually promote his views whensoever an opportunity shall present. Much harmony has prevailed this year in Congress, and I hope the same concord will continue. The present federal year being on the point of ending I shall return to Virginia, and as I mentioned in a former letter, you may write very securely to me, under the care of Messrs. Wallace, Johnson & Muir Merchants in London, who will safely forward your letters. I am, with the most sincere and perfect esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. P.S. Be so kind as forward Mr. Jeffersons letter to him by the safest opportunity that you can meet with---;I have since determined to send Mr. Jefferson's Letter by the French Packet. ""

  Dear Sir New York October the 24th 1785 Having yesterday written a long letter to you, I have now only to request your attention to the following business, which is of very great importance to those whom it concerns, and who form a considerable portion of the Citizens of these States. The representation of those professing the Church of England system of religion, having been lately assembled at Philadelphia where Lay & Clerical deputies from seven States were convened in General Convention for the purpose, among other things, of preserving and maintaining a succession of divines in their Church, in a manner which they judge consonant to the gospel, and no way interfering with the religious or civil rights of others---;have sent an address to the Archbishops and Bishops of England, proposing a plan for the consecration of American Bishops.(1) It is imagined, that before anything is done in this business by the Bishops of England, that they will consult the King and Ministry; who, it is apprehended may now, as heretofore, suppose that any step of the kind being taken in England might be considered here as an officious intermeddling with our affairs that would give offence on this side the water. Should this be the case, the Church of England Members in Congress have the greatest reliance on your liberal regard for the religious rights of all men, that you will remove mistaken scruples from the mind of administration, by representing how perfectly consonant it is with our revolution principles professed thro- out all the States, that every denomination of Christians has a right to pursue its own religious modes, interfering not with others. That instead of giving offence, it must give content, by evidencing a friendly disposition to accommodate the people here who are members of the Church in question. In proof of this, Congress did lately shew their attention to the accommodation of this Class of Christians, by communicating to the different Executives your information from the Danish Minister of  OCTOBER 24, 1785  that Kings willingness to facilitate the business of ordination for our church(2)---;And the Assembly of Virginia hath incorporated this Society---;Under which Act of incorporation the Convention was held in that State that sent both Lay & Clerical deputies to the General Convention lately held in Philadelphia.

  Dear Sir, New York 27th Octr 1785 The Delegates inclosed to the Governor a Resolution of Congress, which has probably been communicated to the Legislature, appointing a Grand Committee for preventing the Separation of Districts from the parent States, without Consent thereof & of the U States:(1) & We inclose You a Copy of the sd Resolution & likewise of an Act of Pennsylvania,(2) by which that State put an effectual Stop to Attempts which had been made therein, to make Such a Separation. It is not probable the Grand Committee will be able to report to this Congress, whose Time is nearly expired, but a new appointment will be called for, in the next Congress, & the proceedings thereof Will be transmitted to the Governor. In the Interim, We think it necessary to inform You confidentially, that notwithstanding the Sovereignty of every State is expressly guaranteed by the Confederation, & the Force of the Union must be furnished when necessary to suppress the Opposition of any District to the constitutional Authority of a state over the same. Yet there appears not any great Indisposition in the Delegates of the other three N England States to dismember Massachusetts, altho in a full Representation of all the States, there would undoubtedly be a Majority firm, in a due administration of the powers of Congress to prevent such Dismemberment.

  Gentlemen, New York 27th. Oct. 1785 A letter from the Delegates of the 27th of May states to the honorable Legislature a number of Difficulties relative to the conduct of some of the States concerning the former Requisitions of Congress, and the want of a fixed and equitable Rule for apportioning future Demands upon the States.(1) In a subsequent Letter of the 23d of August we remarked that we had endeavoured, when the requisition of the present year was under consideration, to have it so formed as to give a Security against the future delinquency of the states, and prevent the application of monies by particular states, required, and raised for the sole disposition of Congress. In the course of this business the many embarrassments of the Union, in consequence of the defective compliances with the requisitions by some States, and the total neglect of the same by others, were minutely examined, and on the conclusion the general Sentiment was, that the States must, and would make exertions not only to discharge former demands, but to comply with the Requisition of the present year. The Requisition being transmitted by the board of Treasury,(2) will fully explain our Sentiments upon this Subject; its great operation by discount, will certainly be favorable to Massachusetts and the other Eastern States. Upon examination it will be found that in the present requisition the Rule of apportionment is changed---;the alteration was the Result of a compromise, and is an abatement to Massachusetts of more than Fifty five thousand Dollars on her quota of the Second moiety of the Requisition for Eight Millions of Dollars.(3) From these considerations, and that no act of Massachusetts might bear the appearance of a denial of constitutional Support to the Confederacy, we wish the Requisition of the present year may not only meet the Approbation of, but be adopted by, the honorable Legislature; for whom we entertain the most perfect Respect, and have the honor to be with the highest consideration their Obedient servants, E Gerry Rufus King [P.S.] The residence of Mr. Holten being on Long Island, which prevents his being in the City before the usual hour of the daily meeting of congress, we are often as on this occasiond unable to obtain his signature, without the delay of a post.

  Sir New York Oct. 29, 1785. From a variety of obstructions the requisition for the supplies of the present year did not pass 'till the 27 Ult. I presume it has been officially communicated to your Excellency---;And hope that the principles of it will meet with the approbation of the Legislature.(1) I learned with pleasure & took the earliest opportunity to announce to Congress that the Genl. Assembly at their August Session ordered a tax of £20,000 subject to future appropriations. This readiness to comply with, or more properly to provide for beforehand, the Constitutional demands of Congress could not fail to make a good impression on our Sister States. I wish it may also be the ambition of every citizen to furnish an example of punctuality in the payment of taxes for FOEderal purposes---;As a motive hereto it may be observed that a large ballance of the Sum called for to pay domestic interest must ultimately come into the pockets of our citizens. By late Letters from the westward there is reason to expect that the Troops sent there will be able to effect the objects of their instructions---;that the lands purchased of the Indians at the late Treaties will be secured from intrusive settlers---;surveyed & exposed to sale in due time---;and prove an important fund for extinguishing the domestic debt. It is to be presumed that the Commissioners are now in Treaty, at the mouth of the Great Miamis, with the more westerly Indians for peace & the purchase of additional territory: But, for certain reasons, it is difficult to conjecture the result of their negotiations on the latter Subject. Letters from Mr. John Adams, have come to hand as late as the 10th of August last; & he makes no mention of an Algerine war with the U. States.(2) He has laid a project of a treaty of Commerce before the British Minister. It is feared that our Ministers abroad will not be able to obtain very beneficial Treaties of commerce 'till Congress shall be armed with more efficient powers on this Subject: But in confering these powers a distinction betwixt the power of regulating trade & that of raising a revenue from trade must be carefully preserved. The former perhaps may be exercised by Congress with safety; the latter  OCTOBER 29, 1785  ought to be tenaciously retained by the particular States. But, tho' our Ministers may not succeed on this head agreeably to our wishes for want of power to make effectual Stipulations on our part, or to give a quid pro quo---;we have the Satisfaction to receive repeated proofs of the good disposition of our friends in Europe, & of a growing esteeme & respect for the U. States throughout the World. The hope that I should return in time to attend the present Session of Assembly has prevented my writing before (& I now write in great haste) and indeed the uncertainty of continuing in our Seats since May has constantly held up to us the probability of a return---;and, together with the want of materials, rendred my communications less frequent & less copious than usual. The ultimate point of time to which the present delegation extends will arrive this day Se'nnight; and I must be excused for pressing the necessity of sending forward a delegation to represent the State in the next Congress at an early day. I shall avoid entering at present on several interesting Subjects; & content myself with the prospect of making known my Sentiments fully thereon at the next Session of Assembly, when I hope to be present: But as this will probably be my last official Letter I cannot conclude without offering my most sincere thanks to the State for the repeated proofs of their confidence in appointing me at three successive Elections to the elevated Station I now hold in their Service---;and to your Excellency, and to his Honor the Dep. Governor for the many instances of your attention & friendship to me. I must rely on the candour of my Constituents to cast a friendly veil over the errors & mistakes, if any, I may have committed, & to impute them to my want of experience, if not of abilities too, in political affairs---;while I assure them that to the extent of my capacity I have pursued the interest of the State, which honoured me with its commands & if the U. States, without consulting my private interest, or that of my particular friends---;or becoming subservient to the sinister view of any man, or of any faction. And I now call upon my enemies, if such I have, as well as my friends, to charge me, if they can, with having solicited, during my official Existence, either directly or indirectly for an office for myself either under Congress, or under the State. It is to me a pleasing prospect that I can now retire from office to the humble condition of a common citizen, with clean hands & a clear conscience. I do not hold myself personally responsible to the public or to individuals for the propriety or success of such measures as I have forwarded in pursuance of the views of the State; Yet I must observe, in justice to my own feelings, that time & investigation have convinced many of their propriety & given them success, & even that success, a powerful argument, has removed the doubts of others, & removed too from my Shoulders a load of ill will which otherwise might have followed & oppressed me even in a private Station.  I pray your Excellency to present my dutiful respects to the Hon. the Genl. Assembly---;and to assure them that in every Station in life I shall retain a grateful attachment to the State of Rhode Island---;And be always ready to contribute my feeble mite to advance the happiness of its citizens. With every sentiment of personal esteeme for your Excellency, I have the Honor to be, your Excellencys most obedient & very hble Servt., David Howell. <<P.S. Dep. Gov. Bowen will doubtless inform the Assembly that I have been under the necessity of drawing on him for 200 Dollars. I hope it is paid before now & that the Hon. the Genl. Assembly will excuse me for wishing for an order to receive the small ballance which may be due to me at an early day as it will be very necessary to repair my little plantation & put me in a way to support my family.> I am sorry to send a Letter so illegible but neither time nor patience suffer me often to copy.

  Dear Sir New York October the 29. 1785 My ill state of health having compelled me to look for benefit from the medical springs lately discovered in the vicinity of Philadelphia, I there received the letter that you did me the honor to write me on the 12th of July1---;but tho Mr. Houdon arrived there with Dr. Franklin when I was in the city, the former of these gentlemen did not deliver your letter to me, but it found me thro the medium of the Post. I have not yet seen Mr. Houdon, nor has he been in any manner before Congress that I know of---;he went immediately after his landing to General Washington, from whence I understand that he returned to this City a day or two ago, but I have not yet seen him. Your request, independent of his singular merit, will secure him every civility and service in my power. I think that you have cause, from your statement, to complain of the remissness of your Correspondents. Were I not prevented by the unhappy state of my health, most certainly I should be more attentive to gratify you in a way that certainly must be very agreeable to you, sequestered as you are from your own Country. I think that we have reason to suppose that the requisition of this year (which with the plan for surveying & selling part of the Western lands I have now the honor to enclose you)(2) will produce, at least a sufficiency to pay with credit the interest of our foreign debt and to support the expences of the federal government. The unliquidated state of the domestic debt, and the unequal business of the facilities may perhaps obstruct for the present, the payment of the domestic interest. I understand the displeasure of the Commissioners of the Treasury arose from Mr. Grand's failing to comply with orders given him to pay the interest due to the Crown of France which has created uneasiness and doubt of our punctuality where these would not have existed had Mr. Grand not undertaken to pay himself instead of the Government. However, I suppose that the Commissioners will take care to  OCTOBER 29, 1785  make good the payments omitted by Mr. Grand to have been made to Government. Vermont remains as it was, and we have heard nothing lately concerning Franklin.(3) The Virginia Assembly are agreed, so far as I know, to indulge Kentucky provided it shall be agreeable to the U. States to receive them into the Confederacy so that they may for every purpose be a part of the general system.(4) A proposition is depending before Congress to declare the sense of the Union against all future dismemberments without the consent of the State to be dismemberd and of the United States.(5) Concerning your idea of packets I have spoken to some Members---;the expence alarms, & they seem rather to approve of sending on occasion a Courier in the packets as they now are. But since a plan has lately been adopted for sending the Mails by Stages instead of Post Riders, which will not only quicken communication greatly, but very much increase the Post Office Revenue, I hope that Packets as well as Cross Posts may e'er long be supported.(6) We have lost poor Hardy who dyed here after some weeks illness. The Surveyors are now at work (under the Ordinance) N. West of Ohio, and a Treaty with the Western Indians is holding at Great Miami. Our Assembly is now in Session, but we have not heard whether Harrison or Tyler has got the Chair,(7) but certainly the contest will have been warm & pretty equal. My Presidential year ends in 9 days, after which I shall return to Virginia for some months at least; my return to Congress will depend on the state of my health which is better indeed, but far yet from being as I wish it. Let me be where I will I shall always be happy to hear from you and to give you the news of our Country such as it may be. My brother Arthur Lee being resident here as one of the Commissioners of the Treasury of the U. States, will receive your letters for me and forward them to Virginia. I shall esteem it a very particular favor if you will be so good as send me one of the newly invented Philosophical Lamps which I understand to be handsome, useful, and OEconomical; employing a small quantity of oil to great advantage in giving light. I will either thankfully repay the cost to your order in Virginia, or remit it to you in France thro the medium of my Brother Arthur from this place. I suppose that you may contrive it by one of the french packets to my brothers care in this City. And it will add to the favor if you accompany the Machine with a description of its use.

  New York, 30th October, 1785. I thank you, my dear marquis, for your very affectionate letter, by Mr. Houdon; that gentleman arrived in Philadelphia, and proceeded immediately to Mount Vernon; he has been ever since with General Washington, so that I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing him in this city. It is very happy for America, that events of such high importance should have taken place here as to invite artists, of Mr. Houdon's great reputation, to visit us. I hope that he will find every thing here agreeable to his wishes. As I take strong part in every thing that conduces to your happiness, so I have contemplated with pleasure, the great satisfaction you must have received at the review of those excellent troops of the emperor and of Prussia. A philosophic mind is apt, however, to regret that such fine exertions of human art should so often be employed for the destruction of the human species. I will comfort myself here by hoping, that these will be used to suppress and control, not to promote the bad purposes of ambition. It raises high the glory of Louis the Sixteenth, that his reign has been so eminent for promoting the good of mankind, whilst sovereigns in general, employ their power to increase the miseries of human nature! Will it not happen, during the reign of this glorious monarch, that those lawless pirates, upon the African coast of the Mediterranean, will be compelled, by some proper system, to respect the rights of men, and the laws of nations, instead of receiving annual stipends for not doing what it is really infamous to do. I mean roaming about to injure, oppress, and destroy, their unoffending fellow creatures. Among the many leagues that are formed, why may not one be made for the purpose of protecting the rights of humanity. I hope, sir, that you have not forgotten your design, again to make us happy, by your return to these United States. I have the honour to be, with sentiments of the highest affection and friendship, my dear marquis, Your most ob't and very humble serv't . Richard Henry Lee. Not found; reprinted from Richard H.

  Sir, New York 2d Nov. 1785. A confidential intimacy with our common friend Mr. Gerry, with whom I have served during the last year has given me full information of the correspondence which has lately passed between you and him: and it is in consequence of a Sentence in your last letter to Mr. Gerry, that I take the Liberty of addressing this to you---;if Mr. Gerry remained in Congress, I should suppose that the communications which I might make, would not be worth the Trouble of your perusal---;but in his absence from Congress, it may be convenient that you should know the Opinions entertained by this body, relative to the Object of your Legation, and other Subjects important to America. If in communicating this information, I shall have not only the honor of corresponding with a great minister, but also the satisfaction of serving my country, I cannot want motives to proceed. The Sentiments uniformly expressed in your Official Letters to the Secretary of foreign affairs, since your Residence at London, meet correspondent Opinions in all the States eastward of Maryland. You very well understand the false commercial reasonings, and ill founded policy, of the other States: their present conduct, will hereafter be the cause of bitter regret. The navigation Act of Massachusetts1 you undoubtedly will have seen before this reaches you. New Hampshire has passed a similar Law, & other States probably may follow their example; yet granting that the measure will not become general, still the confederation has put it in the choice of the Seven or Eight Eastern States to become great commercial powers. Even admitting what is af- NOVEMBER 2, 1785  firmed in England, that the Southern and Eastern States cannot agree in any System of commerce which will oppose to G. Britain commercial Disadvantages similar to those which she imposes upon our commerce and navigation, yet the Eight Eastern States can agree; they have common objects, are under similar embarrassments, would vest adequate powers on Congress to regulate external and internal commerce; and in ease the Southern states decline, to vest similar powers in Congress, or to agree in some uniform system, the former by the Confederation are competent to form, and in the Event must form, a sub confederation remedial of all their present Embarrassments. This is a matter that will be touched with great delicacy; the subject is better and better understood every day in America, for it is the general conversation and examination. You Sir, know your country men, you have witnessed their enterprize and Resolution under superior Difficulties. Will they suffer their commerce to languish and expire? will not the Spirit which dictated the non importation Agreement, & which once pervaded these States again appear? it still exists, and though it may have slept for a Time, it can again be roused; and if once more it becomes vigilant, and can be made active by the pride of independence and the idea of national honor and Glory, the present embarrassments of Trade, and the vain sophisms of Europeans relative thereto, will not only direct, but drive America into a System more advantageous than Treaties and Alliances with all the world---;A System which shall cause her to rely upon her own ships, and her own mariners, and to exclude those of all other Nations. I will not add---;be pleased to esteem this as introductory to such opinions prevailing here, as future safe opportunities may authorize me to communicate. If a stranger can without impropriety offer his homage to a Lady of distinguished merit, I pray that you will please to make mine acceptable to Mrs. Adams; for whose happiness, together with that of Miss Adams her Companion & daughter, I entertain the warmest wishes---; and have the honor to be with perfect respect, & consideration, Sir your most Obed. servt., Rufus King ""

  Sir New York 2d Novr 1785 We are honored with your Excellency's Letter of the 24th of Octr inclosing two others for his Excellency the president of Congress, which We have carefully delivered him.(1) NOVEMBER 2, 1785  We observe your Excellency is of Opinion, that if in the Union there is the Operation of such discordant principles as make it hazardous to entrust Congress with powers, necessary to it's well being, the Union cannot long subsist. This Opinion is perfectly coincident with our own, & We flatter Ourselves, it does not militate with the Ideas expressed in our Letters of the 18th of Augt & 3d of September, for We still have Reason to conceive, that the best & surest Mode of obtaining such An Addition to the powers of Congress as is necessary to the well-being of the Union, is to make the powers temporary in the first Instance, & when approved by Experience, to adopt them as part of the Confederation: & We likewise conceive that if a Convention of the states, is necessary on this Occasion, the Members thereof should be limited in their Authority, & confined to the revision of such parts of the Confederation as are supposed defective, & not entrusted with a general Revision of the Articles, & a Right to report a plan of fOEderal Government, essentially different from the republican Form now administered. We suggested to Congress the propriety of recommending to the States a general Thanksgiving but as there were but seven States on the Floor & one or two of them against it, the Measure could not be adopted.

  Dear Sir. Newyork Novr. 2. 1785 I have received your several favours of Feby 8, June 21 and July 14(1) and also a copy of your Notes by Mr Houdon,(2) for which I am much obliged. It grieves me to the soul that there should be such just grounds for your apprehensions respecting the irritation that will be produced in the southern states by what you have said of slavery. However I would not have you discouraged. This is a cancer that we must get rid of. It is a blot in our character that must be wiped out. If it cannot be done by religion, reason & philosophy, confident I am that it will one day be by blood. I confess I am more afraid of this than of Al- NOVEMBER 3, 1785  gerine piracies or the jealousy entertained of us by European powers of which we hear so much of late. However I have the satisfaction to find that philosophy is gaining ground of selfishness in this respect. If this can be rooted out, & our land filled with freemen, union preserved & the spirit of liberty maintained and cherished I think in 25 or 30 years we shall have nothing to fear from the rest of the world. Mr Houdon has been to Mount Vernon & taken the Bust of our Amiable General. He exhibited it to the view of Congress. It appears to me to [be] executed in a masterly manner. I acknowledge my want of skill to judge of performances of this nature. But there is in the air and attitude of this something that pleases me. Most other pictures seem to have their attention turned on the objects around them; but in this the Artist by elevating the chin and countenance has given it the air of one looking forward into futurity. But I will not venture any criticisms for fear of betraying my ignorance. Our good old friend Dr. F is arrived safe and well and honoured with the chair of President of Pensylva. All parties concurred in the choice, I hope it will be comfortable as it is honorable. As to matters within my circle they jog on as usual. Though many occurrences have happened which would be subject of conversation, there are few worth troubling you with in a letter. As to public matters I take it for granted you are well informed through the proper channel. You see by the journal that the duties of my office are much enlarged.

13491,dg022634,1785,Rufus King to Caleb Davis,"""Rufus King to Caleb Davis
  Dear Sir, New-York 3d. Nov. 1785 It gives me pleasure to learn that the Report of Mr. Jay concerning certain clauses in the navigation act of Massachusetts came to hand seasonably, to throw some light upon that Subject.(1) I will not pretend to give an opinion relative to the policy or wisdom of the law---;if the principle is good, the small errors pointed out by Mr. Jay, may be easily rectified. The extract you was good enough to inclose me corresponds with the uniform official communications of the writer. There is nothing more evident than that not only Great Britain, but France are jealous of the commerce, enterprize, and probable naval importance of the United States; and notwithstanding the apparent opposition between these two countries, it would not be surprizing if they united in advancing each the commerce of the other, if thereby they could suppress or injure the commerce of America. England is less jealous of France than of America. The twenty propositions of the Minister Mr. Pitt for a union with Ireland bear strong features of a Jealousy of America. Ireland now enjoys a free trade. She can admit at her pleasure the Ships, Products and manufactures of America and of Other Countries. England is eagle- eyed upon the subject. She wishes to make Ireland a part of Great Britain, and to regulate her trade---;for the twenty propositions are to be fundamental Articles; they are to form a constitution, which is to remain superior to any future laws of either Country. Ireland evidently sees through the Policy---; and I hope will effectually defeat the System which is more a combination against America, than A plan of commercial advantage to Ireland or England. What ought to be the line of conduct in America is not difficult to discover: but what will be her Conduct is wholly conjectural. If Amer- NOVEMBER 3, 1785  ica could only rouse the spirit which dictated the non importation Agreement, and would universally restrain her commerce to her own ships and Mariners, although the embarrassments would be at first, and for a time very considerable, yet a remedy would soon be furnished by the great number of ships, which would be built, and the multitudes on [of] men who would become mariners. How far these events, so much to be desired, will take place, by partial measures, and sacrifices, of individual states, is somewhat difficult to determine. But even admitting that the Southern and Eastern states cannot & will not soon agree in vesting powers in Congress to regulate external and internal commerce, and that the measure will not be effected by uniform Acts passed by the several States---;yet the Confederation admits of Alliances between two or more States, provided the purpose and duration thereof are previously communicated to, and approved by, Congress. The seven Eastern states have common commercial interests, are under similar embarrassments, would vest power in Congress to regulate Trade, and are competent to give the Approbation of Congress to such sub-confederation, as they might agree upon, and which would not only remedy all their Difficulties, but raise them to a degree of power and Opulence which would surprize and astonish. Politicians in Europe see it, and fear it, more than we appear to wish it. I would not be understood to give any Opinion relative to the Massachusetts Act, for, or against the principle or policy, of it. I have given no Opinion concerning it to any one---;neither have I given an Opinion, that if Congress had the power to regulate Trade, that they would be without the Disposition to do it. I sincerely wish they had the power; if they had, something would certainly be done which would be worthy of Execution, and remedial of present perplexities. But I have my doubts whether the Southern States will relinquish their partial, and unfederal, policy concerning commerce, until they find a decided disposition in the Eastern States to combine for their own security---;the moment that this Disposition is evident, the southern states will sensibly feel their weakness, and accede to such measures as may be adopted by the majority of the Confederacy. You very well understand the Character of our country men, they will bear and suffer for a time; but there is a point below which they will not sink; The Difficulties we now suffer will cure themselves, the spirit for reform will become, nay it daily is becoming more and more, general through all the States. The remedy must be waited for with some degree of Patience. This language will not bear to be communicated---;you know whether it is founded in the nature of our Governments, or not---;at any rate I do observe it in confidence. Some men think that political Dificulties may as readily be rectified as those of a domestic or private nature; but they understand very little of the Genius of the several states composing this confederacy. The nature of   our Governments renders every reform, or alteration, not only difficult, because our local, or State, interests are sometimes in Opposition, but subjects it to tedious Delays. But Sir, I will not add upon this subject. We are anxious for the Opinion of the Legislature relative to a convention for a general revision of the Confederation---;the Delegates here are of opinion that the Confederation wants additional commercial powers, and some other additions or alterations---;but if once a power is brought into existence under authority of the States, who may generally revise the Confederation, farewel to the perfect Republican plan. I will trouble you one moment longer---;whoever the Delegates from Massachusetts may be, they ought for the interest of the State to be together; if they have that interest in view they will wish it. On this Subject, I will observe to you, that I wish the Legislature would authorise by a Resolve their Delegates to take a house furnished (or if unfurnished, to furnish it) at the expence of the State---;to the end that they might live together. I say at the expense of the State; the pay allowed the Delegates will not allow them to do it. Mr. Gerry & myself have lived together, and at board. I assure you that the allowance of the State will not bring the year about---;the Sum of house Rent to the State would be inconsiderable. Other States give enough to their Delegates to enable them to hire houses, and to live independently of private family arrangements and perplexities. I would not mention this to the court, lest they should think I have some thing of profit in view---;if you think the idea would be approved by the Court, and you also think it just, perhaps you may move it; but I pray I may not appear in it. I can in the next year, as I have in the past, spend my own money in the Public Service---;the allowance from almost every state in the Confederacy exceeds that of Massachusetts from twenty to sixty per Cent. Pray excuse me for mentioning this subject---;I will never trouble you or any other man with it in future. I have written on this, as on more important subjects, with great hurry, but entire sincerity. With perfect Esteem & Respect, Your Obt. servt., Rufus King ""

The Agents of the two states joined in a Letter to each of the two Gentlemen, soliciting them to number themselves with the Judges. It may be proper to remark to your excellency that the Agency of the Delegates in the institution of the federal court ceases with the present congress on this day. The Resolve joining the Delegates in the Agency for the institution of the Court, gave authority to such Delegates only, as were actually in Congress on a certain day. Those Delegates alas will not be of the next congress, and the Situation of the Controversy may render it expedient hereafter that the Commonwealth should have Agents at, or near congress.

 Dear Sir New York 7th. Nov. 1785 I reply in great haste to your's of the 27th ult. which I have just received. It is not a little singular that Congress have no information from any Gentleman in the Service of the united States in Europe concerning the Algerine War. A Letter from J. P. Jones inclosing, from France, a copy of the Letter of a French Consul, which has been published in almost all the States, is the only intelligence before Congress relative to the hostile Disposition of the Algerines.(1) Eighteen months, or two years ago, congress directed the ministers in Europe to make inquiry of the mode, and money, necessary to treat with, and obtain peace from, the Barbary powers. Upon examination, it was found that the States of Europe, upon an average pay each near 200,000 Dollars annually to these powers, to obtain their friendship. The Emperor of Morocco made overtures through Doct. Franklin for a Treaty; and about seven months since a formal Letter was written by the President of Congress to the Emperor of Morocco, in Answer to his Overtures, assuring him of the friendship of the united States, and their wishes to treat with him. That Letter was sent to the ministers in Europe, with full powers to treat with the Emperor of Morocco, the Regencies of Algiers, Tripoli, & Tunis, and to conclude peace with them upon the best possible Terms---;and to enable the Ministers to treat with a prospect of success, they were authorised to draw upon the monies of the United States in Holland, for Eighty Thousand Dollars, to be applied to the purposes of these Treaties---;a blank commission was also transmitted, to be filled with the name of such person as the Ministers should appoint, to repair to the Coast of Barbary for the execution of the business under their Directions. A Capt. Lamb of Connecticut was charged with the Dispatches and took passage in the Packet in April or May last. No account has been received of his arrival in France. Duplicates of the Dispatches have been since forwarded, and every thing on the part of Congress has been done, which their situation would permit. The sum appropriated for these Treaties was as large as the Finances would allow---;and it was supposed, that with such auxiliary contracts, or engagements, as the Negotiator might form, would effect a peace with these piratical states; who, to the Disgrace of Europe, subject almost all the commercial States to pay them Tribute. It will be unfortunate if the capture of any american Vessels should increase their Demands. November 7, 1785  I beg you to use this information as to the sum &c. &c. with discretion. Any publication thereof would not only be obviously improper, but wd. subject me personally to Censure---;yet it is extremely proper that the Gentlemen in Trades should be informed that Congress have done all within their power upon this subject.

The evils likely to flow from the practice of dismembering States having created serious alarms in the minds of those who wish well to our Confederacy, induced the delegations of Virginia & Massachusets to propose that the sense of Congress should be made known against the dismemberment of any State without the previous approbation of the State about to be dismembered, and of the United States as your Excellency will observe by the Journals,(2) although the opposition giv'n to this measure by some who coming from small States appear to wish for every facility to lessen the larger ones, has hung up the motion in suspence for the present, yet they were compelled to acknowledge (in argument) the propriety of the measure whenever it should be brought forward to Congress as the desire of any one or more of the legislatures of the larger States; the above delegations have therefore [agre]ed to lay the matter before their respective constituents, [to] the end that instructions may be sent for this purpose; if the hon'ble legislatures of Virginia or Massachusetts shall think proper so to do. Your Excellency will observe that the public papers abound with accounts of Algerine captures of American vessels, & yet our Official accounts from Europe as late as the 10th of August make no mention of this war. It was early in the spring that Congress dispatched powers to the Plenipotentiaries of the United States in Europe, to make treaties in the usual way with Morocco, & the regencies of Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis. But we know not to what cause it is---;owing that, a Mr. Lamb who was charged with the dispatches, was not lately arrived  November 7, 1785  in Europe. Duplicates of these powers have therefore been lately sent by the packett.(3) We have the honor to be, With the highest respect, Yr. Excys Most Obed & very huble servts., Richard Henry Lee Willm.

 My dear Sir, New York 8th Novr 1785 Since my last of the 3d of August I am favoured with yours of the 26th of June, 6th of July, 26th of August & 11th of September, & am much obliged to You for the papers inclosed in the July Letter, as well as for the useful Information contained in all of them. The Conduct of the Court of London, clearly indicates, & convinces Us on this Side the Atlantic that they have an unfriendly Disposition towards Us, if the professions of the King are real, he discovers great Wisdom; for this will ever direct them to make the best of Circumstances, & not to afflict themselves with repining or Resentment, because unfavorable Events have taken place, but in political affairs, & indeed in private Concerns, We are to ground our Conduct, on the part which those We have to deal with act, not on that, which they profess. But let the King's Disposition, be what it may, the Ministry's & Na- November 8, 1785  tion's appears inimical---;their true line of Conduct, is to rival in our Commerce the other Europeans, as they can, if they would conquer their vindictive Disposition & renew Friendship; but they are too degenerate for this, & the Consequence will be, such an implacable Hatred between the two Nations as will terminate all Commerce, & divert that of the U States into Channels from whence it will never return to G Britain. If they wish for Hostilities, We mean to be prepared for them by having a well armed & disciplined Militia, but with forty Millions sterling unfunded & with a people so burdened, as to be clamorous upon every Attempt to fund this Debt or any part of it, so loaded with Taxes for supporting Government & for paying the Interest of the funded Debt as to be hardly able to subsist, I think they cannot be so distracted as to wish for another hundred Millions on their shoulders by again waging War with the U.S. If they are, in the Name of God let them come on, & sink into the pit they had provided for Us; for such an addition to their Debt, or a less Sum, would produce a Convulsion that must subjugate them to some of the Other European powers; An Event I wish not to see, if they will cease to disturb & destroy the Happiness of Mankind. As to an Allowance of Interest to the british Merchants for Debts contracted before the War, I do not conceive the Demand to be just, or that a Jury in the Union will ever be found to admit it. Interest is a Consideration for the Improvement of property, & the Fact is, that the American Debtors had not an Opportunity during the War to make such Improvement. They were obliged to sell their british Imports on Credit & to receive paper, which on an average is depreciated to an half of one third of its nominal Sum. Shall then the british Creditor recover Interest on a Book Debt, when the Debtor could only recover the principal, because such a privilege was admitted by Us under the british Government? if this indulgence was just then, is it, for the same Reason just now? I think not, & beleive them, whatever they may say, to be of the same Opinion: or at least, that they must feel in some Degree, the Injustice of a Demand, so apparent to those who are personally disinterested. I allude to the most cool & judicious Men in this quarter. If a proposition should be made by partial Favours to divide the states, it will as formerly have a most happy Effect. It will tend to unite Us more than any propositions of our own. But I think it impossible that the British Court can be so lost to common sense, as to betray their Enmity by such weak propositions as Facilities in Trade. Your plan of granting a Bounty on oyl to be paid by an Impost on british Manufactures strikes me very agreably. The operation would be twofold, & I should hope the Effect would be powerful. I think You may make Yourself easy at present, respecting Congress---;most of your Opponents are out by Rotation, & the Members appear in general to have great Confidence in your Abilities & In-  tegrity. Should You be attacked, You may rely on Mr King for a friendly & firm Support. Those who wished to supplant You, have quoted in private Circles, such Details & familiar Expressions in your Letters as they conceived were below the Dignity of your Station. Their objections have had little or no Effect on liberal & judicious Minds, more especially, as all allow, You write with great Abilities on great Subjects. But to quiet these Competitors, or Creatures of Competitors, it may be best to avoid Details, & gratify in some Measure their Taste for Sublimity of Style, & Rotundity of periods. The Tales which You have heard of Gallicans & Antigallicans, british & antibritish, are without Foundation. Congress can not be more free from foreign & domestic Influence, than they now are; & there are no parties in America, but such as are produced by clashing Interests, which there is a general Disposition to reconcile---;the Cincinnati indeed may be considered as an Exception; but their Institution will be soon attacked in Congress, & I hope abolished. Congress have taken much pains to obtain a full Representation of the States from the Want of which We have not done half the Business which We otherwise might have done the past Year. We have however put on a good Footing the Departments of the Treasury, War Office & foreign Affairs, the Business of which is very regularly & expeditiously conducted. We have also by adjourning to this place, quieted the Uneasiness which resulted from the Want of accomodations in Princetown, Trenton & Annapolis. We have obtained a good Requisition & regulated the Loan Offices so as reduce the thirteen Receivers of Taxes, & unite both Offices into One: passed the Land ordnance, in which however I think there must be an alteration so far as to reduce the price of the fOEderal Lands offered for sale. We have also given You powers to adjust with the Court of London the eastern Boundary Line of Massachusetts, & have made You, Mr Jefferson & Mr Carmichael Consuls general, in the Kingdoms wherein You respectively reside. The fOEderal Court between Massachusetts & New York is postponed, as two out of nine Judges have not yet accepted. We urged the Expediency of submitting the cause to the seven who have accepted but N York declined. The new Congress is not yet formed & probably will not be within ten Days; they will have nothing to take off their Attention from the great objects of laying plans for empowering Congress to collect the Taxes levied in pursuance of their Requisitions; to regulate Trade, so as to retaliate on Foreigners & carry commercial Treaties into full Effect; & to obtain an Adjustment of the State Accounts & a fOEderal Valuation for assessing the States, or rather a Rule, for forming the latter, indeed the Algerine War, if it has taken place, will require an Exer- November 10, 1785  tion, as We must have peace at all Events with these Barbarians, who are probably encouraged to commence Hostilities, by our british or some other European friends. I wish You would attend to the Resolution of Congress making You Consul General:(1) & if it will admit of the Measure, appoint General Warren's Son Mr Winslow Warren Consul untill the sense of Congress can be known, provided he can remove from Lisbon. This would give such satisfaction to our Milton Friends, that I sincerely wish the Measure may be adopted: & there is no Doubt in my Mind the appointment would be confirmed by Congress. I am no longer eligible to Congress, & feel such a Relief from Anxiety & Care already, As induces me to think I shall relish private Life too well to to quit it Again for any public office whatever.(2) Possibly I may alter my Mind after resting awhile, but I sincerely declare, that I always supposed & ever found publick Life inconsistent with my Happiness. The obligations, Solicitudes, & Confinements thereof, are utterly irreconciliable to my Disposition---;however I can never divest myself of a Desire to see the U States happy in their Government, prosperous, & respected. These objects an Individual may as well promote in his study, & often times better, than by appearing as an Actor in the political Theatre. You have much more Philosophy than most Statesmen can boast; & yet I am sometimes diverted to see it put to the Test. Pray give my Compliments to the Ladies of your Family, & Colo Smith & be assured I am ever yours most sincerely, E. Gerry P.S. Mr. King has lately written to you, but request his respectful Compliments. ""

 Sir. New York Novr. 8th. 1785. Immediately on the death of the Hon'ble Mr. Hardy, Congress pass'd a resolution directing a special Commee. to superintend the funeral; and made it an instruction to them to invite the foreign Ministers, the Governor & principal Officers of the State of New York: and also signified that they would attend themselves in a body. The Commee. were therefore under the necessity of incurring an expence equal to about three hundred & seventy dollars, in order that Mr. Hardy should be interred in a manner suitable to his Station. It was  November 9, 1785  expected at the time that as Congress had undertaken the direction of the funeral, they meant to pay the expences of the same out of the fOEderal treasury; inasmuch as the heirs of the deceased were subjected to this expence from the rank which he held under the fOEderal Government, & which was unavoidably imposed on them without their consent; however it was found on inquiry that Congress were not disposed to interfere: & It was necessary these charges should be paid without delay. The immediate funds of Mr. Hardy were not more than equal to the discharge of his own tradesmen's bills. The matter therefore rested on the Commee. who offered to pay the same out of their own pockets. This however the delegation thought highly improper, & it was judged necessary for the honor of the State as well as of the deceased that the money should be borrowed here, & the bills discharged, which is on the point of being executed. As the expences incurred under all the circumstances of the Case were moderate, & as the delegation were under the necessity of either paying them themselves, or of permitting a special Commee. of Congress to discharge them, they hope their conduct will be intirely approved of, and that the money borrowed will be replaced in New York within the next three months agreable to the terms on which the same has been taken up.(1) A particular account of the charges, will be rendered.

 Dear Sir New York Nov. 14th. 1785. On inquiring at the Office for F.A. I find it is uncustomary to give copies unless by special direction of Congress, a circumstance I did not advert to, when I was writing to you last. I shall therefore give you the best information in my power from memory. Mr. A. says that a Commee. of merchts. from Glasgow waited on him in London & told him their business was to lay the affair of the debts before parliament; that he dissuaded them from taking this step, as he was apprehensive it might be productive of disagreable consequences; by holding out the idea of a speedy accomodation of all subjects of dispute. That he had some conversation with Lord Caermarthen on the subject of the debts among other things. That his Lordship mentioned to him the bill for opening the Courts of justice, and that the same (he had understood) had been lost by the accidental circumstance of a post. That his Lordship objected to the loss of interest which was to be incurred by that bill---;& farther apprehended great losses to the Brittish merchants by the emigrations to Kentucki. That with respect to the interest Mr. Adams had urged, the calamities of war, the sufferings of the debtors & the  November 14, 1785  infraction of the treaty in other instances on their parts; & that as to the injuries apprehended from the emigrations to Kentucki he conceived they were groundless, as few persons Went to that country who did not greatly better their situations; & as there was a regular administration of justice in those quarters, such removals were undoubtedly of advantage. That upon the whole interest & policy dictated to them to act with moderation, & give time to the distressed debtors to make payment: that the loss of the negroes carried off, & the product of their labor, as well as the want of the fur trade arising from the posts being withheld were real & heavy grievances on the debtors & furnished strong reasons against a rigorous exaction of claims. This I think is the substance of what Mr. A. has remarked, to the best of my memory;(1) from his subsequent correspondence, it does not appear to me to be probable that any thing will be done very speedily, in this or any other business. Mr. Adams thinks nothing will touch them but restraints laid on their trade by Congress. At the same [time] he insinuates that such restraints may eventually produce hostilities.(2) Upon the whole it is difficult to determine whether the bill alluded to ought to pass this session or not;(3) I was in great hopes it would have been in my power to have giv'n you better information before this but the last letters mention nothing about the matter. By last Post the delegation wrote to the Governor giving their reasons for not assenting to the requisition;(4) their design was only that the will of the State might not be fettered by their acts. If the State for the sake of preserving public credit should think it expedient to pass a legislative act complying with the requisition I then beg leave to submit to your consideration the propriety of purchasing in different parts of the Continent as many certificates of interest, as that when added to the interest due the citizens of the state on liquidated certificates may be equal to two thirds of their proportion of the same, having in contemplation at the same time the one fourth of the requisition of 1784 which remains yet to be satisfyed as far as it relates to facilities;(5) this mode I should think would be preferable to that of laying an interest tax on the Citizens for the full two thirds of the States proportion, as thereby a competition would be raised & the interest of course obtained on worse terms than if the purchase was conducted (as far as relates to the deficiency) by State agents. With respect to the interest due the Citizens of the State, perhaps an interest tax pro tanto may be an eligible mode. Some of the delegates have it in contemplation [to] recommend to their States to purchase principal, which may be now had at 2/8 in the pound without charging for the back interest; however I do not concieve this to be the interest of our State. Her claim agt. the Continent for the Western expedition must be soon allowed, as a credit in some shape or another; it is beside expected the sales of the Western lands will very soon greatly diminish the domestic   debt; of course the demands on our State will be lessened according to such diminution. I am sorry to inform you that the Surveyors from the back Country have returned without doing any thing more than merely making a beginning; they have alledged in excuse the advanced season of the year, & the unsettled situation of Indian affairs.(6) The Eastern Surveyors Who have returned this Way, speak of the country in the highest style, & talk of nothing but forming confederacies, purchasing townships, & settling the country à la mode New England. Indeed from every appearance it is plain to me, the influx into that country from the Eastern States & the State of N. Jersey will be beyond the most sanguine expectation. The Consular arrangement has been before Congress since you left this; & nothing was done except that of vesting the Ministers & chargè des affaires at foreign Courts with the powers of Consuls general.(7) The balance remains for the new Congress. Yesterday the English & French packets both arrived, but do not understand they have brought any news of consequence. Indeed their contents have not yet got abroad. From Yr. Affect. fd. & Most Obed Servt., Willm. Grayson. N.B. the part of this letter which relates to a certain subject is entirely confidential. ""

New York Nov. 22nd 1785 Since writing by the last post, I have procurd from the board of treasury, a schedule of the aggregate amounts of advances to the different States in the Union;(1) the component articles which form these amounts are about being printed, & will then be forwarded, as the charges were very numerous, and as it was necessary that every one however insignificant should be reduced to specie value by the scale of depriciation, I am not surprised that the work has taken up so much time. The advances to the State of Virginia are relatively small as your Excellency will observe by ascertaining the proportions: but from this circumstance it does not appear that any immediate advantage is to be derived to the State, as it is contended that the resolution of the 3rd of June 1784 suspends the payment of interest untill the general settlement of the public accounts. I do myself the honor of inclosing also the general account of receipts & expenditures from the first of Nov. 1784 to the first of Nov. 1785.(2) Mr. Morris's book of receipts & expenditures has not yet been authenticated by Congress, but as there is no other immediate means of shewing a state of them I shall forward them by the first convenient opportunity the same being too bulky for a conveyance by Post; When the Grand Commee. were sitting, they directed the Commrs. of the Treasury to furnish extracts of the [cor]respondence of the different Commrs. of public accounts with the late financier & with the present board; copies of these Extracts &c. I beg leave now to inclose,(3) which will serve to shew the difficulties of the State of Virginia in the settlement of her accounts, as well as those of most of the other states in the Union. An official letter from Mr. Adams dated the 15th of September makes no mention of the Algerine War; a letter from Mr. Jefferson of an older date mentions it only as common report.(4)  I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Yr. Excys. Most Obedt. & very hble Serv., Willm. Grayson. ""

 Dear Sir. New York, Nov. 22nd. 1785. I wrote you by the last Post, since which other letters have arrived from the gentleman therein mentioned. They came by the last packett; and one is dated as late as the 15th of September last.(1) In it however there is no mention of the Algerine War. Mr. Jefferson has also wrote by the french packett, but his letter is of an old date.(2) There has been a conference with Mr. Pitt.(3) That gentleman thinks the war could make no change in the nature of the debts due by or to the citizens or subjects of either country; that the interest is as much due as principal; that the Brittish lawyers hold this opinion. In answer Mr. A. observes the lawyers in America hold a very different opinion respecting the War, and that no jury from New Hamshire to Georgia would allow interest during the war. That the war put an end to all laws and government, consequently to all contracts made under those laws. That it is a maxim of law that a personal right or obligation once destroyed is lost forever: that the treaty & new laws were necessary for the restoration of the contracts or obligations; that the contracts could not be said to have had any existence during the War. Mr. Pitt replied, that if these were the ideas in America, it was necessary there should be some new stipulation respecting the subject. With respect to the negroes he acknowledged that this was so clear a case, as that satisfaction ought to be made therefor, as soon as the number carried off could be made appear. To this Mr. A. replied, that Colo. Smith who had transacted the business with Sir Guy Carleton could evince it by documents then ready to be produced. He acknowledged also with respect to Mr. A's construction of the Armistice there could be no great difficulty: that with reguard to the Posts it was so connected with other matters as not to be decided on singly. As to the commercial treaty there seems to have been a great difference of sentiment; Mr. A. is of opinion that nothing will be done shortly. Mr. Pitt however has promised that during the recess of parliament he will turn his thoughts to those subjects. Mr. A. thinks that the reason why the Elector of Hanover came into the Confederation agt. the Emperor was to preserve peace, in Europe, on our accounts. I need not observe  November 23, 1785  he is a strong advocate for restrictions on their commerce. I have been detained here longer than I expected, waiting to forward some documents which I concieved might be of advantage to our State; & which I have had more difficulty in procuring than I at first expected. I have by this post sent the aggregate amounts in specie value of the advances to each State;(4) by which it will appear that our State has had but little comparatively. The Union in fact owe her a million of dollars & upwards on this account provided she has made equal exertions in other respects; that is to say she has recieved a million less than her fOEderal proportion. It is said however that no advantage can be immediately derived from this circumstance, as it is contended that the interest on all these sums is suspended till the final settlement of accounts by the resolution of the 3rd of June 1784. This same resolution then holds out an additional temptation for prolongating the settlement. Rhode Island has had a million of dollars; is it likely then to suppose the wishes for the arrival of a period when she is to account? The same observation will apply to those who are similarly circumstanced. It will be difficult then when Virginia meets with embarrassments to get them removed by Congress. Virginia has a demand (in opposing Lord Dunmore) of £400,000 Virga. money incurred from Sepr. 1775 to December 1776: which I do not know is supported by any resolution of Congress. It is true she has the same reason to have it allowed as Massachusets. Besides there are resolutions of Congress which direct assistance which assistance Congress says shall be paid: however it is said here that all this goes for nothing. This subject of our public accounts deserves great consideration. I hope you will [con]sider this letter as confidential, & remain, Yr. Affect. friend & Most Obedt. Servt., Willm. Grayson ""

 Dear Sir. New York. 28th. Nov. 1785. I am very busy preparing to decamp for Virginia, of course I shall not lay you under the trouble of reading a long letter from me this Post. There is one thing very singular in Adam's correspondence, he is always pressing the necessity of commercial restrictions; says no treaty can be had without them, and yet he decidedly acknowledges, that in the prosecution of this commercial war there is every reason to suppose we shall incur a real war; for says he nothing but the opinion they have of our strength & their weakness prevents it at present: for the nation is against us. There are still pro's & Con's here respecting the Algerine war: & not a word from Europe officially. The new Congress have chos'n Hancock Presidt. and Doct. Ramsay Chairman until his arrival. The business immediately before them is whether Temple shall be recieved as Consul Genl. from G. Brittain.(1) I presume it will be decided ultimately in the affirmative as Congress have passed a resolution that Ministers & Chargès des Affaires at foreign courts shall be Consuls general ex Officio.(2) Temple has come out in great State, & has taken the best house in the City. The inconvenience which Members of Congress have experienced here this last year from living at common boarding houses, & mixing with the landlady, her Aunts, cousins & acquaintances & with all other sorts of company has been complained of loudly; We have not, I confess suffered in this way, though we have purchased the exemption at a dear rate to our purses; we have had a house though a small one, & yet that same house has went deep into our allowances, so that our dignity has almost eat up our finances. I understand some of the States mean to relieve their delegates from the weight of this inconvenience by establishing a kind of State house at the expence of such State. Although I cannot help admiring the idea of doing something yet I think the plan of jumbling all together whether Grave or gay, married or single, like Falstaff in the buck baskett, heel to point,(3) altogether improper. I should rather suppose (if the legislature gets into a merry mood,) that it would be better to allow each delegate a certain sum of money, provided he disburses the same in House rent. It is also supposed hard that a Member of Congress when he goes home to see his family should be put upon stoppages. I should hope no person would be appointed but would conscientiously discharge his duty to the State to the best of his judgment. November 28, 1785  I remain Yr. Affect. fd. & Most Obed Servt., Willm. Grayson. [P.S.] You will please to consider what relates to Adams as altogether confidential.

 Dr Sir New York. 28th. Nov. 1785. I imagine long before this you have heard of the death of our worthy friend Mr. Hardy; he was hardly ever well after you left us, having been much troubled with fevers, till going to Haerlem heights on a party, he broke a blood vessel in coughing, & dyed the 17th of Octob. His death has giv'n me the greatest concern on account of the sincere friendship I had for him; and I have been much embarassed with his affairs since his death; his funeral has cost 385 dolls. for which I am liable; his frends being not equal to the paymt. of his private debts. I have wrote particularly to the Governor thereon to which I refer you,(1) & request your assistance thereon, provided this finds you at Richmond; I shall be much pinched to pay the money if I am not relieved in time. With respect to your affairs, I have done the best that it was in my power to do; by paying the importunate, & giving fair words to the others, I have managed so that your credit has not suffered in the smallest degree. I inclosed you by last post, all the letters which have come to hand directed to you since your departure to the care of Genl Weedon; a book referred to (I expect) in one of Mr. Jefferson's letters is now in my possession having been delivered to me by Mr. Otto.(2) I now inclose you the journals of Congress complete by which you will see what we have been about since you left us; since the new Congress met, nothing has been done of any consequence, except the appointing of Hancock President, and Doctr. Ramsay, Chairman untill his ar- November 28, 1785  rival; some people think he will not come forward. The business immedy. before them is whether Temple shall be received as Consul general from G. Brittain or not. I am inclined to think it will be carried in the affirmative, when the States come forward (there being but 7 at present on the floor). As Congress have committed themselves by resolving that all Ministers, Chargés, &c at foreign Courts shall be Consuls genl. ex Officio: of course Adams is Consul genl. at the Court of G.B. There is some important foreign intelligence but which I cannot communicate witht. a cypher. Whether there is actually an Algerine War or not, is more than I can tell with certainty; the news comes authenticated from individuals in different parts; but we have no official accts. about the matter. They talk much about a new requisition already: & I hope you will inform yourself well about the State of our public accounts, also of the sentimts. of the legislature respecting the last request as well as of the fOEderal buildings at Trenton. The latter is asleep for the present. Pray dont forget the situation of your collegues: & yourself, it is rather unworthy the State to deduct for absent time. The Members ought also to be allowed a hundred pounds a piece for house rent if the delegate expends so much. As to stowing them all together in a State house, I think it highly improper, though this I understand is the idea in Pensylvany. I think it would be right that we should be paid our house rent for this year: You know it was very heavy upon us. Your friend Gerry is on the point of being united to the elder Miss Thomson; in consequence of this, I have been able to sell the black horses yesterday for 160 dollars. They were put up before this at the Coffee house, & only one hundred & eight dollars was bid for them: this I should have been obliged to have taken, if I had been under the necessity of setting off for Virginia when I expected, by keeping them I have done better for you; though bad is the best: had it not been for the death of Mr. Hardy I would have taken them myself at the price: but circumstanced as I was I did not think it right to be concerned with them at all. Your friends at the Sycamore are all well, & very frequently inquire after you; Rufus, the Capt., & myself were at the play with them the other evening when they made so brilliant & lovely an appearance as to depopulate all the other boxes of all the genteel male people therein. The town is likely to be very gay this winter. There is a regular Concert & assembly established---;besides the Play house.

 My dear Henry. New York 28 Novr. 1785. You will find by the dispatch to the Assembly that our Time has not been unemployed since you left this place. As it is not known in Congress that our State is so greatly in debt as appears by this dispatch;(1) and as it contains a proposal by which the State may be releived for a moderate sum, I submit it to you whether it may not be proper to read the information with shut doors. We have had much writing of late from Mr. Adams on the subject of commerce.(2) What would you think, if he should recommend to the States, to confine their exports to American bottoms and in the same breath, tell Congress, that if the States enter upon the system he recommends, nothing but our strength and the weakness of Great Britain will protect us from an actual war.(3) Would you be surprised to learn, that there are great men both in and near Congress who wish for another war in order to compel the States to relinquish to Congress the sole and exclusive power of regulating trade. Would you imagine that a certain secretary would venture to assert to Congress \""that it may be demonstrated, that while we bend our attention to the sea, every naval war, however long, which does not do us essential injury, will do us essential good.\""(4) But his whole report is so curious that I herewith translate it. Think of our situation my dear Henry and of men who will have resolution and firmness of mind to guard our interests from the combinations of a very formidable phalanx. If the States adopt the war of restrictions recommended by Mr Adams, the  November 28, 1785  carrying trade of course falls into the hands of the Eastern people. If the restrictions beget a war, and that should prove a naval war only, which they flatter themselves will be the case, our protection must be derived from the Eastern States; so that whichever side of the die turns up we shall be the sufferers and they gainers. Let these hints suffice for the present. I have more to communicate at another time. Adieu sincerely and with affectionate regards to my brother senators.  James McHenry ""

 [November 28? 1785](1) The late dispatches from the ministers of the U.S. in Europe especially from Mr Adams, containing matters of great importance to the peace and well-being of the States, we have conceived it to be our duty to lay them confidentially before the honorable the general assembly, premising at the same time as no copies or extracts could be made from these communications that we have been obliged to depend upon our memory.(2) The chief points with which Mr. Adams is charged are, 1. An explanation of the armistice. 2. a compensation for the negroes carried off contrary to the treaty. 3. a remission of the interest due on British debts contracted before the war. 4. The surrender of the Western posts, and 5thly a commercial treaty. These points have been discussed by Mr. Adams in several conferences with Lord Carmarthen and in one with Mr. Pitt, but he has not yet been able to obtain a cabinet determination upon either of them. The ministry seems unwilling to commit themselves officially either from an apprehension of doing something which might prove disagreeable to the nation---;from its being necessary to have matters previously adjusted with Ireland, before they treat with America, or from an intention to recommence war should their finances admit of a recommencement. With respect to the 1st point, Mr. Adams observed to Mr. Pitt.(3) On the 2d point, Mr. Pitt said that, compensation ought to be made when the number of negroes which had been carried off could be ascertained.(4) What passed on the 3d point is too interesting not to be particularly noticed. Mr. Pitt observed that wars made no change in  November 28, 1785  the nature of debts due by or to the parties at war. That this opinion was held by the British lawyers. The American lawyers, Mr. Adams replyed, were of a different opinion as to the present case; and that no jury from New Hampshire to Georgia would allow the interest which run during the war. The american lawyers hold that the war put an end to all laws and government, and consequently to all contracts made under the laws. That it is a maxim of law that a personal right or obligation once destroyed or suspended, is lost forever. That hence an article in the treaty and new laws became necessary to reproduce the contracts. That the contracts therefore could not be considered as having any existence during the war; and of course during that period, could not generate interest. This was a subject Mr. Pitt said that required consideration, and that the merchants must be consulted upon it, before any thing could be done. The balance, he added, is in favor of Great Britain to which Mr. Adams assented. Touching the surrender of the western posts, which Mr. Adams is instructed to demand, Mr. Pitt observed, that this point must be taken up and settled in conjunction with some others; meaning, Mr. Adams remarks, the obstructions which some of the States have raised against the recovery of British debts. The last point, \""a commercial treaty\"" seems to engage the greatest share of our ministers attention, as being perhaps the most important of his embassy. He has laid before the British cabinet the project of a treaty which has for its basis the most perfect reciprocity in all exchanges and intercourse between the two countries. He is of opinion however notwithstanding all his endeavours, that the national judgement and popular voice is so decided in favor of the navigation acts that neither administration nor opposition dare avow a thought of relaxing them further than has been already done, and that Great Britain will hold out in this system as long as she can maintain the credit of her stocks. Great Britain he thinks must be compelled into a treaty. He urges therefore the necessity of meeting her, as he expresses it, with correspondent \""commercial hostilities\"" and of the States relinquishing to Congress the sole and exclusive power of regulating their trade. He says that this war of mutual duties, restraints and prohibitions must necessarily be a long one---;that it cannot be known which side will \""roar\"" out first---;that Great Britain may hurt us by taking off the duty from Spanish tobacco, and by that means make the Spaniards our rivals, in that article---;and that she may also injure our exports in a variety of other ways. But \""to confine our exports to American shipping, to lay heavy duties upon all foreign luxuries; and to encourage manufactures by prohibitions and exclusions, appear to him to be our only resource\""---;That we should immediately enter upon the execution of this system, \""altho\"" he subjoins, under this head, \""I am very sensible of the many difficulties in the way, and of the danger of its bringing on in the course of a few years another war.   Nothing but our strength and their weakness will in my opinion protect us from such a calamity.\""(5) This \""commercial war,\"" which is already commenced by the State of Massachusetts, (as will appear by their act in reference No. and a report of the Secretary of foreign affairs thereon No. )(6) has struck your delegates as involving some very interesting questions which your representatives in Congress may be called upon to decide. To apprise the honorable Assembly of these facts seemed to be the bounden duty of your present delegates. In a country where there is land to employ the labor of double or fourfold its inhabitants that money and industry which a severe navigation act will force into ship building, would be employed in agriculture. As such a country acquired more wealth than the land could employ, and more men than were necessary to work it, the excess would be converted into ships, seamen, merchants, manufacturers and manufactures. How far this order ought to be disturbed for the purpose of creating on a sudden a naval defence is of great moment to have truely ascertained. It deserves also to be examined whether it is not our interest, for at least twenty years to come, to be at peace with all the world; and whether it is not in our power to enjoy peace without any diminution of our prosperity, and in the mean while, be forwarding the means of a future navy. It may also be made a matter of serious inquiry, how far the confining the exportation of our produce to American built ships navigated by American sailors will effect the price, and, whether the advantages of this system generally and specially considered, are sufficient to counterbalance the consequences of another war. We have been thus particular that the general assembly may have a full view of the subject should Congress refer the question to the States; and because the Secretary of foreign affairs in a report No. has given it to Congress as his opinion, that \""it may be demonstrated that while we bend our attention to the sea, every naval war, however long, which does not do us essential injury, will do us essential good.\""(7) With respect to the Algerine war which for some time past has agitated the public mind, and given rise to the official report just alluded to, Congress have received no confirmation thereof, nor does Mr. Adams take any notice of it in any of his letters tho' one is as late as the 15 Sept. We will not therefore consider it other than a story fabricated to answer some speculating purpose till it comes authorised by our ministers. Measures have been long since taken to keep peace with the piratical powers, but the person who was charged by Congress with instructions had not been heard of by Mr. Jefferson the [. . .] tho' he received his orders from Congress. We have now to subjoin the substance of a communication from Dr. Franklin which will close the foreign state of our affairs.(8) The last act   this minister did was to sign with Mr. Jefferson a treaty of friendship and commerce with Prussia, which was to be carried to the Hague by Mr. Short, there to be signed by Baron Thulemeyer on the part of the King. The Doctor says, that he left the Court of France in the same friendly disposition towards the U.S. that we have all along experienced, tho' concerned to find that our credit is not better supported in the payment of the interest due on our loans, which, in case of another war, must be, they think, extremely prejudicial to us, and indeed, may contribute to bring on the war sooner, by affording our enemies the encouraging confidence, that those who take so little care to pay will not again find it easy to borrow.(9) ""

It was surely improper to play the risquing game on such an occasion. The business immedy. before Congress is whether Mr. Temple shall be received as Consul Genl. from G.B. or not; there are on this occasion different sentiments, though I presume when the States are fully represented (there being but seven at present) that it will be decided in the affirmative as Congress seem to have committed themselves as they have resolved that the Ministers & Chargés des affaires of the U.S. are Consuls genl. ex Officio. Of course Adams is Consul Genl. at the Court of G.B.---;as soon as the dispatches from the Secy. for foreign affairs arrives. Temple himself is in a peck of troubles about it; it seems a very good salary depends on the decision. Since your departure Adams has givn us another fire, to the old tune of commercial restrictions. Jay & Thompson have thought his last advices of so much importance as to send official letters to the States to require the immediate attendance of the Members.(1) It is a little extraordinary that Mr. Adams should recommend a commercial war, when in the same letter he agrees that in the prosecution of this commercial war it is highly probable we shall incur a real war.(2) We are no doubt in a good situation for war. I inclose you a schedule of the advances to the States,(3) by which you will see that Virginia has had less by a million of dollars than her proportion. No advantage it seems can however be taken of this circumstance in the next requisition as the resolution of the 3rd of June 1784 suspends the payment  November 30, 1785  of interest till the final settlement of the accounts, that is, till the day of Judgment. I read some part of your letter at the Sycamore alias the Virginia Hotel, which gave no small satisfaction, & like an able negotiator I drew some small advantages from it myself. Perhaps it may still be productive. I had the honor of escorting them to the play the other evening, when they made so beautiful & elegant an appearance as to depopulate all the other boxes of the Beaux & Philanders. They beg me to present their best regards to you. If it was not for the intervention of Mrs. Lee, perhaps the expression might be more animating. I am just on the point of leaving this place.(4) Should however anything new cast up before I go I will write. From yr. Affect frd & most obed servt., Willm. Grayson(5) ""

 Dear Sir, December 1, 1785. New-York. Your favor of the 20th ult is now before me and I shall endeavor to reply to the various parts of it. We have at present only seven States & five of them are represented by two & two of the at present represented States will be of[f] the floor in a few days. We notwithstanding expect New-Hampshire, Connecticut & Virginia. It is probable that we will not have more than ten States on the floor this winter. The attendance of Georgia, North Carolina, Delaware & Rhode island is very uncertain. From these facts I doubt our being able to get seven States in favor of any Gentleman to represent us at the Hague. I am farther induced to believe this from a strong suspicion I have that it is the wish of the Eastern States to keep open the appointment to the Hague for John Adams Esq. Should that Gentleman fail in his negotiations at the court of London & his success is very doubtful I expect that next Spring a motion will be made to recal him from London & reappoint him to the Hague. This is only conjecture but from the  December 1, 1785  thinness of the Congress added to the above I doubt much whether the vote of seven States will be this winter conferred on any Gentleman. If any person is elected Mr. Izard unquestionably will be the person. Mr. Paca is not a candidate. The only present rival is Houston & I am confident he is not a formidable one.(1) As to the State of our finances if our last requisition is complied with we have much to hope; but I fear the compliance of Virginia, North Carolina & Georgia. South Carolina has nothing to pay. We have heretofore paid interest by new loans but this will end in a year & we must stand on our own exertions. I doubt much being done by the States till the balances are struck and the debt apportiond by a federal rule. Our expectations from western territory have failed us. Captain Hutchings(2) is returned & his conduct in not proceeding is approved. The Indians have thrown difficulties in his way. That project has cost us much money & is likely to produce nothing at present. On the whole I think all our debts will be ultimately paid but I doubt much the present exertions of the States. If the British relinquish their western posts & that land was sold it would so diminish the capital as would make the payment of interest annually easy. It will releive you from embarrassment on this head to be informed that the interest has been hitherto paid but by new loans. A crisis awaits us & either a national bankruptcy or a vigorous exertion of our own resources. I hope for the latter but not as soon as it ought to be. Mr. A Lee has for some time past been in Virginia; but is expected soon to return to his seat at the board of Treasury. This accounts for his not answering your letter. I have made some enquiry into the State of the College here & I hear a very good account of it.(3) I think your sons may be placed here to great advantage. They have lately instituted competition which excites that ambition which is the most powerful stimulus to study. The teachers are able & attentive & the College is under the government of the Gentlemen of the city whose sons are Pupils & who will for their own sake take good care of the institution. My most respectful compliments are tendered to Mrs. Izard. In promoting your interest here I shall exert my utmost & in so doing I am happy that private attachment, State honor & fOEderal benefit all draw in one & the same direction.  With the highest esteem, I have the honor to be, your most obedient servt, David Ramsay. P.S. Mr Temple was this day recognised as Consul general of his Britannic Majesty to these States.

 Sir New York 4 Decr. 1785 I had the honor to write to you under date of the second of November, at which time the congress of the last year was at the point of separation to make way for their successors. States sufficient to form a new Congress did not assemble until the 23d ult, when they proceeded to the choice of a President, and Mr Hancock, although absent, was elected. Whether he will accept the appointment is uncertain. Mr. Temple arrived here about ten days since, and having presented his commission, Congress on the 2d instant passed an act recognizing him as Consul General. I inclose a Copy of the act which explains itself,(1) and manifests what would be the Opinion of congress on the question in case no commercial treaty should take place between G Britain and the U.S. Perhaps the delays of the british ministry may operate more advantageously to the U.S. than those acts which now might be esteemed the most liberal, and Kind. You very well remember, that Spain delayed Mr. Jay formerly, as England now delays you. The Event may be such in the latter Case, as it was in the former; and the U.S. hereafter may decline what they once solicited. Time is more  December 4, 1785  favorable to young, than to old nations. The States are more and more embracing the Opinion that they must rely upon themselves, rather than upon alliances or Treaties with foreign nations. The navigation law of Massachusetts has been literally adopted by New Hampshire, Rhode Island has even gone beyond them. New York probably will follow their example, Pensylvania has now a Bill before their legislature, the heads whereof, as printed in the Gazettes I inclose you. Maryland will do something, which will strengthen the common cause, South Carolina had a short Session of their Legislature this Autumn, adjourned to meet in January, having appointed a respectable committee to prepare a Bill for the regulation of Navigation & commerce. The Rotation of members established by the confederation, has returned many old delegates to their respective States; these Gentlemen, having a more comprehensive Knowledge of the Affairs of the Confederacy, impressed with the importance of a more close union between the States and a greater uniformity in their laws as they affect foreign powers, will not only exert themselves to produce these desirable objects, but probably will have considerable influence in bringing them forth. The Merchants through all the states are agreed, they urge the necessity of commercial Regulations---;and the Sessions of the several Legislatures during the winter will be employed on this subject. The opening of the Budget by the British Minister will not be more important to that Nation than the Acts which the states may probably pass during the winter, will be to the united states. Much time and almost the whole attention of the majority of the Citizens of this country, have been diverted since the war, from public employments, and engaged in the recovery of their private Affairs, deranged and injured by the progress of the Revolution. The success of their application is almost incredible, towns have been rebuilt more beautiful upon their former Ruins, and the waste fields of the Husbandmen are again enclosed and covered with their Flocks and herds. These Citizens will again attend to the public concerns; and engage in every measure which can effectually secure their peace and happiness with the Zeal and firmness of freemen---;all opinions of the future character of the United States, which are founded upon their measures or pursuits since the war, must for the reasons alluded to, be in a considerable degree erroneous. A few years hence will exhibit this confederacy in a condition far different from that which has past, or is present. The conduct of England discovers their sentiments to the citizens of America, and being known, the latter will be guarded, & prepared for every event. Is it so certain as Englishmen suppose it, that the United States cannot do without them---;is it clear that because they prohibit the introduction of our Oil into England and our Fish into their Islands, that therefore our Fisheries will languish---;How is the fact? France is desirous of purchasing our oil, and it comes to a good Market in some other states. The cod Fishery is in a prosperous   condition, Plymouth, in Massachusetts, has as many fishermen or more as some say, than ever. Marblehead has upwards of 40 Sail, besides boats---;Salem 30, Beverly 30, Cape Ann 20, and other Towns to the eastward in proportion to their wealth. A few months since these Towns had no Fishermen; and by the next summer, it is the Opinion of Good Judges, they will have a third more Vessels than they now possess; nor is it probable they will want a Market for all the Fish they can cure. Are not these circumstances in our favor? they certainly are. But I will not be sanguine---;on the other hand I see no cause to dispair. The letters you wrote to Mr. Jay in August and September,(2) were very satisfactory to Congress, contained much valuable information, and by their timely arrival I hope will produce good Effects in the southern states. Mr. Gerry who has not yet left me for home, presents his most affectionate Regards to you, some private concerns detains him here for a short time, and I thereby enjoy his good society longer than I expected. With the most perfect consideration & respect I have the honor to be, Sir, Your obt. Servt., Rufus King ""

 Dear Sir, New York 4th. December 1785 I have been favoured with your Letter of the 29th Ult. but have not yet had Time to have any Conversation with the Commrs. of the Treasury on the Subject you mention.(1) Whatever the Letter of the several Resolutions of Congress may import, or whatever strained Construction they may be liable to, in order to favour some States at the Expence of others, the Idea of fair & substantial Justice must be kept in View, and must be the Rule by which all such Cases must be determined. Every Idea of tricking and catching at little Advantages arising from Circumstances not foreseen at the Time of the Contract, is unworthy of a State or Nation, whose fundamental Maxim in Negociations, especially in Money-matters, should always be that Honesty is the best Policy. I apprehend no Difficulty, therefore, in the Adjustment of this Matter. I would never higgle for Trifles in State Affairs where the Line of Justice is doubtful; but where it is plain and evident, it must prevail among States who mean to be happy. The Proportions between Specie & Facilities must be preserved alike in all the States. If the other States will pay up in Specie to our Mark on the 31st of December 1783 & strike the Proportion of Facilities on the Residue only, we shall be ready to meet them on that Ground; but if they do not come up to our Mark, we must resort to theirs for a Rule. We can easily resort to any Rule that is founded in Justice and Equality---;and some such Rule we must be governed by. Another Requisition must soon be framed, and in doing that we can adjust the Matter, if not before. I am about an Enquiry in which I wish to be informed of the annual Expenditures of our State under the Head of supporting Government(2) ---;I mean such Expenditures as are made out of the Public Treasury exclusive of the Pay of Officers who draw their Support from Fees and Perquisites which form no part of the public Account. Such as Salaries---;mentioning each Officer by Title & his Salary, separately. December 5, 1785  Pay of the Council---;the Amount for one Year, & their Servants or Officers. Pay of the Assembly---;the Amt. for one Year & their servants, with the Contingent Expences of both for Fire &c. Contingencies---;Rewards for apprehending Robbers &c and such other annual Expences as are incident to supporting the Dignity of Government. I thought of extracting this from your Book of the Treasurers accounts, but I find several of the Articles, and the Accounts of different Years so blended that I cannot do it satisfactorily. I imagine you can give me what I want with ease as well as accuracy. Pray send me such a Statement as early as may be. If any Article should occur which may raise a Doubt whether it comes within my Description or not, it may be best to insert it. I can more easily strike out what may be redundant than supply what may be deficient. I have had some Account of the scheme of Finance promulged in the Commee. of Ways & Means.

A Bill passed the house of representatives of Massachusetts during their autumn Session, repealing all the Laws preventing the Return or Residence of Tories or Refugees to that State, and admitting them on the Footing of Aliens. But meeting with opposition in the Senate, it was postponed until the next Session---;it passed the House upon a Division of 141 for, and 18 against the Bill, the question being taken by Yeas & Nays.(1) Although this measure failed, yet the Legislature passed a Law relative to the Whale Fishery, which is greatly to be commended, and taken as a part of a System, is certainly wise and politick.(2) The navigation act was altered so as to conform it to the commercial Treaties entered into by the United States, continuing the impositions upon all British commerce.(3) I inclose a Gazette, which contains the Massachusetts Law encouraging the Whale Fishery.

 Dear Sir, New-York Decr. 10th 1785. When I left this city last August I directed my printer to furnish Mr Monroe with the sheets of my book(1) from time to time that they might be sent to you by the packets. Mr Monroe soon after left Congress(2) & transferred the business to Mr Hardy. His much lamented death prevented his execution of the business. On my return here in November I could not find satisfactory information of what had been sent to you; but the printer informed me that you must have received up to page 305 of Vol. 2d. I now send you the remainder. The work was finished on the 7th inst. but by an unfortunate accident I have not by me the notes from page 440 to page 545. I shall send from this port 1600 copies to Mr Charles Dilly of London by Capt Cowper who sails on the 20th instant. I shall direct him to deliver to your order two complete copies & I beg the favor of your acceptance of one & that you would do me the honor of presenting the other to the Marquis De La Fayette in my name. When you receive the books from Mr Dilly please to deliver the inclosed letter to the Marquis(3) with the copy of the book. I am sorry for the trouble I give you but hope for your indulgence. I have not hitherto been favored with the reception of any letter that informed me of your having received the sheets which I sent you by the monthly packets.

 Dear Sir, New York 11th. Decr. 1785 I am now to acknowledge the fresh Obligation conferred on me by your Favour of the 8th Instant. It is not so great, however, as you intended, as the Address to the Assembly respecting the Bank, had before reached me from another Friend. That Address seems to have been intended for the late House, & I have conjectured that, having been too late in it's Birth, or been kept back in Compliment to the one that did appear, it now steps forward to try to convert the present House.(1) I mentioned some desultory Observations on it in a late Letter to Dr. Jackson.(2) I received a manuscript Copy of Mr. Morris's System---;I have as yet given it little more than a bare Reading it having been most of the Time out of my Hands since it came. Altho' I feel myself obliged to reject it taken in a complex View as a System, I am of Opinion there are good Things in it which may be profitably used in framing a more practicable System or amending and improving upon the Plan we have already proceeded upon.(3) I like, for Instance, the Idea of clearing away the Rubbish of all the old Paper Money. Whether the Plan he States for the Doing of it is quite right, requires more Consideration than I have yet been able to give it before I can form an Opinion upon it; and indeed there are Facts & Circumstances relating to divers of the Emissions of old Paper that I am not well enough acquainted with to enable me to go with Propriety into the Consideration. The farming out of the Excise, the Poll Tax, & the Duties on exporting the Staple Commodities of the Country, I have heretofore remarked upon. I do not think them in equal Degree Objectionable, but I consider them all as inadmissible considering all Circumstances. There seem to be three leading objects in view, 1st to abolish Taxes on Property, 2dly to lay aside the Use of Paper Money & 3dly the Establishment of the Bank so as to make it the very Stomach of the State. The first I cannot account for without injuring my former Opinions of Mr.  December 11, 1785  Morris's patriotism, or of his Judgment in Politics & Finance. The second & third hang together and are more easily accounted for. It is a bold Stroke to be sure, after what has lately happened; but it is honest, because it is open & undisguised, the Intention, or leading Motive cannot be mistaken. The warm Friends of the Bank will of course be pleased with it as far as they can conceive it practicable. Some of the public Creditors will also be pleased with it on the same Principles, having also an additional Motive from supposing it favourable to their own Interest; but wise Men as well as good Politicians will carefully consider the practicability as well as the plausibility of a Measure before they build their Hopes upon it exclusively. Let us suppose for a Moment that the general Prejudice against the Bank were so far overcome as that the Legislature would agree to re-establish and make the proposed use of it; still, in my Apprehension the Plan of raising the necessary Revenues (except the Branch arising from Imposts) would be frustrated, and the Discontents arising from the others might destroy Imposts also. Plans of Revenue are delicate Subjects in all Countries. It is unsafe to make large Strides and great Alterations in them, even in old established Governments, less free than ours, & whose Powers are sufficient to enforce Obedience without having previously obtained the general Assent of the People. It is still more unsafe in a Government like ours, even if it were more matured than it is by Age & Experience, the concurrent Sense & Approbation of the People being essentially necessary to the Efficacy of our Legislative Acts. It is not enough with us that a Measure be wise & good in itself; to give it Effect it must be so understood by the Body of the People; and whether their Disapprobation arises from solid Reasoning or illfounded Prejudice, it should be generally removed before an Experiment, on which anything considerable may depend, be hazarded. To give up a System of Revenue which is well understood and generally approved, in order to make Room for one of, at best, doubtful Experiment, is therefore far without my Ideas of Prudence and good Policy. I fear it would throw the State into Confusion, and blast the tender plant of Public Credit which appears to have taken Root in a good Soil in Pensa. and to be growing with admirable Thriftiness. The noxious Weeds which sprang up for want of Culture are withering under it's Shade, and may shortly be wholly eradicated. I am glad to find a Bill is preparing to meet the Requisition of Congress. I hope it will contain some Mode to possess the State of the Certificates intended to be funded, in order to evade the Circulation of our Quota of the Facilities, as otherwise I fear the public Creditors will lose the further Benefit of the funding Act & be thrown back into the common Mass of the Creditors of the U States. It would perhaps be improper for me to say that the Facilities will depreciate. I am persuaded it is unnecessary for me to suggest the Idea to the Legislature of Pennsa. But if they judge of the whole Matter as I do, they will   guard against compelling those public Creditors, who are objects of the Funding Act, to suffer the Loss of such Depreciation as may happen. Both sides of the House seem to agree in this Principle---;they agree also in the Mode as far as relates merely to this Object. Their Disagreements are on other Points. If some Friend would be so obliging as to send me a Copy of the Bill which you say is preparing, it would be a gratification to me. I have not the Vanity to suppose that my Inspection of it is necessary; but if I can suggest a single Idea of improvement I shall be happy in doing it---;and even if I should find it as perfect as I wish, due allowance will be made me for a Curiosity which arises from a kind of anxiety for the Success of Measures which I have had some share in putting in Motion.  When may we expect a Reinforcement of our Delegation? It was very much my Wish to have been a few Weeks at Home before Xmass. My private Affairs require it, and the public Duties assigned would better admit of it early than later. Mr Hancock accepts the Chair & may be expected this Week. We are also led to believe that in the Course of the Week we may make up 9 or 10 States. I have heard but little in the Way of News, except the Arrival of a Schooner from Fayall with India Goods. I understand it to be one sent from hence by Messrs. Duer & Ste[phen] Sayre. The latter went in her. At Fayall he met with an English Ship homeward bound from Canton. In her was a small English nabob (a Mr Lee) returning with the produce of his Labour. He was induced to think this Country a better Market or a safer Asylum & embarked himself & his Property in his Schooner. Mr. Sayre is gone farther a field---;whether in Connection with this Nabob, or in pursuit of his original Plan, or a mixture of both, I know not. The Town has been amused some Days with a Dispute between Mr. Jay & Mr. Littlepage, which divulges some anecdotes of History which otherwise might have remained secret, & perhaps ought to have so remained. I have sent the Papers as a Curiosity to my Son.(4) What Prospect have we of a Provision for our Delegates living together. I feel it as important with respect to the public Business; and I feel it as of some pecuniary importance to myself. If it is not pretty soon done, I must return some Civilities at my single Expence which we might both or all (I mean the Delegation) partake of the Credit of at the same expence jointly, as it will cost each separately. I am, respectfully, Dr. Sir, your Friend & huml Servant, Cha. Pettit ""

 Dear Sir,(1) New York Decr 14. 1785. A few Days since, I was called on by the Lady, who afterwards sent me the inclosed Letter, who asked if I recollected the State of the Timbers that stood on Mount Washington when we first went there in the Year 1776 and also that which it was in when we left that Part of the Island. I told her I could not recollect sufficiently, to answer these Questions, more particularly the latter one as I had been stationed below Morris's House at a Distance from the Fort, but that you might possibly call to Mind so much as would give her Satisfaction---;and add that if she would commit [su]ch Questions to Paper as would answer her Views I would send them to you. I shall be obliged to you to return the Answer by first Opportunity---;by the Post if he goes into your Quarter. The only Thing new here is an Altercation in the public Newspapers between Mr Jay and a certain Mr Littlepage which has been carried on with a considerable Share of Asperity on both Sides. The latter is a young Man about two or three & Twenty born in Virginia and who some years since was sent by his Uncle to Europe & placed under the particular Patronage & Direction of Mr Jay by whom he was entertained & supplied with Money but for wh Mr Jay was never reimbursed, till Mr Littlepage came here to take his Passage to Europe. A Conversation then ensued relative to the Payment of this Money, for wh Mr Littlepage referrd Mr Jay to his Uncle in Virginia saying it was not in his own Power to do it. But Mr Jay hearing afterwards that Mr Littlepage actually had a sum of Money in the Hands of a Gentleman in this City instantly sued him & obliged him to pay down the Money.  December 14, 1785  This was the Cause of the Difference & produced several Publications which have occasioned a great deal of Conversation and as is usually the Case a Variety of Opinions. I would send them to you but they have been all bought up, and not one is to be had. Mr Littlepage is a Person of considerable Parts & genius, & is patronised by the Kings of France & Poland, the Duke de Crillon & several other great Personages in Europe. He is gone off in the French Paquet leaving a Reply to Mr Jay's Publication to which the latter it is said will give an Answer.(2) I am, Sir, Your obedt servt, Lambt.

 Dear Sir, New-York Decr. 14th 1785 Yours of the 14th is now before me.(1) Many thanks for your friendly congratulations on the present station which I hold. They are sincere & therefore as acceptable as though the occasion was of much greater consequence. I flatter myself that Continental credit is in a convalescent State. Virginia I hear has passed the requisition. The only states we have now to fear are Georgia and North Carolina. This state we have good reason to beleive will pass the five per cent impost. If the requisition & the impost both operate they will have an immediate effect on public securities. December 14, 1785  The subject of your oration(2) is very interesting not barely in a speculative but in a practical view. I admire most those disquisitions which come to our bosoms as men & as immortals. I beleive much might be done to make mankind mechanically more virtuous & of course more happy than they are at present. I hope you will introduce slavery as one principle source of vice. It appears to me that previous to the extirpation of this evil it must be made in the first instance odious in sentiment. I sincerely congratulate you on your growing foreign fame. You are now in the most valuable dekade of human life.(3) Before imagination preponderated & in the course of another ten years, judgment sometimes begins to decline. At least the compound ratio of the two is greatest about your time of life. The printer finished my history on the 7th instant. It is now in the hands of the bookbinders. Aitkin has two hundred copies of it & he has my orders to bind in the most elegant manner one of them & to present it to you in my name. I have 1600 on board Cowper to the care of Mr Dilly. I have only reserved 1400 for the United States. I can always command the work in America, but in Europe it was expedient to supply the market at once. I feel all the anxiety of an author who is about to risque his character & his peace of mind. Many faults have already occurred & I shall hold it the highest proof of friendship to point those out that strike those of the readers who are my acquaintances & friends.

 Dear Sir, New York 16th. Decr. 1785 I have lately intimated to you that I had large calls on my Industry, tho' little or nothing was doing in Congress. Corresponding with my Friends in Philada. (& you may suppose that other Matters have some Claims as well as Politics) has claimed Attention. In writing to Mr. M---;---;s(1) I thought it necessary that every Expression as well as every Sentiment shd. be carefully examined & be, not only clearly defencible, but, especially the former, unexceptionable. I hope it will do good if it be only in aiding the Author of a Scheme that must be abandoned, with plausible Reasons to justify the Change to himself. Such Aids have sometimes a more operative Effect than direct Opposition, as it disarms Pride in a great Degree by changing the Appearance of Defeat into that of Candor and Conviction. Last Evening (I attempted it before but was prevented from making any Progress by successive Interruptions) I formed the inclosed Draught of a Bill for complying with the Requisition of Congress.(2) Let it be carefully examined, corrected & put in another Handwriting than the present before it is offered to the House or even the grand Committee. When I set about it I was apprehensive it would have required more length & Time than I found necessary on Experiment. I believe it contains all that is necessary for that Bill. Afterwards I set about the other, for transferring the Certificates &c according to the proposed Plan. Here I met with much more difficulty than I expected. It requires a minuteness of organization & Thought; and as the Fabric must be original I should think Consultation necessary if it were practicable, especially with the Treasurer & Comptroller who must execute the Plan & therefore ought to understand the Machinery & to be consulted in forming it, so as to make it as simple & practicable as may be consistent with Safety. I shall, however, mark out the Lines of my Ideas to send by Monday's Post---;but they will probably be rough & scarified, & I shall not have leisure to change the Patch-work into a new Dress.

 Dear Sir, New York 17th. Decr. 1785, 12 at Night According to the Expectation I gave you I now inclose a rough Draught of a Bill for new modelling the funding of the public Debts.(1) It is not so complete as I would wish it. The Dress may be much amended, but I have not Leisure to draw it over again & correct it, being really fatigued by the Confinement & sedentary Labour I have undergone for a Week past in which I have allowed myself too little Exercise & Recreation. It does not occur to me, however, that any Idea is omitted, which ought to be inserted, unless it be a Mode of Proof of Citizenship of the Persons named in the Certificates, or of the Mode of obtaining such as may have been received from Staff Officers as public Agents in Lieu of Money. Some such Mode of Proof may be proper; but it is a delicate Subject. Many of the Loan Office Certificates, which for a Time passed as Money, have passed thro' so many hands that tho' they may be ever so fairly intitled in reality, it may not be in the Power of the Holder, tho' he became so at an early period and for full Value, to make the Proof or even to know any thing about the Person in whose Name it was issued. I am inclined to think the Payment of the last Year's Intt. may be taken as a Proof for these, as far as it goes as to Loan Certificates. The Temptation was  December 17, 1785  not then strong enough to encourage fraudulent Attempts, & most of those who were confident of their Right, have possessed themselves of this kind of Proof ---;as to others who may apply, more exact Proof may therefore be required, especially as I have heard of some improper Certificates being imposed on the L. Officers, which were issued by Mr. Burral for the Pay of Commissaries. As to the Form of the Certificates to be issued, & their Denominations, it will be well to consult Mr. Rittenhouse. They ought to be low enough to accomodate the small Holders, especially those of the Country, as I conceive the more Hands they are in, especially in the Country, the better---;they ought to be high enough to accomodate the high Holders without unnecessarily multiplying the Number of Certificates---;and the Denominations ought to be be calculated so as to hit any intermediate Sum, keeping to round Numbers, as well to avoid Trouble to the Officers as the danger of Errors in Fractions---;for this latter Purpose it might be well to impress the Annual if not Monthly Interest of each Denomination on every Certificate. The Conveniencies of Quarterly dates & bringing the Interest to fall due at these Periods I conceive are obvious. It will give a brisker Circulation to the Money by more frequent Issues from the Treasury & thereby occasioning a more regular influx, & it will also tend to Ease & Regularity in the Treasurer's Duties. But I must leave the Plan to suggest its own Reasoning. Those who understand the Business will perceive them & correct it's Errors or make such Alterations as may be thought proper. If the alienated Certificates of Messrs. Burral, Fox & Bindan,(2) were also excepted it would not perhaps be amiss. They are chiefly for personal Pay & the Alienations have been chiefly from, & I believe to the less worthy parts of the Community; but they are too small to be an Object for which to hazard much Difficulty or Danger. I have seen, amongst other Attempts to make the Bank System of Payment popular, a Piece in Mr. Cary's Paper extolling the Author to the Skies.(3) Even such Artifices ought to be counteracted in their own way. They work on the Passions of the ignorant, and tend to delude many of the public Creditors. I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedt. huml Servt., Cha. Pettit ""

 Dear Sir New York 18th December 1785, Sunday Evening When I closed my Letter of last Night, which was written after 12 o'Clock, till which Time I had been hammering at the Bill it incloses, I intended that this, being Sunday, should \""shine a Holiday to me.\"" This Afternoon, however, I was favoured with your Paquet of Inclosures of yesterday. I have looked them over with some Attention, such as the Shortness of the Time would admit, & shall for the present give you only some short Notes on the Draught of the Report. Two of the Sheets being absent, I can only guess at their Contents by the general Tenor and Tendency of the Rest. It appears to me to be a well digested Plan, and to have a proper Aim at the great Objects; but it embraces a great Variety of Articles, many of which I am not well enough acquainted with in Detail & Circumstances to trace so thoroughly as I wish; and Tho' I perceive the Propriety of bringing them all into view in considering of and forming a System of Legislative Regulation I cannot but apprehend that the interweaving the whole into one Machine, would make it too complex & unwieldy for our present Situation and Circumstances, and that it would be better to work them into different Acts & perhaps at different Times (keeping the general Systematic Plan continually in View) than to risk the Embarrassment of any one Wheel by the irregular or uncorrespondent Motions of others. At the same Time I would wish the principal Machine to be so calculated as to be capable of receiving Additions from Time to Time. I like the Idea of appropriating particular Revenues to particular Purposes---;but it is an Idea more applicable to Business before us than that behind us---;I mean to the creating of a new Debt, than to the picking up a confused parcel of old ones. Our Plan of last Year was to create an aggregate Fund as large as Circumstances would admit, and to charge upon it such Burthens as we thought it would bear without being overloaded, laying on the principal Objects first &, as it were, consolidating them as they were laid on, & with an Intention to add others to the Load till the whole should be taken up, and then, as our Strength should enable us, to lighten the Load by discharging the Principal. The Old Emissions of Paper Money had peculiar Funds appropriated to them which I have supposed want only to be put in Motion to be adequate to their Objects. I should therefore be desirous of putting them in Motion for that Purpose separately & independantly of the Debts of other Kinds and the Funds created for their Redemption---;tho' the one may occasionally lend aid to the other. But I am going farther than I intended at this Time. I believe I have been led into it by observing that under the 9th Article Page 14, it is  December 18, 1785  proposed to appropriate part of the Impost Revenue to pay the Arrearages of Intt. on a particular Class of Debts, and to continue the Appropriation of such part till the principal of that Class shall be redeemed, and in page 26---;the Arrears of Intt. on the Continental Certificates are proposed to be specially charged on the Arrea[ra]ges of Taxes. I should think it better to let the aggregate Fund continue as stated in the Act of March last, & to let these Objects rest upon it in common with others as is proposed in that Bill---;and so of other Matters of the like kind. The Year 1792 I apprehend is too distant a period for the final Redemption of the Paper of 81, 82 & 83. If it were fixed at April 10, 1787, the Time allowed for paying the Arrearages due to the Land Office, or a few Months after, I shd. think it long enough. The Fees from the Secrys. Office & Land Offices I should apprehend over-rated. The Profits from the Lottery undoubtedly are---;indeed I doubt the propriety of counting on these Profits at all & I wish the whole of that Subject had been left out, as I am apprehensive the mention there made of the Bank is improper & will give an adversary advantage. 1st. it is not an Object of Importance in itself; but little Money will be recd.---;and it rests on that single Object by a special Law which extends to no other, & 2dly. It may be doubted whether it can be considered as a State Revenue within the meaning of the Constitution. On the whole I fear it will be construed into snarling at a chained Animal. I shall send on the Bill as I had prepared it last Night, as I believe it agrees in Spirit with the Plan of the Committee. If however they shd. think proper to alter either the one or the other, they can do it. I could wish that the Plan had been less prolix. It would perhaps have been better understood & less liable to cavilling objections. I am much gratified by the good Opinion of our Friends, & flattered by their Confidence in my Judgment. I wish I could give them stronger Instances to found their Confidence upon, and that my Abilities were equal to my Wishes in aiding their laudible Endeavours to promote the true Interests and Honour of the State. Though you are a little out in your conjecture, that I should be surprized at Mr. Findlay's Superiority in Argument, I am pleased with the Instance of it which you mention. In that Respect my Judgment is justified. I have discerned in him reasoning Faculties that excited my Emulation rather than Envy. I have for some Time suspected that the Knavery of the Collectors was working under Cover of the Supineness of Government. I hope the Discovery you mention will lead to proper Exertions in developing the Business throughout the State. I fear, as you observe, it will be found that much more has been taken from the People than has been accounted for; but I am confident it will also be found that much has  remained uncollected from mere Negligence, and much from a still worse Principle. You speak of your Amusement by certain Broils & Quarrels, of which I have heard but partially, not having seen any other Papers than Dunlaps & Cary's & the latter I have no later than Wednesday. I am not displeased that one who has so long reigned a Bully (by frightening small & being disdained by greater Characters) should be taken down. Mr. Cary writes like a Man of Spirit as well as Decency, but I have no knowledge of him personally, nor do I know anything at all of Mr. Finlay. I observe in a late Paper, a Letter of Mr. Paine's to Mr. Fitzsimmons.(1) For what Purpose is it published? Those he means to flatter by it I presume it is no novelty to. It will hardly be expected to add any Strength to the Favourers of the Bank, and some of Mr. Paine's Friends will perhaps abate of their Esteem for him on his exposing Sentiments which they may think not well founded, and in a Manner they did not expect from him. But perhaps he thinks he has got all he was to expect from them, and that this may be a Sacrafice worthy of Acceptance elsewhere. Pray excuse me to Mr Bryan for neglecting to acknowledge his late Favour---;I need not suggest to you the proper Excuse. Believe me, with Esteem, Dr Sir, Your most obt. huml Servt., Cha. Pettit ""

Since I have received the printed Copy of the proposed Plan of a Report(1) I have again looked over it with some Attention, & noted down some Observations as they occurred on the Reading, which I shall send you herewith. I cannot afford Time to copy nor to make any considerable Corrections in them---;they must be allowed for as first Thoughts in a rough Dress. Your marginal Notes are useful as they contain Information I wished for; tho' I must mention one Point in which I apprehend you mistake the Fact. The Estimate states an average of 4 years Interest in Arrears on the Debts of the US. proposed to be funded; you suppose but little more than two. I believe the Truth lies between you, but nearest to the Estimate. You will observe it is computed to 1st Jany. 1786. You will perceive I have taken the Liberty to recommend the Expunging of some Parts entirely, and the Changing of the Mode in some others. I have done this, not merely to accomodate it to the Draughts I made, but because they strike me as real Amendments. These being made I believe the Draughts of the Bills as far as they go, accord fully with the Plan. I hope the House will not rise without printing Bills for Consideration. As they mean to comply with the Requisition, I wish to see it done handsomely & as early as Forms properly admit, especially as the Money is called for by the 1st of May. If they do not publish the Bill this Session, the Time may be past before they pass it; besides I feel something for the Promises I have made & the Assurances I have given that it would be put in Train in the first Session. I feel also for the Influence it will have in other States, who have a watchful Eye on Pennsylvania on this Occasion; some looking for her Example, & some having Jealousies which I am sure her Legislature does not deserve. I also conceive it would be highly proper that the two Bills should proceed at the same Time or at least in the same Sessions. December 23, 1785  I observe in the Estimate for the Support of Government £2463.15/--; is allowed for the Support of the Delegation---;this supposes the constant Attendance of 3 Members. If the House would appropriate one third of it, or something more to support a House & Table for the Delegation, I think it would be well bestowed & if they think proper they may deduct something from their daily Pay to make it up. It may be asked why the Delegates do not do this by Agreement & voluntary Contribution. I will not say it would be an idle Question; but I will venture to affirm that they will not be brought together as they ought to be unless the Regulation be made by the Legislature. While one can live with a Relation, another can save Expence by obscurity or Distance, & another may meet with Company & Amusements more pleasing elsewhere, such is Human Nature that even such Considerations will turn the Scale, tho' they will seldom be avowed as the Reasons. And while they are thus scattered the Interests of the State are not, nor can they be, duly attended to. The Members, for want of preconcert, must often vote in the Dark, or oppose each other & expose themselves & the State they Represent to loss of Dignity & loss of Influence. Make it both their Interest & their Duty to live together---;and this may be done even out of their present Allowance, if the House deem it improper to go farther. I am mortified that it is not already done at least by Resolution. I will not deny that personal Convenience has some Share in my Motives for wishing the accomplishment of this Measure; but the promotion of the Interests of the State, in various Points of view, form the more weighty part. I have already said to Members on both Sides of the House, as much as it may be proper for me to say to them on this Subject; but tho' they give a cool Assent to this Propriety of the Measure, they do not appear to be duly impressed with the Importance of it. 3 o'Clock P.M. Your Favour of yesterday has just now given me the Relief I expected & wished for. You describe the present Situation of Matters to be as I expected from the Accounts I had received. I thought I had said enough to Mr. Morris to convince his Judgment, without touching his Passions, that the Bank was a Material that could not be interwoven into any Plan of Revenues & Funds for the State. I hope the Friends to good Order & fair, upright Measures will have patriotism enough to keep together till they prepare the Bills for Publication. I am far from being tenacious of the Form & Wording of the Draughts. I am confident they may be much amended; but I hope the main Points will be steadily pursued. Yours with Esteem, Cha. Pettit ""

 Dear Sir New-York Decr. 26---;1785. Your favor of the 9th(1) reach'd me a few days since. Mine by the last post advis'd you of my arrival here; still I am with out a colleague and the representation of the States, the same. I am perfectly satisfied that the more fully the subject is investigated, and the better the interests of the States severally are understood, the more obvious will appear the necessity of commiting to the U S. permanently the power of regulating their trade, whether it will be expedient to accept it for a limited time only it is difficult to determine. If it is expedient for a day, while the States bear the relation they now do to each other & to other powers, or rather while they adjoin each other & are bounded by the ocean, it will still be so. Whether then will it be expedient to avail ourselves of the present disposition so far only as to try an experiment, the success of wh., as such, must depend upon a variety of circumstances, or to delay any remedy untill under the pressure of the present difficulties it may be made complete? As an experiment in what light will it be conceiv'd & how treated by foreign powers. Will they not all wish to defeat it and of course avoid those stipulations in our favor wh. may hereafter furnish arguments for its renewal. We may with propriety also take into the consideration the diversity of interest wh. will arise in the admission of western States into the confideracy. In a govt. also so fluctuating there will never be energy, or calculation on it either at home or abroad, every thing will be in a state of incertainty. The states severally will be at a loss how to act  December 26, 1785  under it (in their respective delegations); they will fear to take those decisive measures with respect to other powers, wh. might be necessary, least their vigorous operation, may prevent its renewal---; but whether these or any other considerations, may be of sufficient weight to induce us to seek only a permanent change, is what I have not absolutely determin'd on. I beg of you to give me your sentiments thereon as well as of the course you think I may with propriety take here, provided the State shod. confide it only for a limited time. Some dispatches have lately been recd. from {Adams}.(2) They are as we expected they wod. be. {Pit[t]} admits that the {removal of the negroes} is a {violation of the} [treaty], that when the {number} is {ascertaind} they must {pay for them}. That they will take up the subject of {the posts} with that of the {debts}. Yet he says that the {whol[e] nation} are {host[ile] to us}---;that they will give us no {commercial treaty}, that they have sent {out Sir J Johnson} for {Canada} with {entrentching to[o]ls} &ca. This is the amt. of what we have, nor can I well determine how you shod. act under it. If it be practicable to carry into effect, a complete complyance on our part, let their conduct be as it may, I shod. not hesitate to adopt it. But if this is not the case, I cannot well conceive the advantage of a partial complyance, or the paymt. by instalment, as hath been heretofore propos'd. If they mean to quarrell, their ground for it will be equally justifiable, in that instance, as in an absolute failure. And if the end we seek, is to be obtain'd by further negotiation, or by bargain of one for the other, by this measure we lose the consideration we shod. have to give for it. In all the measures of this country toward us we perceive not only the utmost vigilance & attention to their own interest in opposition to ours, but a disposition to seek opportunities to injure us. They restrict us most severely in commerce, give land, & provision to our fishermen to settle within their bounds, and we have too much reason to suspect that they encourage the Algerines to attack us. In this situation to whom may we look for assistance even agnst these pirates. The monopoly of the trade of the medeteranean is in the hands of France, Britain & the Netherlands; will they or either of them, give up this advantage, for our convenience for nothing. Is it not strange in this situation that we shod. be disputing whether we shall act together or cement & strengthen the Union. There hath been a newspaper controversy here between Mr. Jay & Mr. Littlepage of our State, upon some subject of a private nature between them.(3) As I have not read their publications I am unacquainted with the merit of either party. It is however to be lamented that Mr. Jay enter'd into a controversy of the kind, since his character is too-well establish'd to be call'd in question upon any unimportant or trivial occasion. Be so kind as [to] give no intimation to anyone except, Mr. Jones, of the contents of what I have wrote you in cypher. I am Dear Sir your friend & servant, Jas. Monroe  P.S. Is the revenue law in any respect chang'd---;are the facilities of other States admissible in payment of taxes---;or rather is it accomodated to all the purposes of the requisition? Our ministers are taking measures with the regencies of Algiers &ca. It is sd. that Mr. Consul Barclay, a Mr. Lambe & Majr. Franks are sent to these different powers for this purpose, but the latter I think is not confirm'd by an official communication.(4) ""

 Dear Sir, New York 27th. Decr. 1785. . . . .My Friends in Philadelphia have been so kindly communicative that the Plan of a Report you sent me(1) was not entirely new to me. I think it on the whole a Work of great Merit, and yet I have ventured to suggest some Corrections as proper. . . . I observe a difference of 30,000 Dollars in one of the Estimates between this Plan of a Report, and that formed by Mr. Morris. I believe it is in the Quantity of Paper of June 1780 in the Loan Office, but I am not certain & I have not the Plan now at Hand to recur to. As I presume you furnished the Estimates for both Plans, & that you have examined both, I doubt not you have observed the Difference I allude to, & can tell me which is right in that particular. The Civil List of the State runs higher than I had supposed, but I believe it is not higher than the Facts will warrant except in the Article of the Pay of Delegates which I imagine will fall rather below the Estimate. But I am told Deductions are under Consideration which are intended to lop off six or eight thousand Pounds. The House of Assembly are, or ought to be, the best Judges of what they will allow the public Servants they employ, and as they propose to reduce their own Pay as well as that of others, it would seem that they aim at disinterested patriotism. I wish it may prove to be so; but I do not always consider the sparing of Money, either public or private, as good Oeconomy. My Idea of Oeconomy is rather the Expending of Money properly than the saving of it improperly, or in other Words, the laying out of what our Necessities & Conveniences require should be expended, to the best Advantage & to proper Effect. It is better Oecon- December 27, 1785  omy to pay handsomely for conducting & manageing our Affairs well, than to have them ill conducted & ill managed without pay.

 Sir, New York December 27th. 1785. The Legislature, convening in January, we think it, our duty thro the medium of your Excellency, to lay before them, and call their most serious attention to, those resolves of Congress, on which they have not yet acted & to which their assent is necessary to give validity. Resolve of the 18th March 1780,(1) for the redemption of the Continental money. The restoration of public credit is what Congress have much at heart, but, to little purpose will they resolve, while the Individual States tardily execute or wholly neglect them. The redemption of the money issued. The fixing permanent funds for paying the interest on the debt, and the support of the federal Government, will have a happy tendency towards restoring that faith so essential to the well being of every Government. In our opinion the State will never have a better opportunity of sinking her quota of the money issued by Congress than the present, for the quantity at market, less'ning every day, by the States who have not sunk their quota's purchasing, it must of consequence become dearer, & the last buyer must pay the greater price. And should Congress (which there is a great probability they will) empower the loan Officers to give certificates to the holders for this money, it may so enhance the value, as to make a difference of a quarter of a million of dollars in the sinking our States quota, a Sum in our opinion, well worth the attention of the Legislature. Resolutions of the 20th February 1782, 17th Febry. & 18th April 1783---;for fixing a rule to apportion the Federal expences & for altering the 8th Article of the Confederation.(2) The fixing a rule whereby the expences of the federal Government may be absolutely apportioned to each State, would be attended with less consequences & serve to allay that ferment which must ever arise from uncertainty & a supposition that any State does not pay so large a proportion as she ought. Might we be allowed to give an opinion, it would be for the alteration of the article of the confederation as recommended by resolve  December 27, 1785  of the 18th April 1783---;because, we conceive it will operate more beneficially for us than the article as it now stands, & being less complex would meet with fewer difficulties in the execution; our Eastern & Northern Brethren think the Southern States have been much favored in this mode, saying, that the whole number of blacks ought to have been taken instead of three fifths; upon the whole we feel ourselves strongly inclined to press the House to an immediate compliance with the alteration, but should their opinion be different from ours, it will then become necessary for them to Act upon the other. Requisition of the 4th Septr. 1782(3) for one Million two hundred thousand Dollars, for the express purpose of discharging the interest due on the Domestic debt. We observe that the Committee of Ways & Means in the Session of January 1785 have supposed that the State's quota of this requisition amounting to seventy two thousand dollars, might be deducted out of the Supplies furnished by the state in 1782. But in this we conceive they have not been well informed, because, this requisition being made expressly to pay the Interest due on the domestic debt, the application of it was left totally to the States---;& by referring to the requisition of the 27th April 1784(4) it will be found that Congress supposed that each State has complied with the requisition of the 4th Septr. 1782---;by paying their quota's to their own Citizens, as they have deducted the whole of it out of the amount of the Interest due, thereby making it a transaction between the State & its Citizens & no otherwise cognizable by the federal Treasury than this, that if within the State the amount of Interest due before the first of January 1782 does not amount to the states quota the balance must be made good---;besides, the supplies furnished in 1782 were expressly to comply with the requisitons of October 1781, for Eight Million of Dollars & cannot possibly be diverted to the payment of the Interest due antecedent to January 1782. The Continental Loan Officer will issue to the holders of Continental certificates, facilities for their Interest, under the requisition of Septr. 27th last(5)---;the State may avail itself of these facilties by receiving them in taxes & duties, for the payment not only of these 72,000 dollars but for a sum equal to the defficiency of her next years quota of the requisition. Resolution of the 30th April 1784(6) for Investing Congress with power to regulate trade for fifteen Years. On Commercial matters we feel ourselves much at a loss to say any thing. The injunction of secrecy laid on every Member of Congress relative to foreign information puts it out of our power to detail our European advices, we however think it our duty to say---;it appears to Us, that untill some system is adopted which shall coerce a Commercial Treaty with Great Britain we need not expect one, nor any intercourse with her Islands but in her own bottoms---;the variant interests of the several States, render this a complicated business. The distressed Situation of our Trade---;The making a nursery for seamen of   it, for ourselves or other nations---;the saving within the Union the profits arising from factorage & transportation, are questions of moment. And whether the States respectively or assembled in Congress are most adequate to the conducting the system of Commercial warfare, that will consequently ensue, on any regulations being made, we must leave to the wisdom of the Legislature to determine, but might we be supposed to be disinterested judges, our opinion would be, under proper regulations to Vest the power in Congress. The appointment of Agents to meet those from the State of Georgia the second Monday in May for establishing a federal Court, will also be necessary(7)---;perhaps, as good consequences might result from an amicable settlement as from a decision had this way---;we submit for the information of the House an estimate of what we suppose will be the expence. The recommendation of Congress in their resolve of the 2nd November last,(8) on the application of the State of New Hampshire merits serious attention---;to be provided for defence is one of the first duties of Government. The resolution of the 7th June 1785(9)---;making provision for disabled seamen & Soldiers---;the propriety of this resolve is such that we trust no remarks enforcing the adoption of it are necessary. These are all the resolutions of Congress of consequence which at this time occur to us, & we hope the House will find time to make a decision on them this session. With the greatest respect, we have the honor to be, Your Excellency's mot. obt. and very humble servants, (Signed) Charles Pinckney David Ramsay John Kean Estimate of the Expence of a Federal Court.  7 Judges for 90 days @ 10 dollrs. each. dollrs. 6300 To be borne equally So.
