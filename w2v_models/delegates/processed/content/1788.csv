 Dear Sir New York 2d Jany 1788 It was my intention to have done myself the honor to have called upon you, previous to my leaving Massachusetts, but partly from cha- January 2, 1788  grin at undertaking an employment in which I could render but little service to myself, or my Country, And in part from a hurry of business inseperable from my then Situation I was deprived of the honor. I do not now address you upon the great Subject of contemplation, because everything worth your attention (& many things beneath it) has been said, & better said, than is in my power. Much less do I mean to dragg you into Convention; to hiss you for speaking contrary to what I might dictate, Or compell you to vote with me.(1) For besides other objections to the measure, the being run thro the body, for which at the present moment I have no great propensity, seems a natural one; And I am not sure but if I could effect this, as the redoubted Capt Barry did at Philadelphia in regard to a member of their Assembly(2) that you would not turn the hiss upon myself; But my principal design in writing is to evince that esteem, which a series of kind offices on your part have inspired.  And altho without reserve I confess myself a fOEderalist, I have so much charity for unbelievers, as most sincerely to tender you my services, in any way that you may think proper to command them, feeling perfectly secure in your well known delicacy, & nice sense of honor. I am not by any means of opinion, if your dissent & influence, should stop the progress of the new system, that all would be lost, and no Government adopted; altho I am in doubt whether we shall do better; And think there is great danger whilst we are contending for perfection in Government, which no human Legislators are competent to, we shall be left without, any; And there will be a kind of necessity for some of you great Spirits, to come forward and call us to order, in your own right. There seems at present to be a pause in the Govt of the United States. I suppose in their eager attention to the New confederation, the old is forgotten, And therefor only five States (but one from N England) are represented; It is hoped howeverthere will be a meeting of at least seven States in all this month. Mr A Lee is gone down to Virginia (where tis said the opposition gains ground) full of zeal, a Candidate for Convention; Gr. Clinton setts of[f] for Paughkepsie this morning to put his machinery in motion. I understand all the States South of this, Virginia excepted, either have, or will accede. If the E States had a propensity to be jealous, the eagerness, avidity, & illiberality of some of the States, in their mode of adoption, would have inspired it; However I hope nothing will prevent them, & espesially Massachusetts, from discussing & determining the question, with that decorum, & dignity of debate which have marked her public Councils; And that a fair majority will be submitted to, let the question be determined as it may. I should feel myself honored by a line from you as leisure permits, And am very respectfully, Your most humble Sert, Sam. A Otis January 3, 1788  ""

 Dear Sir New York Jany. 3d. 1788 I have been favored with yours of the 28 Ult. and thank you for the paper which it inclosed.(1) Your arguments appear to me to place the subject to which they relate in its true light, and must be satisfactory to the writer himself whom they oppose, if he can suspend for a moment his preconceived opinions. But whether they should have any effect or not on him, they will unquestionably be of service in Virginia, and probably in the other Southern States. Col. Hamilton has read the paper with equal pleasure & approbation with myself. He seems to think that the Farmers of New York are in no danger of being infected with an improper jealousy of a sacrifice of their interests to a partiality for commerce or navigation. Connecticut is more likely perhaps to be awake to suspicions of that sort; and it will be well to counteract them every where by candid and judicious explanations. I propose to send a copy of yours to S. Carolina by the first conveyance; and to put another into the hands of some Gentleman who corresponds with Georgia if I can find one. I have no correspondent in that State. I never till very lately received an answer from Virga. on the subject of your former observations in support of the fOEdl Constitution. I find now that the three first letters were published at Richmond in a pamphlet with one or two other little pieces, and that they had a very valuable effect. The 4th was circulated in the Newspapers, not having arrived in time to be put into the pamphlet.(2) We have received no information of very late date or of a satisfactory nature from Europe. The London Head in the paper of this morning which I inclose, mentions a circumstance which leads to some new reflections on the situation of the Dutch.(3) I have no intelligence from the States Eastward of this worth adding. The elections in Massts. must by this time authorize a pretty good estimate of the two parties with regard to the plan of the Convention, but I am not yet possessed of theconjectures on the subject. It seems that both Mr. Gerry who opposed the plan in Convention, and Mr. Dana who followed the example in Congs. are left out of the returns from their respective districts. Perhaps the enmity of the for- January 3, 1788  mer may not only be embittered, but rendered more active and successful by this disappointment. On the floor of the Convention he could only have urged bad arguments, which might be answered & exposed by good ones. Without doors he will be able not only to urge them without opposition, but to insinuate that he could say much more, had he not been deprived of a hearing by the machinations of those who were afraid of being confronted. The post from the South being not yet come in I can not give you any Richmond News. The last I received was a continuation of the evidences of an increasing opposition to the new Government. The Characters which head it account fully for the change of opinions.  With very great esteem & regard I am Dr Sir, Yr Obedt. & very hble servt., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Sir New York January 6th 1788 Your letters of the 23d & 24th Ultimo came duly to hand.(1) Mr Livingston's letter I gave to Barnes who engaged to deliver it: the others I shall forward by the first opportunity or give them to Mr Hazard, as requested. There is no conveyance at present to any part of France, the Packet will probably be the first & will sail about the [ ]5th instant. We have no very particular accounts from the States South of Virginia respecting the great political question. The latest and best advice from Georgia comes from a gentleman in Philadelphia to Mr. Madison, informing him of the arrival of a vessel by which he learns that the new Constitution is so well received in that State as to give reason to believe it will not only be adopted but that their Convention will be unanimous in the act.(2) There seems to be no late accounts from the Carolina's by which one would be more likely to form a just opinion of their dispositions respecting the great question than might be done in the closet by reflecting on the nature of the new Constitution, the present situation of affairs and the genius & disposition of the people of those States. January 6, 1788  The intemperance of the few Philadelphians in attempting to drive the plan through their Legislature and in hissing the minority in Convention has considerably injured the good cause. Yet I see no reason to alter my opinion on the subject, or to disbelieve that the good sense of the people will finally prevail and the Constitution be adopted. There are no late accounts from Europe but the general opinion here is against a war at present between France and England. Please to accept the papers herewith enclosed and believe me to be with great Respect, Sir, your most Obedient & Very Humble Servant, N. Gilman ""

 My dear friend N. York Jany. 10. 1788. I have put off writing from day to day for some time past, in expectation of being able to give you the news from the packet, which has been looked for every hour. Both the French & English have overstaid their usual time ten or 15 days, and are neither of them yet arrived. We remain wholly in the dark with regard to the posture of things in Europe. I received two days ago your favor of Decr. 27 inclosing a copy of your letter to the Assembly.(1) I have read it with attention, and I can add with pleasure, because the spirit of it does as much honor to your candour, as the general reasoning does to your abilities. Nor can I believe that in this quarter the opponents to the Constitution will find encouragement in it. You are already aware that your objections are not viewed in the same decisive light by me as they are by you. I must own that I differ still more from your opinion, that a prosecution of the experiment of a second Convention will be favorable even in Virginia to the object which I am sure you have at heart. It is to me apparent that had your duty led you to throw your influence into the opposite scale, that it would have given it a decided and unalterable preponderancy; and that Mr. Henry would either have suppressed his enmity, or been baffled in the policy which it has dictated. It appears also that the ground taken by the opponents in different quarters, forbids any hope of concord among them. Nothing can be farther from your views than the principles of different setts of men, who have carried on their opposition under the respectability of your name. In this State the party adverse to the Constitution, notoriously meditate either a dissolution of the Union, or protracting it by patching up the  January 10, 1788  Articles of Confederation. In Connecticut & Massachusetts, the opposition proceeds from that part of the people who have a repugnancy in general to good government, to any substantial abridgment of State powers, and a part of whom in Massts. are known to aim at confusion, and are suspected of wishing a reversal of the Revolution. The Minority in Pennsylva. as far as they are governed by any other views than an habitual & factious opposition, to their rivals, are manifestly averse to some essential ingredients in a national Government. You are better acquainted with Mr. Henry's politics than I can be, but I have for some time considered him as driving at a Southern Confederacy and as no farther concurring in the plan of amendments than as he hopes to render it subservient to his real designs. Viewing the matter in this light, the inference with me is unavoidable that were a second trial to be made, the friends of a good constitution for the Union would not only find themselves not a little differing from each other as to the proper amendments; but perplexed & frustrated by men who had objects totally different. A second Convention would of course be formed under the influence, and composed in great measure of the members of opposition in the several States. But were the first difficulties overcome, and the Constitution re-edited with amendments, the event would still be infinitely precarious. Whatever respect may be due to the rights of private judgment, and no man feels more of it than I do, there can be no doubt that there are subjects to which the capacities of the bulk of mankind are unequal and on which they must and will be governed by those with whom they happen to have acquaintance and confidence. The proposed Constitution is of this description. The great body of those who are both for & against it, must follow the judgment of others not their own. Had the Constitution been framed & recommended by an obscure individual, instead of a body possessing public respect &confidence, there can not be a doubt, that altho' it would have stood in the identical words, it would have commanded little attention from most of those who now admire its wisdom. Had yourself, Col. Mason, Col. R. H. L., Mr. Henry & a few others, seen the Constitution in the same light with those who subscribed it, I have no doubt that Virginia would have been as zealous & unanimous as she is now divided on the subject. I infer from these considerations that if a Government be ever adopted in America, it must result from a fortunate coincidence of leading opinions, and a general confidence of the people in those who may recommend it. The very attempt at a second Convention strikes at the confidence in the first; and the existence of a second by opposing influence to influence, would in a manner destroy an effectual confidence in either, and give a loose to human opinions; which must be as various and irreconcileable concerning theories of Government, as doctrines of Religion; and give opportunities to designing men which it might be impossible to counteract.  The Connecticut Convention has probably come to a decision before this; but the event is not known here. It is understood that a great majority will adopt the Constitution. The accounts from Massts. vary extremely according to the channels through which they come. It is said that S. Adams who has hitherto been reserved, begins to make open declaration of his hostile views. His influence is not great, but this step argues an opinion that he can calculate on a considerable party. It is said here, and I believe on good ground that N. Carolina has postponed her Convention till July, in order to have the previous example of Virga. Should N. Carolina fall into Mr. H---;---;y's politics which does not appear to me improbable, it will endanger the Union more than any other circumstance that could happen. My apprehensions of this danger increase every day. The multiplied inducements at this moment to the local sacrifices necessary to keep the States together, can never be expected to co-incide again, and they are counteracted by so many unpropitious circumstances, that their efficacy can with difficulty be confided in. I have no information from S. Carolina or Georgia, on which any certain opinion can be formed of the temper of those States. The prevailing idea has been that both of them would speedily & generally embrace the Constitution. It is impossible however that the example of Virga. & N. Carolina should not have an influence on their politics. I consider every thing therefore as problematical from Maryland Southward. I am surprised that Col. H. Lee who is a well-wisher to the Constitution should have furnished Wilkinson with the alarm concerning the Mississippi, but the political connections of the latter in Pena. would account for his biass on the subject. We have no Congress yet. The number of St[ate]s on the Spot does not exceed five. It is probable that a quorum will now be soon made. A Delegate from N. Hampshire is expected which will make up a representation from that State. Thetermination of the Connecticut Convention will set her delegates at liberty. And the Meeting of the Assembly of this State, will fill the vacancy which has some time existed in her Delegation. I wish you every happiness, and am with the sincerest affection Yrs.,  Js. Madison Jr ""

Payment I think may be gotten from thence; not the smallest expectation at this place.

We are also very impatient for European Intelligence---;nothing of consequence can as yet be relied upon---;the packets are hourly expected. A little period since our Ministers abroad were predicting a speedy war. I do not believe the affairs of Europe exhibit at this time a more pacific appearance. If the contest in Holland has terminated with peace to the provinces, France will accept the challenge from England with spirit and with equal ability. A little while and then we may determine with certainty. Connecticut has received the Constitution---;a great majority. Four states have now adopted. Parties are running very high in Massachusetts: Samuel Adams and his friends have at length come forward: the Delegates from that Government, who understand characters, are doubtful of a happy Issue. If Mass. should be so unwise and dishonest to reject the system, N.

A golden day is now passing when a good government would invite many of the dutch patriots with immensity of wealth. January 20, 1788  We expect to make a Congress next week if the States South of the Delaware were represented. I think sufficient reasons could be urged to induce Congress to adjourn to Philadelphia about the first of May. I understand the opposition are brooding over something which will be hatched by the time of meeting of the next Assembly in February. Whether the offering will be a quadruped or a biped is not sufficiently known until it comes into existence. It must offer a legal and constitutional proof that the people of Pennsylvania were not represented in the last convention, and of course overset their proceedings. (This is inter nos).

 Dear Sir N. York Jany. 20. 1788. I have received and forwarded your letter and pamphlet to Mr. King.(1) The latest information from Boston makes it probable that every aid to the fOEderal cause will be wanted there. The antifederal party have found such reinfor<<ce>ments in the Insurgents, and the province of Maine which is afraid of creating obstacles to her separation, that there is the most serious reason to apprehend the friends of the Constitution will be outnumbered. The consequences of such an event elsewhere, are as obvious as they are melancholy. The Legislature at Poughkepsy is much divided on the point of submitting the Constitution to a Convention. The House of Assembly is in the affirmative, and is even supposed to be friendly to the merits. The Senate in its present State is opposed to a Convention. The arrival of the absent members may turn the scale in favor of one. On the merits that branch is certainly in the negative. The little piece by Philanthropos is  January 20, 1788  well calculated to cherish the distrust of a favorable issue to a second Convention, and will be reprinted here. I do not know a better mode of serving the fOEderal cause at this moment than to display the disagreement of those who make a common cause agst. the Constitution. It must produce the best affects on all who seriously wish a good general Government.(2) Your commands for the Editor of the paper under the title of Publicus shall be attended to.(3) I am Dear Sir with great respect Yr Obedt. hbl sert.

The Count de Moustier arrived a few days ago as successor to the Chevr. de la Luzerne. He had so long a passage that I do not know whether the dispatches brought by him, contain much that is new.(3) It seems that although the affairs of Holland are put into a pacific train, those of the Russians & Turks may yet produce a general broil in Europe. The Prussian Troops are to be withdrawn & the fate of the Dutch regulated by negociation. The intelligence from Massachts. begins to be rather ominous to the Constitution. The interest opposed to it is reinforced by all connected with the late insurrection, and by the province of Mayne which apprehends difficulties under the new System in obtaining a separate Government greater than may be otherwise experienced. Judging from the present state of the intelligence as I have it, the probability is  January 20, 1788  that the voice of that State will be in the negative. The Legislature of this State is much divided at present. The House of Assembly are said to be friendly to the merits of the Constitution. The Senate, at least a majority of those actually assembled, are opposed even to the calling a Convention. The decision of Massts. in either way, will decide the voice of this State.

 Dear Sir N. York Jany. 20. 1788. The Count de Moustier arrived here a few days ago as Successor to the Chevr. de la Luzerne. His passage has been so tedious that I am not sure that the despatches from Mr. Jefferson make any considerable addition to former intelligence. I have not yet seen them, but am told that this is the case. In general it appears that the affairs of Holland are put into pacific train. The Prussian troops are to be withdrawn, and the event settled by negociations. But it is still possible that the war between the Russians & Turks may spread a general flame throughout Europe. The intelligence from Massachusetts begins to be very ominous to the Constitution. The antifederal party is reinforced by the insurgents, and by the province of Mayne which apprehends greater obstacles to her scheme of a separate Government, from the new system than may be otherwise experienced. And according to the prospect at the date of the latest letters, there was very great reason to fear that the voice of that State would be in the negative. The operation of such an event on this State may easily be foreseen. Its Legislature is now sitting and is much divided. A majority of the Assembly are said to be friendly to  January 20, 1788  the merits of the Constitution. A Majority of the Senators actually convened are opposed to a submission of it to a Convention. The arrival of the absent members will render the voice of that branch uncertain on the point of a Convention. The decision of Massachusetts either way will involve the result in this State. The minority in Penna. is very restless under their defeat. If they can get an Assembly to their wish they will endeavor to undermine what has been done there. If backed by Massts. they will probably be emboldened to make some more rash experiment. The information from Georgia continues to be favorable. The little we get from S. Carolina is of the same complexion. If I am not misinformed as to the arrival of some members for Congress, a quorum is at length made up.

Agreeably to your Excellency's  January 23, 1788  proposal, I yesterday waited upon the Treasurer and received Fifty pounds for Mr. Gilman and a like sum for myself, with which I shall set out on my journey as soon as circumstances will permit, probably by Saturday or Monday next. When I reflect on expences which are unavoidable at New-York, and the smalness of the sum which I have received, I cannot but feel anxious lest Mr. Gilman will be greatly disappointed, and we both find ourselves soon in a very disagreable situation for want of cash.\"" ""

 Dear Sir N. York Jany. 25. 1788. I have been favoured since my last with yours of the 10th inst. with a copy of the Governours letter to the Assembly.(1) I do not know what impression the latter may make in Virginia. It is generally understood here that the arguments contained in it in favor of the Constitution are much stronger than the objections which prevented his assent. His arguments are forceable in all places, and with all persons. His objections are connected with his particular way of thinking on the subject, in which many of the Adversaries to the Constitution do not concur. The information from Boston by the mail on the evening before last, has not removed our suspence. The following is an extract of a letter from Mr. King dated on the 16th inst.(2) \""We may have 360 members in our Convention. Not more than 330 have yet taken their seats. Immediately after the settlement of Elections, the Convention resolved that they would consider and freely deliberate on each paragraph without taking a question on any of them individually, & that on the question whether they would ratify, each member should be at liberty to discuss the plan at large. This Resolution seems to preclude the idea of amendments; and hitherto the measure has not been suggested. I however do not from this circumstance conclude that it may not hereafter occur. The opponents of the Constitution moved that Mr. Gerry should be requested to take a seat in the Convention to answer such enquiries as the Convention should make concerning facts which happened in the passing of the Constitution. Although this seems to be a very irregular proposal, yet considering the jealousies which prevail with those who made it (who are certainly not the most enlightened part of the Convention) and the doubt of the issue had it been made a trial of strength, several friends of the Constitution united with the opponents and the Resolution was agreed to and Mr. Gerry has taken his seat. Tomorrow we are told cer- January 27, 1788  tain enquiries are to be moved for by the opposition, and that Mr. Gerry under the idea of stating facts is to state his reasons &c.---;this will be opposed and we shall on the division be able to form some idea of our relative strength. From the men who are in favour of the Constitution every reasonable explanation will be given, and arguments really new and in my judgment most excellent have been and will be produced in its support. But what will be its fate, I confess I am unable to discern. No question ever classed the people of this State in a more extraordinary manner, or with more apparent firmness.\"" A Congress of seven States was made up on Monday. Mr. C. Griffin has been placed in the chair. This is the only step yet taken. I remain with the highest respect & attachmt, Yrs affety., Js Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir, New York Jany. 27h. 1788. Seven States being represented in Congress on Tuesday last, we proceeded to the choice of a President and Cyrus Griffin was elected. The indisposition of one member has prevented our making a Congress since that day, so that we have had no opportunity of instituting the enquiry directed by the General Assembly(1) ---;however the commissioners of the Treasury Board have (without any request from us) inclosed us copies of a number of papers relative to the transaction, but as they do not contain all the information required by the Assembly we delay sending them forward to you until we can obtain such other papers & information as may be procured.  As the situation of my private affairs will prevent my continuing long from home, it is my duty to inform you that I can not remain here longer than the last of February; by that time one of the other Gentlemen will I hope be able to attend. The ratification of the new federal Goverment by the people of Deleware, Pennsylvania and Connecticut have been r[ecd] in Congress.

 Sir New York January 27th 1788 I have been honored with your letter of the 11th instant.(1) I need not tell you how much pleasure it would give me to be able to answer your queries, to your satisfaction, but I am persuaded that no observations short of an actual survey will enable you to gratify your correspondents abroad---;(particularly relative to your 3d querie) with such accuracy as to hazard any thing positively; I will however relate to you such facts, and observations as actually came within my own knowledge, as well as accounts of persons who I think may be confided in. From a place called Mahoning on the big Beaver to the falls of the Cayahoga is about thirty miles, the Country is hilley, tho not Mountainous, the chief, is called the Buck ridge in this rout, which is not high, but pretty extensive, being several miles over, a flat moist Country on the summit; in some places it inclines to be marshey and the difficulty of travelling is increased much by the roots of Buck trees with which it is heavily loaded. The Cayahago, above the great falls is rapid, rockey, and is interrupted by sundry lesser falls, on the branch that heads towards that part of the big Beaver called Mahoning. This account I had from an intelligent person, then at Mahoning, who was loading a Sloop with flour at the mouth of Cayahoga for Detroit; he added that an old Indian assured him it was not more than 15 miles from Mahoning to a navigable Creek, a few miles East of Cayahoga---; that he had employed the Indian to blaise a road, and intended when that was done to explore the Country himself. I presume however this service was not performed, as this Gentlemans Men & Horses were soon after killed and his store house burned by the Savages. Captain Brady, a Partizan Officer, says that the sources of the big Beaver, Muskingum, and a large deep Creek which empties into Lake Erie, 15 or 20  January 27, 1788

 624 January 27, 1788 miles above Cayahoga, are within a very few miles of each other, (perhaps four or five) and that the Country is level. Several other persons of considerable credibility and information, have assured me the portage between Muskingum, and the Waters falling into the Lake, in wet seasons---;do not exceed 15 miles---;some say two miles, but I believe the first is the safest to credit. At Mahoning, and for many miles above and below, I found the general course of the Beaver to be East & West, from which I concluded this place to be the nearest to the main branch of Cayahoga---;and on comparing the sundry accounts I am led to think, that, the shortest communication between the Waters of Beaver, Muskingum, and Lake Erie, will be found to lie East and west of Cayahoga. I have also been informed by a young Gentleman of veracity, that the sources of the grand River (laid down in Hutchins's Map) and a branch of Beaver which falls into Big Beaver, called Shinango, are not more than twelve miles apart---;the Country hilley---; I know this to be a fine Boatable stream its confluence with the Big Beaver about 20 miles from the Ohio. I droped down the Beaver from Mohoning to the great fall about seven miles from the Ohio, in a Canoe on the first of July without any difficulty---;it is true that at this season when all the western waters are remarkably low, some small riffles appear---;but nothing to cause any material obstruction. The great falls appear at first view impracticable, at low water; indeed too tremendous, at any season, notwithstanding it has been passed at all seasons. I met two men in a flat Boat a few miles above, who had carried their Cargo half a mile on shore and then warped up the empty Boat---;they set with poles the rest of the way to Mahoning. This Boat carried about a ton and a half---;but at some seasons there will undoubtedly be water sufficient for Boats with five tons in. Canoes tis said have ascended 25 miles higher than Mahoning, which must certainly be verynear one branch of Muskingum---;as it continues a westerly course---;and this most Easterly branch of that River, it is agreed by all who have been in that quarter approaches very near to waters falling into Lake Erie. All agree likewise that the Rivers north of the dividing ridge are deep and smooth the Country being flat, particularly those west of the Cayahoga. Following the Indian path, which generally keeps in the low ground, along the River, the distance from the mouth of Big Beaver to Mahoning is 50 miles, which with the 30 computed from thence to Cayahog makes 80. But I am certain a much better road will be found by keeping along the high grounds which divide the waters of the big, and little Beaver, and the distance shortened at least 20 miles---;but this digression I must beg your pardon for. To your 4th querie I flatter myself I shall be able to afford you more satisfaction, as I think I can point out a more practicable and easy Communication by which the  January 27, 1788  articles of trade you mention, can be transported from Lake Erie, to the Ohio, than any other hitherto mentioned---;at least untill Canals are cut. This is by a branch of the Alegheny, which is Navigable by Boats of considerable burden to within 8 miles of Lake Erie. I examined the greatest part of this communication myself, and such as I did not, was before and subsequent to my being there, by persons whose account can scarce be doubted. From Fort Pitt to Venango by land on the Indian, & French, path is computed to be 90 miles---;by water it is said to be at least a third more; but as you know the Country so far, I will forbear giving any account of it---;but proceed to inform you that I set out from Vinango and traveled, by land, tho frequently, on the beach or within high water mark---;(the Country in many places being almost impracticable for a Horse) to the Confluence of a branch or Creek called Caniwagoo, about 65 miles from French Creek. The general course of the River between these two Creeks is North East---;the course of Caniwagoo is very near north---;it is upwards of 100 yards wide 30 miles up from the mouth to a fork---;deep and not very rapid---;to this fork the navigation is rather better from Vinango, than from thence to Fort Pitt. I traveled about 25 miles a day, two Indians pushed a large Canoe loaded, and encamped with me every night; as the River is crooked I think it must have been near 40 miles by water. One fork of the Canewago continues a north direction about 7 miles to a beautifull Lake, this Lake is noticed in Hutchins map by the name Lake Jadaqui, but is badly executed---;it extends by the best information I could obtain, to within 9 miles of Lake Erie---;is from one quarter to two miles broad, and deep enough. I was taken sick which prevented my intended Journey to Lake Erie. The following account I had from an Indian Chief of the Seneca tribe---;as well as from a white Man named Mathews, of Virginia, who says he was taken by the Indians at the Canhawa in the year1777, he has lived with the Indians since that time; as far as I could Judge he appeared to be well acquainted with this part of the Country. I employed him on this tour as interpreter. That from the upper end of Jadaqui Lake, to Lake Erie, is not more than 9 miles along the path, or road, for they with great confidence assured me that there was formerly a Carriage road between the two Lakes. The Indian related this, that he was about fourteen years old when the French first went to establish a post at Fort Pitt---;That he accompanied an Uncle of his a Chief Warior, who attended the French on that occasion, that the head of Lake Jadaqui was the Spot the Detachment embarked at; that they fell down all the way to Fort Pitt without obstruction---;in large Canoes, with Artillery, Stores, provision &ca. He added that French Creek was made the communication afterwar[d]s---;for what reason he could not tell---;but always wondered at it, as he expressed himself, knowing this other to be so   much better. This Seneca also related a number of circumstances to corroberate, and convince me of the truth of his account---;among which the most remarkable are---;That he was constantly employed by the British last war in this quarter had the rank of Captain---;that he Commanded the party who were defeated up the Aligheny by Col. Broadhead---;That in the year 1782 a Detachmnent, composed of 300 British and 500 Indians were formed, and actually embarked in Canoes on Lake Jadaqui---;with 12 pieces of Artillery, with an avowed intention to attack Fort Pitt. This Expedition he says was laid aside occasioned by reports of the repair & strength of the place, carried by a person from the neighborhood of the Fort. They then contented themselves with, the usual mode of sending small partys on the frontiers, one of whom burned Hannas town. I recollect very well that in August 1782 we picked up a number of Canoes, which drifted down the River---;and I received repeated accounts in June & July---;as well from friendly Indians, who I employed as from a Canadian who Deserted to me, of this armament, but I never knew with precision, before this account, of the spot of formation. Both the Seneca and Mathews wanted to conduct me as farther proof of their veracity---;to where an Iron four pounder lies on the bank of Jadaqui Lake---;which the Indian says was left there by the French. Major Finley who has been in that Country since I was, informs me he saw the Gun. Mathews wished me much to explore the East fork of Caniwagoo---; but the reason already mentioned prevented me---;his account is---;that it is navigable about 40 miles up from the Junction with the North or west branch, it suddenly terminates in a Swamp---;which is half a mile wide---;that on the north side of this swamp, a very large Creek has its source, called Cateraqui, which falls into Lake Erie about 40 miles from the head, that he has three several times been of a party---;who went up the one & down the other, carrying the Canoe over theswamp only---;he added that Cateraqui waters much the finest Country between Niagara and Presque Isle.  A letter has been lately published in a Philadelphia News paper, written by one of the Gentlemen who was employed last summer in running a boundary line between New York and Pennsylvania, which I think supports the foregoing accounts very much---;his words are as near as I can recollect \""We pushed up a large branch of the Alegheny called Caniwango, to a beautiful Lake Chataghque---;(so he spells the names) which is from one half mile to three or four broad, and upwards of twenty long; the Country is level and land good to a great extent on both sides. We ascended the dividing ridge between this and Lake Erie, from this place a most delightfull prospect was open to us.\"" Here he dwells on the scene and future prospects of grandeure &ca not to the present purpose, but concludes by saying that in his opin-  ion \""the waters of Lake Erie can not be brought to the Ohio as the summit of the dividing ridge is 70 feet higher than that Lake but we continued along the common path to Lake Erie which is only nine miles though the path is crooked---;a good waggon road may be made which will not exceed seven miles as the hill is not steep.\"" This Gentleman has overlooked the Eastern branch which is extraordinary if his view was to find out a communication as there is very little difference in the size of the two at the Junction. I suppose the Commissioners have reported to the Executives of New York & Pennsylvania---;which I doubt not I can have access to. If I find any thing more particular than what is herein mentioned, I will inform you. I am sorry this detail has been spun out to such length, as I doubt will rather weary than afford you real satisfaction, but being obliged to blend other persons information with what came within my own knowledge, rendered it in some degree unavoidable. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, Your Excellencys Most Obedient Humble Servant, Wm. Irvine(2) ""

I was the more anxious to receive it expecting it might contain some account of the Proceedings of the Assembly concerning which have had very imperfect information; but suppoze your hurry of Business has prevented your writing. I must request that you will write to me more frequently, be assured that the regular Correspondence of a Relation & Friend for whom I have the greatest Affection & esteem would add very much to my Happiness. We have at length formd a Congress but as only Seven States are yet fully represented no Business of Consequence has been taken up. I shall bring forward the Kentucky Address at as early a Period as possible, from the soundings which I have been able to make, have sanguine hopes of Success; but with me it is an Object of such consequence that I shall not be free from Anxiety untill it is fin[ally dete]rmined.(1) I think little is to be feared from the Project for ceeding the Navigation of the Mississippi to Spain almost a total change of Sentiment upon that Subject has taken place, the Opposition has acquired great Strength from the Sales of Western Territory; many Inhabitants of the Eastern States of great Influence & powerfull Connections have become Adventurers in that Country & are now engaged in forming Settlements at Muskingum, Miamia &c. The fate of the New Constitution becomes every day more precarious. Connecticut & the Three States south of this have adopted it. In this it will meet with Opposition. The Convention of Massachusetts is now sitting but the event of their deliberations is extremely doubtful---; such warmth has already prevailed as had well nigh ended in total confusion---;both parties are equally confident of Success. Should it be rejected in that state I fear the consequences will be fatal to the Plan. The hope of its succeeding is the only Prop which atpresent supports the Feoderal Government. If it was finally rejected I fear we should immediately experience the dire effects of Anarchy & the total disolution of our Confederacy. But  January 28, 1788  we will not yet dispair.

I give it to you as I have recd. it in the words of Mr. King.(1) Boston 20. Jany. 88 \""Our Convention proceeds slowly. An apprehension that the liberties of the people are in danger, and a distrust of men of property or education have a more powerful effect upon the minds of our opponents than any specific objections against the Constitution. If the opposition was grounded on any precise points, I am persuaded that it might be weakened, if not entirely overcome. But every attempt to remove their fixed and violent jealousy seems hitherto to operate as a confirmation of that baneful passion. The opponents affirm to each other that they have an unalterable majority on their side. The friends doubt the strength of their adversaries but are not entirely confident of their own. An event has taken place relative to Mr. Gerry, which without great caution may throw us into confusion. I informed you by the last post on what terms Mr. Gerry took a Seat in the Convention. Yesterday in the course of debate on the Construction of the Senate, Mr. G. unasked, informed the Convention that he had some information to give the Convention on the subject then under discussion. Mr. Dana and a number of the most respectable members, remarked upon the impropriety of Mr. G---;---;s conduct. Mr. G. rose with a view to justify himself. He was immediately prevented by a number of ob- January 28, 1788  jectors. This brought on an irregular conversation whether Mr. G. should be heard. The Hour of adjournment arrived and the President adjourned the House. Mr. Gerry immediately charged Mr. Dana with a design of injuring his reputation by partial information, and preventing his having an opportunity to communicate important truths to the Convention. This charge drew a warm reply from Mr. Dana. The members collected about them, took sides as they were for or against the Constitution, and we were in danger of the utmost confusion. However the gentlemen separated, and I suppose tomorrow morning will renew the discussion before the Convention. I shall be better able to conjecture the final issue by next post.\"" There are other letters of the same date from other gentlemen on the spot which exhibit rather a more favorable prospect. Some of them I am told are even flattering. Accounts will always vary in such cases, because they must be founded on different opportunities of remarking the general complexion; where they take no tincture from the opinions or temper of the writer.

 [New York, January ? 1788] \""The account you saw in the newspaper respecting the SALE OF THE WESTERN LANDS must have been erroneous. There was about one hundred and twenty thousand acres of the first surveys that went off at the average price of about one dollar per acre; and what has been contracted for at two thirds of a dollar per acre will amount to near seven million dollars, to be paid at different periods. There are still great tracts of land belonging to the United States in the western country; but how long the rage for purchasing will continue, or what proportion of the domestic debt will be absorbed in this way is very uncertain. The States have a right to look to North-Carolina and Virginia for large cessions of territory, and should they comply, there will be land enough, if they can find purchasers, to sink the whole. But as this depends on the nature of our Government and various circumstances, it is difficult to foresee what will take place.\"" Reprinted from the Albany Journal, February 2, 1788, where it was printed under the heading: \""Albany, February 2.

Nicholas Gilman, whose home was in Exeter, was the only New Hampshire delegate attending Congress from October 1787 to January 1788.

Gerry has not returned to the Convention, and I think will not again be invited. We are now thinking of Amendments to be submitted not as a condition of our assent & ratification, but as the Opinion of the Convention subjoined to their ratification. This scheme may gain a few members but the issue is doubtful.\"" In this case as in the last Mr. King's information is accompanied with letters from other persons on the spot which dwell more on the favorable side of the prospect. His anxiety on the subject may give a greater activity to his fears than to his hopes; and he would naturally lean to the cautious side. These circumstances encourage me to put as favorable a construction on his letter as it will bear. A vessel is arrived here from Charlestown which brings letters that speak with confidence of an adoption of the fOEdl Government in that State; and make it very probable that Georgia had actually adopted it.

 Dear Sir N. York Feby 3d. 1788. Another mail has arrived from Boston without terminating the conflict between our hopes and fears. I have a letter from Mr. King of the 27 which after dilating somewhat on the ideas in his former letters, concludes with the following paragraph.(1) \""We have avoided every question which would have shewn the division of the House. Of consequence we are not positive of the numbers on each side. By the last calculation we made on our side, we were doubtful whether we ex- February 3, 1788  ceeded them or they us in numbers. They however say that they have a majority of eight or twelve against us. We by no means despair.\"" Another letter of the same date from another member gives the following picture.(2) \""Never was there an assembly in this State in possession of greater ability & information than the present Convention---;yet I am in doubt whether they will approve the Constitution. There are unhappily three parties opposed to it. 1. All men who are in favour of paper money & tender laws; those are more or less in every part of the State. 2. All the late insurgents & their abettors. In the three great western Counties they are very numerous. We have in the Convention 18 or 20 who were actually in Shay's army. 3. A great majority of the members from the Province of Main. Many of them & their Constituents are only squatters upon other people's land, and they are afraid of being brought to account. They also think though erroneously that their favorite plan, of being a separate State will be defeated. Add to these the honest doubting people, and they make a powerful host. The leaders of this Party are a Mr. Wedgery, Mr Thomson, & Mr Nason from the province of Main---;A Docr. Taylor from the County of Worster & Mr. Bishop from the neighbourhood of R. Island. To manage the cause agst. them are the present and late Govr., 3 Judges of the supreme Court---; 15 members of the Senate---;20 from among the most respectable of the Clergy, 10 or 12 of the first characters at the bar, Judges of probate, High Sheriffs of Counties & many other respectable people, Merchants &c---;Genls.

 Dear Sir New York Feby 6 1788 I wrote you in my last(1) that a few days after my arrival here, which was 17 Novr, the Secretary of Congress notified the States that were unrepresented, to send forward their delegates; But as I suppose, the approaching convention of several States was so interesting, that no representation took place until 21st Jany, & then of only seven States; N Hamshire, Connecticut, N Carolina, & Georgia, having only one, & N York, & R Island none. The apprehension of an Indian War, you are sensible is not groundless; Georgia having made a formal declaration, having 4500 men raised & raising. Reports indeed are that, the Indians either suppose, or they really are, ill used by the Georgians & N. Carolinians; That such are their resentments, whether well or ill founded, that they never will again be at peace with them; But if this is the fact, & Georgia & N Carolina would make the cession, that the other States have done, agreeably to repeated calls of Congress, The United States could consistantly adopt the business; And the Indians having no prejudices against the fOEderal Government, might probably be induced to treat with the Commissioners of the USA, upon terms much more advantageous, than with those against whom they are highly irritated; But altho the USA have already expended as much to defend Georgia, as the whole State upon a fair valuation would sell for, She delays mak- February 6, 1788  ing her cession, And expects the USA go on conquering, more Indian Lands for her emolument. You see by the papers a scramble has taken place, between the emigrants to the Western waters & the Spanyards, in which some blood has been spilt; I wish the rashness of some of these people dont bring us into great embarrassment. The State of Virginia I see by the papers have passed an act very unfriendly to one of our principal manufactories (if distilling may come under that denomination) by laying a duty, equal to prohibition, upon N E Rum, in common with all foreign Spirits; We take from them large parcels of flower, of grain & tobacco, Why therfore so little tenderness is shewed to our distilleries ought to be a subject of serious enquiry.(2) The Situation of the Western Lands of Massachusetts, is critical; besides transient encroachers, who once on it will be extremely difficult to remove, the formidable & systematic effort to get possession under Indian leases, cannot but be a serious object---; And I cannot but be of opinion the Treaty proposed by Govr Clinton would have had a benificial effect. It would have evinced to the Jobbers under Indian Grants, & others, that we were not inattentive to our interests, and have tended to discourage their practices; It would also have tended to efface prejudices, which I am well informed interested men have very industriously created, in the minds of the Indians, and particularly against the people of Massachusetts: And moreover the earliest attention should be paid to the business of the Western Lands, because the other States so well as the USA, having vast quantities of Lands for sale, it seems to be poor policy to pos[t]pone the sales of ours, until all the best purchasers are supplied, with the alotments of N York, Pensylvania & FOEderal lands: Indeed we suffer much for want of a speedy permanent system of disposition in regard to our unlocated lands, And every State out strips us in this business. I need not enlargeupon the weak state of the FOEderal Government; Many circumstances contribute to debase its dignity. The Tre[a]sury of the USA being without supplies, Their troops stationed to secure the frontiers, and the Civil list of Congress destitute of provision; And even the small pittance necessary for the subsistence of the Presidents household, even in the most eligible stile, of republican neatness & simplicity, only attainable from other inadequate appropriations; Are facts which evince the most degrading poverty in the fOEderal Government---;And how can it be otherwise? Massachusetts in the last sessions resumed all the provision she had made for support of the Union---;Virginia at the same time withdrew her supplies. In this situation without any provision for a growing foreign & domestic debt, can it be wondered at that a Government, not destitute indeed of resources, but so supine in her application of them, should be viewed in a   ridiculous light by her own Citizens, & a contemptible one by other Nations? Every good Citizen feels himself hurt by the indignities his Country is liable to in this humiliating predicament both at home & abroad. Under these circumstances however Congress thot it their duty at least to preserve the forms, & proceeded to the election of Cyrus Griffin Esq their President on 22d Jany, but being only seven states represented, the more important business is necessarily defered.(3) The arrival of the minister from the Court of France(4) is an additional attention, to the many acts of friendship experienced from a generous ally; But when he comes to remind us, & that in very pressing terms, of large ballances long since due, both for principal & interest, we cannot make him such a reply as friendship or good policy dictate. Congress have it in Contemplation to adjourn in the Spring, And efforts will be made to get the place of adjournment to Philadelphia, but this will be opposed; I wish for the opinion of my judicious friend upon this subject; Possibly it might prevent a Seat more Southward. The Commissioners under the Resolve 29 Sept 1786(5) have finished runing the Line East of Hudsons river between Massachusetts & New York, have filed their report plan &c in the Secretarys office,(6) And an accurate delineation of the business was done by a Mr Thomson, which occupying him 30 days he demands 70 dolls for; And as this can never go out of the Office of Congress have conversed him upon the subject of drawing out another plan, from the field book, and for which he demands sixty, but perhaps may be induced to take fifty dollars; I did not chuse to engage him absolutely until I have authority therfor, but should advise by all means to have it executed; And as it is a work of time, a speedy answer would be best. Copy of the Surveyors report is transmitted. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very sincerely, Sam. A Otis ""

 Dear Sir New York Feby. 8---;[17]88 The prospect in Massts. seems to brighten, if I view in the true light the following representation of it.(1) \""This day, (Jany. 30) for the first our President Mr. Handcock took his seat in Convention, and we shall probably terminate our business on Saturday or Tuesday next. I can not predict the issue, but our hopes are increasing. If Mr. Hancock does not disappoint our present expectations, our wishes will be gratified.\"" Several reflections are suggested by this paragraph which countenance a favorable inference from it. I hope from the rapid advance  February 10, 1788  towards a conclusion of the business, that even the project of recommendatory alterations has been dispensed with. The form of the ratification of Georgia is contained in one of the papers herewith inclosed.(2) Every information from S. Carolina continues to be favorable. I have seen a letter from N. Carolina of pretty late date which admits that a very formidable opposition exists, but leans towards a fOEderal result in that State. As far as I can discover, the state of the question in N Carolina is pretty analagous to that in Virginia. The body of the people are better disposed than some of a superior order. The Resolutions of New York for calling a Convention, appear by the paper to have passed by a majority of two only in the House of Assembly.(3) I am told this proceeded in some degree from an injudicious form in which the business was conducted; and which threw some of the fOEderalists into the opposition. I am just informed by a gentleman who has seen another letter from Boston of the same date with mine, that the plan of recommendatory alterations has not been abandoned, but that they will be put into a harmless form, and will be the means of saving the Constitution from all risk in Massts.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York February 13th, 1788. Your letter of the 7th of January, in consequence of some mismanagement, never reached me until yesterday. I hasten to acknowledge it's receipt & to give you such information as I am possessed of relative to the subject of your enquiry. Besides the army's apportionment in the four ranges of townships lately sold & exposed for sale, at public vendue, there have been two allotments of land for the military rights(2) viz. a million of acres situate about fifty miles from the Ohio, in the rear of the seven ranges on the one hand & the New England purchase on the other. This I am informed is excellent in quality, & will doubtless be very valuable. It's distance from the river is the only objection against it. The other allotment is very far below & beyond this as well as the New England & Symmes's purchases. It embraces a large tract of country at the mouth of the Wabash & it will, I expect, be so far extended, as to satisfy all the claims of the army which may survive and remain after the above settlements & purchases are compleated. February 13, 1788  The Secretary at war acquaints me that [. . .] those tracts surveyed & prepared for dist[ribution, which] may be done with convenience & in [. . .con]sidering that the drafts for those lands will [. . .] & not by lines, by which means those [. . .] related, would wish to be neighbours in [. . .] widely seperated & upon considering too that [. . .] and risk as to the quality would be the same or nearly so, in the one case as in the other & in addition to those two considerations, that our locations there must depend on future contingencies, while here they will be immediate and certain, I have been induced to determine for myself in favor of laying my right within the purchase made by Mr. Symmes. I have taken care to examine upon the maps the relative situations of all these tracts in point of climate and navigation & altho' I am convinced that at some future distant day, the settlements on the Wabash will be more highly favorable than these particulars, I am still inclined to give the present preference to the country contained between the two Miamis. In answer to your enquiry whether Congress ever enlarged the Grant made by them in the first instance to the Army,(3) I can only say, that if they did, I neither know of it, nor can find it on their journals. I had received & entertained until very lately an impression to the same effect, without being able to recollect how it was occasioned, but I have now reason to apprehend that it was never founded in fact. I wish you to be assured that I shall be happy in making communications on this head or any other, that [will be] Serviceable to you or to your friends.

 My dear Child(1) New York Feb. 16, 1788. In my last letter which was directed to your Aunt Wingate,(2) I intimated that I intended to direct my next to you. This I conclude will be very welcome as I know that you was not a little anxious at my leaving home. You have observed that I was rather depressed in spirits for some time before I came on my journey. I am not quite so much now as I was then, altho' I cannot say that I feel very cheerful. I am very well in health & as agreably situated as I could be in this City. There are five of us who board in one family with a clever widow woman. The gentlemen are agreeable, three of them are unmarried, the other near my age who has had eighteen children. The widow I never see only at table. We have no other amusement but conversation & reading. I have no visiting acquaintance yet, & unless I should find somebody that I can visit without much ceremony, I desire to have none. We do but little business in Congress yet, & there is nothing interesting which I have to Communicate. This gives leisure to write which you must not expect will be so frequent in future. Last evening I went to the Theatre where I saw acted a silly Commedy called the School of Scandal & a farce called the true born Irishman.(3) Neither of them were worth hearing for the sentiments contained in them, but the manner in which they were performed afforded some diversion. The play house was curiously prepared for the variety of scenes & the company, especially [the] ladies were very showey. But the entertainment was not, worth the expence, unless merely for curiosity once, & I am determined not to go any more to that trifling place, which is frequented by many as often as twice in a week. The expence of living here will not exceed what I expected unless it should be for clothing &c &c which I can assure your Aunt Wingate has cost me nothing yet. I shall not be put out for want of ruffles as a large number of the Delegates dress as plain as I do, while some younggentlemen dress very gay. My bald head does very well when dressed which costs me six pence pr. day. Washing costs half a dollr pr. Dozen great & small pieces together, which I do not think dear. The Congress house is elegant where every member has a great chair & writing desk & pen, Ink  February 16, 1788  & paper before him, which with paper & all the necessaries for writing at our lodgings are supplyed at the public expence, so that I begrudge nothing but my time in writing letters. Each member also has given him all the j[o]urnals of Congress & seventeen news papers every week which is a considerable work to read. There are now about twenty members of Congress present who are in general very sociable & appear to me much like other men. Next Tuesday week we are to have a very great day in receiving and giving a public audience to a French Count who is just arrived a Minister plenipotentiarry from his most Christian Majesty. This will be a curiosity that does not often happen. I have now given you enough of this triffling information. Its coming from a distant & affectionate friend is what alone can make it worth reading. I hope that you are happy, & by a prudent discreet conduct in life will continue so. You must not allot upon uninterrupted pleasures nor expect too much from the imperfect enjoyments of life, if you wish not to be disappointed. For my own part my expectations of happiness here were never very raised & for that reason have not been mortifyed with disappointments. You will find that a virtuous & sober mind without the mistaken gloom of superstition will best contribute to calmness & chearfulness. This will rob you of no real pleasures. I am led to these reflections while I am writing by hearing the almost numberless carriages ratling on the pavements to the assembly room this evening. This City is noted for its expensive pleasures & dissipations in a throng of young company, but one hour in the circle of my old friends would be infinitely preferable by me. I hope to hear from my family soon & that they are all well. Mr. Wiggin can superscribe any letters that are wrote & direct them to me in Congress at New York & leave them in the Post office at Portsmo[uth] or Exeter & they will come directly to me within eight or ten days. Ishall have some letters to write upon business to several persons soon, & it is uncertain when I shall write again to any of the family. Tell Sally & George that I shall not forget to give them a letter when I have leisure nor John & Betsey by that time they shall be able to read such bad writing. I hope Mr. Bigelow & Mr. Mason have paid the money they promised, & that your Mother has been able to buy for you such things as you further wanted. I desire to be remembered to the whole circle of my friends without particularly enumerating them; & be assured they ever have my best wishes. I am yours affectionately P Wingate P.S. I had forgot to mention in any of my letters the most remarkable circumstance that has attended me in New York which is, that I have always slept alone & never had my bed warmed, which is neither injurious to my health nor very mortifying to my feelings now. We have had very pleasant & moderate weather until this morning but now have a violent snow storm. Adieu. PW. February 18, 1788  ""

I thank you for them---;and yet I feel no addition of real satisfaction in being thus elevated, but truly and with sincerity I experience the reverse. My family are the great object I have in contemplation, and if this promotion in its consequences shall redound to the advantage of my children my utmost wishes will be accomplished, so far as private considerations are permitted to operate---;at all times and upon all occasions I would sacrifice my ease to their emolument. And as to the public, it is not in my power to do any essential services, but I will discharge my duty with honesty and to the best of my abilities. The consultation between the ladies has certainly been a wise one; how happy is lady C.(1) in having so amiable and intelligent a friend! And yet I am almost tired to death with this kind of life, in a croud thro' the day and solitary at night---;the family must certainly be set in motion in April or May unless something material should intervene to prevent a Journey to N.

Maryland and South-Carolina by large majorities in convenient time; N. York, Virginia, and N.

 Dear Sir New York Feby. 19. 1788 By the Count de Moustier I received your favour of the 8th of October.(1) I recd. by his hands also the watch which you have been so good as to provide for me, and for which I beg you to accept my particular thanks. During that short trial I have made, she goes with great exactness. Since the arrival of the Count de Moustier, I have recd. also by the Packet Mr. Calonne's publication(2) for myself, and a number of the Mercure's(3) for Mr. Banister. The bearer was a Mr. Stuart. I had a conveyance to Mr. Banister a few days after the Mercure's came to hand. The Public here continues to be much agitated by the proposed fOEderal Constitution and to be attentive to little else. At the date of my last Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had adopted it.(4) It has been since adopted by Connecticut, Georgia, and Massachusetts. In the first the minority consisted of 40 against 127. In Georgia the adoption was unanimous. In Massachusetts the conflict was tedious and the event extremely doubtful. On the final question the vote stood 187 against 168; a majority of 19 only being in favor of the Constitution. The prevailing party comprized however all the men of abilities, of property, and of influence. In the opposite multitude there was not a single character capable of uniting their wills or directing their measures. It was made up partly of deputies from the province of Maine who apprehended difficulties from the New Government to their scheme of separation, partly of men who had espoused the disaffection of Shay's; and partly of ignorant and jealous men, who had been taught or had fancied that the Convention at Philada. had entered into a conspiracy against the liberties of the people at large, in order to erect an aristocracy for the rich, the well-born, and the men of Education. They had no plan whatever. They looked no farther than to put a negative on the Constitution and return home. The amendments as recommended by the Convention, were as I am well informed not so muchcalculated for the minority in the Convention, on whom they had little effect, as for the people of the State. You will find the amendments in the Newspapers which are sent from the office of foreign affairs. It appears from a variety of circumstances that disappointment had produced no asperity in the minority, and that they will probably not only acquiesce in the event, but endeavour to reconcile their constituents to it. This was the public declaration of several who were called the leaders of the party. The minority of Connecticut behaved with equal moderation. That of Pennsylvania has been extremely intemperate and continues to use a very bold and menacing language. Had the decision in Massachusetts been adverse to the Constitution, it is not improbable that some very violent measures would have followed in that State. The cause of the inflamation  February 19, 1788  however is much more in their State factions, than in the system proposed by the Convention. New Hampshire is now deliberating on the Constitution. It is generally understood that an adoption is a matter of certainty. South Carolina & Maryland have fixed on April or May for their Conventions. The former it is currently said will be one of the ratifying States. Mr. Chace and a few others will raise a considerable opposition in the latter. But the weight of personal influence is on the side of the Constitution, and the present expectation is that the opposition will be outnumbered by a great majority. This State is much divided in its sentiment. Its Convention is to be held in June. The decision of Massts. will give the turn in favor of the Constitution unless an idea should prevail or the fact should appear, that the voice of the State is opposed to the result of its Convention. North Carolina has put off her Convention till July.(5) The State is much divided it is said. The temper of Virginia, as far as I can learn, has undergone but little change of late. At first there was an enthusiasm for the Constitution. The tide next took a sudden and strong turn in the opposite direction. The influence and exertions of Mr. Henry, and Col. Mason and some others will account for this. Subsequent information again represented the Constitution as regaining in some degree its lost ground. The people at large have been uniformly said to be more friendly to the Constitution than the Assembly. But it is probable that the dispersion of the latter will have a considerable influence on the opinions of the former. The previous adoption of nine States must have a very persuasive effect on the minds of the opposition, though I am told that a very bold language is held by Mr. H---;---;y and some of his partizans. Great stress is laid on the self-sufficiency of that State; and the prospect of external props is alluded to. Congress have done no business of consequence yet, nor is it probable that much more of any sortwill precede the event of the great question before the public. The Assembly of Virginia have passed the district Bill of which I formerly gave you an account.(6) There are 18 districts, with 4 new Judges, Mr. Gabl Jones, Richd. Parker, St. George Tucker and Jos. Prentis. They have reduced much the taxes, and provided some indulgences for debtors. The question of British debts underwent great vicicitudes. It was after long discussion resolvd. by a majority of 30 agst. the utmost exertions of Mr. Henry that they sd. be paid as soon as the other States sd. have complied with the treaty. A few days afterwards he carried his point by a majority of 50 that G.B. should first comply. Adieu, Yrs. Affety., Js. Madison Jr P.S.

The Amount we understand is about three Hundred and twenty Dollars, and as this Expence must necessarily fall on the States interested we think it for the Honor of the State we represent that the Honorable Legislature give order for the immediate payment of it's Moiety of the said Sum when demanded by Congress, which we suppose will be as soon as the Committe to whom this Business is referred shall make their Report.(3) We have anticipated the regular Communication of this Matter that it may if possible, be before the Legislature previous to their Adjournment.

 Dear Sir New York Feby 20. 1788 I am just favored with yours of the 7th(1) inst. and will attend to your wishes as to the political essays in the press. I have given notice to my friends in Orange that the County may command my services in the Convention, if it pleases. I can say with great truth however that in this overture I sacrifice every private inclination to considerations not of a selfish nature. I foresee that the undertaking will involve me in very laborious and irksome discussions; that public opposition to several very respectable characters whose esteem and friendship I greatly prize may unintentionally endanger the subsisting connection; and that disagreeable misconstructions, of which samples have been already given, may be the fruit of those exertions which fidelity will impose. But I have made up my determination on the subject; and if I am informed that my presence at the election in the County be indispensable, shall submit to that condition also: though it is my particular wish to decline it, as well to avoid apparent solicitude on the occasion; as a journey of such length at a very unpleasant season. I had seen the extract of your letter to Col. Carter, and had supposed from the place where it first made its appearance that its publication was the effect of the zeal of a correspondent. I cannot but think on the whole that it may have been of service, notwithstanding the scandalous misinterpretations of it which have been attempted. As it has ardently the air of a paragraph to a familiar friend, the omission of an argumentative support of the opinion given will appear to no candid reader unnatural or improper.(2) We have no late information from Europe, except through the English papers, which represent the affairs of France as in the most ticklish state. The facts have every appearance of authenticity, and we wait  February 21, 1788  with great impatience for the packet which is daily expected. It can be little doubted that the patriots have been abandoned; whether from impotency in France, misconduct in them, or from what other cause is not altogether clear. The french apologists are visibly embarrassed by the dilemma of submitting to the appearance of either weakness or the want of faith. They seem generally to alledge that their engagements being with the Republic, the Nation could not oppose the regular Authority of the Country by supporting a single province, or perhaps a party in it only. The validity of this excuse will depend much on the real connection between France and the patriots, and the assurances given as an encouragement to the latter. From the British King's speech, it would seem that France had avowed her purpose of supporting her Dutch friends;(3) though it is possible, her menaces to England might be carried farther than her real promises to the patriots. All these circumstances however must have galled the pride of France, and I have little doubt that a war will prove it as soon as her condition will admit of it; perhaps she may be the sooner forced into it on account of her being in a contrary situation. I hear nothing yet from the Convention of N. Hampshire. I remain yours most: respectfully & Affectly. Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir New York Feby. 21. [17]88 The receipt of your favor of the 29th Ult.(1) which did not come to hand till a few days ago was rendered particularly agreeable to me by the prospect it gives of a thorough reestablishment of your health. I indulge the reflection and the hope that it denotes a remaining energy in the Constitution, which will long defend it against the gradual waste of time. Your representation of the politics of the State coincides with the information from every other quarter. Great fluctuations and divisions of opinion, naturally result in Virginia from the causes which you describe; but they are not the less ominous on that account. I have for some time been persuaded that the question on which the proposed Constitution must turn, is the simple one whether the Union shall or shall not be continued. There is in my opinion no middle ground to  February 21, 1788  be taken. The opposition with some has disunion assuredly for its object; and with all for its real tendency. Events have demonstrated that no coalition can ever take place in favor of a new Plan among the adversaries to the proposed one. The grounds of objection among the non-signing members of the Convention, are by no means the same. The disapproving members who were absent but who have since published their objections differ irreconcileably from each of them.(2) The writers against the Constitution are as little agreed with one another; and the principles which have been disclosed by the several minorities where the Constitution has not been unanimously adopted, are as heterogeneous as can be imagined. That of Massachusetts, as far as I can learn was averse to any Government that deserved the name, and it is certain looked no farther than to reject the Constitution in toto and return home in triumph. Out of the vast number which composed it there was scarce a man of respectability, and not a single one capable of leading the formidable band. The men of Abilities, of property, of character, with every judge, lawyer of eminence, and the Clergy of all Sects, were with scarc[e] an exception deserving notice, as unanimous in that State as the same description of characters are divided and opposed to one another in Virginia. This contrast does not arise from circumstances of local interest, but from causes which will in my opinion produce much regret hereafter in the Opponents in Virginia, if they should succeed in their opposition. N. Hampshire is now in Convention. It is expected that the result will be in favor of the Constitution. R. Island takes no notice of the matter. N. York is much divided. The weight of Abilities and of property is on the side of the Constitution. She must go with the Eastern States let the direction be what it may. By a vessel just from Charlestown we understand that opposition will be made there. Mr. Lowndis is the leader of it.(3) A British packet brings a picture ofaffairs in France which indicates some approaching events in that Kingdom which may almost amount to a revolution in the form of its Government. The authority is in itself suspicious; but it coincides with a variety of proofs that the spirit of liberty has made a progress which must lead to some remarkable conclusion of the scene. The Dutch patriots seem to have been the victims partly of their own folly, and partly of something amiss in their friends. The present state of that Confederacy is or ought to be a very emphatic lesson to the U. States. The want of Union and a capable Government is the source of all their calamities; and particularly of that dependence on foreign powers, which is as dishonorable to their Character as it is destructive of their tranquility. I remain Dr Sir Yours very Affely., Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sally(1) New York Feb. 23d. 1788 I am tired with writing, and dont know what I shall fill this letter with to you. As you are fond of dress I will try to give you some account of the fine girls in this City, tho' I take so little notice of them, that I can give you but a poor account. I am confined wholly to the company of gentlemen & the most I know of the ladies is what little I observed at Church last Sabbath & in the streets where they are continually taking their pleasures. At this time there is fine sleighing & the streets are filled with parties of pleasure. The ladies wear very large Calashes & silk cloaks bordered with ermine when they ride or walk abroad. At church, for I attended public worship at an Episcopal church last Sabbath, the old ladies wore hats much like those fashionable ones your way, and the young ladies wore yellow straw hats, with crowns bound round as yours. Their hair craped pretty large & I did not observe any thing very different in other respects from the dress you have been acquainted with. I hope that you will learn to consider dress as but of little moment, compared with the ornament of the mind. The most worthless may exceed you in finery, but the young lady who studies to furnish her mind with useful knowledge, to regulate her passions, to discover an affable & benevolent disposition, & upon all proper occasions to make an innocent & virtuous life appear, will be esteemed by the valuable part of the world. These qualities, which will be for your reputation as well as happiness, let me then particularly recommend to you. I do not wish you to be totally indifferent to fashions & the external ornaments of your person, but to allow these a subordinate place in your attention. So much by way of advise. I dont know but you & the female circle I have wrote to, will think, from the grave letters I have lately wrote, that I have experienced some extraordinary change at New York. To this I can assure you I am much the same. I can bechearful when I am in some company, but in general I have not yet found it exactly to my taste. I think I shall contract some intimate acquaintance before long, with whom I shall be able to enjoy myself more entirely. I went to the theatre once, which I have given some account of in one of my letters. This was merely out of curiosity; from the same motive I may perhaps go once to the assembly, but those kinds of amusement I shall indulge very seldom. I  February 23, 1788  have nothing new which I think worth writing to you. It is more from an inclination that the family should often hear from me, that I have heretofore so frequently sent my letters, than from any opinion of the worth of my communications. However I hope that all I have said will not be wholly lost. When, & to whom I shall write next, is uncertain. I shall expect at least to receive one letter before any more of mine will be sent, and that I shall have the satisfaction of hearing you are all well. I wish to know whether Polly has yet moved to house keeping, & any other little domestic occurrence that has happened. Tell your Aunt Wingate that I shall soon send her a blank letter, unless she by one to me shall furnish matter for my reply. I have not yet altered in my habit of body. And do not think that eating & drinking will make me fat. I play no cards, because the custom is universally to play for money, which I consider as an improper diversion. I have some leisure to read & to write which I have improved with satisfaction. I will add only my most sincere wishes for your happiness, the welfare of all the family, & the prosperity of all my friends, to whom I desire my cordial respects. My dear Child, adieu, P Wingate ""

To what cause this neglect has been owing is not for me to decide.

 Dear Sir New York 27th Feby 1788 I have nothing very interesting to add to my last.(1) A public audience to the Minister of France was given yesterday at his request. The address & answer you have in the papers enclosed.(2) The Minister is a man of about forty, his manner rather more lively than dignified, altho no decided opinion can be formed from a single interview, & that a public one. In the papers enclosed you have a copy of the Indian leases, which are operating so injuriously to Massachusetts; I am informed that the Legislature of N York have declared these leases, within the construction of the 37th article of their bill of rights, & of course null & void; Their own interest will induce N York to discourage these Jobbers, because the Lessees are practising as well for new york as Massachusetts Lands: However tis said these people design to go on, & occupy, until title can be determined in a federal Court. I fear they will give us much trouble. Upon the subject of Western Lands, Congress want the Western Line ascertained, vizt from 45 degree No Latitude thro the Westerly end of Lake Ontario, South upon Meridian Line, to Pensylva- February 27, 1788  nia line.(3) This if impartially run, so far from being objectionable will be for our benifit; provided a faithful person on our part be appointed to attend the business; But in almost all Land matters, Massachusetts seems to come off second best. I find it is in contemplation to assume the State debts, and fund State & federal at 3 per Cent. What think you of such a project? Would it be just? And how would it affect Massachusetts?

This was so unexpected, that we could scarcely realize it. I fear it will have a bad effect. The publick mind has been fluctuating, with regard to the system proposed---;at least in considerable districts of the community: The first impressions were favourable to the adoption of the plan: The next, occasioned by various pieces written against it, and the intemperate conduct of its zealous friends in Pennsylvania, &c. were much less favourable. The adoption of it in Massachusetts again turned the current of opinion much in its favour: The principal men in opposition in the State of Newyork, Maryland, &c. appeared to be agreed to acquiese in the adoption of it, in the form in which it has been adopted in Massachusetts; but I am quite unable to say, what effect this unexpected conduct in Newhampshire may have. Tho' my opinion, on fully examining all that has been said and written, respecting this plan, is not altered as to the amendable parts of it; yet I have been long satisfied we must, and ought to, put it into operation, and afterwards engraft the amendments into it, which time and experience shall direct. It is dangerous to remain long in our present situation, and the more so, in my opinion, on account of the storm evidently gathering in Europe. The present calm there is, I am fully persuaded, momentary, and that a war will take place among the European nations with which we are principally connected, at no very distant period. And I think we may clearly observe in their plans already, evident intentions to entangle us in their disputes. It will be impossible for us to remain neuter, and pursue our true interest, unless we shall have a national Government for effectually regulating our affairs, and controuling the conduct of our own citizens.\"" MS not found; reprinted from the Salem Mercury (Massachusetts). 1 This extract was printed in the March 25 issue of the Salem Mercury under the heading: \""An obliging correspondent has favoured us with the following extract of a letter from a Member of Congress to his friend in this county [Essex]---;dated March 1, 1788.\"" Of the Massachusetts delegates attending Congress at this time---;Nathan Dane, Samuel A.

 Dear Sir N. York. March 3d. 1788 The Convention of N. Hampshire has afforded a very disagreeable subject of communication. It has not rejected the Constitution; but it  March 3, 1788  has failed to adopt it. Contrary to all the calculations that had been made it appeared on the meeting of the members that a majority of 3 or four was adverse to the object before them, and that on a final question on the merits, the decision would be in the negative. In this critical state of things, the fOEderalists thought it best to attempt an adjournment, and having proselyted some of the members who were positively instructed agst. the Constitution, the attempt succeeded by a majority of 57 agst. 47, if my information as to the numbers be correct. It seems to be fully expected that some of the instructed members will prevail on their towns to unfetter them and that in the event N. Hampshire will [be] among the adopting States. The mischief elsewhere will in the mean time be of a serious nature. The second meeting is to be in June. This circumstance will probably be construed in Virga. as making cotemporary arrangements with her. It is explained to me however as having reference merely to the conveniency of the members whose attendance at their annual elections & Courts would not consist with an earlier period.

 Dear Sir New York March 6th 1788 I am honor'ed with your obliging favor of the 23d Ultimo which confirms the sad account,(1) received by the Saturday mail of our Conv- March 6, 1788  ention business. When we first received the very unexpected news every one was surprised and every friend chagrined---;much is to be apprehended from this unfortunate check to the tide of our p[o]litical prosperity---;as a Citizen of New-Hampshire I am greatly mortified and as a friend to my Country [&] mankind I dread the evils that may ensue. This unfortunate affair will at least give a temporary spring to the opposition and I fear its effects in other States; though I cannot doubt the final ratification in ours, if proper measures are adopted, to counteract the nefarious designs of the enemys to our Country; for such I shall, in future, consider all those incendiaries who are predetermined to disregard argument & reason and to sow the seeds of jealousy and discord among the people. In my first emotion on this occasion I conceived it of some importance to give a favourable turn to the popular opinion and (having heard from Boston of the instruction business)(2) published the enclosed, as being in my opinion a Statement of facts---;and which I am happy to find so correspondent to your letter. We have no foreign advices of a recent date---;but from the unsettled state of affairs in Europe, it seems to be the almost universal opinion that they will have but a short respite from the scourge of War, and should the curse fall on us in our present disjointed State the evils are inconceivable that would probably [en]sue. Our great and good friend Madison has just set off for Virginia where I hope his influence will be at least sufficient to counteract the ill effects of the backslidings of my native state. The most important business now before Congress is an application from Kentucky to be set off from Virginia and to be received into the union as a sovereign State---;in which Virginia agrees to concur on certain conditions: that she shall be released from a proportion of her federal obligations &c. &c. This is not a time for the determination of so important a Subject---;but it is sostrenuously urged and the people of that Country are become so jealous and irritable as to require the most delicate management---;how it will terminate is yet uncertain. Mr. Wingate desires his best regards to you. With sentiments of the most sincere respect and esteem, I am, Dear sir, Your Most Obedient & Most Humble servant, N. Gilman ""

 Dear Sir New york March 7th 1788 I received your favor by Mr. Bowers, his business was put in train(1) ---;one point was necessary to be clearly ascertained, Viz that the Corps was ever by any construction considered as Artillery---;a referrence to the War Office (for report) is the usual mode in such cases & was not deviated from in this. I went yesterday to that office to enquire what progress was made, and there was informed that Mr. Bowers had left town, that he requested General Knox would not make report until he should be able to procure some farther proofs or documents. After all I do not think he will or can succeed. I do not know a circumstance in their favor except that the Surgeon was adopted, but that was evidently occasioned by a blunder of Genl. Lincolns the then Secretary at War---;to which he was very subject. The fact is that there was only three men belonging to that Corps intitled to any notice, Irish, Wylie & Jordan(2)---;they were continued late in the War, all the rest were meer day laborers & went to such business as they thought proper at an early period. The Board of War at one time---;I can not now recollect the period, delegated the disposition of that Corps to me, & I dismissed them all except Wylie & Jordan. Irish was then in another department---;Commissary of Military Stores to the southward---;almost all the privates were discharged---;or furloughed, with Certificates of the number of months pay due them at the time. You have doubtless seen an extract from a Report of the board of treasury, a Copy of which was transmitted a few days since to Council(3)---;relative to the old dispute about the 70,000 Dollars. The Report has not yet been called up or acted on in Congress. I will if possible keep it out of sight, until, the sense of Council, or the Assembly if they should think proper to interfere is signified---;tho I am persuaded it will not be an easy matter to get Congress to disapprove the report. A case nearly similar of New york was reported on inthe same mode in that of Penna. Virginia have stopped payment until all their claims are allowed, in an account which was sittling by Joint Commissioners---;but you will not I hope understand that I wish any other State to follow the example---;in short if Penna. & New york should---;at this moment, there is no divining doubt but bad consequences must ensue. These hints you must not consider, as public or official, should be glad however to be furnished with arguments, against the report, if good ones as I suppose there can be urged.

 Dear Sir, New York March 15, 1788. It was my intentions to have done myself the honor to have called on you before I left Massachusetts---;but several circumstances prevented. I arrived here the 20th of last month. There has been a Congress most of the time for two months past and part of the time nine States assembled but we do but very little business. Indeed we have but very little to do. It does not appear to be the intentions of Congress to engage in any important business. An adjournment has been mentioned for a few months.(1) The reasons offered against it are such as were offered against an adjournment last year with which you are well acquainted. Many of the members are of opinion that the particular situation of our public affairs at this time requires that Congress should be in sessions and the forms of the Government kept up---;this idea naturally leads us to contemplate public affairs on a large Scale, and to observe the present State of the New Constitution---;when Mas- March 17, 1788  sachusetts adopted it in the manner She did---;both parties seemed rather to consider the question as settled---; that it must be adopted also by the other States, and amended afterwards. But the unexpected Conduct of New Hamshire and late intilligence from Virginia and North Carolina, appear to make the adoption of the Constitution much more doubtful---;and all parties here consider the great question far from being dicided---;the opponents in this State, in Virginia and North Carolina I find say they have a very considerable majority---;the Supporters of the Constitution are doubtful. I confess it is my opinion, notwithstanding, that all these States will adopt it---;recommending amendments---;perhaps, some in addition to those recommended by Massa. I need not mention to you how important it is to keep the minds of men Cool and temperate at this time, particularly by keeping up the forms of Government and the appearances of Tranquility. Matters seem to be in a state of quiet in Europe at present, but I do not think they will remain so long. We hear nothing from that quarter that respects us particularly---;except that our friends the Dutch are very pressing for their interest money, and I expect Congress will make a short statement to the States on this subject. The States must apply some small sums at least to the use of the Union or the Federal Government must be dissolved. I am at a loss to know how the board of Treasury have done so well as they have to pay the civil list, the Dutch interest and troops in a considerable part. I believe the Union has been Supported almost wholly for a year or two past on the payments of New York, the gleanings of new Emission money, and a little tobacco from North Carolina. We have as usual much said about an Indian war. I doubt whether there will be anything more than party disputes among the plundering individuals. Kentucky and Virginia have form[al]ly applied to Congress to acknowledge the Independance of the former and to admit it into theUnion. Nothing of importance has yet been done in Congress relative to the subject and, probably, there will not be at present. With the highest sentiments of esteem and respect I am dear sir, Your obdt servant, N. Dane ""

 Dear Breckinridge New York March 17th. [17]88 I had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 12th of Feby & am happy to find that you are still disposed to continue a Correspon- March 17, 1788  dence from which I promise myself much pleasure & information during my stay in this place; where from the remoteness of my situation & the difficoulty of Conveyance I am cut off from all communication with my Relations & even from any intilligence respecting them except through you. I expect that Brother James(1) has before this time bid adieu to Wm. & Mary & set out for Kentucky big with the prospect of making money & of receiving that reward which so many years spent in a painful course of study Justly merit. He has my warmest wishes for his favorable reception & Success in the world. I flatter myself that his Genius & acquired Knowledge will enable him to make his way good at least in that Country where as yet he will not meet with powerful opponents. I have at length presented the Kentucky address to Congress & from the apparent disposition of Congress at present relative to that Business I fear I shall meet with no small difficoulty in obtaining the Independence of that District.(2) The Objections are the want of power by the Articles of Confederation to admit a new State into the Union. That the admission of Kentucky is contrary to the Eastern Interest as it would throw another Vote into the Western or rather Southern Scale---;that therefore it would affect the adoption of the New Plan of Govt. in Eastern States. The reasonableness of the request of the District is admitted by all---;but the policy of the measure is disputed. I shall spare no pains or Arguments in my power to effect this measure which I have much at heart---;as I am fully convinced that the future tranquility & Glory of that Country very much depend upon the event. Knowing you to be much interested in the issue of this Business I shall from time to time give you a particular account of its progress. It now stands refered to a committee of the Whole. I am sorry that I have it not in my power to give you a favorable Account relative to the Success of the New Constitution. The Conventionof N. Hampshire adj'd. without adopting it 'till June next a majority of the members having been instructed to reject it; there is little doubt but that it will finally be adopted in that State, yet I fear the present failure will be productive of bad consequences as it will give fresh spirits & Confidence to the Malcontents who were begining to dispair & relax in their opposition. Although Penselva. has adopted it yet there is a very powerful party opposed who are growing very tumultuous---; having been exasperated by the intemperate zeal of the friends to the Plan. I really dread the Consequences of its rejection---;It has already damn'd the present Govt. in the estimation of the World, it cannot, it will not drag on much longer, & should the new be rejected God only knows what will be the event. From the present Situation & disposition of the States there is little foundation to hope that any new plan can be brought forward less exceptionable than that now proposed. I hope Virginia will not be so blind to her own Interest & that of the Union as   not to adopt it. The Necessity of the Case, with me precludes even the Idea of Hesitation.  I have not time at present to inclose you any letters for my Relations in Botetourt or Montgomery but shall unless a better Oppy offers trouble you in my next with a packet for that Country---;if you have any late intilligence from that quarter let me know it. I wish much to hear from J Smith---;also whether Mr. Howard & family move this Spring to Kentucky. Let me know the present State of your University---;pray write to me more frequently every thing which drops from your pen is interesting to me. I enjoy good Health & live contentedly enjoying high life in ease plenty & good Company. But still my friends [in Kentuc]ky engross the most of my thoughts. Adieu live contented & Happy, John Brown P.S. Let me know when James Set out & his Intentions. ""

 Dear Sir, New york 17th March 1788 The enclosed extracts from a solemn application made by the Delegates of Virginia(1) , by the Joint desire of the District of Kentuckey, and Virginia, will shew you that however improper this hasty, and I may say peremptory mode of application may be, and ill timed too, yet it involves so many consequences, whichever way Congress may decide, it brings them into a dilemma. Some Gentlemen are of opinion that no new State can be admitted under the present Confederation, others fear, that, if they should be rejected now, they will not come in when we wish them; instance Vermont. There is no doubt I think but they will be an independent state next Decr, whether Congress accede or not---;this circumstance alone is all that has any weight in my mind.

 Sir New York March 22d 1788 I am honored with your Excellencys favor of the 28th ultimo and beg leave to express my thanks for the particulars of the action at Exeter.(1) That the defence of the system was great as the ground was advantageous I have no doubt; but have still to regret (with much apprehension) that the victory was not more compleat. Your Excellencys expectations of success in the next engagement affords some consolation yet I am sorry the field assign'd for the scene of action is so much in favor of the adverse party. Those that have not been in the way of seeing and hearing can hardly imagine what pernicious effects our Convention business has March 22, 1788  produced in a number of States. New Hampshire had been counted on by friends & foes as being perfectly federal---;so that from the ratification of the new system in Massachusetts, the opposers began to make excuses and change sides in all Quarters but immediately on your adjournment they augmented their forces, took possession of their old ground and seem determined to maintain it at all hazards. The Governor of this State acts no longer under covert but is open and indefatigable in the opposition. In Pennsylvania, I am informed, affairs have a most unfavourable aspect. The Antis are forming associations, holding county Conventions &c. much in the stile of the Massachusetts rebellion. By all late accounts from Virginia the opposition is there increasing and there is reason to apprehend that North Carolina is too highly tinctured with the same spirit. Patrick Henry is entirely anti-federal and Grayson is warmly opposed to the present plan. The adoption of it is certainly doubtful in New York, Virginia, North Carolina & Rhode Island. This being the case I hope no pains will be wanting to secure a Majority in the next meeting of our Convention. I do assure, Sir, our present situation appears truly alarming and I am more and more confirmed in an opinion I have long entertained that the tranquility of our Country is suspended solely on the great question of the day. I think Mr. Wingate informed your Excellency(2) of the application of Kentucky to be set off as a seperate State and taken in to the union; which Virginia will accede to on condition of her being exonerated from a proportion of her federal obligations &c. The affair has been once debated in Congress in Committee of the whole and postpon'd, since which it has not been taken up. It is an application that cannot, in the present State of affairs be complied with---;but there is such a spirit of avulsion among the people of that Country they are so impatient and importunate as to make it a subject that requires at thiscritical juncture, the most prudent management. An other disagreeable affair between the United States and Virginia is now before Congress. The Conditions on which the Western lands were sceded by that State to the union were that Virginia should be allowed for the necessary and reasonable expences she had incurred in subduing the British posts, maintaining forts &c in that Country, the Accounts to be adjusted and liquidated by a majority of three Commissioners. The Commissioners have been setting all winter in Virginia---;two of whom thinking it unjust to allow Virginia her enormous claims and being about to report, The Legislature (then setting) interposed, stopt their proceedings and made an appeal to Congress, in language corresponding to their Idea of their own omnipotence. I think Congress will order the Commissioners to proceed & make report---;and whether Virginia will then assume the rights of Judge & jury---;withhold all monies & endeavor to reclaim the seeded territory, as she   threatens, time only will discover. They seem disposed to avail themselves of the Spirit of the times to obtain unreasonable demands. In this, however, I believe they will be disappointed and should they hasten a general occursion it is hardly supposable that they will escape the evils attending it. I shall soon be under the necessity of drawing for the small sum of money your Excellency was kind enough to mention in Mr. Wingates letter---;and hope provision will be made for paying so small a sum that I may not become liable to pay interest & Damages. I take the liberty to enclose for your Excellency's perusal, the remarks of Aristides (Alia Judge Harrison our old friend who was Secretary to General Washington) on the new plan of government(3)---; and as I cannot procure an other, shall be obliged if you will please to lend it to the Treasurer. Having drawn my letter to some length I will not trespass further than to add the perfect Respect with which I have the honor to be, your Excellencys Obedient and Very Humble Servant, N. Gilman ""

 My dear sir N. York 24 March 1788. Before the date of this letter I hope you are gotten safe to Orange, and found all things in a situation the most agreeable. We are still going forward in the same tract of Seven states, of course not a great deal can be done, and indeed not a great deal to do. A prospect of the new Constitution seems to deaden the activity of the human mind as to all other matters; and yet I greatly fear that constitution may never take place; a melancholy Judgment most certainly---;and would to heaven that nothing under the Sun shall be more erroneous! The adjournment of N. Hampshire, the small majority of Massachusets, a certainty of rejection in Rhode Island, the formidable opposition in the state of N. York, the convulsions and Committee meetings in Pennsylvania, and above all the antipathy of Virginia to the system, operating together, I am apprehensive will prevent the noble March 24, 1788  Portrait of Cyrus Griffin  fabrick from being enacted. The constitution is beautiful in Theory---;I wish the experiment to be made---;in my opinion it would be found a government of sufficient energy only.  Neither of the packets have yet arrived, and what has detained the french no one at this place can determine. Not a word from our Ministers abroad. Congress have taken final leave of the Chavalier by a very polite and friendly letter.(1) The Marchioness is recovering rapidly, and the Count in good health; I mention them because they entertain a very exalted [opinion] of you and talk much upon that subject. Daniel Shays and Eli Parsons have petitioned the Legislature of Massachusets for pardon---;and will succeed.(2) The frequent attacks upon the post-office has produced the enclosed performance.(3) The customary papers are sent to you within this cover.

 Dear Sir, New York Mar 29. 1788 Mr. Hodgdon who is now in this City informs me that he can frequently transmit letters to you from Philadelphia, and by him I improve this opportunity of writing to you. The distance of your situation from New Hampshire & the difficulty of an intercourse between us has prevented my giving and I suppose of receiving any direct intelligence from you for a long time. But this seperation has not obliterated my remembrance of or lessened my affection for you. It is with particular satisfaction that I sometimes hear of your welfare by our friends at Salem. This pleasure I had in the beginning of Feb. when your brother told me that he had received a letter from you dated the 1st of Janry at which time you was Setting out for your new settlement. Mr. Hodgdon tells me that you have since been down & returned again very lately & that the last intelligence was that your family were all well & that your situation was very agreeable. I rejoyce in every circumstance that contributes to your domestic happiness & extensive usefulness in life, but could wish that you had believed those two objects obtainable somewhere within the circle of your family connections & former friends. Your brother(1) was remarkably well when I was there in Feb. I think he appears to enjoy as good health & spirits as I have known him have for several years. All the other branches of the family were well. Your son came with me from Salem to Boston in a sleigh for the sake of a ride & to see the Bridges &c and returned again the same day with a lad who brot me on. Master Jno. is sensible & after some acquaintance is sufficiently sociable, tho' with strangers rather reserved. He has those qualities which I think will render him, with the advantages of education that he will enjoy, both amiable & useful & in whom a parent will have great satisfaction. Your other children I have not seen, but I dare say they afford you the pleasing hopes of a fond father. I have receivd aletter from my family dated Mar. 17 when they were all well. Polly is married, & I hope & believe to a worthy & agreeable husband. She will live about one mile from me. Sally is a woman grown. George & Jno are two good boys, & Betsey my youngest is about 5 years old who I suppose will finish our complement of children. My wife(2) enjoys uninterrupted health & changes with succession of years as little as almost any body. I shall write to her by the post to day & let her know that I have heard of you by Mr. Hodjdon which will make a letter very welcome to her on your account if not on mine. I have been in New York since Feb. 10 & find my situation as agreeable as I could expect considering that I am very domestic & habituated to an active life. I have nothing very important to March 29, 1788  communicate to you. The subject which engages the general attention at this time is the New Constitution. What will be the fate of it is yet uncertain, but those who are well wishers to their country & best know the situation we are in, are the most sensible of the necessity of its adoption, and great pains are taken to obtain the end. On the other hand there are powerful opposers to it, who avail themselves of some popular objections & they are too successful with the less knowing part of the country. In New Hampshire when the Convention met, there was a majority prejudiced against the plan. They were chiefly from the interior parte of the state & many of the delegates were instructed to vote against it. The most distinguished Characters were in favor of it & after debating it for sometime there were a few converts made, who did not think themselves at liberty to go against their instructions and therefore obtained an adjournment. There is I think a probabity that it will finally be adopted in New Hampshire, altho considerable danger that it will not. New York is very doubtful but it is not despaired of. Virginia & North Carolina are much in the same situation. Maryland & South Carolina are supposed to be fOEderal. Those two states will decide before the others & if they should agree to adopt there will be but one of the dubtful ones necessary to make up the nine. The important decision upon the subject cannot be known before the last of July, & at any rate I do not see that the new constitution can be got to go as early as Dec. next. Nothing but the hope of a new can I fear keep the old Constitution from dissolution long---;Sed nunquam de Re publica desperandum. The news papers are so filled with lyes that no dependance can be put on any account you receive in them respecting the Constitution. I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of hearing from you by letter, which direct to me in Congress at New York. If you have any letters which you wish at any time toforward to Salem or to any friends Eastward if you will put them under cover to me, I will take the care of them & send them without hazard or expence to the place of destination. If Congress should not adjourn which yet is uncertain, it is likely that I shall remain in this place until Oct. next.

 Dear Sir New York March 30th 1788 I This morning received your letter by Mr Colt and I never was more surprised.(1) Is it possible you should have applied so large a Sum of Money to your own use and have no part of it ready for us, what am I to think. By the Packet to Sail the next Thursday instead of a large remittance I must send Mr Church a Sketch of the Accounts. My letter in the most possitive terms not to sell our goods on Credit has been disregarded and a large sum is in out standing debts---;and much of it with those Who have no visible property, and every shilling that is collected made use of. It distresses me more than I can express that a Man in whom I placed all my confidence should treat me thus. For God Sake let me know imediately what you have done with the Money and fix on times as early as possible to return it. Tell me the periods at which I may depend on its being remitted to Col Hamilton and do not disappoint me. I am alarmed that your letter does not tell me in particular what your funds are from whence this great Sum is to come. Mr Church has long since been alarmed as is Col Hamilton. I dare not Shew him the Accounts or letter---;till I hear from you again.

 My dear Sally New York Mar. 30. 1788. I have just had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 19 instant, enclosed with several letters; As yours is short & spirited, & is the first production of the kind, which I have received from you, I shall immediately return you an answer, & desire you to assure Polly,(1) as well as Mr. Wiggin & the Doctor that I shall acknowledge their favors as soon as possible. I am very glad that you are sensible of your foible which is so obvious to every body else. And I am equally pleased at your sincerity & frankness in owning the truth. This is not the usual characteristic of young ladies. But since you have so candidly confessed your fondness for dress, I will gratify you in your enquiries, so far as my inattention to such trifflings will enable me. I am far from being an enemy to what may be called decency in dress, and I am willing to allow a young Miss to be more attentive to it than an old man. But there is such a thing as excess, against which it is wisdom for both old & young to guard. I hope as you shall by age have more experience & observation that your good sence will lead you to a commendable mediocrity between the extreems of under & over dress. There is another thing which deserves notice on this head & that is the place & company you have to appear in. If I should find some young gentleman in New York, who I should contract with as a husband for you & accordingly send for you here, I should then think it quite consistent to spend a thousand dollars in your equipment. Such is the difference between Stratham & this City that one hundred dollars there, would be more extravagant than the other sum here. There is a delegate from Connecticut who has his daughter with him in this City about 15 years old, whom he introduces in to the best Company & of consequence dresses in the richest manner. I dined with her once. She was dress'd in a white satten. She is not very handsome, & I believe had not been much used tothe most genteel company. But her father intends she shall be. In addition to my account of fashions which I wrote to you, I sent a supplement to your mother for Sally Gool if she is at Stratham. This it is likely you will see I don't know what to observe further, only that it is the fashion for young ladies when they are well dressed to be cheerful & very sociable. They never appear bashful tho' they can blush when there is occasion for it. As for the subject of conversation it is no matter how trifling, only let what you say be well expressed. The ladies I think universally crape their hair & are powdered some times. They wear abundance of trumpery over their bosoms, which reaches up to their chins. I have not been to the Assembly yet, where is the perfection of dress. If I should spend a dollar for that use I shall be able to give you a better account. In the mean time let me advise  March 31, 1788  you to cultivate the ornaments of the mind which will afford you the most substantial pleasure. I bid you a very affectionate adieu, P Wingate ""

 Sir New York April 2d. 1788 I have had the honor to receive from you four Letters with the enclosures. I have without delay either delivered or forwarded the letters according to your request. I have received no answer or return from any one excepting a verbal reply from Sir John Temple,(1) who said that he had entrusted all his affairs in New Hampshire to the care of a Mr. Winthrop. I tho't it probable from one of your letters that I might receive something for you & that has induced me to delay my answer  April 2, 1788  the longer. I thank you for the information which you gave me respecting the welfare of my family, and for the complement you are pleasd to pay to Mr. Gilman & me as delegates in Congress. If my Abilities were equal to my wishes & endeavors to be useful I should esteem myself happy. I am much obliged by the particular account you have given me the proceedings of the late convention altho' much disappointed with the issue. The New Hampshire adjournment has made an impression on the minds of the people this way unfavorable to the Constitution beyond what could have been expected. But I hope your expectations will not be disappointed with respect to its adoption at the adjournment. We have at present nothing material that is new. Congress very thin in its representation which is a hindrance to the business on hand. The Conventions that are yet to set will some of them be so late that we cannot have intelligence of their determinations before August; this will be so late that it is probable the necessary arrangements cannot be made so that the new Congress & form of government can take effect as early as December. The general opinion is that the New Constitution will be adopted, & that this under present circumstances is not only very desireable, but necessary to save us from the most perplexing difficulties, if not ruin. I hope that we shall understand our true interest & pursue it; be speedily extricated from all our embarissments, & have peace & happiness. In which wish I dare say that you heartily joyn with me.  I have the honor to be with sentiments of respect your most obedient & humble Servant, Paine Wingate [P.S.] Mr. Gilman desires his Compliments. ""

 My Dear Sir: New York, April 6, 1788. I received yours of the 18th ult. I shall readily pay every attention to the subject you mention in my power. Nothing particular has taken place since I wrote you last. We have had no late information of any considerable importance from the Indians. It is rather uncertain as yet how the elections for the State Convention have gone in Virginia, and no conjectures can well be formed how they will be in this State. I see by the papers that the British Ministry have demanded the abolition of the works at Cherbourg. This newspaper information is all I have heard or seen respecting the affair, but if such a demand has been made, I think it must be passed by in silence by the French Court, or that Court must refuse to comply with it. The probable consequence, in my mind, is war. I inclose you a letter from Major Sargent. With sentiments of esteem and friendship, I am, dear sir, your obed't servant, N. Dane.

 My Dear Sir(1) New York April 6th. 1788. I am exceedingly sorry to observe that your prospects of the succeeding Election(2) are not more flattering than they appear from your Letter of the 30th Ult. Your Opinion that my presence in the County is indispensably necessary places me in one of the most disagreeable situations that is possible. On the one hand, I could wish to comply with your wish, because I long to see my Family & from a conviction that I could be more useful to promote the good of the Country in taking an Active part in the Election and also from your Opinion which carries with it almost the force of a Law, on the other hand, Congress earnestly wish to retain a sufficient Number of States to transact the ordinary Business, and when you consider the peculiar situation of my Colleagues in the delegation you will perceive that I can be better spared than either of the others except Yates who is not wanted here at all. Mr. Benson cannot attend as well on Account of his private Business as the general Election, and Mr. LHommedieu and myself had some Conversation on the Subject when he returned from Poughkeepsie he assured me that he was very apprehensive of the Issue of the Election in Suffolk unless he could be at Home to concert Measures to procure a federal representation from there to the Convention and thought and indeed insisted hard that I should remain untill after the Election when he would releive me---;add to all this the constant fear of the Gent. in this place that Congress may on some day when the State is not represented revive the Motion for removing farther South. What must I do in this dilemma? will I not incur the just Censure of the State by breaking up the representation in the national Councils? do I not neglect the true Interest of the State by remaining here, when I could render the federal Cause perhaps essential service in our County? your Answers to these Questions will determine my Conduct irreversibly. The first Volume of Publius is published & the Numbersfor Albany will go by Peter Schuyler on Wednesday in the Care of Robt. McClallen Esqr. to whom I have caused them to be directed, will it not be well for the Committee to appoint a proper Person to issue them and receive pay for them in behalf of the Printer. The Debates of the Pensylvania Convention as well as the Commissions for your Regiment will go up by the next Stage, Mr. Scot has promised that they should be finished on Wednesday next. April 6, 1788  I have called three times at Mr. Gaines to deliver your Message respecting the Trees and could not see him, have yesterday left an extract of your Letter at his House, with direction where I could be found, to morrow I expect young Prince in Town and will furnish him with your request, if possible the Trees will go by Schuyler. Your Brother Phil is not yet come to Town. I wish to see him very much. Contrary to all expectation Westchester & Queens it is now thought will elect federal Characters to represent them in Convention, Kings is decidedly well disposed to a Man, and from Suffolk we hear that Floyd & LHommedieu are very active. The federal Cause gains ground fast to the Southward and from Rhode Island we learn that the federalists disatisfied with the Method adopted by their Legislature, instead of polling themselves in favor of the Constitution have remonstrated against the Method, hence all the Votes taken in the different Towns are for its rejection, and tho' it is conceded that a Majority of the Electors in that State are opposed to the plan, yet a very respectable Number composed of the Wealth & abilities in that State are warm Advocates for it. I thank you for the Trouble you have taken to prevail upon Mrs. Gansevoort to come down and am sorry You was not more successful. The Commissions for Thomas Barritt, Dirck Hilton, John Veeder & Jonathan Hilton as Cutters of Staves, Henry J. Bogert as Measurer of Boards, Timber &c. and Jellis Winne as repacker of Beef & Pork, I will send up per M. McClallen, good Use may be made of them as they were severally appointed by our recommendations---;it will be well to let Maus R Van Vranken know that in consequence of his application to me he was recommended and is now actually appointed a Justice of the Peace as I have seen by the Records of the Council. Jonathan Hilton I believe know nothing about it but I considered him as a friend to your Family and an honest & industrious Man & therefore added hisName---;have you taken care to apprize Dd. V Rensselaer, Jacob Fort Junr., Philip Conyne & Thos. Tobias that they are appointed Coroners through the same Channel, this should not be neglected, their Commissions will also go up with the rest---;it may give a Spur to Action. I think it would be well to suggest to Genl. Schuyler the propriety of writing official Letters to the newly appointed Justices, their Commission will go up soon Mr. Scot has promised me that he will attend to it. Mr. Gross will go up soon with an Address from the German Society he is warmly federal and I promise myself much good from his Excursion. I have endeavoured to promote a similar Measure by the St. Andrews Society in this place which consists of near 300 Members of all which Number there is but one Antiman, to wit, Genl. Malcom, our friend James Caldwell has seconded this application to Wm. Maxwell   the Vice president and the Society will meet to Morrow for the purpose, they cannot believe that the Scotch in Albany differ so widely from them in sentiment, many of the leading Members of that Body have promised to give their Attendance and promote this necessary Measure, they will at least write to the Scotch in the Upper Counties as well as in Albany. Coll North has assured me that he will go up this Week. I have impressed his Mind with the absolute Necessity of affording all the assistance in his Power. Palmer in Ballston has been written to by Dirck Lefferts per post, but fear his Letter will remain in the post office unless some step is taken to forward it, can't you procure some unsuspected Person to take it up & forward it to him. Hamilton says others have written Palmer on the same Subject. Yours very sincerely &c, Leonard Gansevoort ""

 Dear Sir,(1) New York April 12th. 1788. I received your favor of March 17th and was much gratifyed with your particular information respecting the Convention, and your relation of sundry other historical events. Your account was the most minute & authentic, which I had received at so early a date, concerning the debates & decisions of the Convention. Tho' I was disappointed & sorry for the event, yet was glad to have the true state of the facts. I suppose as the Delegates then viewed the matter, it was fortunate that the issue was no worse. But the ill impression on the minds of people by the adjournment is more extensive & mischievous than you would imagine. It is complained of as far as Virginia, & believed that if New Hampshire had adopted, there would not have been one dissenting state. Whereas there is now some danger that the whole plan will miscarry. I say some danger, for Virginia & New York are I suppose nearly divided, and that from selfish views, & their influence is considerable over other states. But upon the whole the probab[il]ity is in favor of its being adopted. You know my opinion of the necessity & importance of this, for the safety & welfare of the country under our present circumstances. I shall trouble you no more on this subject. Congress have had application made to them from Kentucky, to be made an independent state, This is a large Tract of Country on the westward part of Virginia. It is situated between the Allegany Mountains & the river Ohio, on the East of that river. These mountains lie in a chain from North to South & are impassable except in two places. It is six hundred miles from the center of this Country, to the seat of government in Virginia, And cannot be travelled in less than 21 days, & that with great peril in fording or rafting over the rivers, & climing over the rocks & mountains, where there is no road, & never can be inhabitted for the distance of 5 days journey. Notwithstanding those difficulties, sotempting is the soil that there are said to be not less than 60 thousand souls settled there already. There is a member in Congress from that Country,(2) a Clergymans son, who gave me this account. He says that the winters are so mild, that the cattle in the spring will be as fat as at any time, without the trouble of feeding them. That it is a very hea[l]thy climate. That there are a number of salt springs where the people can boil the water & make salt as we do out of sea water. It is only crossing over the river & there is the western country where the Ohio company & others are about to make their settlements. It is said that where the Ohio emptieth itself into the Mississippi so flat is the country & such floods come down in the spring season, that there is a space of forty miles distance laid under water. Which forms the appearance of a sea, out of which a forest of trees rises. The vast country north west of the Ohio was ceeded by Virginia to the united states upon condition that they should be reimbursed for their expences in defending of it during the late war. This Congress agreed to & commissioners were appointed by mutual consent to ascertain the sum. The commissioners have not yet reported, & cannot easily agree either two of them. One supposes that 60 Thousd. pounds LM would be enÃ´, another 150 Thousd pounds & the other would give them 220 Thousd pounds for their expences. This would be a dear purchase of that Country to the united states. I intended to have given you some account of the City of New York in this letter, but have dwelt so long on the New Constitution, & the western country, that I find I shall not have room. Boston is not more than two thirds as large as this City in buildings & numbers, and I suppose are much the same in proportion of commerse & wea[l]th. The continual increase is very great, & I think its situation is very favorable to its being the center of business & wealth in the union. As for news I will enclose a paper to giveyou that. We have nothing remarkable in Congress. I shall be glad to hear from you when it is convenient. I cannot take much pains in writing, having considerable of it to do. If you can read  April 13, 1788  it & find any amusement there from my end is answered, especially if you will consider it as a token of that esteem and friendship with which I am yours &c, Paine Wingate P.S. If I should not write by this post to my family please let them know that I am well & desire my affectionate regard to all friends. ""

 Dear Sir New York 13th April 1788 Altho I can only enclose you a barren paper I cannot suffer the post to go without directing to you. The No of Gentlemen present has hardly been sufficient since your absence to affect the smallest business; of course am unable to give friend Gerrey such an answer upon the extension of posts as he wishes, but in answer to his, have written him upon the Subject.(1) I think Hazzard is in a bad box. The fOEderalists frown upon him for being anti. The opposers of fOEderalism charge him hard with stoping the papers, & \""muzzling the process\"" to facilitate the purposes of despotism.(2) I hope they will not oust him, but a little shaking will put him right. The officers of Congress will receive no injury by shaking. The parties are hard at it here, and in Virginia. Tis said Clinton will be candidate for the City, & will carry it for Ulster County. Mrs P enquires frequently after you, and Mr D is so studious he seldom times his muscles to a smile, We miss you at meal times, which if ever is a season for hilarity. My Compliments to all friends Mr Hill, Nason &c, being fellow Laborers, particularly, from, Your friend & H. Sert, Sam A Otis Sunday Evening. Not expecting amongst so many acts of friendship from Dear Chumm, a letter from Boston, altho I expected one dated from Biddeford soon after you got home, I cannot seal, without thanking you for yours of 6th. I am particul[ar]ly obliged for your attention to my dear family and as I always telled you, you are better than your principles, so I have no reason to suppose you telled Mrs O any stories abot me, to my prejudice---;For am sure if you had, I should have heard of them. Whether the Ladies are fond of a fatt man have not particularly enquired, but as you coupled \""fatt & handsome,\"" they may April 13, 1788  pass very well; for one is true to my sorrow, & the other, if it is one, tis a white one, And a casuistical friend says, those which injure nobody are not charged. Your Ghost haunted me in your absence But having advanced the five dollars & got Ludlows rect, I conclude he is laid. I am surprized at the Governors petulence, precision, or whatever you please to denominate it. We had written him several Letters, and one I think, at the same time or very near it. We are by Constitution the officers not of the Governor, but of the Legislature, & viewing the thing strictly not accountable to him; However I have no objection to directing to him, but as I know Letters have been frequently directed as ours was to the Legislature, It lay in my mind as a thing of course, in recess, to write the Supreme Ex[ecu]tive, in sessions to the Legislature. I had no design to offend. You remember we proposed to the Legislature to get a copy of the plan, & they resolved accordingly, but the Govr would not sign it; alledging as a reason \""that we had directed our Letter to the Legislature, not to him?\"" Great men have more resentments & mortifications than little ones, or feel them more in prosperity. I am sure I should not have resented so trivial a deviation from etiquette if indeed it was a deviation. But refering him to John Rogers advice to his chilldren, which may apply to political, as well as natural death, I leave him with contemplations upon mortality, for young chilldren to[o] may die And so may he & I When I told brother D \""you loved him\"" he smiled, but when I hinted some new objections, against the New System, he was quite risible; Decended from the hights of philosophy & speculation, and was for half an hour, meer mortal. I confess I think what old Corran said of you was true \""a man of pretty parts,\"" But any other Irishman would say, by my Showl, & by St Patrick, which is more, if you can find an additional objection, you are a Genius indeed!

April 14, 1788  Congress have never been in session since your departure, and there are only six States who will attend: NY have indeed a representation in Town but one of the members is so engaged in private business he cannot attend. You did not mention a word about approaching election. There are several News papers arived in your absence which I shall preserve until we meet that you may complete your folios. Our family are to pack up in a week or two when the annual uproar begins. We have got a very excellent house in Q Street and in a Street much more clean & healthy. I suppose you intend returning to your old quarters again for altho it is at a distance Mother calculates for you. The old influence is exerting to get to Philada but presume it will hardly obtain. Mr Prices has got Madam there and I suspect she is averse from any farther advances East. But it must be done. I have no violent attachment for this place but at any rate tis more healthy than Pensilvania. Adieu my dear Sir & believe me very sincerely yours, Sam A Otis ""

 My dear Sir N. York. April 14th. [1788] At present I discover no probability that Congress will adjourn to Philadel---;the southren states not being fully represented---;and as my family, when seperate from me are very expensive, money difficult to be gotten, and their situation in a boarding house not the most agreeable, I think they had better conclude and come to this place, to set out about the last day of April in order to reach N.

The horses will remain in Bristol, fed upon grain &c untill about the 28th but I wished to know if any Gentleman was coming this way and would take charge of the family some distance upon the road. I fear Mr. Obrien cannot wait so long---; and  April 14, 1788  whether decent postilions could be hired for the Journey.

 Sir, Philadelphia 14th. April 1788 After my Return from New York in May last, I presented an Account to the Comptroller General in order to obtain a Warrant from Council for a few Weeks Pay as a Member in Congress. Considering it as a Business of course I neglected farther Application for some Time, but was at length told that Doubts had arisen in Council whether I was intitled to the Pay stated in the Account or not. These Doubts seem to have arisen on one or other of the two following suppositions. 1st. That the Assembly, by the Election of Genl. Armstrong, intended to supercede my Appointment, or 2dly. That the Time limited by the Constitution for my Continuance, was expired before I gave the Attendance for which I have claimed Pay. As to the first, I am far from questioning the Right of the Assembly to supercede any one of their Delegates whenever they think proper: But having never received any Intimations of their Disapprobation of my Conduct as a Delegate, I cannot suppose they intended to brand me with so unusual a Mark of Displeasure. As to the second---;The fOEderal Constitution limits the Service of Members to three Years. It was for some Time doubted whether the three Years should be computed from the Time of their respective Appointments, or the Time of taking their Seats in Congress; but the Words being that \""no Person shall be capable of being a Delegate for more than three Years in any Term of six Years,\"" the former Construction has prevailed. The Words of Limitation in the Constitution of Pennsylvania are \""No Man shall sit in Congress longer than two Years successively.\"" Hence it has been generally understood that the two Years, so far as this Limitation applies, commence at the Time a Delegate takes his Seat in Congress, and this Construction has prevailed in Practice.(1) Those who best know me will do me the Justice to believe that altho' I was duly sensible of the Honor conferred upon me by the Appointment, I was far from soliciting it, and that I should have beenequally far from obtruding my Services in this last Period of Attendance if I could have supposed they would have been either deemed unacceptable or founded on doubtful Authority. I therefore take the Liberty of stating to Your Excellency and the honble. the  April 14, 1788  Supreme Executive Council my View of the Subject at the Time of the Transaction. In April 1785 The Legislature did me the Honor to elect me a Delegate. Being a Member of the House at the Time, I had some Doubts, in point of Delicacy of accepting the Appointment, and had actually refused at a former Session to permit my Name to remain in the List of Nominations; but it was again urged so warmly that I did not absolutely refuse, neither did I announce an Acceptance till some Time after the Session ended. In May I received the Credentials of my Appoinmtment, and on the 27th of that Month I presented them and took a Seat in Congress. In the November Session following I was again appointed for the ensuing Year. In November 1786 I received a third Appointment. As the Constitutional Limitation would admit but a few Months Continuance under this Appointment, it was to me both unexpected & undesired; but being at New York at the Time, and considering it as an honorable Testimony of Approbation which demanded my Gratitude, I accepted and continued to act under it till the Arrival of a sufficient Number of my honorable Colleagues enabled me to retire for some Time without leaving the States unrepresented. This had so seldom happened before, that I felt the strong Occasion to avail myself of the Relief, and remained absent from Congress till the beginning of April 1787, during which Time so many States were unrepresented that little Progress was made in Business. Considering that the Time limited by the Constitution for my Continuance in the Delegation would expire on the 26th of May, I began to decline the Thought of returning to that Duty; but there were then but two Delegates from this State at New York, one of whom was by his Station precluded from the ordinary Duties of a Member,(2) and the other having signified to me his Desire to be relieved by a particular Day at which he must withdraw himself for a Time: recollecting moreover that some Matters of Business were likely to be resumed in Congresswhich my honorable Colleagues had had less Opportunity of investigating than myself, I thought it my Duty to give my Attendance tho' it should be but for a few Weeks. On the Day of my Arrival in Congress, General Irvine, who had been impatiently waiting for a Relief, departed. I had heard that General Armstrong was elected & supposed that the Intention was to guard against a Vacancy when my Time should be expired, but had no Reason to suppose it was designed to affect my Continuance during that Time, nor did I receive any Notification of such Election otherwise than from common Report, neither did I know till sometime after I went to Congress that the Gentleman elected had determined to accept the Appointment. On his Arrival at New York sometime afterwards, I obtained a Sight of his Credentials and consulted with him & the President of Congress on the Occasion, intending to retire immediately if I should discern the least Intimation that such had been the Design of the Legislature;   but nothing of the Kind appearing, I continued my Attendance in Congress till about the 18th or 20th of May when I withdrew, supposing my Time of Service to be within a few Days of expiring by the Limitation. I have taken the Liberty to ask the Attention of Your Excellency and the honble. Council to these Particulars not so much with a View to the Sum I have claimed, however desirable it may be to me, as in order to remove the Appearance of Censure which a Refusal of it would seem to imply, and which I am not conscious of having deserved.(3) I have the honor to be, with gre[a]t Respect, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant, Cha.

 New York Apl. 17th. 1788. I am now, my dear St George, at liberty to write to you on a Subject which for some time past has given me much Disturbance & Perplexity of Mind. For Heaven's sake, what do you make of the Letters of our dear Nl.(1) In September last I received a long one from him containing such Matter as fill'd me with Astonishment & Anxiety. Agitated betwixt Wonder & Uneasiness I scann'd it as well as my Understanding wou'd enable me & found a perfect Connexion of Ideas throughout the whole, which gave me some Relief. But as he had been uncertain whether his Letter wou'd find me alive or not, he avoided entering into Explanations & left me totally in the Dark with respect to the Sources of his extraordinary Information. He concluded with desiring Me to think of what he had written but to communicate it to no one. Thus was I deprived of the Liberty of making any Inquiry either of your self or any of the rest of our Friends, for I knew not whether he had mention'd it to any. I attended to every Expression contain'd in my Letters from Bermuda, to endeavour to find out whether or not they were under the same Uneasiness, but nothing occurr'd that afforded me any Light on the Subject. In this State of anxious Uncertainty, I wrote to him in the most pressing Terms to releive me from my Suspence by writing to me immediately the fullest Explanation he  April 17, 1788  Portrait of Thomas Tudor Tucker  felt himself at liberty to give of these wonderful Discoveries, with the Source from whence they were derived. But I cou'd not venture to express a Doubt of the reality of every thing he asserted. In all my sober Moments I acknowledge the Superintendance of a Divine Power, & suppose that he acts by general Laws contrived to effect the Happiness of all sentient Beings. How far these general Laws may in the Moral as in the physical World produce PhOEnomena that to our Understandings seem irregular & not resulting from the general principle, & therefore often term'd miraculous, I am not qualified to determine. A general propensity to Religion in Mankind, I have consider'd as Evidence of the Deity's Existence. The Tenets of all the different Sects appear to me to abound with Absurdities, as far as I have Knowledge of them. Not because I cannot explain every thing, but because many things seem to be contradictory to that Reason which has been given by God for our Guide. He cou'd not give us Reason & then take pains (if I may so express myself) to confound it's Operation.  June 13th. I know not how I have been prevented from continuing the Subject. I was going to add many other Observations, but shall rather proceed to Facts. I reced a very long Letter from N. in Answer, with a full Account of what had happen'd to him, & accompanied with several of Swedenborg's Books which I have not been able yet to read with Attention. I find he has sent them also to you & to our Friends in Bermuda. Our dear Sister B. sent them also to me by Mr. D. Tucker, without many remarks upon them, but N. says she reads them with Intelligence & Conviction. He is impatient to hear from you, & is also so earnest with me that I am perfectly at a loss how to write to him. Pray, help me out, if you can. Perhaps you have read those Books, & can form a better Judgment of them than I can. I shou'd be glad to have your Sentiments as fully as possible upon this very extraordinary Change. I mustconfess I was for some time even afraid to enquire about him, but am now happy to find that he goes on with his Business, & with rather better Prospects than formerly. Heaven bless you, my dear St. George. Yrs. most truly & sincerely, Thos. Tud. Tucker ""

I was indeed hopeful that to the great Affliction of being deprived of the most valuable of Friends(1) you had not the additional Misfortune to feel yourself straighten'd in your pecuniary Circumstances. How much I partake of all your Griefs, & how happy I shou'd be to see them removed is truly beyond my powers of Utterance. I thought you at least possest of a Sufficiency to keep you free from anxious Anticipations of possible Sufferings to your self or dear Children. But it seems as if our Family were doom'd to a continual Struggle for the means of Existence. I before knew of your Appointment,(2) & was told by Mr. Madison that the Salary was 500Â£ per Annum, which, with a supposed independent Income, I flatter'd myself wou'd at least keep you free from Uneasiness. I still hope, my dear St. George, that your Difficulties will not be so great as you apprehend, & that from time to time something unforeseen will turn up to your Advantage. My own Circumstances are extreamly doubtful, insomuch that I scarcely dare to indulge serious Reflexion upon them, or to look forward to what may probably happen. But I believe the best way is not to be over minute in calculating future Chances, but to content ourselves with such Exercise of Foresight only as is necessary to enable us to manage our Affairs with prudence. When I go farther than this my Heart is apt to sink under the Heaviness of Despair. Let us endeavour to be comforted by the Consideration of our good Intentions, & leave the rest to Heaven. Whilst we live we shall at least have the Happiness to love each other, & when we die we shall certainly not make a Change for the worse. Those who are dependent on us can scarcely be supposed to be liable to more severe Sufferings than ourselves have experienced. I am indeed not philosopher enough to think of this without a Pang. But we must try to avoid giving ourselves up to an incessant Torture not merely fruitlessbut destructive of the Interests of those we love. May the Almighty give Comfort to your Heart, & make the Way smooth before you to the End of your Days! I rejoice that my dear Fanny has got better. Give my tender Love to her & the rest of your beloved Children.

 Sir New York April 19th 1788 Since I had the honor to write your Excellency, of the 21st March,(1) the Commotion in Pennsylvania seems to have subsided. The accounts from Virginia since their election of delegates for the State Convention are rather favorable, as both parties write that there is a small majority east of the mountains in favor of the new System and that the question will depend in a great measure on the delegates from Kentuckey. The Antifederalists are endeavoring to excite jealousy in that quarter by giving it out that the first business of the new Congress will be to Ceede the Navigation of the Mississippi to Spain. If they should not succeed in this mischief it is probable the question will obtain in their Convention. I beg leave to relate, for your Excellencys amusement, a little affair which for several days interrupted the tranquility of this City: in which, however, there is nothing miraculous, though occasioned by raising the dead from their graves. It seems the young Surgeons had made a practice for several months past of diging up the dead for the purpose of anatomical dissection. The people in time became uneasy and applied to the Mayor for redress, but being unable to obtain relief or put a stop to the practice in that way, on Sunday last they surrounded the Hospital in a body and took several young men in the act of dissection; but gave them up to be confin'd without much abuse. The next day the mob assemble, ransack'd the houses of all most all the physicians in town & destroyed their valuable Anatomical preparations to a great amount. The Governor endeavored to prevent them, but to no effect. He at length order out the Militia---;but the number that turned out was so contemptable as to be disarmed and kick'd off the field. This so enraged the mob that they determined to force the Jail and cut off the young doctors hands. They accordingly made the attack---;broke down the yard---;all the lower windows of the prison and made an entry on the lower floor. A second attemptwas made to turn out the Militia and about forty were collected with Arms, who,  April 19, 1788  with a number of gentlemen, march'd up to the Jail amidst a shower of paving stones and brick bats. Mr. Jay was very badly wounded in the forehead but will probably recover---;The Governor, Baron Steuben and many others more slightly---;the Poor old Baron has got two black Eyes without the least consolation, as he execrates his own conduct for being in the action. They however recovered the Jail in time to save the lives of the prisoners but were finally obliged to fire upon the mob---;three of whom were killed and several wounded which put an end to the affray.(2) Let me beg your Excellencys acceptance of the Address herewith enclosed,(3) which I think contains some observation of general concern worthy of notice. I have the Honor to be, with the most perfect Respect, your Excellencys most obedient & very Humble servant, Ns. Gilman P.S. I am just now honored with your Excellencys obliging favor of the 4th instant with its enclosures, and beg leave to observe that as Colo.

 Dear Sir New York April 19. 1788 I am sorry I have not been able sooner to answer your letter of the 19 of last month. I happened to be in Philadelphia when it reached New York. It was transmitted to me and when I received it I was in hopes I should have finished my business & returned in a few days. Therefore I immediately sent back the letter which was enclosed therein to be forwarded by the packet and deferred writing to you until I returned. My stay was longer than I expected, and after my return here I recd. your second letter of the 12 of this Month and at the  April 19, 1788  same time an Account of your election. I hope, notwithstanding the choice made by the counties of A[nne Arundel], Baltimore and Harford, that the elections of [Maryland?] are such as will ensure the adoption of the new Constitution; for unless that takes place I confess to you my fears for the safety, tranquility and happiness of my country are greater than at any period of the late war. The present federal government is at the point of expiring. It cannot I think survive the present year and if it could experience must have convinced every man of reflection that it is altogether inadequate to the end designed. What remedy then have we prepared for the train of disastrous events which must necessarily ensue from a dissolution of the Union or what security for our independence, peace & happiness as a nation? You ask me what is the amount of the foreign & domestic debt? With regard to the foreign debt I beg leave to refer you to the enclosed schedule of the french & dutch loans shewing the periods of their redemption, the annual interest payable thereon & the instalments stipulated for discharging the principal.(1) To this you must add about 150,000 dollars due to Spain & 186,427 dollars due to foreign Officers, also a Million of florins which from the failure of the states Congress were under the necessity of borrowing last year to defray the interest of the dutch loans & other demands in Europe. As to the domestic debt I have to inform you that by the last estimate which the board of treasury laid before Congress, the amount thereof as far as then liquidated is 28,340,018 dollars. How much of this has been actually extinguished by the sale of western territory, I cannot certainly say. The tract which the Ohio company have in view to purchase is supposed to be between 5 & 6 Millions of Acres, but I believe they have only paid 500,000 dollars. The residue of the purchase Money is to be paid by yearly instalments and the Company by their agreement are at liberty toconfine their purchase within the compass of their abilities & to take no more land than they are able to pay for. The tract which Symmes has agreed for is said to be 2 Million acres & Flint, Parker & Co. have [app]lied for the purchase of 3 Millions Acres; but I believe neither [. . .] have yet paid any money. The quantity of land surveyed & laid out into townships agreeably to the Land Ordinance is upwards of 700,000 Acres but of this there is only about 100,000 sold. As to the land unsurveyed the quantity is immense and in my opinion fully adequate to the extinguishment of the whole debt of the Union, provided we can have a firm, stable federal government; but without this I am apprehensive the Union will derive little benefit from it. As to the amount of the duties on a 5 per cent impost & the expence of the civil list under the new government it is altogether conjectural, but of this I am confident that the new government if established will from prudential motives encrease the former and lessen the latter as much as possible and however proper it may have been judged to vest it with   the power of direct taxation, it will not proceed to the exercise of that power except in the last necessity. Enclosed I send you the first volume of the fOEderalist. The second volume is in the press & will, it is expected be out in the course of a week or two. As soon as it is published I will forward it to you.  With sincere esteem & regard I am, Dr. Sr, Your obedt humble Servt, Cha Thomson ""

 Sir New York 20th April 1788 Your favour of the 7th of Feby, with the enclosure from Mr Fanning, was duly received.(1) In the letter to Mr Fanning, which I do myself the honour to enclose,(2) I have given him all the information he will need for the security of his surveys. It must undoubtedly have occurred to you, Sir, that the present unexplained state of our southern and western boundary must have rendered it improper for the state of Georgia to do any thing respecting the private right of soil to the lands on the Missisippi. Many applications have been made, but the general assembly has never done any thing, but what appear[ed] necessary to prevent the present settlers in that country, from becoming our enemies from the apprehension that we might deprive them of their possessions. My expectation is, that the state of Georgia will soon(3) make a cession of their western territory to congress. They have long only waited an issue of our present great national question, whither they might expect protection in return. It did not appear necessary to state either of these reasons to Mr Fanning, as the measures to be pursued by them, for securing his ancient surveys of land in that territory, will probably be much the same, whether his titles are to be obtained from the state of Georgia, or from the united States.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York Apr, 20, 1788 Here we remain in an idle situation we had no Congress since you left this place---;six States and as may half States attend---;the business of the union must be neglected, because one or two gentlemen, who are in the City, must attend to their private business. We have now collected the accounts of the elections for the Virginia Convention---;it is impossible to say, with certainty, whether the Constitution in that State will be adopted or not---;however, I think appearances are rather in favor of its being adopted. With sentiments of sincere esteem & friendship, I am Dear Sir your Obedt Servant, N. Dane MS not found; reprinted from Historical Magazine, 2d ser. 6 (December 1869): 347. 1 The volume of Historical Magazine from which this letter is reprinted contains four Massachusetts delegate letters to Thatcher, but none from Thatcher while he was attending Congress. However, it does include the following letter from Thatcher to Pierse Long, dated \""Biddeford 23 April 1788,\"" which contains his observations on a number of issues that came before Congress during his prior attendance. \""You enquire about the fate and settlement of the Western Country. To be particular upon this Question would involve answers to so many others which would fall insidentally in the way as would be tedious for a Letter, and therefore for the present, I shall only observe generally---;That the Companies of Cutler and Sergent, Flint and Parker, Symms and more than eight or nine million of acres---;to be paid for in Continental Securities at certain periods by Installments upon which payments deads [sic] are to be executed to the purchases, but if not paid for no Title is to be given, and I believe I am justified in saying that all the payments by the three Companies do not exceed half a million of Dollars---;and I am not certain that it does 270,000 Dollars. For my part I must acknowledge, my faith of paying the Domestic Debt, by regular sails of the western Land, neverwas very great. There is Land eno' and that which is excellent. A few days before I left New York, I was in company with the Geographer General of the United States and he said, from a calculation he had made, he would warrant there was more than two hundred million of acres of good Land on the North-west of the Ohio. But to me the Idea of runing this out, and by the neat proceeds of its sails discharging any considerable part of the Debt is almost as chimerical as to count upon the number of Cod-fish, and Whales in the ocean for that purpose. Not a great many purchasers have offered themselves, and few that have could give evidence of their ability, and of those that could, still a small number have, and probably ever will, freely comply with their contracts. Continental Securities have been for several years very low, perhaps lower than they ever will be hereafter should the proposed Constitution, or any other with energy enough to discharge the Interest he adopted. Hence if purchasers have found it difficult to discharge their Contracts while public Securities have been sold from 6/ to 3/ on the pound, what probability is there of their being enabled after the adoption of a Constitution that shall secure their Redemption, and make them equal to Silver and Gold. April 20, 1788  \""As to the negotiation of public Treaties, it appears to me the existing articles of Confederation have exhibited to all Europe too evident marks of incompetency for any national purposes to induce foreign Powers to trust to Treaties made under them. The Queen of Portugal has shewn a disposition for negotiations of Friendship and Commerce. But here difficulties arise on the part of America, And perhaps if I were to say that Congress cannot command Cash or credit sufficient to support a negotiator at the Court of Lisbon, to promote and improve any overtures of this kind, I should not be far from the truth. Money is universally acknowledged to be the Sinews of war, and I think it cannot be doubted, to be equally necessary to the support of Civil Government, and the formation of foreign Treaties. \""The Importance of the Navigation of the Masseseppee is a matter I am not sufficiently informed to say much about. . . . But from the general state of that Country there can be but little doubt, that if the navigation of the Messeseppee should be beneficial to the American Settlements, they will enjoy it. The Idea of Spain's interrupting it is almost inadmissible---;within 20 Years and upon the Settlement of a good Government the Danger will be on the side of Spains Losing her possessions on the Western Waters, rather than the Americans loosing the Navigation.\"" Ibid., pp. 347--;48.

Williamson that he & Mr. Swan, mean to attend, here, on the part of our state.(3) But people in general seem in a measure to despair of effecting any thing with a sick & worn out political constitution. Scarcely has there been a competent number of States, the whole winter. Even the delegation for New-york has neglected attendance, while, in the mean time, business, both of a private, & public nature, is waiting disappointed. That two gentlemen, & not one singly, are coming from the state of North-Carolina relieves me from an embarrassment I should other wise feel at being under the necessity of leaving this for a time. Tho' my wish, & design is to return as soon as I can arange the necessary means of support.  The difficulty of procuring gold, as well as the very advanced rate of it, had induced me to trust to my salary, as superintendant of southern indians. But in the present state of their treasury no services to the united states can be rewarded. This apology, therefore, I have to make for quitting, tho' reluctantly, & but for a time, an appointment to which my country had done me the honor to name me. Shortly I shall be enabled to return to it. I presume you are acquainted of the cession of teritory made by Georgia. But it is conditional---;when 9 states accede to the new gov- April 21, 1788  ernment. The boundary line is to be drawn, from the head of Chatahouchi river, north. This claim may one day or other involve the united states in difficulties with the Spaniards, who hold it to be no part of the united states. However, it is very easy to see the government of the catholic King is relaxing in its policy in this respect. They begin to be convinced these states, especially the western country, are rather to be restrained by benevolence than violence. On almost the only occasion where nine states have assembled in this Congress, a petition from the people of Kentuckey, with approbation of Virginia, for admitting the former into the union has been debated. The eastern states seem much at a loss to decide. They are jealous of any additional influence in the southward. But if their partial views are indulged they disgust the tramontane people; whom, if not affection, fear, or interest will not long hold dependent on the Atlantic states. It is whispered that, whenever there are states sufficient to take up such business, Monr. le comte de Moustier means to present a memorial to them on the subject of the french debt. But I cannot think he will make such a representation, as in the present condition of these states can only serve to disgust. Tho', indeed, this minister is remarked not to be so courtly in his attentions to congress as his predecessor the chevallier de la Luzerne. The french consul, Monr. de la Forest, frequently reminds me of a debt which he is instructed to demand & which he says is due to the marine of France from our state. He says he hopes we shall no longer delay to pay attention to it. Upon my assuring him our legislature had taken up the business in such a manner as was thought a sufficient provision; he answered me, the proceeds were quite inadequate.(4) I am sorry to inform you that in a late furious commotion of this populace, five of them were mortally wounded. The minister of foreign affs., & others, much bruised. The clamor was raised inconsequence of indiscreet dissections of some surgeons. I have the honor to remain, your Excellency's obedt. servant, James White ""

 My dear Sir, New York Apl. 23. 1788 I have the pleasure to forward herewith two packets which came by the last French Packet. The business of the constitution as referred to the Town meetings of Rhode Island, is over without producing any effect. Three of the Towns were decidedly for calling on the Legislature to appoint a convention according to the mode prescribed, and this it seems from freindly views to the measure. The remaining Towns have done nothing decisive of their sentiments---;a few of them have apparently voted against it, but it is said & I beleive with Truth, that the reason votes do not appear in favor, is that the Freinds objected so directly against the mode of proceeding, that they would not act at all. In some others there are votes both for & against & at the same time propositions for insisting on the Legislatures calling a Convention. Upon the whole it is a pretty decided matter that Rhode Island will not be amongst the adopting States by June. We have no Congress but it is expected we shall have one in a few days---;this a triffling business which I long to see an end of. I am Yrs. afftlly., Ed. Carrington ""

 Sir New York April 23d. 1788 I am honoured with your favor of the third Instant, and am happy to find that your sentiments respecting the Independency of Kentucky, as a State distinct from Virginia, coincide with those I had advanced in a committee of Congress. There is one Idea which your Excellency suggests, sufficient I think to evince that the present confederation does not provide for the erecting new states out of those already in the Union, namely, \""because nine states are competent to determine any question before Congress,\"" and upon this supposition, a minority of the states in the union might be so circumstanced as to decide upon the most important matters. This business of Kentucky has not been before Congress but once yet, and I believe there will be some very decent excuse found, for deferring the determination at present, without exciting the resentment of Kentucky. That country is encreasing surprizingly. An Officer, who has lately  April 23, 1788  come from fort Pitt, says that on the road within the distance of 150 miles, he met seven thousand people moving thither, and that Indian Corn was so plenty there, that it might be bought for nine pence per bushel. Captain Hutchins, the Geographer of the united states, gives the most flattering accounts of the western country. He says that there are more than one hundred millions of acres of excellent land there, and he is so confident that it may soon become the source of wealth, that he will stipulate with sufficient sureties to pay off 15 millions of Dollars of the domestic debt within five years by the sale of those lands, if Congress will now supply him with 8 thousand specie dollars for the expence of surveying &c. But so low is the state of the treasury that money cannot be spared. And while we have the pleasure of reflecting on this western prospect, our European prospects are the most discouraging. Letters from Governor Jefferson of Feb. last in France,(1) inform Congress that it will be absolutely necessary to pay the Interest of our loans in Holland very shortly, if we would preserve any degree of credit there; that the supplys, expected from the new loan negotiated there, have stopped. And he has proposed a very disadvantageous mode of relief to the consideration of Congress, without recommending it, only stating our situation. He says that there is a certain Dutch Gentleman, mentioning his name which I cannot recollect, who now holds 1,340,000 Dollars of our domestic securities, and he will engage to fill up our loans, which have been stipulated for in Holland to a considerable amount, and which if procured, would answer our present urgent demands; but it is upon this hard condition that Congress will allow him out of that money 189,000 Guilders in pay of the Interest due to him on those securities, he allowing 10 per Cent out of the interest for receiving his pay in Europe. A very extraordinary offer this! An answer is desired by Mr. Jefferson within three months from the date of hisletter in Feb. It is probable this sum asked for, is of more value than the whole purchase of those securities. The sum this single European possesses is near one twentieth part of our domestic debt & it is said that there are large orders now from Europe for buying up our securities at their depreciated value. If this Dutchman could obtain the interest he proposes it is probable that it would increase their avidity to buy, a consideration not very favorable to the interest, if the peace of the united states. We have for some time not had a congress owing to some of the members going home, but it is expected that others will be here in a few days. There is considerable business which will claim the attention of Congress as soon as the states assemble. The Mob in New York have been quiet since the Militia dispersed them at the Goal.(2) It is said that Governor Clinton disavows his ordering the Militia to fire, & says he had rather they should have been disarmed by the mob, than they should have killed his fellow citizens. Baron Steuben, who got sadly pelted by marching with those who were armed, says, damn such fellow citizens. The Gov- April 24, 1788  ernor & Mayor are blamed by the populace, tho' they even degraded themselves in trying to please them. The Doctors are before the grand Jurors now for tryal and it remains an uncertainty what will be the issue. I have nothing very consequential to communicate to your Excellency, beg leave to assure your Excellency that with the highest sentiments of Esteem & respect, I have the honor to be your most obedient & humble Servant, Paine Wingate ""

 Dear Sir New York Apl. 24. 1788 I was but a few days ago honoured with your favor of the 21 December.(1) Having been absent on a trip to Virginia ever since the 1t of Jany I was alike cut off from it, and an opportunity of writing you. Massachusetts, Jersey, Pensylvania, Deleware, Connecticut and Georgia, have adopted the Constitution. New Hampshire has been in convention upon it, but finding that a Majority had assembled under instructions or promises to vote in the Negative, of whom a sufficient number were converted to turn the scale, an adjournment has taken place until June for the purpose of getting such clear of their fetters, and it is not doubted by the Friends of the measure, that this will be effected so that a ready adoption will be the consequence of their reassembling. New York, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina & South Carolina are to deliberate between this and July---;in Maryland & South Carolina no doubt is entertained as to the adoption---;in New York & Virginia very active opposition is made and the event is uncertain. In the latter it will depend much upon the ideas entertained in convention as to the issue in N. Hampshire, whose reassembling is to be after the meeting in Virga. I am certain that a great Majority of our Convention, will be for adopting upon being ascertained that nine states will adopt, as much worse apprehensions are held from the event of a disunion, that [than] from any thing that is in the constitution. We have a party that is truly antifederal headed by Mr. Henry, but it will be limitted to a few, unless the federalists who are for amendments, should, from a mistaken view of the probability of the measures being carried into effect by Nine States, be drawn into steps favouring the antifederal scheme. Mr. H---;---; does not openly declare for a dismemberment of the union, but his Arguments in support of his opposition to the constitution, go directly to that issue. He says that three confed- April 24, 1788  eracies would be practicable & better suited to the good of America, than one. God forbid that I should ever see the trial made. Virginia would fall into a division from which she might add to her burthens, but could never derive aid of any kind. North Carolina is to sit after Virginia, and it is probable, will follow her---;of Rhode Island we say nothing when speaking of American politics. Of the States which have adopted, Jersey & Deleware were unanimous. Georgia we hear was also unanimous---;in Pensylvania the Majority was about two thirds & the Minority continue much discontented---;in Connecticut the Majority was about two thirds, the Minority acquiescing---;in Massachusetts the Majority was small the Minority acquiescing. The debates of this convention have been published, a Copy whereof you will receive herewith.(2) It would have afforded me much pleasure to have seen your sentiments fully upon this subject but Mr. Madison having gone to Virga. before my return to this City, I have not seen your letter to him as yet.(3) You ask \""would it not have been better to assign to Congress, exclusively, the Article of imports for federal purposes, & to have left direct Taxation exclusively to the States.\"" It is probable that the former, aided by the Land Office, might have cleared off the present debts of the Union, and supported the current expences of Government during peace, but in a case of War, other resources must be brought into practice, and with a view to such an event, some coercive principle must have been established whereby the federal Government should act with effect, and had this not been interwoven in its civil administration, a military one must occasionally have been put in practice upon delinquent states. The former will never be exercised but when necessary, & then in a way not odious or inconvenient to the people. The latter must forever be both odious and inconvenent, let the occasion be what it may. I feel sensibly for your situation with ournumerous and too justly discontented foreign Creditors. Nor do I see a prospect of relief before the New Government shall get into operation, which must still require some time. The proposition for filling up the Loan in Holland provided the Broker be suffered to retain 180,000 Guilders the interest of certain certificates in his possession of our domestic debt, will not be acceded to by Congress, and yet I do not see upon what ground we are to expect that loans will be made upon the common principle. I should myself be for acceding, because, it appears that it would preserve our Credit until it is probable the new Government would commence, this I think so great an object, that I would not stand on a precise adherence to Systems. We have at present not a   competent Congress to act in the Case, but from the Sentiment of the members attending, and those of the Board of Treasury, I am convinced the terms would not be accepted. I hope the views of our Creditors are turned upon the revolution which is about to take place with us, and that they may be induced to continue their patience until time shall produce the issue. I apprehend that amongst the first measures of the new Government, will be that of negotiating Loans for the purpose of satisfying the foreigners to whom the U.S. are indebted, as it will require some time to bring into practice the resources from which money is to be derivd. I am happy that my information in the case of Commodore Jones apprised you of the hazards you might have run, & I am at the same time pleased that you fell on the expedient of acting safely without disappointing him.(4) The business of the prize money which was paid under your direction is fully understood by Congress, and I believe every one else whose attention has been called to it. I am much obliged by your information upon European politics. It is true we ought not to entangle ourselves in the affairs of others, when we can avoid it, but keeping clear of them depends, in some measure, upon knowing their circumstances & views. I will venture one idea upon European politics. It would seem that the Turks should meet with support against Russia from other powers in addition to France. Russia has already a vast Territory which is peopling fast; she is also growing in naval force. Suppose she should get Turkey with those seas which belong to it, would she not be dangerous to the rest of Europe? I have the Honor to be, Dr Sir with the most perfect respect & Esteem, Your Most obt. Servt., Ed. Carrington P.S. I have not a list of the Returns for the Virginia Convention or I would sent it to you. It contains many obscure characters whom you would know nothing of. It is unfortunate that in this great business the passions instead of the Reason ofthe people were called into operation. This circumstance renders the issue there the more uncertain because a great proportion must act from the influence of a few Men whose popular talents may be exerted. ""

 Dear Sir New York April 24th 1788 Your favr 23d March have before me, And attributing your silence to the pressure of public business without suspecting a want of attention from you, anticipated your apology. Last Evening recd. also yours 13th Instant & to both shall make the necessary reply. Elections were under the first article. Upon which did I not recollect some striking instances of their precarious nature I should feel a greater dissappointment. By what I can learn there does not appear to be a choice of L Govr by the people, of course the same ground is to be traversed in General Court. Mr H carries all before him,(1) and altho I supposed he could be elected, I had great expectation, from what you observed, that his competitor would have stood higher. The sale to Messrs. Gorham & Phelps is estimated by some of my friends as an advantageous one.(2) I confess, if they are so obligated as to make the payments sure and punctual, it appears to be a good sale, Under all circumstances. There is a glutt of Land at Market of which the U S A hold two hundred million acres. I am obliged for your attention to my particular finances. As to adjourning farther South it will not probably take place under the present Confederation. What a new Year may effect, or the New System you have so much at heart may produce, depends upon various contingencies. In regard to the accumulated and increasing debt of the Union, some people give broad hints that it will be paid with a sponge; which I think under our present weak & resourceless circumstances, will be a natural Consequence. Under a new energetic Government, I hear some politicians say, our inability is an insuperable bar to payment. The same men say resources might be pointed to of importance sufficient to pay an interest of 3 per Cent; And I am of opinion could the debt be funded at 3 per Cent, the holders of securities left at their option to reloan at three, or take their chance of unfunded securities at six, the bulk of the debt would be reloaned.To this it may be said the cry of injustice will be sett up; As it would indubitably at a sponge. Upon which I reply. In the first place that, upon the whole, which will effect most extensive justice, to the greatest number of individuals, must be done. In the second place whats done by consent takes away error. And lastly, If it shall appear impracticable to effect more than three per Cent, will not necessity, which is paramount to all law, justify the measure? You will reply let this necessity be made apparent prior to such proceeding; In which I am perfectly agreed. Before I go from the subject, I am induced to think that under our present impoverished circumstances, could any measure be devised to fund our debt, & make sound appropriations for the interest at even less than three  April 24, 1788  per Cent, it would reanimate a dead mass of useless paper & instantly make it an efficient Capital for the farmer, the Merchant, the manfacturier, & every man in the Community. Whether \""regeneration\"" is necessary to induce N England, my honored Country, to adopt the New System or not, you who are in one of its largest states can form the best judgment; But am confident without that miraculous change, They will find the necessity of that, or one very like it. For as to the old wheel it wont budge an inch, & seems shattered to pieces. That some of the old spokes, & perhaps felloes, may do again I have no doubt but that the nave must be taken out, & the whole worked over again appears to me indispensible. I do not form my judgment altogether upon what information I get from Boston, but compare it with that from my friends at Milton, & other parts of the state. Ruling all which together the result seems to be that N Hamshire are divided, & so is N J. The majority of one, I am convinced are against fOEderal measures & possibly of both. As to N Y one party are sure of adoption, another as positive it will be rejected. So no judgment can be formed. Some think Govr Clinton will be elected for the City, which I doubt. He will come in however by a handsome majority for Ulster County. Maryland by a very large majority will accede; So will So Carolina. N Carolina will probably operate as Virginia, which State I think will be nearly divided; But I rather think from the best information attainable, the majority will carry it for adopting, with amendments, upon the plan of Massachusetts. I have heard in the Circles here, you, or Sister W have written the Columbian patriot.(3) I suspect you, but wish to have it Ascertained; for the purposes only of curiosity believe me. To your demand to know what we are doing in Congress I answer---;Nothing. To your enquiry what have we done? I answer---;almost nothing. Yet I dont know that those who have attended, which Massachusettshave incessantly, are to be blamed. The States have been in such a flutter about the New, that they have hardly paid attention to the old Government. One week we have nine States, Then again we have only four or five; For to my surprise the Members are under no kind of control & take themselves away whenever they think proper. The State of N York particularly altho there are sometimes two or three members in Town have for weeks together, had only a single member present. What is to be done? Massachusetts, & I presume others have written to their Legislatures upon the Subject. Is more in their power? Most of the members are either of the Convention, or just before election dance down to the Hustings, And whether they are successful candidates or not, their attendance upon Congress is withdrawn. We have a prospect however of a full House in May,(4) when we shall soon finish the more important business, & if the States agree, follow our instructions in organizing the new Government, & so  cede. The doing it before is courting encroachment. And leaving the people to the mercy of any rude invader. And I am not ready for despotism. Your refusal to christen \""Parson's handling,\"" and \""re Eccho to the speech\"" shows a favorable combination is effected against the doings of convention. By the way, the Govr. was offended at Thacher & self for addressing the Legislature, other than thro' him, which we did upon the supposition it was usually done while they were in sessions; However he refused, & gave this as a reason for not signing the resolve, empowering the delegates to procure a plan of the Line. I am perswaded heretofore communications have been thus made.  I informed Mr Walker your ballance was ready,(4) & upon its appearing that the money received is identified, he says no objection can be made to receiving it. Farther, I have requested him to give me on paper the objections, informalities &c which require answer & remedy, & I will communicate them; which he assures me shall be done without delay. I will very chearfully attend the settlement & if in my power effect it. The other matter is still at the Treasury Board, Mr Osgood informs me, that he hourly expects the returns from the commissioners, & if it shall appear that the U S A have not paid the difference between 40 & 75 they will allow it. As for the recovery of your depreciation I see no great prospect of it. Congress have refered this business to the Treasury board before I came on; The Treasury Board have given an opinion in many instances against admiting new demands for depreciation, And in yours amongst the rest, and to me have repeated it as an impracticability. So that I confess I know not how to get forward in the business. I will again converse the board & effect everything in my power. You will oblige Cobams & Hamatt to forward me their Charter party of Schooner Dispatch, having requested me to close the account for them. Upon application to the offices where the NavyBoard papers were lodged; I am informed no Charter parties were forwarded, Which I wonder at. Love to Sister & the family from, Yours very affectionatly, Sam A Otis P.S. Mr. Walker says the ballance is Â£68 263.18.3 agreeably to corrected cash book, by the Vouchers. They are so very minute & scrupulous, I see no chance of a speedy settlement unless Mr. Henderson would come on. But I suppose in that case they would allow nothing for expences. I will forward Mr Walkers objections however under his own hand. Upon perusal of the papers I am fully perswaded the ribaldry flung at you by your enimies will tend more to make you friends than anything else, And if their spleen had not blinded them they would see the natural consequence. April 25, 1788  John Sullivan was one of the Sargents who led the mutiny & assaulted Congress in Philadelphia; Afterwards fled for misdemeanors into the Western world. Tis supposed he was concerned in murdering some Spanyards & is a very dangerous desperate character. Hamar has an order to take him as a dangerous enimy to the U S A.(5) ""

I have ventured to assure them that any business in which I was concerned has been better managed in my absence than it would have been by me, and that if they have any further instructions or information they must transmit them to you.

 My Dear Sir New York April 27 1788. I confess I can't help accusing myself with faults and negligence, whenever I omit, for any considerable time, writing to my friends, especially those I very sincerely love and esteem, and for the first place you hold among these in the affections of your constant friend, your allowing me to hold the like place in yours will ever afford me the greatest pleasure and happiness. For my negligence my friends must sometimes allow to plead my indolent habits---;and sometimes I have a better excuse, I mean the want of information, & ideas, words, and matter worthy their notice---;and you, who may be always sure of my sincerest regards and sentiments of friendship, will, I am persuaded, allow me another excuse, and agree that forms and ceremonies shall be dispensed with. Here we are in an idle and painful situation, no Congress for doing business more than one day in twelve or fifteen,(1) public affairs neglected, and we kept here only as Spectators of a declining Government, and of those little wretched games of interest and self always played in times of disorder and in the passage from one kind of Government to another. How long we shall remain in this situation is uncertain---;however I think not long. The Constitution must pretty soon take place in peace, or else the Scene become more turbulent, and consequently more active. Should it be peaceably adopted our affairs will be, I believe, on a better footing, at least for sometime and as to the final Consequences time and experience must determine. I have ever been as much discouraged about the administration of our Governments, as about the forms of our Constitutions---;and I think we may depend on this---;that we may make and alter Constitu[tions] eternally on paper, it will answer little or no purpose, if we be not more Steady and attentive in the administration of public affairs. Sir Wm. Temple observes, and I Think Justly, that the Dutch had neither parts, genius or wit, and that they had but very indifferentConstitutions, and yet, that they were the best Statesmen in the world, and enjoyed an exceeding good Government; that by their industry, application, and uniform perseverence, and by their frugality, &c. they made compensation for all the defects of their Constitutions, and for their difficiencies in point of genius, and quickness of discernment.(2) In fact  April 27, 1788  the Dutch merely by the force of system and application in the administration of their affairs, have long been respectable in a miserable Country, in a mixture of sand, mud, and water, where any other people on Earth would have perished. They see the ship is well ballast'd, and the first requisite in their magistrates is a capacity for applying systematically to business. Are we not in this Country often deceived with a brilliant imagination, where there is no depth of Judgment, or any talents for business? Have not the States often, in delegating men to Congress chosen their most Showy and, yet in fact, their most triffling characters, men who never come forward with a view steadily to pursue and support systems, and to shew their abilities in that line; but only with a view to overturn all measures adopted by others, and to introduce new ones of their own, and thereby perpetuate change and instability? We have done no business of any importance in Congress this year nor is there much to be done. We have eight States and three half States---;Just money received into the Treasury to keep the Government in motion---;no foreign Communications of any importance---;the present calm in Europe is thought generally to be but temporary---;the affairs of the Dutch [are] unsettled---;punishments and confiscations carried with a pretty high hand. Mr. Adams returns to Boston soon, probably by the middle of May---;and Colo. Smith to New York. Brother Thatcher returned to Massa. about the last of March---;and proposes to be again in Congress about the first of August. I wish you to attend if you can find it convenient early in the Summer. My affairs then will require that I should, for a short time, be in Massa., and I will be very much obliged to you to let me know, as soon as you conveniently can, your determinations respecting your attendance in Congress. It is probable by the first of August that nine States will have agreed to the Constitution---;and it is my wish to attend to my private affairs inMassa. and be returned to Congress by that time. Maryland Convention is now in Session, and I believe will adopt the Constitution, without any doubt. South Carolina Convention will, probably, adopt it by the first of June. Virginia and New Hampshire will probably decide by the first of July & there is pretty clearly more than an equal chance that one or the other of these states will adopt. I am rather disposed to believe that all the States except R.I. will adopt; but, at present, little can be said with certainty as to New Hampshire, N.Y., Virga. or N Carolina.  Be kind enough, Sir, to give my respects to Brother Strong and to our friend Bacon when you see them, and let my best regards always be remembered for your family. With Sentiments of esteem and friendship, I am, Dear Sir, your affecte. Hum Servant, N. Dane  PS.

It is said that Maryland has already adopted the new Constitution by a very great Majority, but the official Accounts have not yet reach'd us. We have a Letter from the Governor of Rhode Island informing of the Proceedings of that State upon the Business & it's Rejection, which you have seen in the public Prints. They alledge that the Singularity of their Mode proceeded from no Disrespect either to the general Convention or to Congress but from a Regard to pure republican Principles. I understand that in your State there is a clear Majority of the Delegates Friends to the new System. I suspect the same will be true of both the Carolinas, so that we shall have an Opportunity of seeing what wonderful Effects will be wrought. Except Rhode Island there is no State but this that seems at all doubtful of accepting the Constitution, & I even am inclined to think it will pass here, but not by any considerable Majority. The Federalists (as they style themselves) have been extreamly busy in endeavouring to swell their Number of Votes as much as possible in this City, not for the sake of carrying their Election (for of that they were perfectly secure by a vast Majority) but to make it appear, if possible, that a Majority of the Inhabitants of the State are federal.

The federal ticket for members to represent this City in Convention is carryed by a very large Majority; and accounts of several Elections in the neighbouring Counties (that have come to hand) are much more favourable than was generally expected. The latest accounts from Virginia are favourable. Pennsylvania is in a State of tranquility and the general opposition seems to be once more on the decline. The State of Georgia has made a large Cession of Western lands to the United States on condition that the new System is adopted and that they be allowed thirty thousand dollars for expences in defending that Country.(1) In haste, I have the Honor to be, with the greatest Respect and Esteem, Dear Sir, your Most Obedient Servant, N.

This intelligence, so agreeable to your Excellency's wishes, I have taken the first opportunity of communicating. The state of New York have this week had their elections for delegates to their convention. In this city the votes are generally in favor of federalists, and it is said that they are so in other counties beyond expectation. It is now the opinion of those who are well acquainted with the sentiments of the people thro' the state that the probability is in favor of adopting the constitution here. The latest accounts from Virginia are, that from the returns of the delegates, which are now generally made, a majority will be for the new government. South Carolina does not seem to be doubted. Upon the whole the encouragement of having a peaceable & good government soon established is dayly encreasing.(1) I hope we shall not be disappointed. Georgia have made a considerable cession to the united states of their Western lands upon condition that the new constitution shall be adopted & that they be allowed thirty thousand dollars for their expences in defending that territory during the late war.

 Dear Sir New York 8th May 1788 I have been pretty much taken up with variety of attentions, & noth- May 8, 1788  ing of importance having taken place except what was in the papers, I have much against my inclination, defered replying to your last of . But I assure you nothing on my part shall be wanting to cultivate a correspondence which at once gratifies my vanity, & promises me improvement. Congress have not been idle, altho they have been so interrupted by the appointment of its members to Convention, in one place & another that much less has been effected than could be wished. It was however the general, & invariable opinion that it would be more expedient that Congress should continue in session, during this uncertain & agitated year, even if nothing very important was effected, Than to leave the States without any bond of Union, or even the semblance of a fOEderal Government. Indeed the frequent returns of the states who have been wise enough to adopt the new Constitution, renders it amongst other things expedient that Congress should continue in sessions. Maryland ratification is now reading, And I have no doubt we shall soon have that of So Carolina. I presume from what intelligence is stiring that No. Carolina will follow the lead of Verginia where the opposition has gained no ground of late, & will be weakened by the unanimity of Maryland. Verginia remains doubtful however---;yet I can hardly suppose She will refuse to adopt, as I am informed, upon the plan of Massachusetts. N. York are nearly equally divided. The fOEderalists are very positive, so are the opposition. Govr. Clinton is pitted at all events against it & indeed it is with him a very great stake; for if he is in the minority upon this question I think he must lose his election. The supporters of the measure are however powerful. The City almost unanimously, & all the commercial interest, The Schylers & great proprietors, a large number of farmers &c. Clintons friends pushed him very injudiciously for the City. What is our omen of success in my view is, that the most steady opposers in thisquarter begin to dispair, and say it must be adopted with amendments. I hear a suggestion that N. York opposers have no hope of rejection, but only hold up a good countenance, in order to effect amendments, upon the Massachusetts plan. Upon the whole I recollect no period at which the prospect looked more bright than the present. I can form no judgment of N Hamsh. Their adjournment into the Wilderness augurs ill, but Langdon & Sullivan, the great leaders are both agreed in fOEderal measures, altho I presume their cordiality is not very perfect in other points. R Island will be overwhelmed with argument & influence, and their own minority exerting, I think may be brot to their senses. I exceedingly rejoice at the unanimity of Massachusetts & congratulate her upon the honor she is about to acquire, in her elections. The people who are united in electing a Governor, a Lieut Governour(1) , & Senate, who have evinced steady measures & good policy, can hardly fail of making a good election of Representatives.   I am informed you have taken my more than orphaned neice under your wing. To that humane benevolent disposition which your friends may recognize without flattery, You have the tenderness of a father inducing your protection of one, very dear to your valuable servt my much regreted friend---;Of whom I never think but my heart sickens.

 Sir, New York May 8 1788 Until a few days ago there has not been a Congress for taking into consideration your Excellencies letter of the 13th of March requesting a prolongation of the time allowed for rendering the Accounts of the State against the U.S. to the district commissioner.(1) We took the earliest opportunity to lay this letter before Congress---;it was referred to the Board of Treasury, whose report thereupon we have now the Honor to enclose. This report expressly liberates the State Commissioner from the duty of restating the Accounts under the heads directed on the part of the United States. He is clearly at liberty to render them in the forms in which they have been kept, and the re- statements, if any such are necessary, must be made by the district Commissioner. As your Excellencies letter stated no facts upon which Congress could found an opinion that an extension of the time would be necessary from any other circumstance, and as no application of the kind, has been made by any other State, it was thought best by that Body to concur with the Board in refusing the request of Virginia, permitting the delegation to transmit the report to your Excellency for your more full information. May 10, 1788  We beg leave to recommend that the Commissioner on the part of the State immediately tender the Accounts to the district commissioner in their original forms, if he has not time to re-state them, & should this produce a difficulty let that arise with the adverse party.

 Dear Sir, New York May 10. 1788. Yesterday were sent to me inclosed---;the inclosed pamphlet and printed letter(1) with a request to convey them to you, which I do myself the honor to transmit accordingly. So far as my information extends the sentiments expressed by this writer, very generally meet the approbation of those who aim at Just and uncorrupt Government on republican principles---;nor do I perceive any thing in this publication in the least inconsistent with the determination of the Massa. Convention---;a determination, in my opinion, by far the wisest & best that has been made on the Subject---;for tho the situation of the Country made it prudent to adopt the Constitution, and put it into operation; yet, clear I am, that we ought not to relax a moment in our attention and vigilance for further guarding and checking the exercise of powers given by the Constitution, and for securing the liberties of America, and an honest administration of Government on known and certain principles. My fears and apprehensions do not arise altogether from a consideration of the faults in the new Constitution, but, in a consider- May 10, 1788  able measure, from a full persuasion that we have many men, and able ones too, in this Country, who have a disposition to make a bad use of any government, and who, if not well checked and restrained by the forms of the Government, will, so far as they can have influence produce a wicked and corrupt administration---;and you may, Sir, be assured that the jealous advocates for the adoption of this Constitution, and who are pretty numerous, artful and active, do not intend that any amendments shall be adopted, even after the Constitution shall be put into operation, if they can any way prevent it---;at least they will oppose all amendments which, I believe, the republican and honest part of the Community will contend for---; however, I think the true Federalists, or true freinds of a genuine federal republic, are extending their influence and connections very considerably; and tho a large proportion of them considering our situation agree to adopt the system as presented, they are determined with candor and firmness, to endeavour to establish in these States governments on principles of freedom and equality---;whether the friends of honest measures---;or the friends of influence and corruption will succeed time only can determine. Sure I am, the former will have the support and advice of your self and many others who have steered the political ship through the late Storm. Eight States have now determined relative to the Constitution proposed. I can give you no certain information respecting the other five---;our accounts respecting the Sentiments of the men elected for the State Conventions are various---;but, on the whole, I am inclined to believe they will adopt with recommending amendments as in Massa. In this State, Virga. & N.C. the numbers for and agt. are pretty equal, as well as abilities. Your freind Mr. Lee I understand, declined going to the State Convention, principally, on account of the unhealthiness of the place where the Convention is to meet. I mentioned to you in my last theapplication of Kentucky for an admission into the union---;I am Just informed a gentleman has arrived in this place from Vermont, to make enquiries, &c respecting her admission into the Union. I understand the State has appointed a Committee and given them power to apply to Congress whenever they shall see a fair opportunity for again bringing under consideration the independance and admission of that state into the Union. I have been wishing for sometime that this subject might again be brought into veiw---;for I am well persuaded if these States do no[t] unite in their infancy, and cement the union, they will not do it hereafter.

 Dear Sir New York May 12th. 1788 I have had the honor to receive your favors of the 9th & 21st of April(1) for which accept my thanks. My hopes respecting the Success of the new Constitution in Virginia are in some measure revived by the information you have given me upon that Subject but am still sorry to find that the number of friends & foes are so nearly divided as to render the Vote of Kentucky of critical importance for I fear nothing friendly is to be expected from that quarter. I yesterday reced. letters from Colo. Muter & Mr Innes(2) who inform that it has few or no Supporters in that Country. Muter from a warm friend has become a violent enemy to the Plan & that upon general principles. They enclosed me a list of members chosen to represent that District in Convention & further advise that on the 1st Monday in April a Convention was to meet at Danville expressly to take into consideration the new Constitution & instruct & charge their representatives with the Sentiments of the District upon that Subject.(3) This measure almost precludes all hope that any good effect will result from a communication of my Sentiments to their Delegates, as I am apprehensive that they will conceive themselves religiously bound to observe Instructions framed & given with such Solemnity. However as I am personally acquainted with the Men & fully possess their confidence I shall at all events hazard the Attempt. I have not of late been able to discover any great change in the Sentiments of the people of this State with respect to the New Government. Both parties appear equally confident & have equal expectations from Virginia. Their Elections for Convention are over but the returns are not yet made known. I believe Federalists only are elected for this City. We have done very little in Congress since you left us---;Nine States have not appeared since that time & for a month previous to Tuesday last we could not even muster Seven; Nine are again shortly expected upon thefloor, as soon as this is the case I shall endeavour to obtain the Determination of Congress upon the Kentucky Application. I flatter myself that it will be in favor `tho' still have great reason to fear the effects of Eastern Jealousy. My Anxiety upon this Subject daily increases, should not a dete[r]mination be had before the expiration of the Act of Seperation---;or should Congress refuse to grant this request; in either case I fear the consequences may be unfavorable to the Union especially as that District entertains such prejudices against the New Constitution which I hope & believe will be adopted. Let the event of their application be what it may I am convinc'd they will proceed in establishing their Independence. They have already chosen  May 12, 1788  Delegates to meet in Convention at Danville about the last of July to form a Constitution.(4) The future prosperity & tranquility of that Country greatly depends upon the Success of this important undertaking & I fear that few will be found in that Body who have Sufficiently attended to political Subjects to quallify them for the task of framing a good System of Government for that District. There is also reason to apprehend that certain partialities & prejudices will operate against a Judicious Selection from the Constitutions of the different States. Some of the most respectable Characters in that Country aware of those difficulties have expressed to me their wish that you could be prevailed upon to draw up a plan of Government for that District to be laid before their Convention---;assureing that from the great confidence they place in your integrity & abilities there is every reason to believe that it would be adopted in toto. Will you pardon me for adding my request to their wishes? I am sensible of the impropriety of this application at a time when you are engaged in important Business---;let my anxiety to promote the happiness of a flourishing Country in which I propose to spend my life plead my excuse.(5) I send you enclosed the Statements(6) you required & shall at all times be happy in being favord with your commands should my Services in this quarter be of use to you.

 My dear Sir, New York May 14. 1788 Mr. Barlow of Connecticut(1) will have the Honor to call on you with this letter. I have not the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with him, but his literary Talents have considerably distinguished him as a poetical as well as prose writer, and he is introduced to me as a Gentleman deserving your countenance. Permit me to reccommend him to your attention and civilities. He conducts to the Marquis de La Fayette, the Eldest son of our illustrious Friend Genl. Greene(2), who is sent at the particular request of that Noble Man, to receive his education under his direction in France. I have given the little Fellow a few lines to you and directed him to deliver them in person, it is unnecessary for me to solicit for him the attention of one who so well knew his Father. I had the pleasure to write you pretty fully on the 25th Ult.(3) by Mr. Paradise, since which no event has taken place except the adoption of the Constitution in Maryland, by a Majority of 63 against 11. South Carolina is now sitting, and the general countenance of intelligence from thence, is much in favor of the Measure. There seems to be no doubt entertained of an adoption by a considerable Majority. Should this be the case it will give eight States. Virginia being the next to set, will meet under very critic[al] circumstances, because upon her decision will, in my opinion, depend, not the fate of the Measure, but whether some degree of convulsion shall, or shall not, attend its Maturation. It will have gone too far to be retracted, and even Virginia herself, should she in the first instance reject, must afterwards come in. Indeed New Hampshire will certainly accede when she re-assembles, and compleate the Nine for giving action to the project, but a decision in the Negative in Virga. would, in one moment, give additional life to the Minority in Pensylvania, whose opposition has taken a stubborn stand, and the appeal may in that quarter, be to the sword, nor will I venture a conjecture upon the effect suchan effort there, will have amongst the opposers in Virginia. I hope, however, that the possibility of a calamity of this sort, will have its effect on some of the more wise in the opposition, and incline them to adopt rather than run such a hazard. Should Virga. adopt, we shall at once, have a Government, the issue of a thorough revolution, without the violent means which have uniformly been requisite for the like events elsewhere. I pray God we may exhibit to the world this instance of our superior wisdom & benevolence. I do myself the pleasure to send you by Mr. Barlow a volume containing a Number of Periodical papers which have been written in this City upon the occasion of the Constitution. They are written, it is sup- May 14, 1788  posed, by Messrs. Madison, Jay & Hamilton. The Numbers run to as many more, the remainder are to form a second Vol. which will be published in a few weeks, & I will do myself the pleasure to send it to you as soon as it is done.(4) Mr. Madison, in a letter which he wrote me a few days ago,(5) requested me to obtain the first & second volumes of the Philosophical Transactions of the society in Philada. & forward them to you. Upon enquiry I find that the 1st Vol. is not in print having been destroyed during the War. The second, I have got the favor of Mr. Barlow to take with him for you. I am told the 1st is to be reprinted. When it is done we will take care to forward it to you. During Mr. Madisons absence in Virginia I am aware of your dependance upon me for regular information upon the progress of the business of the constitution and shall omit no opportunity of writing.

 My Dear Sir New York 18 March [i.e., May] 1788 . . . . I think I have not written you since the accession of Maryland to the new System(1) ---;the accounts are favorable from the South and unless Virginia does, I hardly apprehend a negative from the Southern States. Gore is here & goes for Philadelphia to morrow---;He is going to lay hold of some of our great ones, and will mak[e] O.

After several applications to Greenleaf he has paid me ten pounds & 11d currency which wants your order. It was paid in paper and the difference between that & Specie is about seven pr Cent. In Congress we go on with seven States as usual, but I think nine are like to be upon the floor this week---;The most deficient State is New York,(2) which is very extraordinary. There is a Doctr Williamson arived who seems to have got with him from No Carolina a quantum of self consequence. Kentucki business I think must unavoidably be agitated this week---;Brown who by the way improves upon acquaintance is incessant in his application. The New England members with [will?] certainly be in opposition---;King tell me we are not empowered in his opinion, and if we were it is extremely improper in the present State of affairs. I find it is the general opinion that the New wheel will revolve---;N Carolina, our pompous brother Williamson thinks there will be no  May 18, 1788  fear of, nor perhaps will there be of S C, and Virginia with all stateliness, will be very unwilling to stand alone; For N York will accede with the worst possible grace, I think she will be bullied into it. I think the people of Massachusetts, by what I have heard of their elections, are in a state of tollerable union & tranquility---;This rejoices me, because N England united, will forever counterpoise any cabals & manOEuvres of the South. . . . Yours very truly, Sam A Otis 20th May. So great a favor as yours of 9th can by no means pass unnoticed. I am glad you found all things well in Massachusetts. I think their elections shew they are in pretty good Temper.

If I am elected to attend the Convention, I do not see how it will be possible for me to attend at New York next month except a few Days, & as I propose after theConvention to attend the proposed Treaty, in Case it should take place. I beleive it will be best to send on, or rather request Mr. Yates to take his seat, he having no public Business to divert him (as I know of) from the same.

 Dear sir New York 21. May 1788 From my Arrival in Philada. which was on the 11th Inst (for I came by Water from Portsmouth) I have been persecuted by a story that had been published in Martins Paper(1) & republished I think in every Paper from NC to this Place. Is it true that North Carolina is toren into factions? Are you generally governed by Mobs? and such other Questions were frequent and familiar. You know that in those Northern States which contain from 10 to 15 Counties each People think differently concerning the magnitude of a County from what we think in Carolina where a quarter nag might cross a County in half an Hour. General Caswells Name being among the federal Candidates rendered the Story as published by Martin the more exceptionable; the Story was so told as to induce the Belief that the Candidates were all  May 21, 1788  present & had effected a Riot. In this State of Intelligence & being thoroughly chagrined by a Story so obviously calculated to injure a very respectable Character & with him to injure the general Character of the State I thought it my duty to prepare a Paragraph and cause it to be published which is thought by the Readers to put the Matter in a very different or in a new Point of Light.(2) The inclosed paper contains the Paragraph which if you think worth while you will forward to Govr. Caswell. As I had no particular Information concerning the circumstances of the Dobbs Riot you may presume that I could not directly and pointedly contradict every assertion of Mr Martin, I was therefore obliged to account for the Riot by reference to private disputes which otherwise I should have had no desire to mention, but even under this necessity you see that I have taken Care to cast no shade on the Character of any individual. I conceive that I am possessed of some Philosophy & Patience but still I have not patience sufficient to be silent or unconcerned when I conceive that the Character of a friend is injured.

 My dear Sally New York May 21. 1788. I received your's of the tenth Instant last evening, and as you think I have neglected writing to you as often as to some others, I shall now discharge my debt to you before any body else. You will not expect that I shall write to you as frequently as to your mother, But you may depend on your share in common with the rest of the children. Your letter gives me a good deal pleasure. It is very well expressed & pertinent. You need not feel uneasy in writing a letter to any body. It is true there are defects in spelling which I could wish you knew how to mend, but these are very fashionable errors in young ladies. I have observed that you are apt to be too diffident of yourself & of what you say & do. This may proceed from a good cause. It may proceed from an anxious desire to appear well. But it should never be indulged in bashfulness. This is very unfashionable. A young lady should be very May 21, 1788  modest in her dress, innocent in her language, & virtuous in her deportment; but at the same time when she is in company with gentlemen or ladies she will be entirely easy and unimbarrassed in her behaviour. She will be very sociable & familiar upon any trifling subject much as she would be with a brother or sister. You will observe that when you go to see Polly or your Aunt Wingate & have them to see you, You are never at a loss what to say. Any chat will do for you. And much the same kind of talk is made use of among the fashionable people in their visits. Only they keep talking all the time & consequently say more nonsense than you would. Another thing is fashionable which I can not say I entirely approve of. That is---;Fathers, Mothers, sons & daughters, young & old all mix together & talk & joke alike so that you cannot discover any distinction made or any respect shewn to one more than to another. I am not for keeping up a great distance between Parents & Children. I love to have them familiar, sociable & even humerous sometimes, but there is difference between stareing & stark mad. The young gentlemen are never permitted to kiss a lady before company or even to take her by the hand, unless it is to lead her out of the room or to hand her into a carriage or up the steps to a door, or the like. The husband does not hand his wife upon such occasions but some other gentleman does it. So much for fashions in conduct. I do not know any remarkable changes in dress since I have been here. The ladies have still very slim waists with rumpers & plumpers. Very small feet & monstrous large heads. Long trailing gowns & short sleeves. But the plaiting of the hair & adorning the body is I think more attended to than the ornaments of the mind. Consequently the young gentlemen associate with them occasionally for their amusement but do not think of submiting to such a heavy tax as to support them for wives. You will take the hint, & if you wish tohave a husband who is worth having, you will appear in such a manner as will induce him to suppose that you will not be a tax upon him to maintain you, but that you will conduce to his interest as well as happiness. I have no more instructions at this time to suggest, but shall give you my most affectionate wishes that you ever walk in the paths of peace and virtue, that you may make a wise choice of your allotments in life, that you may be happy in your friends & connexions, and that all may tend to introduce you to a happier state hereafter. My letters my dear child to any of the family you are welcome to read, on my part, but When they are sent from me they belong to another & I have no right to controul. But I dare say your mother will gratify you in every thing that is proper, perhaps there was something you would not wish to see.  I am your affectionate Paine Wingate ""

An ArrÃ©t of the King of France of the 29th December 1787, giving farther Encouragement to the Trade of the United States has been transmitted to Congress by Mr. Jefferson, and a Copy of the same will be forwarded to your Excellency from the Office of Foreign Affairs.(2) It was expected that a Treaty wou'd have been effected with the several Nations of Indians in the Neighbourhood of the Muskingum some time in the current Month, but the latest Advices from the Superintendant of Indian Affairs there,(3) give reason to suppose that it will be a Month or two longer before the Chiefs of the Nations will be in Readiness to assemble.

When we found the Southern obtained, we gave over trying Hazzards report upon the Pownalboro post, because one or two States declared they would oppose it. But a new arrangment of the post-office must soon take place and perhaps by the time you return, we may make a more successful attempt.

 Sir, New York May 26. 1788 I have received your favour of the 18 & agreeably to your request transmit you herewith a list of the members now in Congress. It might have been expected that even the crooked wisdom of your Know ye men would before this have pointed out to them the necessity of altering their conduct, not from a conviction of the iniquity of their past measures but with a view to secure their wicked gains. But it seems as if they were destined to be examples, and to warn the other states against the evils and mischiefs, of pure democracy. I hope the good people of your state will be awakened to a sense of their situation & the contempt to which they have exposed themselves by suffering themselves to be guided by unprincipled designing men. May 26, 1788  I am sorry for your losses. We have encountered together a severe storm. We have been surrounded with dark blackening clouds and have seen them dispelled and followed by a bright sky & clear sunshine. I confess it is enough to try the patience of Job to have passed safely the tempestuous Ocean and be in danger of drowning in a duck puddle. The sentiment you allude to in the close of your letter was not \""That it was a pity that the war had not continued longer\"" but that too speedy a termination of the war was not to be wished---;And that I was more afraid of peace than of a continuance(1) of the war. Sensible of our inexperience in the art of government and of the self sufficiency of those who would probably take the reins I dreaded the mischief that might flow from the wanton abuse of power and liberty too easily acquired. I confess we have escaped better than I expected. I am therefore encouraged to hope for a favorable issue and to conclude with \""forsan et hac olim enemissi juvabit.\""(2) ""

 Dr sir New York 26th May 1788 You recollect that the general Assembly of our State during their last session passed a Law repealing all such other Laws as were inconsistent with the Treaty of Peace.(1) The Secretary of Congress informs me that no such Act has been forwarded to Congress and it is much desired, will you be so good as send me by Post a printed Copy of that Law or an attested manuscript as you may think best. The general Assembly also, near the End of the Session, instructed the Delegates in Congress to move certain Propositions respecting the Navigation of the Mississippi. I shall be obliged to your Excellency for a Copy of that vote & of the Resolutions.(2) It may happen that Mr White has received one and the other of the Papers above reff[e]rred to, but he has not communicated them and is gone hardly to be expected here for some Months.

 Sir, New York May 27th. 1788 We received the letter of Mr. Secretary Avery of the 3d Ultimo with the resolution of the General Court inclosed, directing us to procure a copy of the plan agreeably to the feild book of the late Commissioners appointed to run the line between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York, East of Hudson's river. We have employed a person to make a copy of that plan,(1) who will probably have it done in a few weeks, which, when ready, we shall forward to the Secretary, as directed. Congress have directed the two Cannon belonging to Massachusetts to be returned to the State, agreeable to Your Excellency's request; and for the reasons mentioned in the Act of Congress,(2) which the Secretary will transmit, have ordered an inscription to be engraved on them, which we hope will be a pleasing circumstance to the State. We also do ourselves the honor to give Your Excellency and the Legislature such general information touching the affairs of the union, as we think may be useful and expected from the Delegates of the State. The principal objects, not of a secret nature, that require the attention of Congress of late, are, the Federal Territories, Indian Affairs, the unsettled Accounts of the late war, and the means of discharging the current demands upon the Union. An inconsiderable part of the year, in our opinion, would be sufficient for attending to these objects, could the States be induced regularly and seasonably to attend in Congress. As to the Government of the Federal Territories, we need only observe, that the officers are appointed, and measures adopted, for carrying into effect the system established by Congress, by their ordinance of the 13th of July last---;so that there is now, in those Territories a Government properly organised and in operation. We flatter ourselves that the valuable and extensive tracts of federal lands, of which Congress have the disposal, may, with care and attention, be made a certain source for sinking a large partof the domestic debt of the Union. Terms for the disposal of about nine millions of acres have been agreed upon, and the average price has been rather more than two thirds of a dollar an acre in public securities. Other Companies have made application for purchasing about three mil- May 27, 1788  lions of acres more. From a general veiw of the terms agreed upon, and also of the terms offered, there is reason to believe that most of the lands between the Ohio and the completion of the forty first degree of North Latitude, will sell for half a dollar an acre in securities paid down at the time of sale. As Companies appear to purchase those lands in large tracts, and agree to locate the tracts internally according to the directions of the land ordinance, passed May 20th, 1785, the reasons, for surveying in townships those lands at the public expence have, in a great measure, ceased, and accordingly the surveys have ceased for the present. In the Federal Territories, as is often the case, many claims are set up by individuals under Indian deeds, &c. to these pretended claims, as well as to punctual payments for lands sold, we hope Congress will pay proper attention---;convinced as we are, that nothing but a regular system of measures Steadily adhered to for a number of years can produce all the good effects, that may be reasonably expected from this extensive property in the hands of the union.(3) It has been a question, with the Eastern Delegates especially, whether peopling those new regions with emigrants from the old States, may not, in one point of veiw, be a disadvantage to them. But it has been found, that those new lands are very inviting to settlers, and that, if not regularly disposed of and governed by the union, they will in a very few years, probably, be seised upon and settled in an irregular manner, and perhaps at no less expence of Inhabitants to the old States. Considering these circumstances, the advantages of regular settlements, of lessening the public debt and military expences on the frontiers, and of keeping, by such settlements, that Country more effectually connected with the union, Congress have been induced to adopt measures to establish government, &c. there. Provision has been made for holding treaties, in the ensuing Summer, with the Westernand Southern Indians, to quiet their discontents. It does not appear that the Indians, in general, on the frontiers are hostilely disposed towards the United States; but such is the temper of Indians and the character of many of the frontier people, so extensive are the frontier Countries, and uncertain the titles to tracts of lands about which disputes arise, that discontents and depredations generally exist at some place or other, between those people and the Indians---;From which Causes, if not constantly attended to and their effects guarded against, expensive and troublesome wars would result. Hence the United States unavoidably incur every year a considerable expence in the Indian department; tho triffling for several years together, compared with what would be the expence of a combined Indian war for one season. It is Judged to be the true policy of the United States to treat the Indians with Justice and equity; to promote peace   with them, and by a fair free trade between them and our Citizens to make, as far as it can be done, compensation for the expences of the Indian Department. The Unsettled Accounts of the late war are a subject of importance, and particularly at this time, as a change in the forms of the Government will, probably, soon take place, when the attention of the Union will necessarily be drawn to other objects. We need not notice the measures that were adopted in the last and preceeding years relative to this subject. It is probable that in less than a year from this time, the accounts of individuals (a few accepted) will be settled, and that several officers and expences in the Treasury Department will become unnecessary and cease. It is also probable, that, in the course of a few months, the five districts Commissioners appointed to collect the accounts of the respective States against the union, will finish their business. The Secretary of Congress will officially transmit to your Excellency, the Act of Congress of the 22d instant, relative to this subject(4)---;by this it will appear that Congress, after having often, by their Acts and Officers, called on persons entrusted with public monies to settle their accounts, have directed decisive measures to be pursued. It is, perhaps, proper for us to observe, that the persons whom this act respects are not numerous; but a few men, principally in the middle States, who early in the war received very large sums of public monies, and who have very unreasonably delayed to render their accounts. It is not expected that very large sums on settlement will be found due from these persons, tho sums too considerable to be lost or neglected by the union. Congress deem it essential that men, however distinguished, entrusted with the public property should always be brought, punctually, to render and settle their accounts; not only to do Justice to the public in the particular Cases; but also to evince that there is always a determination in the Governmentthat no Accounts shall remain unsettled, and thereby to provide the most effectual security against a fraudulent line of conduct which men, so entrusted, might otherwise be tempted to pursue. It is with great difficulty monies are obtained by Congress for discharging the current expences of the union. There is no prospect, at present, of any monies to be remitted to Europe---;and as there are some measures before Congress respecting our loans in Holland not yet acted upon, we forbear to make any observations on that subject at this time. Your Excellency by the papers furnished from time to time, by the board of Treasury, will particularly see the extent of the annual demands upon the union, and the amount of the reciepts at the Federal Treasury. We only observe that for the year 1787 276,141 Dollars(5) only were received there exclusive of Indents and the monies last year  loaned. Should the New Constitution be put into operation, as soon as it can be reasonably expected, good Judges seem to be of opinion that no considerable sums of money can be collected under it, 'till we shall get far into the year 1790. In this situation of things, we cannot think the states will Judge it proper wholly to omit payments into the federal Treasury in the mean time, and suffer the demands upon the union to accumulate as they must---;or the present Government to cease until another shall be adopted. The State of Virginia and the District of Kentucky have applied to Congress for the Admission of that District into the union as an independant State. This subject involves in it several considerations, and particularly this, whether the admission of Kentucky into the Union ought not to be contemplated, at least for the present, in connexion with the admission of Vermont. It does not clearly appear that Congress have the power under the Confederation to consent to the division of a state, and to the admission of a part of it, as an independant state, into the Confederacy. We doubt whether it is expedient at this time to decide on a Subject of this nature, or whether the admission of a State would be of any avail to it. But situated as these two districts are we think it advisable, that no discouragements to their admission into the Union, as independent States, hereafter, ought to be hove in the way. We think it proper thus briefly to State this subject to your Excellency, and our sentiments relative to it, and to observe, that it is our opinion at present, that we ought to Act in conformity to them, unless otherwise instructed by the legislature. With Sentiments of the highest esteem & respect, We are Your Excellency's Most humble Servants, N. Dane Sam. A. Otis ""

 Dear Sir New York 27 May 1788 I congratulate you & my Town upon the appointment of a very respectable seat,(1) at the head of which you have so often met the approbation of your fellow citizens & contributed important services. I conjecture you will have a good house, because the same electors appoint the house who have chosen a good Senate. The rejection of Mr Warren at Milton, Mr Reed, and especially Mr Gorham, is very unaccountable;(2) I thot the latter had the fee simple of the Charlestown Seat. Mr Dane & myself have given an official account of our doings,(3) and which being directed to the Governour I hope it will give no offence, as one from Mr Thacher & myself did, by being inadvertently directed to the Legislature.(4) I take the opportunity to contradict an idle report that Congress are contemplating to sponge the debt of the Union---;Than which, nothing can be a more groundless surmise. So far from this we have it in view, and fortunately in our power, from the fidelity & address of Messrs Adams & Jefferson to borrow another million florins in Holland, which will provide for the interest of the Dutch Loan to 1790 inclusive, & pay the expences of foreign arrangments; I mean if we omit the installments of 1788, 1789 & 1790 of the principal falling due to the Dutch at those periods respectively, & the French interest & instalments wholly. This indeed is only giving a new note for the interest, but it is all we can do under present circumstances. For the domestic debt we are making all possible provision by the sale of Lands &c. Tis true no requisition for the year has been made. This has however been omitted from very different causes than any intention to anihilate the domestic debt; For as to the foreign, should this, or any other Congress be so weak or wicked as to attempt the wiping it off, by any indirect measures the injured party would stand justified to the world, should they make attachments upon the high seas, & sue out the mortage uponour Sea ports. In fact the reasons operating against the requisi May 27, 1788  tion this year were, The attention of the public was so fixed to the new System it seldom admitted of a full representation, When nine states have assembled other attention have unavoidably obtruded themselves. The ferment of the public mind also made any additional heat an object of great circumspection. Congress supposed if there was a disposition in the people to pay, there were old requisitions to exercise it upon; If there was no disposition, New requisitions, of which either no notice, or a resentful one, would probably be taken, appeared neither a measure of discretion, or honorary to Government. From Europe the rumour seems to be of war. The two Empires have attacked the Turks in force, & the European politicians are of opinion, unless the disciple of Mahomet gets some assistance he will be overwhelmed. It is however said upon pretty good authority, that Spain objects to the admission of the Russians into the Mediterranean; And in fact when England & France disarmed, Spain has kept fifteen Line Ships equipt; Some say to awe her American Subjects who grow refractory, Whilst others assert the keeping Russia from navigating in the Mediterranean is the real object, and that She is backed by France. In Holland the Statholder rides triumphant over the liberties of his Country. He has however done Congress the honor of a Letter since his exaltation. In France their affair are still embroiled. The Spirit of liberty seems to have awoke, and this makes odd work in a Monarchy. Their reforms are however an uphill business; It seems to be a contest of King & ministry against the financiers & property; Which will prevail requires no great penetration to predict. The Marquis de Fayette will probably share the fate of the Duke de Sully under Harry 4th, who with much superior abilities attempting to reform abuses, stired up such an hornetts nest, as had well-nigh stung both him & his master to death. Banishment & disgrace of the honest minister alone saved the King for a time;Who at the head of his army, whilst his financiers were rolling in wealth, & the superfluities of peculation, wrote his faithful Mentor, not indeed in the usual stile of Monarchs, \""For G---;---;ds sake Sully send me a clean Shirt & pair of boots being destitute of both.\"" The reformers it is said have rather encreased expence hitherto. They are however amongst other things about to discontinue the packetts to America upon principles of OEconomy. The late arret in favor of Commerce obtained by Mr Jefferson under countenance of Marquis de Fayette, is clamoured at by the chambers of commerce, & is refused registration by the Parliament, without which it is too precarious for any dependence.(5) It is confidently asserted that England, Holland & Prussia are determined upon an offensive & defensive. The Court of Berlin it is thot however will demur. The Prussians know it is for their interest to keep well with France; And their cool politicians view the late inter-  ference with the affairs of Holland a piece of Quicksotism [Quixotism?]; They wish however to have the sole controul of the affairs of Holland, and turn them as circumstances & interest may dictate for, or against France; Their connexion with England may make them less manageable. There is a fishery establishing at Dunkirk & the undertakers perswade the French Government, they shall be able to effect great things, which will end in Smoke; Under the present impression they are discouraging our fisheries, in hope of building their own upon the ruin. But our friends say it is temporary, & not formidable.  In respect to England it is supposed sooner or later a commercial treaty will be effected. Interest the great pole Star of men & of nations dictate it; Interest which supersedes personal animosity, & converts national hatred into amity, points it out; And whatever may now be the present feelings of both nations, hereafter, they will be connected by this powerful bond of union. In the mean time our European friends, official & others, enjoin it upon us to be prepared for events, But to observe a sacred nutrality in regard to the European bickerings. For indeed on the other side of the Atlantic, the \""dogs of war are let loose,\"" & the fire burning in the North, will probable kindle a general flame; England & France stand a tipto & a casual spark may excite an universal blaze. Indiscreet therfore is it for our printers to lard their papers with national reflections. Is it for the interest or honor of a young Merchant wishing to drive an advantageous bargain with an old established House to be perpetually bullying them? We are the youngest nation on earth, & being admitted into company with our elders, modest firmness & defference to those before us in age & experience, will give dignity & importance, Whilst a contrary conduct, will be as derogatory from national honor, as the airs of a Coxcomb are, from the demeanour of an accomplished Gentleman.Equally unfortunate are any publications criminating & reflecting upon sister states. Union is our only hope. This bond once broken, & the tragedies of antient Greece & more modern Italy will be acted over, in our now happy Country. Every man & every State have their peculiar views, prejudices, & partialities, And perhaps overrating their own importance, & consequently feel too quick, But this should rather inculcate circumspection; And altho in our public assemblies strictures upon sister states may unavoidably take place, it answers no good purpose to hold them up in our papers, & blazon family faults to the world. We are in daily expectation of addition of such as shall be politically saved to the fOEderal list; Hot spirits however fume in opposition; And much exertion, patience & discretion are necessary. Doubtless the opposition of Verginia, New York, & N Hamshire will adopt a uniform System. I cannot see reason to expect an absolute negative from any quarter but R Island. Probably in the three first named States an attempt will be made at adjournment without day. If they fail in this, al- May 28, 1788  terations will be the next object, annexed as Massachusetts did. At present I suppose five in eight of the NY convention are in the opposition. Clinton and some others have done infinite mischief in this business; for which the Citizens of this state owe them no thanks. For good pollicy would probably have fixed this the seat of Government, from the residence of which in its present State they derive an annual advantage of 200,000 Dolls, And which would increase with our numbers & our National importance. But C is a mercenary man with daring qualities, that willcarry him thro everything in pursuit of his own interest & aggrandizement. I think however this State dare not stand alone against N Engld towards which upon all occasions they look with an exploring circumspect eye. Thus Sir I have detailed to you everything within my observation worthy your notice. Your discretion will communicate only in Confidence, Your candour excuse the trouble, And presenting myself very respectfully to my numerous friends I remain, With esteem & Regard, Your most huml Sert, Sam. A. Otis ""

 My dear Sir, New York May 28. 1788 I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors from Orange & am much obliged to you for them.(1) Mr. Brown informs me that he has sent you full statements of the Foreign & domestic debts(2) ---;should you find any additional papers useful, be good enough to inform me, and they shall be immediately forwarded. I can however now add to what you have received, some intelligence upon the subject of our debts. You are acquainted with the steps taken by Mr. Adams last year, for negotiating a loan of 1 Million of Guilders---;this loan has not been filled up---;about two thirds of the  May 28, 1788  Bonds deposited by him with our bankers to be negotiated, have remained undisposed of, owing to the dubious state of our politics---;the inefficiency of our old Government is too well known in Holland to induce the confidence of Money lenders, and doubts whether the new Constitution will be adopted have prevented their taking that as a ground, on which to depend upon our honesty. As the June interest was becoming due, and as our bankers were also pressed for other indispensible demands, they lately set about some new efforts to get the loan filled---;at last they had an Offer from one broker only, but it was of a Nature rather insulting than otherwise---; having in his possession a Sum of our domestic securities he offered to fill up the loan, provided he should be allowed to retain one years Interest upon those securities. This would have amounted to upwards of one fourth of the sum loaned---;in this embarrassment the Bankers addressed themselves to Mr. Jefferson who has gone to Holland to see what can be done. From Amsterdam he has communicated this proposition to Congress, & in the mean time is endeavouring to get the loan compleated upon other terms.(3) In France we are undergoing also severe strictures amongst those to whom we owe money. In the inclosed papers you will receive the late British Act of Parliament upon the subject of our Trade with the different Territories of that Nation.(4) You see that this Court are presuming much upon our remaining in our imbecile State, having confirmed in a formal Act, what they at first tried in only temporary regulations, for oppressing us. In the debates of the House of Commons Notice was taken of the proposed reform in our Government, which might render this an imprudent measure, but the promoters of it, supposed they had but little to apprehend. I trust we shall soon have it in our power to teach this haughty Nation which is the most dependant in an advantageous intercourse---;her West India Islands cannot prosper without us. We can do very wellwithout any thing from thence. The Gentlemen who are attending here from N. Hampshire, assure me that there will be no doubt of an adoption of the Constitution upon the re-assembling of the Convention, as several of the Towns whose members were formerly instructed to vote in the Negative, have given up their opposition. I cannot learn that any act has taken place declaratory of such a change of sentiment, yet the supposition that it is the case, is presumable, because the persistence of the opposition in that State, must depend on its re-animation in Massachusetts, and of this there is not even a faint prospect. The acquiescence of the Minority there is fully confirmed in the late elections---;upwards of two thirds of the Senators returned are declared freinds of the Constitution of which discription are generally those who represent the parts of the State where the opposition was the most obstinate. I shall do myself the pleasure to write you by the next post and shall   constantly do so during your session, you will much oblige me by the earliest information of the symptoms discoverable in the convention respecting the important object of your Meeting.

 My dear Gen. New York 30th May 1788. Your letter of the 29th of April(1) was long on its way, as it did not reach me 'till the 24th Instant. That I have been very delinquent in not writing to you oftener I admit, but that this delinquency has ever arisen from want of remembrance, affection or respect, I entirely deny. The truth is that it has proceeded from a doubt or a difficulty of conveyance, from the interferences of business & sometimes perhaps (of which I should be & am heartily asham'd) from an indolence which I got from nature & which neither time nor the experience that follows it can entirely correct. 'Tis however the indolence of Mandeville's porter & can be thrown aside without any reluctance when the object is either to make a new friend, or preserve an old one. I have done as you bid me with respect to the note you enclos'd. Troup pretended not to have any recollection of the facts but admitted the hand:writing & paid the money---;or what was the same thing gave me an order upon Rivington for the amount in books. The registers came but to 12 Dollars & as you were silent as to the farther application of the money I have put it upon Rivington's honor, science & Taste to vest the remaining 28 in the newest & most approv'd things that his shop affords, & he promises to discharge the commission like a gentleman & friend---;not like a printer & bookseller. The other note you mention to have been presented by Coll. Lewis neither he nor Troup have any recollection of. As to the conveyance you suggest for the books, I have my doubts. These arise from the frequent losses sustain'd by stage carriage & some of which I have myself suffer'd. Could I find any person going to Baltimore in whom I could confide, they should be sent instantly---;but none such presents himself at this moment---;& I have only to choose between committing them to certain risque, or waiting a few days for such an opportunity as I can approve. I prefer, & I hope you will, thedelay & the certainty, to the expedition & the risque. There's no part of my conduct on which I would not wish your approbation & I have yet no reason to think the resignation of my judicial appointment an improper step.(2) On the contrary I think with you it was right & that a little in society is much more desireable than a great deal in a desart. The career however which the new Goverment opens I'm far from thinking flattering to men of any Age or character---;for tho' a friend & advocate of the System (as a Step towards common sense & practicable Goverment) yet it falls so far short of  May 30, 1788  what I know to be the situation & believe to be the character of this Country---;that I despair at once of both the stability & convenience of the oedifice. The fact is my dear Gen. that my creed as to popular Goverments is very much chang'd under a little experience of their operation & I suspect that shape them as you will you must find them on experiment both foolish & feeble. The philosophy that teaches the equality of mankind & the dignity of human nature is founded in vanity & addressed to it alone---;And in my opinion tho' there be less consolation there is infinitely more truth in the opposite doctrine, that the many were made for the few, & that we are better govern'd by rods than by reason. These ideas I wish you to consider however as meerly speculative & such as I would express only to a tried & bosom friend; they convey my fears, not my wishes---;& will ever be more a matter of opinion than a rule of conduct. What particular part I'm destin'd to play in this new drama I know not? My standing at present, considering my age, & that I have been oblig'd to make my way thro' very narrow & hostile politics---;is as forward as I had any right to expect, & more so perhaps, when I consider how many with better pretensions, because with more collateral supports---;I have left behind me. This consideration will not however induce me to push myself forward for other or greater distinctions. I will neither conceal myself from View, nor obtrude myself upon it---;& then if appointments come, they will sit easy. My friends in Pennsylvania have I hear already tho't of a place for me, & mean to try their force in sending me to the new Senate---;but as they will have but two seats of that kind fo fill, I need hardly say that they will be seats of much competition. The rich & the ag'd (as the natural representatives of property & wisdom, & the true counter ballance to the cormorants of the lower house), will expect, & mostprobably get them---;& indeed so little am I set upon success in the trial, that I scarcely feel a wish to cross them. My leading wish is to see them well fill'd. Another word or two concerning myself & on another subject---;one on which most young men choose to display their wit at the expence of their judgment---;I mean marriage. The report you alude to is unfounded. I'm not yet married, nor likely to be so.(3) The truth is that I'm too poor to marry a woman without some fortune & too proud to marry any woman, that I know, who possesses one. In this dilemma, 'till my circumstances change, or other objects present themselves, I must ee'r keep along in the cheerless solitary road I am in. Thus much for myself---;but you will forgive an impertinince you have drawn upon yourself. Coll. Smith return'd hither from St. James's a day or two ago.(4) He brings with him a wife & child---;the whole profit of his legation. He has parted with some of his characteristical buckram, that is, his external manner is more easy than it was---;but I fear he has exchang'd it   for a coxcombry of a worse kind---;that of the Mind. He is now a very profound politician, & indeed so much so that he is often quite unintelligible. This I regret for I think well of his honor & principles. His Wife, who is a daughter of Mr. J. Adams, is the negative being described in Mrs. Shandy. The Baron passed the winter at the same lodging house with me.(5) To this he has come at last. The tower is now dismantled & deserted, & he is once more upon the Justice or generosity of the public.

 Dear sir, New York May 30th 1788 I have made the necessary Enquiries to enable me to answer Some of the Questions in your Letter of the 24 Inst.(1) I find by the public Registers that the Number of Male Negro slaves in this state amounts to 9,521 & of females to 9,368, in which Statement is comprehended the Mulattoes of both Sexes. In the Census that fixed the Citizens of this state to 238,000, those of Vermont are not included. I have not been fortunate enough to procure the exact Boundaries of this latter State. They are I imagine rather arbitrary, as not being determined by any Authority, which New York acknowledges competent to decide. There are Some good Harbors in the Port of New York---;but I do not know the particular Spot, to which you allude. I inclose you a Pamphlet, which has considerable Merit, & has operated very forcibly on the Minds of the People here. The returns of the Delegates to the New York Convention have not as yet been forwarded to the City---;but it is expected that the antifOEderalists will have a Majority of 10 to 15---;the Number is 65---; but as yet, it is all Conjecture.

 My dear Sir, New York May 31. 1788 I had the pleasure to inclose you by the last post the British Act of Parliament upon the subject of our Trade.(1) You will now receive in one of the papers inclosed an ordinance of the Province of Quebec,  May 31, 1788  for regulating the inland Commerce of that Province with the Neighbouring States, or in other words the U.S.(2) The intention doubtless is, that these two Acts, shall co- operate to give that Nation the use of our commodities, and at the same time the exclusive benefits of carrying them; and that of Quebec leads to another object, more remote, but if compassable, would be still more mischievous to us, the allurement of the Commerce, and with it, the Affections of our Western Inhabitants by means of the Lakes and the River St Lawrence, to that quarter. As to our Commercial intercourse with the West Indies, I have not a doubt that Great Britain may be made the dependent party, and therefore a wise policy on our part, supported by an energetic government, would give us the Controul of the Terms of intercourse. As to the other object, I hope that the influence of a better government than we have hitherto had; the improvement & extension of our inland Navigation, and the Free use of the Mississippi, added to the difficulties which from Climate attend that of the St Lawrence, will all Conspire to prevent its being effected.

 Sir, New York May 31, 1788 The Delegation having revived the former mode of Corresponding with your Excellency weekly, in Monthly rotation each, I have the Honor now to inclose an Act of the British Parliament, permanently establishing, with still additional impositions, the regulations which have for several years been exercised by order of the King, & Council upon the commercial intercourse of the United States with the Territories of that Kingdom; Also a paper containing an Ordinance of the province of Quebec to regulate the inland Commerce of that Province with the Neighbouring States, or in other Words, the United States.(1) It may easily be perceived that these two Acts are intended to Co-operate in giving to that Nation the use of our products, while she shall also secure to herself the exclusive benefits of carrying them, for in case of our adopting a policy so uniform and effectual, as to exclude her Bottoms from our ports, an easy and free passage is opened  May 31, 1788  for all such of our Commodities as are wanted for her West India Islands, and for Naval Stores, to Quebec. There may still be another, though more remote object, the Allurement of the Commerce, and with that, the Affections of our Western Inhabitants by means of the Lakes and the River St. Lawrence, to her purposes. But at the same time that we may be sensible how much we are exposed, in various quarters, to the insiduous policy of this Nation, her solicitude is also discoverable for the acquisition of our Commodities, which evinces the vanity of the boasted competency of Canada & Nova Scotia, to the furnishing of her several demands. The truth is, the West India Islands are dependent for provisions, lumber, and many other things upon importations, and these articles are attainable from the United States on much lower terms than from any more distant Country: Naval Stores are also furnished by these States on such terms that it is an object with Great Britain to import them from us, not only for the West India Trading vessels, but also for her European Service. On the other hand what we derive from an intercourse with the West India Islands, are at best, but Articles of Luxury, nor is the production of them confined to the Territories of Great Britain; as to Naval Stores they are our own. Thus viewing the Matter, she is evidently the dependent party, and under a wise policy, supported by an energetic Government, might be made to accept, instead of presuming to prescribe, the Terms of Commercial intercourse. As to the other object, I hope that the benefits of a better Government than we have hitherto had, the improvement & extension of our inland Navigation, & the free use of the Mississippi, added to the difficulties which from climate attend that of the River St. Lawrence will all Conspire to prevent its being in any degree effected.

 Dear sir New York June 2nd 1788 By the Time this comes to Hand you will be pretty well engaged in discussing the new Constitution & attempting to convince men who came forward with the Resolution not to be convinced. Of all the wrong heads who have started in opposition none have been mentioned who appear to be so palpably wrong as the People of Kentucke. It is said that some antifed in Maryland on the last Winter fastened on the Ear of Genl Wilkinson who was accidentally there and persuaded him that in case of a new Govt. the Navigation of the Mississippi would infallibly be given up. Your Recollection must certainly enable you to say that there is a Proviso in the new Sistem which was inserted for the express purpose of preventing a majority of the Senate or of the States which is considered as the same thing from giving up the Mississippi. It is provided that two thirds of the Members present in the senate shall be required to concur in making Treaties and if the southern states attend to their Duty, this will imply of the States in the Union together with the President, a security rather better than the present 9 States especially as Vermont & the Province of Main may be added to  June 2, 1778  the Eastern Interest and you may recollect that when a Member, Mr Willson objected to this Proviso, saying that in all Govts. the Majority should govern, it was replyed that the Navigation of the Mississippi after what had already happened in Congress was not to be risqued in the Hands of a meer Majority and the Objection was withdrawn.(1) Certainly those gentlemen know that the River is at present shut not by right but by the Hand of Power and that under the existing Govt we are never like to be able to open it. It is true that we may readiry [sic] reduce the spanish Settlements on the Mississippi but that would not secure us any Exports; for a single Spanish Frigate would take every Vessel that we attempted to send out with Produce. And any Nation sending Vessels to take our Produce would expose such Vessels to Capture. On the Contrary under an efficient Govt. when we shall certainly have some Ships of War Spain will find herself under the Necessity of suffering our Produce to be exported. For myself I conceive that my opinions are not biassed by private Interest, but having claims to a considerable Quantity of Land in the Western Country I am fully persuaded that the Value of those Lands must be increased by an efficient federal Govt. It is clear that the Kentucke Gentlemen must have viewed this Subject in a difft Light, but I suspect that they have never fully examined the provision respecting Treaties.

 Dear Sir New York June 2d. 1788. I had the satisfaction of receiving your favor of the fifteenth of May. I can assure you that it gives me particular pleasure to receive fresh tokens of your friendship & such communications as may serve to revive the remembrance of our former intimacy. At this time I am rather more in a hurry than is common, & therefore shall give you but an imperfect letter which I desire you will receive as a token of my esteem & respect.  I am exceeding glad to hear from you that the prospect of the new constitution being adopted is so favorable, & that any converts have been made to that side. I am fully perswaded that wise and honest men if they knew the situation of our public affairs, would without hesitation agree with me. I have nothing which I am sensible of to byass [bias?] my mind in this matter but a hearty desire for the gen- June 2, 1788  eral good. We are in expectation every day of receiving an account from So. Carolina of their sati[s]fying the new plan, as we have information from their convention since met that there is a large majority in favor of it. Much depends now upon New Hampshire. Their example will have great weight, more than many are sensible of. If New Hampshire should come into the plan, which from the best accounts we rely upon, we have a good degree of probability that all the states will eventually unite. Our latest accounts from Europe are that our credit begins [to] revive there already, upon the presumption that our government will soon be upon a more respectable footing. We have now a pretty full Congress & expect soon to have all the states represented. We are at this time engagd in a matter of considerable consequence, that is, whether Kentucky which is the Western part of Virginia & which I think I gave you some account of heretofore, shall be erected into a distinct state. This will be an affair not easily settled. There are great difficulties on all sides. The commissioners who were appointd to judge how much the united states should pay Virginia for their expences in defending the western country during the war have reported half a million of dollars for us to pay.(1) This is no inconsiderable sum. Georgia have also made a cession to the united states of their western lands on condition of their being paid one hundred thousand dollars.(2) If we should have a few more such presents we should not know how to pay them. The expences of these purchases together with the expences of the Indian treaties & of surveying & disposing of those lands will create a very large debt. It is true the country is immensely large, is an excellent soil, & capable of supporting a vast number of inhabitants, but I think they will draw off our most valuable and enterprising young men & will impede the population of our old states & prevent the establishment of manufactures. Upon the whole I doubtwhether in our day that country will not be a damage to us rather than an advantage. We seem to be overstocked with lands & I believe it had been as well for the Indians to have kept their own territory.  For what news we have I must refer you to the papers enclosed. Should be obliged to you to give that which contains some account of bees to my wife with the letter to her directed. I hope you smoke your pipe with her sometimes. I am as well contented here as I expected, & enjoy good health. I am yet among strangers & should be more in my own element at home. I shall be glad to have any intelligence from you which you shall think fit to write. I have written to Capt. Jona Wiggin as you proprosed, & hope it may have some effect. You will excuse my cursory writing---;If you are able to read it & can derive any satisfaction from it my end is answered.

You may have been taught said he to respect the Characters of the Members of the late Convention. You may have supposed that they were an assemblage of great Men. There is nothing less true. From the Eastern States there were Knaves and Fools from the states southward of Virga. They were a parcel of Coxcombs and from the middle States Office Hunters not a few. Col. Graysons Trope of Rhetoric was more to the feelings of Virginians. He harangued the People at the Court House having in his Hand a snuff Box hardly so broad as a Moidore. The Point of finger and Thumb are inserted with difficulty. Perhaps said he you may think it of Consequence that some other States have accepted of the new Constitution, what are they? When compared to Virginia they are no more than this snuff Box is to the Size of a Man. On being asked afterwards by an intimate, why he had risqued such an assertion. There was not any short-Handman present said he. The Convention in this State meets on the 17th Inst. as does that of N Hampshire.

As he informed me that he could not pass them I requested you to take them back & satisfy him to the Amount; this I presumed had been done untill a few days ago when I reced. a letter from Mr John Smith informing that Capt Craddock had sent them in with him with directions to draw the Money at Richmond & pay it to Crocketts Order, but he further informs that he cannot get Cash for them from the Treasury & requests to know what he shall do with them. I have written to him to apply to you about them & if he cannot meet with you to dispose of them to the best advantage & apply the money to Crocketts Order. I wish you to take such steps in this Business as will enable him to make payment to Colo Crockett who has been kept out of his money much longer than could have wished. We are all waiting with the utmost anxiety & impatience to hear the fate of the new Constitution in Virginia, the final adoption or rejection of it in a great measure depends upon the determination of her Convention of which I have heard with pleasure that you are a Member. I have heard that the Delegates from Kentucky are all in the Opposition. I am at a loss to account for the general disaffection of that District to a System of Government upon which in my opinion the peace & Glory of the United States depend. I have carefully examined the proposed plan as it may affect the District in particular & must candidly assure that I have not been able to discover that it contains principles partially injurious to the Interest of Kentucky. We have nothing to fear respecting the Navigation of the Mississipi a total change of Policy with respect to that Subject has taken place not only in Congress but throughout the Eastern States. Our political System is in a wretched situation wholely inadequate to the purposes of Government. A change must take place & in my Opinion we cannot under our present Circumstances obtain a better than the plan proposed. Congresshave determind that Kentucky ought to be admitted in to the Union & have referrd it to a Committee consisting of a Member from each State to examine whether by the Articles of Confederation power is delegated to Congress for that purpose, if not to frame an Additional Article vesting in them the Necessary power to be submitted to the different States for their ratification.(2) I expect this will be the result & that we shall not be admitted at the present time. I shall be able to inform you with more certainty in a few days as the Committee are to meet tomorrow. Pray write to me by every post & inform me fully the News of Kentucky.

Accounts from Virginia are rather favorable but among the delegates to the Convention of New York, I have no doubt, there is a large majority against the question. Notwithstanding the Convention of Virginia is now in session I hope New Hampshire will have the honor of being the ninth State in accession to the system and I beg leave to suggest that it is considered a matter of great importance that we have an account of the ratification here before the Convention of this State come to a decision as they will be influenced more by our proceedings than by the doings of Virginia.

 Dear Sir New York 6th June 1788 After my congratulations upon the respectable elections of the present year, Give me leave to add them upon the favorable appearances from the South. Verginia is now in Convention, And must be influenced by the unanimity of Maryland, and the more recent accession of So. Carolina by a majority of two to one. The Gentlemen here, most acquainted with the affairs of Verginia, entertain the strongest hopes, but so great is the object, not without a degree of anxiety for the event. North Carolina looks well at present, and will certainly join the list unless Verginia should be so unfortunate as to stand out, In which case N Carolina may wavor. June 6, 1788  In NY the opposition is powerful, but I think they will play the politician, procrastinate until the determination of Verginia & N Hamshire is known. If they assent Join them. Congress have been so closely pressed with an application from Kentucky that the question cannot be parryed much longer. It is of great importance to the E states to bring Vermont forward; But this cannot be done without the agency of that State, Which for reasons of which I am not apprised is quite passive. No objection could operate against these measures if they went hand in hand; And really the arguments in favor of Kentucky are powerful. They have near one hundred thousand inhabitants at the immense distance of 800 miles from the seat of Government. They are courted by other powers to reject their allegiance to the USA. Their darling hope of opening the Missisippi is cherished by those who wish ill to the Union. And Verginia are, however extraordinary it may appear, not only willing but sanguine for the measure. The other business of Congress is detailed to the Legislature in our official letter directed to the Governour.(1) And some few matters not proper for a public communication are made to confidential friends in the hands of my old & tried friend Mr Davis;(2) To whom, and to the numerous list in both Houses that I have the felicity of puting in the same class, you will present me very respectfully.

It gives me no small concern to find that the People of Kentucky are not to expect your Assistance in the important Business of framing a Constitution which they have so shortly in View.(2) At the time I took the liberty to trouble you with the request I was well aware of the multiplicity of your engagements, but flattered myself that from your fa- June 7, 1788  Portrait of John Brown  miliarity with the Subject of Government a few leisure hours would have enabled you to have drawn at least the outlines of a Plan which must have greatly facillitated the execution of their undertaking & might have been effectual in preventing those fundamental errors which from want of experience & proper attention to the Subject there is but too much reason to apprehend will take place in any System they may form. Perhaps this may still be in your power as their Convention is not to meet before the last week in July. The President informs me that he has sent you a Copy of a Resolution which Congress passed relative to the Seperation of Kentucky.(3) This contains all that has been done upon that Subject & I fear all that will be done. From the Hudson eastwardly all the members are opposed to do any thing further in this Business than to frame an Ordinance for the admission of Kentucky to be refered to the different States & ratified by them individually or to obtain from the States the ratification of an Additional Article to the Confederation vesting powers in Congress for that purpose. Either of these plans virtually amounts to a denyal of the present Application as the Compact between Vrga. & the District becomes void if not ratifyed by Congress before the 4th of July. Colo Hamilton heads the Opposition from the apprehension that a compliance might embarrass the New Constitution---;he is supported by all the eastern States least it might add to the Southern Interest. I suppose Kentucky will assume her independence as it cannot be expected that she will continue in her present situation untill she can be admitted under the New Government & I am inclined to believe that no application under the present will be successfull. When thus forced into unconstitutional measures 'tis difficult to say how far they may proceed. I fear the contracted policy of the present Congress will be productive of Consequences ruinous to the tranquility of that promising Country; or to the importance& dignity of the United States; & perhaps to both. My disappointment in this Business has in a great measure prevented those exertions which I intended to remove the Objections of the Delegates from that Country to the New Constitution. Any Arguments which I could with propriety urge presuppose their admission into the Union---;this at present will not be granted & all the letters I have recd. from the District hold out the Idea that they are determined not to make a second application. I have in general terms written to some of them that it is decidedly my opinion that there is not any thing to be apprehended relative to the Navigation of the Mississipi & that they ought to adopt the plan proposed. Indeed my mind is & for some time has been so irritated that I have avoided writing to my friends from the District now at Richmond my expectations respecting their independence least I might drop something which might have a similar effect upon them. I hope you have a decided majority without them & that the ninth Pillar may be raised in Virga. I am in haste, Sir, With esteem, Yo Mo Hble Servt., J Brown  ""

 Dear Sir(1) New York. June 7. 1788 I recieved your friend[l]y letter of 22d Ulto. The causes you ask for not writing sooner in answer to my letter are unnecessary---;tho I should be glad to hear from you every week and wish you to write to me as often as times and circumstances will permit; yet it is my wish to place all my correspondences with my freinds on a footing unembarrassed with forms, ceremonies and needless punctualities---; whenever any thing material shall occur I Shall communicate it to you with pleasure and satisfaction. At present I have the pleasure to convey to you the information respecting the adoption of the Constitution in South Carolina, contained in the enclosed Newspaper. The Number in favor of the adoption was 149---;against 73---;majority 76. You will perceive that State has in some measure adopted Massachusetts ideas about some future alterations, and well as Maryland has copied after Massachusetts in the mode of expressing her satisfaction and Joy on the occasion. As to the other States North Carolina & Virginia I can add nothing with certainty---;however the probability is in favor of their adopting the Constitution. I do not know what this State will do---;their elections for the Convention have gone rather more than two to one against it. However I am not fully convinced that the opposition will insist upon making their amendments conditions to the adoption, or to precede it rather than to accompany it as amendments recommended. We have eleven States now in Congress and in a few days shall, probably, have thirteen---;eight States have made returns of their acts ratifying the Constitution---;in the course of this month it is likely nine will have made returns, when the subject of putting the new system into operation will be taken up in Congress. I am very uncertain when Congress will direct the new Government to meet---;if this state shall not adopt it---;it will not I suppose meet here. I shall be very unwilling to have it assemble in Philadelphia---;for if it should,I doubt whether it will ever be able to move from that place---;and I think it a very improper place for the permanent residence of the federal Government. I think with you that our public affairs are taking a favourable turn---;the revolution popular harrangues made to effect it, and various circumstances have thrown us into the extremes of disorder on the popular side. We have experienced the evils of a Government popular in its  June 7, 1788  principles and too popular, on many occasions at least in its administration. We are coming back and I have for sometime felt anxious that the political pendulum may stop in the proper medium, and in that point only will it rest and things be quiet, the laws Steady, property secured and industry encouraged. There is I see a very good Senate for the present year in Massa. and I think a majority of the house are the right kind of men---;but on examining the list I think there is a very large number some of whom have no opinions of their own and some of whom have opinions perhaps not very favourable to order & good government. The evils of the numerous prosecutions which have lately taken place in the State and of which you make mention I conceive may, without much difficulty, be Stop'd by the legislature, by properly renewing the State of limitation touching such prosecutions. I think the statutes of limitations in G. Britain and formerly in Massa. did not allow of such prosecutions after several years had elapsed. Every law ought to be attended to which will have a tendency to fix the people in the habits of peace, industry and friendship. We are not Spartans to live on black broth or to be pleased with perpetual tumults & wars. Nor are we a people whose Spirits are broken and disposed to submit to an arbitrary will. We are in the mean Stages of society, in which protection and obedience, property, law, and liberty are all to be respected. Please to give my respects to Mrs. Brown. I am very sorry to hear of her feeble state of health. Give my respects also to your partner Capt Thorndike & Mrs. Thorndike---;tell Capt Thorndike I hope he will attend the General Court. I expect to write to him in a few days concerning some affairs of the union that it will be necessary for our legislature to attend to this Session. Pray inform me how our new affairs, the bridge and manufactory succeed from time to time. I feel more interested the undertakings should succeed than for the small property Ihave in them. With sentiments of the highest este[em] & friendship, I am dr Sir, Your's N. Dane ""

 Sir(1) New York June 8. 1788 I a few days Since received a letter from Mr. Higginson in which he mentions that he has not received the Â£100 due to him from the Treasury on my draught. As I made the negociation with him expecting there would be no failure, I shall feel myself extremely obliged to you to make arrangements, to pay him, the first opportunity that you may have in your power---;so well acquainted, I am fully persuaded, you are with the affairs of the Treasury, that I need not mention how much the small credit it has must be effected by any failure in cases where such particular negociations are made.

I am by no means insensible of the difficulties you have to encounter in that office in the present barren State of the Treasury. I expect to be in Massa. sometime in July and to return to New York about the first of August. I shall want some monies from the Treasury for paying my expences there for the residue of the year. By the enclosed paper you will perceive that South Carolina has adopted the Constitution---;members for the adoption 149, against 73, majority 76. Virginia is now in Session. Tho nothing can be said with certainty as to her conduct yet the probability appears to be that she will adopt it.

 My Dear Sir [New York, June 8, 1788] In my last(1) I think I informed you that the elections had turned out, beyond expectation, favourable to the AntifOEderal party.(2) They have a majority of two thirds in the Convention and according to the best estimate I can form of about four sevenths in the community. The views of the leaders in this City are pretty well ascertained to be turned towards a long adjournment say till next spring or Summer. Their incautious ones observe that this will give an opportunity to the state to see how the government works and to act according to circumstances. My reasonings on the fact are to this effect. The leaders of the party hostile to the constitution are equally hostile to the Union. They are however afraid to reject the constitution at once because that step would bring matters to a crisis between this state and the states which had adopted the Constitution and between the parties in the state. A separation of the Southern district from the other part of the state it is perceived would become the object of the FOEderalists and of the two neighbouring states. They therefore resolve upon a long adjournment as the safest and most artful course to effect their final purpose. They suppose that when the Government gets into operation it will be obliged to take some steps in respect to revenue &c. which will furnish topics of declamation to its enemies in the several states and will strengthen the minorities. If any considerable discontent should show itself they will stand ready to head the opposition. If on the contrary the thing should go on smoothly and the sentiments of our own people should change they can then elect to come into the Union. They at all events take the chances of time and the chapter of accidents. How far their friends in the Country will go with them I am not able to say, but as they have always been found very obsequious we have little reason to calculate upon an uncompliant temper in the present instance. For my own part themore I can penetrate the views of the AntifOEderal party in this state, the more I dread the consequences of the non adoption of the Constitution by any of the other states, the more I fear an eventual disunion and civil war. God grant that Virginia may accede. Her example will have a vast influence on our politics. New Hampshire, all accounts give us to expect, will be an assenting state. The number of the volumes of the FOEderalist which you desired have been forwarded as well the se[c]ond as first, to the care of Governor Randolph. It was impossible to correct a certain error.(3) In a former letter I requested you to communicate to me by express the event of any decisive question in favour of the constitution authorising changes of horses &c with an assurance to the person sent that he will be liberally paid for his diligence.

 My dear Sir, New York June 9. 1788 I had the honor to write you by the last packet by Mr. Barlow and Master G. W. Greene,(1) since which South Carolina has acceded to the new Constitution by a great Majority. The inclosed papers contain the act, and some of the debates of the convention.(2) Virginia is now sitting, having met last Monday, but we have not yet received any intelligence as to the probable turn the business will take there. I am inclined to think the critical stage in which this convention meets the affair, will have much influence upon the opinions of many who sat out in the opposition. In adopting they will certainly avoid Commotion, and, at worst, accept a constitution upon which eight States have already agreed to hazard their happiness, and which may be amended, should it be found to operate badly; in rejecting they may produce commotion, with but little prospect of preventing the adoption. The five States who have not yet acceded, would never agree in their objects, and could even this be brought about, they must at last rather yeild to the 8, than these to the five; and it appears that the submission on either side must be intire, for should the 8 think of a compromise with the 5, there would be difficulty in agreing what points to yeild. These considerations will, I apprehend, have their effect in the convention of Virginia, & produce an issue different from that which might have taken place under other circumstances. I am happy to find that the five are so separated that there cannot be a possible effort, to Unite in an attempt to dismember the union. Had the southern States joined in opinion as to the constitution, I verily believe such a desperate step would have been tried, but it would have ended in their destruction, and perhaps that of all the others. Mr. Madison & myself have sent you sundry Pamphlets and pieces which have been written by the Friends of the constitution;(3) I have endeavoured to select from those which have been written on the other side, thatwhich is reputed the best, to send you now, that you may fairly judge of the arguments brought forward amongst us pro & Con. The two Books enclosed contain a number of letters under the signature of the Federal Farmer, but the Author is not known. These letters are reputed the best of any thing that has been written in the opposition.(4) June 9, 1788  I hope by the next opportunity to be able to send you the second volume of the Federalist.

 My dear friend(1) New York June 9. 1788. I have the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 27 of May. And having returned my acknowledgements to my wife for hers of the same date, I am at liberty to make some returns to you, for the great obligations you lay me under by your correspondence. I should think I had no enjoyments worth possessing, were it not for the pleasure I have of frequent communications with my friends by writing. You will judge then whether my heart is not as much at Stratham as some body's else you mention is at New York. I assure you I have not yet found any body or thing which engrosses my affections here. I shall prefer my wife to the Dutch lady & you have given me such a flattering account of her constancy & attachment to me even tho' long absent, that I do not feel at all mortifyed to hear that you are otherwise engaged. It give me the greatest satisfaction to hear that you enjoy so good health whether my letters are the means of contributing to it or not. I wish it may long continue & increase & that the increase of your hea[l]th may soon be accompanyed with a more valuable increase of another nature. If this should be the case you may depend on the raisins. As to your spirits, the vivacity of your letter sufficiently indicates them, without your particularly informing me. Whether the extacy of pleasure you discover at the time of writing, arose from the tho't of going to my house that afternoon, or from your having your tho't at New York just then, I cannot say, but if they should subside after such an excess I hope the receipt of this will revive them again. Most pleasures must be mutual in order to become pleasures & did I not hope that it would contribuate to yours by my writing it would give me but little satisfaction to do it. Mr. Adams tells me that you expect & should be very particular in answering your letters. This I am not apt to be. I have so many whims of my own to mention, that I have not room to repeat & reply to yours. Besides yourletters so abound with the most flattering complements, that it would savor of vanity in me to notice them. The French are remarkable for flattery & gallantry.  June 9, 1788  Whether you are related to that nation I cannot say. But you resemble them in one thing, you are fond of pleasing. By the way nobody is the worse for this, but as much better as they are more pleasing. And now I am speaking of pleasing it may be well eno' to pass to the subject of beauty. You wish to know whether Lady Christien (for that is the name of the Presidents lady) is as handsome as you are. I think she is much what. And I can add she resembles you in another [favor?], she is sociable & agreeable. I have given her character so particularly in some of my letters which probably you have seen, that it is needless to add any thing further. I am very glad to hear that you visit Polly. I hope that you will do it frequently & thereby increase her satisfaction in life. Mr. Adams observes that you are muster master general of the young females & I expect that your regiment will be considerably increased by young recruits by that time I shall return home. I must beg to be excused from your invitation to tea & hope you will not wait for me as I do not drink now any thing but the best hyson which your company I suppose do not afford. As you are so noted for telling the truth I cannot doubt of any thing you tell me & wish that the next time you shall write to me, you will inform me of all those hundred things which you have yet in your budget. I know it must be a burden to you to have any secrets not uncovered. I am much pleased [with?] the account you give of Mrs Weeks. She must be very happy & very pretty. I cannot tell when I shall write to you any more nonsense but believe I shall wait until I hear from you whether you wish for any more. Should be glad to know Who Betsey employs to write her letters for her. They are very pleasing to me. I expect that my wife will read & approve of this. I now must bid you adieu. Paine Wingate ""

 My dear Child, New York June 9. 1788. Your Aunt Wingate tells me in her last letter, that your mother & she were going to see you the next day for her fourth visit. This I know must be very agreeable to you & therefore it gives me pleasure to hear it. You shew your wisdom & good sense in liking your situation, and I have the satisfaction to believe that you will make a prudent, industrious & OEconomical wife. The fashionable pleasures & bustle of life are  June 9, 1788  but vanity. The greatest satisfaction is to be enjoyed with a few virtuous, sensible & intimate friends & companions, & from the peaceful approbation of ones own mind from a consciousness of discharging the duties of our particular station. You know that I wish your happiness & would not by my advice or influence deprive you of any. I think you have more consideration than most of your sex & therefore will not expect uninterrupted pleasures, but study contentment with your allotments. I do not mean that to be happy it is necessary to shut ones self out from the world. While you have your small circle of valuable & intimate acquaintance, the rest of the world you will treat with great civility, politeness & affab[il]ity, especially such as are your equals & with whom you have perhaps been once intimate. The good opinion of the world is worth having, if it is not purchased at too dear a rate. But this may be done by propriety of behaviour without making it our whole business & attention to please. I shall not now trouble you with any further lessons of instruction, nor do I think from my present feelings that I shall give you a long letter. The fashion at this time is for parents & children among those in high life to be as familiar as brothers & sisters, nay I think that the children are the most fancy, & do take greater liberties with their parents in every kind of language & behaviour than they would towards any body else. This I cannot be pleased with, tho' you know that I do not love to keep children at a distance. I have not yet heard how you exercise your motherly deportment, but hope it is with wisdom & moderation. I shall be glad at any time to receive a letter from you but would not have you give yourself any trouble to do it. If it should worry you to write & give you any uneasiness I had rather you would not do it. I can write two letters to you, easier than you can one to me. You may set your Aunt Wingate to write who hasalways nonsense enÃ´ in her head to fill a letter. I have enjoyed my health as yet very well but want my customary exercise. I have some intimate acquaintance who are very agreeable to me, but none among the ladies. They expect more ceremony & attention paid to them, than I am willing to take the trouble of. I have other business enÃ´ to employ my time about & feel very contented in my situation. Mrs. Elisabeth Blanchard lately wrote me a long letter chiefly upon politicks, but I could not very well enter into a new correspondence, & therefore returned her a short letter merely of friendship. Her husband expects soon to go and visit her & then to go to the West Indies. His circumstances will not admit of living with his family. How much better to live within the bounds of moderation and oeconomy than to be involved in such misfortune. We have now one Member of Congress who has the small pox very favorably(1) & there are some of the Inhabitants who continually have it in the city. I have reason to be glad that I had it formerly. I feel concerned about George & have wrote to Mr. Woodbridge & your mother   upon the subject. I should be very unwilling that he should leave the school at Exeter & loose the benefit of his instruction. And at the same time would not have him pressed with any burdens that could well be avoided. I wish that you would encourage George as much as you can & make it as agreeable to him as it may be. You are sensible that whatever would make him uneasy would necessarily make me so to know it. You may tell Sally that she may read any of my letters to you, or to her aunt Wingate when she pleases, & to her mother if she thinks proper. I suppose that you have the same liberty with your letters to them. Indeed there is nothing private or interesting in them, but they are wrote principly with a view of expressing my friendship and concern for you all, & some times for the sake of a little diversion. I was last Saturday at the Jewish Synagogue which was their Sabbath day. The service was all performed in hebrew, was very long, and chiefly read in a sort of singing voice. Only the men were allowed to be in the lower part of the house & the women sat in the gallery & went up, into it on the outside of the house. They were dressed very fashionably. I have likewise been at the Romish Church & to a German Church where I could not understand a word that was said. I have indeed been to most of the places of worship in the city in order to see their different customs. I believe I shall not think fit to change my religion for any of them. Let Mr. Wiggin know that I have not heard yet from Mother Fox any further. I wish your health & every desireable enjoyment you can have. Am your affectionate father, P. Wingate ""

 Dear Breckinridge New York June 21st 1788 I this day rec'd your favor of the 13th Instant & am not a little alarmed to hear that the New Constitution still rests upon uncertain & precarious ground. Untill this Post we were flatterd with accounts that there was a decided majority on the federal Side but the Accounts this day rec'd leave the Event in a very doubtful situation in our estimation as I find it is in yours. I have written some time since to Mr Allen & Mr Walton also to Mr Fowler(1) to whom I pointedly gave it as my Opinion that it ought to be adopted without hesitation as the only means left to prevent Anarchy & Confusion & to ensure safety & importance to the United States. I also inclosed a pamphlet written in this place in which the Banefull Consequences of a rejection were pointed in Just  June 21, 1788  & lively Colours(2)---;after this & the letters which I have written to the District I did [not] suppose that the Delegates from that Country could be at any loss with respect to my Sen[timents which] have been uniform upon that Subject since my arrival here. Before I left Richmond I view'd the plan as they do but my appointment has placed me in a Situation from whence I have been enabled to take a more extended view of American Politics & as I have frequently mention'd to you I have discover'd a total change so far as respects the Western Country especially with regard to the Mississipi. The Advocates for the proposed Treaty with Spain now plainly discover that the Cession of the Navigation of that River would not answer the end which formerly they had in View & many of them who were most disposed to sacrifice the Western Country are now by purchase of Lands & appointments to Offices become personally interested in supporting its natural Rights against arbitrary encroachments. I am well assured that a similar attempt will never be made even by the eastern States whose Interest will be most affected by the prosperity of that Country & most sincerely hope that the impression thereby made upon the Minds of our Western Members in Convention will not induce them to reject the proposed plan of Govt. upon the Adoption of which it is candidly my Opinion that the Happiness, Dignity & Glory of the United States depend. I have very little prospect of obtaining the Assent of Congress to the present application of Kentucky to be admitted a [member of] the Union. I expect you have seen the Resolution of Congress appointing a Commtee. to draw up an Ordinance for that purpose. The Comtee. have determined that there is no power for that purpose given by Articles of Confederation. I presume Kentucky will proceed to establish her independence as tho she had been admitted & will apply or not to the new Govt. as her Interest may dictate. If unanimity prevails in the District perhaps thepresent disappointment may be productive of good Consequences to that Country. But be this as it will I flatter myself that they would wish to see a Good Govt. established in the United States even though they should be driven out of the Union & therefore conclude that their Delegates will not decide against the proposed plan a measure which I fear would involve the Atlantic States in Confusion. I am happy to hear of my Brother's [safe] arrival in Kentucky & that he is well pleased with the Country.

 Sir, Copy New York June 21st. 1788. Your Excellency's letter of the 24th of May came safe to us, together with the Instrument of Ratification of the new FOEderal Government, by the Convention of our State, which we presented to Congress.(1) This very important Subject is now under deliberation in the Conventions of Virginia, New York & New Hampshire. The accounts of the first of these are rather favorable to the adoption of the Constitution, altho it does not appear that any certain Judgment can yet be formed---;from the two latter nothing has yet reached us. We anxiously wait the issue of the negociation [wi]th the Creek Indians, & earnestly wish it may have the happy effect of stopping the farther Effusion of Blood & establishing a lasting peace. We inclose your Excellency a Copy of late Resolutions of Congress fixing the mode of crediting the several States for Monies paid to Invalid pensioners, & limiting the time for applications to be put on the List.(2) The State of Georgia has transmitted to Congress an Act of its Legislature offering a Cession of Western territory to the United States under certain conditions therein expressed.(3) This Matter has not yet undergone any Investigation in Congress, & of course the final ratification of the Cession has not been made. The memorial of the District of Kentucky has been considered by Congress, & a Resolution passed in favor of the expediency of concurring in the proposed Measure: but difficulties having arisen with respect to the constitutional Mode of doing it, no farther progress is yet made in that business.(4) We have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your Excellency's Most obedient servts,  (signed) John Parker Thos.

 Dr Sir,(1) New York, June 22, 1788 I am informed by letter recd. from Mr Allen last post that you are at Richmond & presuming that you came thro Augusta I would thank you for any information you may have it in your power to give me respecting my fathers family & my other relations in Botetourt & Montgomery. You will excuse this trouble I hope when you are assured I have not recd. a letter from that quarter, since my arrival here. Any information you may give concerning my acquaintances in K---;---;y will also be very acceptable. We wait with great impatience to hear the determination of Virga. upon the new Constitution. It is supposed that its fate depends upon her Vote. We are told that the Kentucky Members are opposed. I flatter myself not generally. Those objections which respect the navigation of the Mississippi are not well founded. Nothing is to be apprehended in that quarter. I hope it will be adopted, as in my opinion the safety & peace of the United States depend upon it. The Separation of Kentucky will not be granted under the present application.(2) Congress have determined that it is reasonable, and appointed a Committee to bring in an act for their admission into the Union. But the Committee are of opinion that there is no power delegated to Congress for that purpose by the present Confederation. In short it is I fear impracticable to remove the objections suggested by the contracted policy of the Eastern States, who had rather risque the Union than lose what the[y] Call the Ballance of Power. We must act for ourselves---;Assure our independance---;frame our Constitution, & apply to the new Govt. for admission into the Union as our interest & Circumstances may dictate. If we are unanimous and prudent, we have nothing to fear. Perhaps a rejection of our present application may be advantageous to the District. Her importance will in a short time enable her to prescribe her own terms of admission. I enjoy my usual state of good health &c &c Tr(KyLoF: Orlando Brown Papers). This Tr was embodied in the text of a letter to Brown of December 31, 1808, from J. Speed, Jr., of Natchez, Mississippi, who had made  June 22, 1788  a copy after being shown the RC by Colonel Steele in the context of a discussion of the Aaron Burr conspiracy trial. 1 John Steele (c. 1755--;1817) was representing Nelson County, Kentucky, in the Virginia ratifying convention at Richmond where he voted against ratification of the Constitution. In 1790 he became a member of the Virginia Council of State and served as secretary of the Mississippi Territory, 1798--;1802, becoming acting governor in 1801. See Doc.

 My Dear Sir, New York June 22. 1788. I convey to you the inclosed which came to hand by the post.(1) I am sorry I have it not, as yet in my power to give you any certain information respecting the conduct of Virginia as to the adoption of the Constitution, from the complexion of the letters of both parties, all I can say is, I think it is probable, the State will adopt it---;in either event the majority will be small. This State is now in Convention, but nothing decisive has taken place---;it was reported last evening, and I believe from pretty good authority, that the opposition has no thoughts of rejecting in toto---;nor are they wholly fixed as to previous or subsequent amendments. Congress have agreed that it is expedient that Kentucky be independant &c---;thus far was thought by all the members to be prudent and politic, all circumstances considered---;but as to its final admission, into the union or to independency or any further measures relative to the subject, I believe a very considerable majority of the members are of opinion that they ought to be left to the consideration of the New Government.(2) We have ten States in Congress and a member from Maryland and a member from Connecticut---;P[ierpon]t Edwards. E. has been here about twelve or fifteen days(3)---;from his general reputation as a lawyer of rather brilliant talents, gentlemen were led, I believe, to expect some display of abilities---;from what little I have seen of him he appears to think and Judge like a man of a warm climate---;he is not thought to examine his ground well before he takes it, and of course often will expose himself to cautious and discerning men opposed to him. I have often seen men who will shine at the bar; but never in a political sphere. In the inclosed paper you will see the treaty lately made between G. B. & Holland. English politics have now acquired an intire [a]scendency in the Netherlands; and probably will keep it some time. With sentiments of esteem & friendship, I am Dr.Sir, your's &c, N. Dane. June 22, 1788  [P.S.] As I wrote to you last week on the Subject of our attendance in Congress(4) I need add nothing at present. ""

 My dear Brother June 23d. 1788. In Congress. Your Favor of 6th June was deliver'd to me three days ago by the Boys(1) who had a short passage from Norfolk. It gives me great Concern to find that you had lately been very much indisposed. However they assure me that you are intirely recover'd & that you are now as well as you have been for several Years. May Heaven continue the Blessing of Health to you. I am happy to find by the Boys & by a Letter from Richard that you intend, if Circumstances will permit, to make a Visit to this Place in the course of the next Month. I need not say how very great will be my Satisfaction on that Occasion. I find that all your young folks are in good Health, which is a great pleasure to me. Dr. Johnson had fortunately return'd from Connecticut 2 or 3 days before the young Gentlemen arrived. I have been with them to him, & they are now gone to College to give an Account of their Progress. As their Bedding is at Princeton it will be some days before they will get fixt in Lodgings at College. Your Letter to Mr. Constable I have not yet deliver'd as he was out of Town, & I did not know of his return on Saturday until late. The Boys, however, have been with him with a Letter they had to deliver. We have a Report this Day that your Convention had taken the Question for Adjournment, which had pass'd in the Negative by a Majority of Eight, & that the final Question on the Constitution was to have been put on the 21st Inst.---;that the Question for Adjournment had been moved by the Opposers of the Constitution.

 Sir New York 23rd June 1788 On the middle of May I arrived here. I had then been 3 Years out of Congress and could not have taken my seat sooner. Doctr. White had been gone a fortnight before my arrival and an Agent had been appointed for the Southern Department.(1) It is true that the appointment is said to be meerly temporary, but no body here has ever attempted to convince me that the Appointment was prudently made. It is alledged that the Agent appointed, as in all appointments formerly made, is altogether unacquainted with the management of Indians. Having a full Persuasion that you have a considerable acquaintance with the Indians and Interest among them, I wished to see you in that Department, but the Door seemed to be shut; there was however one mode remaining by which our State at least might have the benefit of your Influence among the Indians, this was by giving you the separate Charge of the Cherokees &c. Mr Carrington of Virga and Mr Brown, a lawyer from the Western Part of that State, were both informed of your attention to Indian Affairs and zealousy promoted this measure, but my Collegue Mr. Swan who had been inoculated could not attend steadily in Congress till on the last Week and on Friday last you was chosen.(2) While the Agent formerly appointed for the Southern Department continues, you are to hold a subordinate Place, but to receive your Instructions from Congress with the Allowance of 900 Dlrs per Ann. I think it prob[ab]le that on the next Year the whole Duties of the Southern Department will be in your Hands, for I am persuaded that on the Remr. of this Year we shall have the satisfaction to find that the Indians under your Care conduct themselves without Offence to the Citizens of the United States. I hope in particular that our Friends in Davidson County will experience the Benefit of your attention to the safety of themselves, their wives & Children. I beg you to observe that I have no sort of Claim to thanks for any attention I have shewn to this Business, for in allvotes that I give, as a servant of the State, I am careful not to be influenced by private attachments; I constantly wish to promote such men to Office as I think will serve the public best. If you should be the means of saving the Lives of any of our fellow Citizens I shall have the Reward that I covet,  June 23, 1788  the approbation of my own Mind. Wishing that your appointment may be productive of Benefit to the State and Honor & Profit to yourself I am Sir, Your most obedt servt. Hu Williamson ""

 Dr Sir 23 June 1788 This I mean shall lay on my table to put down Matters as they Occur to me. I have with me the News papers I prosecuted upon in expectation to Speak to the Governour and Jones upon that Subject but I did not find an opportunity and therefore Now Return them.(1) Your Brother Sander May prepare in the Mean time a Declaration But before it is made a Record it will want more Consideration than at this Day can be aforded Either by myself or frinds. I met Claxton (the printer) in the street 8 or 10 Days Ago, who was very importuning that I Should withdraw the suit or discharge him from it. I should by no means consent to withdraw it. I told him that I should by no means consent to withdraw it, and to discharge him was not possible without distroying the suit. He then told me some publication would, he supposed, answer the end of a verdict (here I suppose he meant a sort of recantation). I told him I supposed not---;he said I would in the End find that the Characters of those that published were insignificant and were hardly Worth my Notice. I Answered, that that might be, but they were the ostensible or tools only. If I see him again I shall Continue the Conversation. I tell him that I dont want to injure him no farther than is absolutely necessary to the prosecution of the suit but the real authors shall come forth tho it should prove his ruin. He Complains that it has proved his ruin in some measure already that he has been Obliged to hire himself to London to work for my work and ten more. The Mortgage of Greveroot I shall be Able to do nothing with here. I beleve I will at the End be oblidged to publish and sell it at vendue for I am determined it shall not remain so. Tho. Witbeek has been with me says he will not be able to pay untill August Next. I Shall be well satisfied if he does then. When I went from home the family were in distress About A Servant I have heard nothing of it since. Has the Affair of Waldren succeeded? if not has he paid? I mean to buy A Wench and ifany Suitable one  June 24, 1788  Comes for sale I would have you buy her: I shall try to Muster up Mony one Way or other. Have you got any Mony in since I left you. I Intend soon to Oblidge Van Engen, Van Loon, Van Benson, & some others to pay. As soon as the next harvest is in, the wheat there is then to Spare before the New Wheat Can be brought Down I suppose will be the time to sell the remains. The time probably is Already past, But I would always reather venter that, you have sometimes Mis crops or Blasted. I have Wrote sometime Ago in respect to little Jane.(2) I Wish to know what determination there is upon it. This I dont mean, as a Stimulus to send her down, the propriety of that Measure I leave entirely to Mrs. Yates & Susan. I Mean if it should be intended to send her down then the sooner the Better because I should wish that She should be here three or four Weeks and if then I should return I bring her up with me. If she does not come I wish she could be kept to her books More than she has the last year. It appears to me she has not made the progress that Yates has; I have no Opinion of her going into Latin, let her learn to Read, Write and Cipher and if she gets more let it be french. At all events let the World and her troubles go as they Will the Education of the Children should be attended to. Forget what Estate you Will unless the Children knows how to use it, it is a Chance if it does not at the End injure them, therefore A Child should be brought up to learning Parsimony and with it to use Oeconomy; and to be as free as possible of affectation.

 Dear Sir New York June 25th. 1788 We wait with fear & trembling to hear the determination of Virginia respecting the new Constitution. Both Federalists & Antifederalists agree in opinion that its fate depends upon her decision. Accounts  June 25, 1788  recd. by last Post leave us in great uncertainty with respect to the event. In Convention in this State there are at least two thirds Antifederal or such as will insist upon previous amendments should Virginia do the same. We have no certain information from N Hampshire but the general opinion is that she will adopt it without previous amendments. If it should not be adopted I fear the Consequences will prove ruinous to the Union. I do not expect that Congress will assent to the Independence of Kentucky agreeably to the Acts of Seperation passed by Virginia. A Resolution has passed appointing a Committee to bring in an Ordinance for the Admission of Kentucky into the Union in a mode conformable to the Articles of Confederation. The Committee are of Opinion that there is no power vested in Congress for that purpose & that nothing further can be done under the present application than to report an Additional Article granting such powers to be refered to the different states for their ratification. This will not answer our purpose as the Compact between the District & Virga. will cease on the 4th of July if not ratifyed by Congress. The Eastern States are opposed to the measure least another Vote should be added to the Southern States. Others are opposed least it shd embarrass the New Govt. Kentucky must & will be independent.

 Sir, New York June 25. 1788 I have the Honor to inclose to your Excellency the resolutions of Congress passed yesterday in consequence of the application of Virginia for an extension of the time for exhibitting her accounts against the United States.(1) I hope the time now given will be fully adequate to the object, especially as the second resolution clearly opens the way to the admission of evidence for a very long time after the accounts are rendered---;this however depends greatly upon the commissioner on the part of the State---;a man of capacity and an accommodating disposition may remove difficulties which to one of another discription might stand as insuperable obstacles. I own that to me the ordinance appears to be calculated, if properly understood, & acted upon with industry, by the State Commissioners, to procure tolerably equal justice to all the States.

I beg leave to assure your Excellency that upon the present occasion a very liberal respect has been paid to the application of Virginia by both Congress & the Treasury Board, as no request of the kind has come from any other State, and the general terms of the Resolutions have been adopted only to take off the inconvenience which might have resulted from the example of a special indulgence.

 My dear friend New York June 25. 1788. I am very happy at this moment having within the hour past received the good news of New Hampshire adopting the new Constitution. This is an event of great consequence & diffuses universal joy. The nine pillars are now erected, upon which the new building will stand, even if there should be no more props added; but we hope yet for all thirteen states in due time, which will add stability & beauty to the fabrick. You will excuse my filling any part of my letter with politicks to a lady. I write from the fulness of my heart & what possesses my mind at this juncture. I also know that you are a mighty political madam, & a staunch federalist. Pleasures you know, (at least some of them) must be mutual in order to be exquisite & I am perswaded that you will chearfully partake with me in this, altho I would not ask for a participation with you in some others. My ---;---; ---; very justly claims a monopoly with me in certain pleasures, in which I perfectly agree with her, & it is with reluctance on my part that distance deprives us for a short time. You say that somebody thinks it a long time. I am sure the mortification on that part is not greater than on mine. I hope that my absence will be recompenced by an increased happiness at my return within about two months or less. As you are pleased to use a little smutty talk some times, so I hope that you will excuse me if you should conceive a small appearance of it in what I have suggested. I do not desire that you would shew this letter to any body except to my wife, who has my free consent & desire to see all that I write & to know all that I do and whom I wish to partake with me in all that I enjoy. This I am sure you will say is making a very suitable return for all her kind thÃ´ts & wishes for me. As Capt. Jona Wiggin I doubt not voted for the new Constitution please to give my affectionate regards to him & tell him that I thank him for his services & congratulate him upon theevent. I must now turn my attention to your letter, or else perhaps you will be affronted again & say that I do not take due notice of or answer your very agreable communications. Last evening I had the honor of receiving your very kind favor of the 15 Instant, & be assured that it gave me the greatest pleasure next to that which I received from the other letter which accompanyed it. That was from one whom I very justly prefer letters from, & if you should think that I am partial, you will at the same time allow that I have very good reason to be so, from a like partiality to me. You observe in the beginning of your letter that you had been \""at meeting all day.\"" This I suppose was the most remarkable news you could tell & what you thÃ´t would be the most acceptable to me to hear. As you had just retired from your devotions, & I hope  June 25, 1788  under the good impressions you had so lately received, I conclude that you would write me nothing but what was true. For this reason the account you give of a certain person's constancy, affection & concern for me, & desire for my return, must be very pleasing, tho' I would not have it give a painful anxiety. However as that person expresses some jealousy that you write what you ought not, I cannot but suspect a little your veracity. I know that you can to make a good story lye a little (asking your pardon). Upon other occasions I have a great regard for your word. I have not a doubt of the truth of what you say of the two poor nieces of yours & of their husbands. Nor of the wood chuck & the pigs & other increases of your domesticks. As to the small pox I dont know how you would do about that if it might have the same effect it had before. I thank you for your care of & good advice to George and shall think myself much obliged by the continuance of those favors. I have taken up so much of this letter already, that I have no room to give you any account of myself only that I am very well. I am much pleased to observe you in so good health & spirits & hope they will continue & encrease. There are a thousand pretty thÃ´ts & diverting pieces of information in your letter which I cannot now more particularly remark but do assure you that they are very acceptable.

 Dear Sir New York June 26. 1788. By your favor of June 9th I recived the first intelligence from the General Court of New Hampshire after their meeting, and am much obliged to you for the trouble you took in giving me that early information. My wife informs me that you took particular pains to convey to me the letter; I am very much gratifyed by knowing how the elections have issued. I have since seen a New Hampshire paper in which there was a list of the court &c. I now Sir with particular satisfaction, congratulate upon the adoption of the new constitution in your State, and which has ensured its taking place. The latest news we have from Virginia is dated the 18 Instant. By a letter from Govr. Randolph we are told that then there had no question been taken to decide the sense of the Convention, but his calculation was that these were 82 for, 76 against & 10 doubtful. Another letter which is from an antifederalist of, the same date says, that there are reckoned 80 on each side as certain & 8 as doubtful. The event therefore is yet very dubious. It is supposed that they would come to a determination on Saturday or Wednesday last. Of New-York convention you will have as good an account as I am able to give you by the newspaper which I enclose. I hope that the spirit of lying & controversy upon this important subject will soon be done away, & that harmony and prosperity will attend the United States. We have no later intelligence from Europe than what has been in the papers. By them we have accounts of very distressing wars & other calamities. It is not unlikely that other nations may be in- June 27, 1788  volved. The disturbances in France between the King & his Parliament & other powerful subjects is very considerable. Perhaps it may be a fortunate time for them to regain some of their ancient liberties. The spirit of American liberty which he cherished at a distance seems to have crossed the Atlantic & is not a little troublesome to him. It may perhaps be thÃ´t wrong to suggest any thing to the reproach of our magnanimous & most christian ally, but I suppose the truth of the case is that he is a very weak & sottish prince. The latter infirmity, if he had not the former, you know will disqualify very soon a man from being active & enterprising. The Dutch are in a much worse condition than when they began their struggle & thousands of them have been obliged to fly their country & are ruined. It is very probable that those confusions in Europe may be the means of sending emigrants to America. Whether this will conduce to the real comfort & happiness of its present inhabitants I cannot say, but it will hasten on our population & make us a great if not a happy people. The western country which is yet to people is immense & I do believe it is a country in [which] the inhabitants can subsist themselves as easy as in any part of the world but they have many disadvantages. They are now settled in that country some of them a thousand miles from the sea. The Spaniards are on their West & South & tribes of savages in the midst of them & they will I believe have wars with both of them sooner or later. Congress have agreed to sell large tracts of that country & others are applying. I hope that it will yield some emomulents [emoluments] to the united states. The Congress will I suppose pretty soon take up the new System & prepare to put in motion. I hope that by the latter end of August we shall be able to adjourn. For my own part I am not for tarrying here any longer than is indispensable. I have my health & find my situation more agreable than Iexpected. We have agreed that Kentucky should be independent in a mode conformable to the Confederation, but it cannot take place in the present situation of affairs.(1) I can add no more at this time but my best wishes to attend you & yours and am your obliged friend & humble Servant.

 Dear Sir, New York June 27th 1788 Your Several Inclosures in your Letter of the 18th Inst. were very flattering as our federal friends had begun to despond, from the  June 27, 1788  Tenor of the Advice that had been previously received from Virginia. Since the Adoption of New Hampshire, the Virginia Politics are not So interesting. The federal Edifice is now compleat, altho the Support of the other States will greatly Strengthen it. If the Virginia Convention has not decided before the Ratification of New Hampshire reaches them, I have no doubt of a favorable Issue. I find by Letters received here from the antifederal Party at Richmond, that they are Sanguine, but not So confident as our Friends. This is a good Sign. New York will reject---;but no opinion can be formed of the Manner of doing it. Yours Sincerely, Wm Bingham ""

 D Sir New York 27 [June 1788] The measure about takeing up an other 1,000,000 of guilders in Holland has this day again been moved in Congress.(1) You Remember that last year also a New Loan of a Million was taken in Holland. It was then Said we were under an absolute necessity of Doing So upon the Account that the Bills of our agents or Managers in paying the foreign Debt were protested. Mr Jefferson in his Letter of the 16 March 1788 supposes from a Representation of the Board of Treasury of December that the Change of Government will make it Necessary to take up this Loan of an other Million. I have again opposed this motion & given for Reason that suppose it impolitic to take up Loans in time of Peace, And that at a time we dont want it the Interest settled so as that there Can be no call untill A year hence, and to take up a Loan now for the year 1789, and 1790. Besides how will the anticipation of this Loan agree with the Ideas propagated for several years that our Credit was lost in Europe Because of the Defects in the Confederation. And now to Sponge upon the Credit of the existing Confederation for fear that we will not be Able to make payment under the New one. There were ten states on the floor on the question. New York Devided and I am not sure wether Rhode Island agt. A Motion was for Reconsideration but the question was not put. I am apprehensive however that so soon as Nine states Can be got it will again be attempted. I shall however Watch the Motion and oppose it Which is the best I can do and let you know if What is done in it for it appears to be exceeding unjust to Load the dissenting States in the Confederation With a  June 29, 1788  Debt that if the advocates for the New Constitution Can make it work will be of no use to them.

 Sir New York June 29th 1788 I am honored with your Excellencys obliging favor of the 21st instant and most heartily rejoice with you on the accession of our State to the new System of Government---;the more especially as it is the ninth; which cannot fail of defusing general joy throughout our Nation and among the friends of Mankind in Countrys where freedom & happiness is less known. Permit me, Sir, to Congratulate you on the renewed testimonial of public Esteem in your being again called by the voice of the people to the chief seat of Government in which I most sincerely wish you all the pleasure & satisfaction that can arise from Universal applause.(1) I have the pleasure to inform you that by letters of the 20th instant received last evening from Virginia there is good reason to believe that there will be a majority of five or six of their Convention in favor of the question. Should this take place, North Carolina will undoubtedly follow---;but what turn the question will take in New York is at present uncertain as there is still an inflexible majority in the opposition. As it may at times be useful & necessary to make communications to the President which would be improper for the public Eye I must beg leave to request that my letters addressed to the president may be considered as private communications and such letters or such parts only made known to the Legislature as the public good may require. I am induced to make this request in Consequence of an Idea that seems to have obtained in our Court that all letters from Members of Congress to His Excellency the president are of a public nature and must be read in Court. I beg leave to observe that gentlemen here seem impatient to see the ratification of the new Government by New Hampshire(2) and will not add but to assure you of the Sincere Respect & Esteem with which I have the Honor to be, Sir, Your Excellencys Most Obedient & Most Humble Servant, N.

 D Sir New York 29 June 1788 I R[eceive]d yours of 22 June Instant. The Letter I Wrote and Which before now you have Rd. In Respect to Mess. Jannet(1) Will be All that is necessary to Say upon that Subject: nor do I belive that the gentlemen of the Convention Will Request by [my] Attention At Poughkepse, nor do I belive that the Attention of the Albany federalist Will Do them Any service. From every Information I git it appears that the Anties are neither to be frowned or flattered out of their op[p]osi[tio]n. The principle Object the Other side have in View is to get an Adjournment Which I Confess is the only Apprehension I have For if they Can Obtain an Adjournment the Members During That Time will be Seperated and open to their Management both in the News papers---;and the State the Whole Time in Convulsions. It appears to me the Fire Edge in this place is Wearing off very fast. It appears to one that the more serious Citizens get tyred of the furie and Noise. The Speeches of Lansing And Smith(2) meet in the Coffe House and Elsewhere With Almost general Approbation the Ringing of the Bells become reprobated as uselessly irritating And Improper in the Situation We are in. Should Verginia Adopt and Wether they Will or not is problematical then th[ere wi]ll be New exclamations: Can our State Stand Alone? Is our state Wiser then all the Rest &a? If that storm is wethered I suppose they will see that it will be in vain to throw any farther Obstacles in the Way and they Will soon finish. I belive my staying here May be of some Service. Last year there Was A Loan Made in Holland of 1,000,000 guilders. The Reason then given Was that Our Bills, to pay the Interest in Europe had been protested. Now it is proposed to take up one Million more Because upon A Representation of the Board of Treasury to Mr Jeffries [Jefferson] that With the Change of Government We Will not be able to Make any Remittances till after the Year 1790.(3) This Measure has been taken up twice And I have in both Instancesopposed it (and Which they have not been Able to git Nine States)---;Upon this Principle---;That it is Impolitick At all events to take up Mony in time of profound Peace, And the More as there Will be no Interest Due untill June 1789---;And What Will the World think When they Meet With the Observations that have been made for Several Years that our Credit Was Lost in Europe Because of the Defects in the confederation---;if We now go and Sponge upon the Existing Confederation to set the Wheels of the New government Agoing, And then to grees them.

 My dear Child New York July 2 1788. I now send you the little book which I some time ago mentioned to you, & gave you reason to expect. I think there are many useful sentiments in it, with which you will be pleased. No doubt the manner in which it is said to be found, is a fiction. Some suppose it was wrote by lord Chesterfield, but it is very immaterial who was the author, if it contains good moral instructions.(1) I have stuck into the Book a couple of pins, which I have sent to Sally, & desire you would deliver them to her as soon as you have opportunity. I have wrote to Sally informing her of the present. That to you & to her, I wou'd have you receive, not on account of their value, but as tokens of my remembrance & affection. I wrote to Sally upon Matrimony as I heard she was Courted.(2) And to be pertinent to your situation the subject of this letter to you, ought to be upon housewifry. How you discharge this new department of life I have not heard. I remember that you set out with determinations of correcting some of the mistakes of those you had received your education from; & That you would not betray a weak fondness & indulgence to the humours of Children, but preserve the dignity of parental authority. Perhaps experience may shew the difference between resolving & practicing. But you cannot judge of this matter decidedly until you shall have two or three turbulent boys to be fond of & yet to govern. I do not know how soon this may be, but if it ever should be the case, I hope you will have prudence to stear aright. As a mother in law you will consider that great attention is necessary to treat your little daughter properly. You will, now she is young endeavor to improve her mind with knowledge & to regulate her temper & inclinations so as shall be for her own happiness as well as that of her parents. And you will by degrees & in the methods least disgusting to her, lead her into the habits of industry & ingenious work. This will be for her reputation& amusement too, for I think that an Idle life is the most distant from satisfactory enjoyment. I must now give you a hint about your domestic business & oeconomy. You know your mother has set you a good example of this, & I think your natural disposition will induce you to imitate her therein. Prudence & good management are very expedient in young housekeepers. There is a wide difference between sordid meanness on the one hand & extrava- July 2, 1788  gance and careless dissipation on the other. The good things of this life are designed for our enjoyment & that of our friends but decency & frugality are to direct. The early part of life is the most convenient time for making some savings. When people become older they are less disposed to business, & their expences are unavoidably encreased. But enough of this has been said. Wisdom is profitable to direct. I have a word to say about out doors concerns. How do your bees flourish? Have you good luck with your Chickens? Your mother tells me of a mighty improvement in raising chickens. That she has thirty under the care of one hen. This must be a pretty amusement. How does your Garden florish? I do not think it is worth while for you to work in it much this summer. I hope you continue to go to meeting & to see your mother as you told me you did when you wrote to me. I shall endeavor to come & see you by that time your beach plumbs shall be ripe. I intended to have written to you on your birthday which will be on July 12, and congratulate you on that event, but as that time is near at hand you must receive this as answering that purpose. I wish you may live to see many such days in health & prosperity. You will remember the transitoriness of life & how quick we pass from one stage to another until we arrive at the close. I have wrote this letter in great haste not having time just now, & several other letters to write. I hope you will be able to read it. I enjoy my health very well, & am as well satisfyed with my situation as I could be from home. You hear from me often & thÃ´ I have not written many letters to you I suppose you see those I write to others. I desire my love to Mr. Wiggin & to Polly, with whom I wish you long happiness & am your affectionate Father, P Wingate ""

 Dr Sir [July 2, 1788] <<A description of the Reception of the News of New Hamshire you have had in my former(1) which I Directed to Mr D Wit as I supposed that Letters between us (tho I have no reason but Apprehension only) Would be liable to at Least observations if not to other Abuse. L Hommedieu last Monday mentioned that he had from A Strong federal (Dr Tillotson) that the anties went upon A supposition that Verginia and NH both would Adopt: and that they were Determined that they would not adopt without Previous Amendments.> July 2, 1788  <<The federalists notwithstanding had hopes that the News from N Hamshire Would have Struck a damp on the Spirits if not thrown the Majority on the federal side---;but Mr Euger(2) (the Member from South Carolina) Informs that he was at Pogkepse when the News arrived And that it made no impression on the Convention at all---;So that they recur to their old hopes to git the Members Devided or to an adjorment. They seem to be Confident that the anties will not agree among themselves. Coll Lewis told me that he knew of two principal members that were of opinion that they by the Resolution of the Legislator of last February had no other powers but to Adopt or Reject. I tell him the federal Gentlemen had the Most Extraordinary Talents of Swallowing Cammels themselves and Recommg others to stick at nats.> I believe however that the Chief expectation is to git an adjornment by which they will have a farther opportunity to shew their dexterity at Management in [. . .] Woud [. . .] probably 10 States With the Members as Well as in the papers---;for upon Desiring the Adjornment of the Convention the State would be in one Continual Convulsion. Willet told me to day that Brockholts Livingston Esqr had asked him to Subscribe to the expences of a federal Ship to be used in a procession the 4 July. This very Day it has again been Moved In Order to Confirm a Loan of 1,000,000 Guilders Contracted for in Holland by Mr Adams in Case It shall be ratifyed by Congress.(3) You Will please to observe that Mr Jefferson by a Letter of the 16 March 1788 He Writes that the Board of Treasury by their letter of December last that it Would be Impossible to make any Remittances to Europe the Ensuing year and that they must therefore Rely Altogether on the progress of the late Loan &a (A Loan made of 1,000,000 last year). This Motion I have opposed---;That I supposed it exceeding Impolitic to take up Loans in time of Peace And to pay for Interest that shall be Due only in the years 1789 & 1790. Besides howwould this agree with the Ideas propagated for some years that our Credit Was Lost on Account of the Defects in the Confederation And now to anticipate and go Sponge upon the Credit of the Existing Confederation for fear that the New one would not Work.

 Dear Sir, New York July 3. 1788. In my last letter(1) I briefly gave my opinion on the questions you Stated to me; now being more at leisure & Sensible that the peculiar Situation of our Government at this time is a matter of common concern and highly interesting to us all; and that we have the same object in view, the peaceable establishment of a general Government, on genuine federal and republican principles, I shall in this be more particular, and submit to your consideration several observations with that candor and frankness with which we have always communicated our sentiments to each other relative to the important subject in question. The Constitution of the United States is now established by the people of ten States, and a day of course must soon be fixed, when all proceedings under the Confederation shall cease. The line of conduct which shall now be pursued by the three States which have not, as yet ratified is become particularly and deeply interesting to them, and to the whole Confederacy. As things are now circumstanced will it not be clearly for their interest and happiness, as well as for the interest and happiness of all the union to adopt the Constitution proposing such amendments as they may think essential. The situation of the States is now critical---;as the Constitution is already established there can be no previous amendments; and a State which has not ratified, and wishes to be in the union, appears to have but this alternative before her; either to accede with recommending certain alterations, or to make them a condition of her accession; and the probable consequence of either Step must be considered. I take it for granted that New York and the other two States wish to form a part of an American Confederacy---;the readiness with which they Joined in the revolution, and acceded to the articles of Confederation; their open and general professions, and their past exertions to the support of the union Justify this opinion. In all our late political discussions, a separationof the States, or Separate Confederacies, have scarcely, to my knowledge, been seriously mentioned. Admitting that Rhode Island, New York, and North Carolina all withhold their assent to the Constitution, and propose similar amendments, their situation is such, far removed from each other, and surrounded by ratifying States, that they never can think of confederating among themselves. Each one of them must be considered as Standing alone---;but we have no reason to suppose that any one of those States has a wish to Stand alone, in Case she can Confiderate on principles agreeable to her. If I understand the politics of these three States, they are strongly attached to governments founded in freedom and compact, and possess a Just aversion to those  July 3, 1788  which are the result of force and violance. They will, therefore, be the last States which will adopt measures tending to foment parties, and give passion an ascendancy over reason, or to hazard steps that may, in the end, lead to a civil war, and consequently to the Government of the prevailing party established by the longest Sword. It is not to be pretended that the ratifying States will have any Just cause to make war upon any non ratifying State, merely because she does not accede to to a national compact, where she has a right to act according to her discretion---;nor ought we to presume that hostilities will be commenced by any party without some plausible or Just provocation. But the ratifying and non-ratifying States will immediately have opposite Interests, which, in the nature of things, they will pursue---;the longer they shall remain separate the more their affections and freindship for each other will decrease---;and counteracting laws and a disposition for coersive measures will take place---;the affairs of the Country will have a propensity to extremities and a thousand accidents may give rise to hostilities. The question in the ratifying States being settled, it is probable the parties in them will gradually unite. In the States where the question shall remain unsettled, and the contest continue between the parties in them, as it undoubtedly will, in what manner they shall Join the union, they will grow more hostile to each other; and from what appears to be their present temper and situation, and if we reason from experience and from the character of men we must conclude, it is at least highly probable, that they will have recourse to arms, or to contentions extremely injurious to their common Interest, at no very distant period And what must be the issue of force, or of such contentions between the parties in any State is not difficult to foresee. If the other States should not interfere, those parties must decide their contest by themselves. If the party called federal Shallprevail, they bring the State into the Union Unconditionally, or establish a State Government of their own, probably, on their own principles. If the other party shall prevail they will keep the State out of the Union, unless the federal Constitution, which can hardly be presumed, shall in the mean time be made agreeable to them, and they will of necessity add a degree of severity to their laws and measures very incompatible with those principles of freedom they now contend for---;this presents a disagreeable Scene in either event. But should the other States intefere, or a civil war by any accident become general between the advocates and opposers of the Constitution, throughout the United States, which is the probable consequence of any hostile beginnings, what must be the issue? our people tho enlightened are high Spirited---;one party, when both are nearly ruined, may prevail, not in accommodating and fixing a government in freedom and compact, but in force and violance, and may we not expect a more severe high toned partial system established to secure the victo-  rious party, at least a system more despotic than the old one we lay aside, or the one we are adopting. Were there any great number of men heartly attached to the Confederation, their success might establish it---;but this in its present form seems to have but few or no advocates. Were there any great number of men attached to it with certain defined Alterations in it, their success might establish it when so altered---;but we have not agreed in those alterations---;and if we may Judge from experience, and what appears to be the public opinion, it is more difficult to mould the Confederation to the wishes of the people than the Constitution---; the Community in fact consists of two parties, the advocates, who are for establishing the Constitution in its present form, and the opposers, who generally if I understand them consider it as a tolerable basis, but as an imperfect and unguarded system unless amended. Were the advocates well attached to the system their success might establish it, but this is not the Case. We know that many of them and those too, who would have the most influence, from their abilities, address, and activity, in producing a Government, never will agree to a system so favourable to liberty and republicanism even as the one proposed, if by any means they can get one more favourable to themselves, and unfavourable to the body of the people. If the other party those who wish to have the system but amended, succeed, and they were agreed in the amendments their success might establish the plan so amended---;but no set of amendments have been agreed upon, and different ones have been proposed by different Conventions. You will, therefore, I am confident, agree with me that the friends of liberty and of Governments founded in compact cannot reasonably expect any good consequences from force and violance---;the very means are hostile to the end proposed. Our object is to improve the plan proposed: to Strengthen and secure it's democratic features; to add checks and guards to it; tosecure equal liberty by proper Stipulations to prevent any undue exercise of power, and to establish beyond the power of faction to alter, a genuine federal republic. To effect this great and desirable object the peace of the Country must be preserved, candor cherished, information extended and the doors of accommodation constantly kept open. The votes of the people will I think avail them much more in establishing a government favourable to them---;than any violant or forceable proceedings. It is to be considered that five States have adopted the Constitution without proposing any amendments---;we have seen the amendments proposed in the Conventions of four States---;and certain it is there appears to be too little in reality proposed to be gained by the amendments to Justify parties in those states carrying matters to extremities---;Nor will any one, two or three States ever expect the others to meet them in amendments, but on the principles of accommodation. Whatever amendments any State may propose, I am per-  suaded you are too well acquainted with men, not to be sensible that passion, opinion, and self will must have a constant influence in their conduct relative to them, that when terms are rigidly insisted on by one party, they are generally opposed by terms rigidly insisted on by the other. It cannot be proper for any State positively to say to the others, that unless they precisely agree to the alterations she proposes she will not accede to the Union---;this would be rather dictating---;a state may take a question upon the Constitution simply as it stands and express its sense of it in it's present form---;she may then annex recommended amendments and adopt it with them, or make them the Condition of her accession to the Union, I flatter myself, after a state has expressed her sense upon the simple proposition you will prefer the mode of adopting with recommendatory amendments annexed---;the new system must soon go into operation and some of the most important laws be made in the first Congress, and essential amendments be recommended by it---;the State that adopts this mode comes into the Union armed with the declared Sentiments of her people, and will immediately have a voice in the federal Councils---;she there will avail herself of all her influence, and of the advantages of Accommodating principles in bringing the other States to Accord with her sentiments---;whereas if she adopts conditionally She will not have a voice in those Councils during the most interesting period---;party Spirit will, probably, reign in her bosom, and ill will constantly gain ground between her and the other States---;And it is in my mind almost an absolute certainty that she must forever remain out of the Union, or relinquish some of her conditions. It cannot be presumed that any two of the three States will precisely agree in the same Alterations, and should they do it, it is not probable that all the States will agree exactly to them. There are many and able advocates for valuable amendments, and a good system of lawsin every State and may they not prevail should all the States meet in the first Congress but should some of them Stand out, and those in which those amendments and laws have the most friends---;the federal republicans or men who wish to cement the union of the States on republican principles will be divided, and have but a part of their Strength in Congress, where they ought to have the whole. When measures of any sort become necessary in a Community, it is generally wise to take a part in them, and to bring them as near to our opinions as we can in the first instance, and I have ever thought since a federal Convention was agreed on that Rhode Island and certain individuals, who were appointed to that Convention, missed it exceedingly in not attending it. They might clearly, had they attended, have engrafted many of the principles and checks they now contend for, into the system---;and have given it those features and securities which as it now appears, would meet the approbation of the people in General---;they saw a Constitution of some   kind was to be made, and before it had taken a fixed direction was the time for exertions. You as well as others know it to be a fact that some parts of the Constitution most complained of, were obtained with much address and after repeated trials, and which never could have been carried had the States and members, I refer to, attended the federal Convention---;for any State now to stand out and oppose appears to me to be but a repetition of the same error. I might add many more observations but I think I need not dwell longer on these points. Even when a few states had adopted without any alterations, the ground was materially changed; and now it is totally Shifted. Tho I retain my opinion respecting the feeble features, the extensive powers, and defective parts of the System, yet circumstanced as we are, I confess, I feel no impropriety in urging the three States to Accede. Men in all the States who wish to establish a free, equal, and efficient government, to the exclusion of Anarchy, corruption, faction, and oppression ought in my opinion to unite in their exertions in making the best of the Constitution now established; to preserve inviolate the liberties of America, and to promote the happiness of the people by Just and equal laws and an equitable administration; to add constitutional security to those liberties on every proper occasion are still the objects of all good men. This now appears to be the way to disappoint those men who discover a disposition to make a bad use of a Constitution in many parts not well guarded, and to use its powers to corrupt and selfish purposes---;a good Constitution is capable of affording much security to the rights of the people, and ought to be aimed at with unremitted attention. But ought we to expect any Constitution under which the people may, with safety, relax in any considerable degree in their attention to public measures? can they be secure under any Constitution unless attentive themselves, and unless some of their able leaders are their real friendsand their faithful guardians? Tho I think our people have examined the system in question with candor and freedom and discovered a strong attachment to liberty---;Yet I would by no means so far rely upon their exertions and vigilance as to lose sight of those Constitutional securities which may be obtained by time and experience---;while we view the conduct of rulers with candor, we ought to watch their movements with an Eagle's eye, and guard and secure the temple of freedom with unceasing attention. To conclude ought we not now to give additional weight to the plea in favor of the Constitution drawn from the peculiarity of our situation, and which when less urgent and pressing appears again and again to have saved the system! and tho the system may be abused by bad men, ought we not to recollect that The road to lasting fame in this Country has generally been Justice, and Integrity, prudence and moderation, political information and industry & that there is more than an equal chance that this will continue to be the case! Attempts   to palm upon our people vice for virtue, the mere shew of talents for real abilities, and the arts and puffs of party for a well earned reputation have generally failed---;and what is wanting but to excite the attention of this intelligent people to render such attempts always unsuccessful? All these and many other considerations ought to have their Just weight in deciding the great Question before Us. With esteem & regard, Your obedt. humble. servant,  N. Dane A copy. ""

In obedience to the orders of the United States in Congress Assembled, I have the honor to transmit to you herewith enclosed the proceedings of Congress relative to the Independency of the district of Kentucky.(1) From these you will perceive that though Congress think it expedient that the district be made a separate State and member of the Union, yet the present State of the government of the Confederacy renders it highly improper for them to proceed further than to express their opinion that the district ought to be an Independent member of the Union, as soon as circumstances will permit measures to be taken for that purpose; and to recommend as they have done to the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Virginia(2) and to the inhabitants of the district so to alter their Acts and Resolutions relative to this matter as to render them conformable to the provisions in the New Constitution to the end that no impediment may be in the way of the Speedy accomplishment of this important business.(3) I have only to add that from the 4th of March to the 30th of May, Congress for want of a sufficient number of States could not take up the Subject. With great respect, &ca, C.T. ""

His indigence, infirm state of health & distance from the office have prevented his applying for a final settlement of his account before this time. The state of New Jersey has allowed him the depreciation on the pay he actually recieved. By Capt Hubbels certificate there appears to be thirteen months in arrear & a deficiency in Cloathing.

 Dear Sir New York July 7th 1788 Permit me tho late to congratulate you & your amiable Lady upon a return to your native Country,(1) The pleasure & delights of which you must relish peculiarly after so long absence. I have never been much of a traveler, but I can hardly conceive of a Country under all circumstances more eligible; And the prospect of public felicity seems the brighter from the accesion of ten states to a System which so far as I comprehend it, promises equal liberty, security of property, & decision. I do not indeed flatter myself with the return of the Golden Age. If any of our farmers have heard of Arcadia they may not think of ram- July 7, 1788  bling in her meadows, or that her rich harvests will spontaneously flow; Ideas like these do very well in the poets imagination. Nor may our commercial people expect Gold & Silver as in Solomons reign, Yet we may venture to predict that the industrious husbandsmen may reap plenteous harvests, & the vigilant, enterprising Mercht may rationally expect his ships full fraught with articles of foreign growth, in exchange for produce of his own Country. At least this is my hope & belief, altho some sensible, & I doubt not well meaning friends, hold up such a doleful picture to the contrary, as if the D---;---;l himself had sat for it. At all events the experiment will soon tried. Ten States have acceded. Congress feeling an obligation to call upon the people to elect their president &c, have chosen a Committee who will in a day or two report the time for operations to commence under the new Government, & which I think will probably be in Jany or Feb 1789.(2) N York are indeed opposed, but the last accounts from their Convention from the leaders in favor of the question \""lead us hope.\"" Of N Carolina there can be little doubt---;R Island you will be pleased to form your own Judgmt upon. They are a kind of Comet. Virginia & N Carolina & the New settled regions at the Westward, keep teasing about Missisippi. You may probably not be informed that Congress have ratified your last loan of 1,000,000 florins,(3) Indeed I know of no other alternative, No resources can at present be brot into operation. You may have heard Congress have resolved \""that it is expedient for Kentucky to become a separate State,\""(4) but this will not take place at present. The Dominion was so swoln, & Kentucky inflamed it was thot prudent to administer this cooling application. The business will not progress under the present Confederation, Vermont must go hand in hand with this business. I had the pleasure of passing an hour at Col Smiths(5) on Saturday evening. He is delightfully situatedabout 12 miles from N York, and Mrs Smith is pleased with her residence at Jamaica. I took the liberty to propose directing her Letters to the Eas[t]wd, And shall carefully deliver any you may please to cover to me. I should feel myself honored by a communication of your opinion & advice upon any matter of such importance as to claim your attention, And with my compliments to Mrs Adams & all friends, I am, Very respectfully, Your Excellencys Most Huml Sert, Sam.

 Dear Sir New York. July. 7t. 1788. I received your favor some time since & shou'd have acknowledged it before this, but was at that time in the height of the small pox. You will give me leave now, sir to thank you for your polite engagement in the business on which I wrote you. From the slow & irregular conveyance which sometimes attends Letters you may possibly hear of the decision of this State on the New Constitution before this reaches you: however as there are Chances against I shall take the liberty to mention their extreme indecision on that Subject, an indecision the more astonishing since they are apprised of it's ratification by ten States. The Constitution is ably supported by Gentlemen of great literary Merit, but the Opposition who are by no means contemptible, seem determined to dispute the ground intch by intch. What they propose to themselves from their inflexibility, is hard to discover; since it is certain, if we are to judge from their situation & the disposition of a great part of the State, that they will find their concurrence sooner or later not only expedient but unavoidable. However shou'd their determination be contrary to the general Sense of the Union, I hope it will not be made an Example to influence the deliberations & Conduct of our State. We are, Sir, in the most painful Suspense for Carolina. I confess I shou'd be most sensibly mortified were Carolina to reject the Constitution however unavailing her dissent might be with regard to it's Establishment and doubly so when I reflect that in such a determination they wou'd have the Countenance of Rhode Island alone, who in all probability may veer about when a certain State- System of business is gone thro' with. The Arrangements for putting the new Government into Action have been committed for some days & in all probability will be reported on this Week. July 7, 1788  I shou'd, Sir most certainly beg the favor of a line now and then, but knowing that you are so variously employed You are seldom allowed leisure.

 Dear sir New York 7th July 1788 Virginia having confederated N Carolina in Opposition, should she be disposed to stand out, can only expect countenance from Rh. Island or N York. Let me state in a few Words the politics of Rh Island. You have heard of the Effects of the Know Ye Law by which every Creditor is enabled to wipe off a Debt by paying 2/6 in the Pound, for their Paper is now at 8 for 1, & the mony being paid into the Hands of a Magistrate remains there for some Time for the Use of the Creditor and if he neglects taking it The State Treasury becomes Heir general. Thus private Debts by this Time are nearly discharged in that State. The State Certificate Debt is also nearly paid off by similar Means. The domestic or private Debts of the State were to the best of my Recollection about 566 Thousand Dlrs. A Law was made for paying one fourth of this Debt & all holders of Securities were called to bring in their Claims and receive Â¼th of the Amount. Every man who neglected tendering his Claims forfeited the Amount that was offerd that is one fourth. But the Creditors in general neglected. A second & a third Payment was offered and made in the same manner and now they have advertised for paying the fourth and last Portion of the Debt. Thus the whole of the State Debt is soon to be expunged by a kind of Legerdemain. For little or no mony has issued during this Process out of the Treasury. It is thought that Rh Island will pretty soon be ready to confederate, but a was told some days since by a Leader of the Know Ye men that the good People in that State have two capital Objections against the new Constitution; first, they think that every Slave should be taxed as a white man & not represented. Second, they think that the Ratio for taxing is not proper, the States should not be taxed according to the number of Inhabitants but according to the amount of the Produce exported  July 7, 1788  from any other State. I asked him what did Rh Island grow & export, he answered nothing except a little Cheese & Pot Ash. You see how reasonable a Plan his would be; Maryland, Virga & So. Caro. would be delighted with it. The Politics of N. York are not so villanous in their Face---;but not much more honourable considering them as part of the same Nation. They during the War agreed to give Congress the Power of collecting the 5 Per Ct Impost, as soon as they got Possession of this City they refused to let Congress have such Power because the[y] find the selfish advantage of imposing a duty on Imports for their own Use. Half the goods consumed in Connecticut or rather Â¾ths of them, half the goods consumed in New Jersey or rds of them, all the goods consumed in Vermont and no small Part of those consumed in the Western Part of Massachusets are bought in New York and pay an Impost Duty of 5 Per Ct for the Use of this State. I say nothing of what the good Citizens of N Carolina import from N York whence they pay Part of the New Yorkers Taxes. Tis easy to discover why New York does not like the new Govt. But this very Argument must be a very good one with the Citizens of N Carolina why they should like that Govt. Consequently it is to be hoped that they will neither copy N York nor Rh. Island. I am with great Regard Dr Sir, Your obed servt, Hu Williamson ""

 Dear Smith(1) New York July 9th. 1788. I was this day favor'd with yours of the 1st Instant from Richmond for which accept my warmest thanks. I am very happy to hear that you have finally Settled the Amt. of Certificates with Colo. Crockett as it gave me pain to find that he had been so long kept out of his due tho it in a great measure proceeded from his detaining the Certificates. I hope the Note which you have passed for the Discount will not produce any Inconveniency to you. If you will inform me the Amt. I will forward you an order on the Treasury for it. I am rather at a loss what to say with respect to the purchase of the remainder of Quirks Claims---;'tho believe I must make it. Cash is out of the Question---;I have his Bond for about Â£20---;& would engage to take up his Bonds now due to the amt. of Â£100. This ought to be considerd by him as Cash. If you can contract with him [. . .] upon these terms or any other which you may think more advantageous I request that you will do it---;But would not be restricted to any particular Bonds & would wish some time to produce them. I only agree to this to prevent a loss of the whole Contract in which you well know I was much imposed upon. I am willing that Capt. Craddock should appropriate the Bond refered to for the Payment of my Just debts, he is well acquainted with my Business & have no doubt but he will transact it to the best advantage. I am not acquainted with nature of the Contract between Mr. Harvey & Capt. Kennedy therefore cannot determine with what propriety he can injoin the Judgt. obtained against him upon the bond by Mr. Preston. Should he file a Bill it will not be in my power to put in an Answer untill after my return to the District---;if he pays the Money I wish it to be appropriated agreeable to my former letter. Congress on the 3d Instant came to a final determination upon the subject of the Kentucky address---;which was to refer the application to the New Government & to recommend it to the State of Virginia &the District to make the Necessary Alterations in their Acts & Resolutions upon  July 9, 1788  that Subject.(2) The great change which has taken place in the Genl. Government of the Union in some measure Justified the decision which was contrary to the expectations which I at first entertained---;but had it not been for the opposition of the Eastern States Kentucky might have been admitted into the Union before the New Constitution had been adopted by Nine States. I hope this disappointment will not be productive of any bad consequences to the District---;but that unanimity & good Order will still prevail. In my opinion their Interest requires that they should assume their Independence frame a Constitution & proceed to the exercise of Government & when the New Govt. is in Motion then to make application to be admitted into the Union if it should appear advisable. I thank you for the Journal of the Virga. Convention containing the Ratification of & proposed Amendments to the New Constitution(3)---;the proceedings of that Body were recd. here with every possible mark of Joy. This State is still in Session, what the result of their deliberations will be is as yet very uncertain. N. Carolina will doubtless adopt it. Congress are now engaged in taking measures for setting it in Motion. The Elections are to be held in Jany. next & the New Congress to meet in Feby---;I expect at Philada.(4) I am as yet uncertain which rout I shall take to Kentucky, as I expect to be governed by the State of the River. I propose to leave this about the tenth of August & hope to be at Danville the 1st of Septr. in order to attend Court at that term. In the mean[time] I propose to pay the Eastern States a Visit---;& shall set out in company with Genl. Knox for Boston tomorrow morning. I expect to continue my Journey as far as New-Hampshire & to return through Connecticut. I promise myself much pleasure in this excursion as I shall go part of the way by Sea a mode of travelling new to me. I [am] happy to hear of the wealfare of my fathers family & of my other Relations.

As I know you must have wrote me on the subject on which we conversed the last time I had the pleasure to see you, I wish you would be pleased to let me know by whom you sent your letter, for I have never reced it. Congress have now before them the report of a committee for the orginization of the new Government.(1) The gentlemen from the southward were urgent to postpone the Assembling of the Administration untill March. From a principle of concileation the northern members have acceded to it, but the same temper doth not prevail with regard to the place. The southern members excepting those of S. Carolina are anxious to Assemble at Philadelphia. To this measure I feel myself greatly opposed, because in the first place I beleive should congress there assemble that that city will thence become permanently the seat of Government, and in the next place I consider it as the most improper of any great town on the continent, because, it is the greatest commercial place in America, & because it is generally beleived that there exists in that town the undue influence inimical to the general good. Now whether this idea is well or ill founded the effect on the public mind will be precisely the same. Besides should the members of the legislature in that state be men of tolerable discernment they will be able to dictate in all the matters of national concern. August 1, 1788  Portrait of Theodore Sedgwick  Certainly the government ought not to be permanently established in any great town, nor in any place accessible by water.

I will still continue to address you in the language of friendship which is the language of my heart, you will therefore permit me to assure you, that my feelings towards you are presicely the same they were before the people in justice to your merits placed you in an exalted station.(2) The feelings of my heart were then towards you the dictates of pure & disinterested affection.

 My dear friend N. York July [August] 2d. 1788 Some of the letters herewith inclosed have been here for some time without my knowing it. The others came to hand yesterday. I have also in hand for you the Marquis Condorcet's essai on the probability of decisions resulting from plurality of voices,(1) which I understand from Mazzei is a gift from the Author. I shall forward it by the first conveyance. There are public letters just arrived from Jefferson. The contents are not yet known.(2) His private letters to me & others refer to his public for political news. I find that he is becoming more & more a friend to the new Constitution,(3) his objections being gradually dispelled by his own further reflections on the subject. He particularly renounces his opinion concerning the expediency of a ratification by 9 & a refusal by 4 States, considering the mode pursued by Massts. as the only rational one, but disapproving some of the alterations recommended by that State. He will see still more room for disapprobation in the recommendations of other States. The defects of the Constitution which he continues to criticize are the omission of a bill of rights, and of the principle of rotation at least in the Ex. Departmt. Congress have been some days on the question where the first meeting of the New Congs. shall be placed. Philada. failed by a single voice from Delaware which ultimately aimed at that place, but wished to bring Wilmington into view. In that vote N. Hampshire & Connecticut both concurred. N. York is now in nomination and if those States accede which I think probable, and Rhode Island which has as yet refused to sit in the Question can be prevailed on to vote which I also think probable, the point will be carried.

The calls of private want are seldom heard, or heard but faintly, amidst the louder cries of contending States & Cities---;& the Baron(2) may beg or want untill the competition between N. York & Philad. be decided. I thought I saw an end to this in the debates of the last week, but I then spoke my wishes rather than my experience, & forgot for a moment, that in deliberative assemblies, delay decides more questions than argument. I care much less about the effects of this policy upon the question, than upon myself for if it left me at liberty to see my Alida, I would play the generous game, and even join my voice to Hamilton's in preaching up it's propriety & necessity---;But as it is, you will not, I'm sure, blame me, for blaming it. I did & I propos'd---;& the moment I had clos'd my Conversation with you, I went to begin another with your two sweet sisters. I found them at Edward's---;well & happy in hearing you were so. I have since seen them as often within the week, as public business & private engagements would let me. Mary, Edward & Eliza are now on Long Island---;they went over on Friday, & return to-morrow.

I wish he may not eventually find it her pleasure to give pain. The 2d of August has come & gone & Jones is not here---;this is no otherways interesting to me than as a disappointment in not hearing from you. I had a thousand Questions to ask---;& as many to answer. I regarded it as a kind of Assignation---;Wish'd it with impatience, kept it with punctuality & so far gavemyself up to fancy, as to blame you for what, if it were a fault, could only be ascribed to Jones. You will I'm sure make but one inference from this---;& that is the pleasure you will give in letting me hear from you once a week at least. The post will be a safe & a speedy conveyance (When others do not present them- August 4, 1788  selves)---;& your delicacy be entirely preserv'd by either varying your own hand, or employing that of another in writing the direction.

With you I equally regret that interuption which our Correspondence to me so agreeable must shortly suffer---; this I fear is the last I shall be able to write you untill my arrival in Kentucky. I expect to set out in a few days & shall go by the way of F Pitt unless I shall hear that the River is too low to permit my passage, in that case I shall pass through Winchester & either through Greenbrier or Holston as may appear most advisable. From that Country (should I arrive in Safety) you shall hear from me as soon as possible. Your fears respecting N York are obviated, the agreeable News of their adoption must have reached you before this time. We daily expect good News from N Carolina. Rhode Island have not yet taken any measures since their partial rejection but think they shortly will be convinced of the Necessity of adopting. Your sentiments relative to Kentucky are rather alarming---;but I hope there is too much good Sense in that Country to let any ill founded prejudices lead them into intemperate Measures. My wish is that they may not fall into confusion by divided Councils & like Frankland experience the banefull effects of irritated Factions & Civil War. Upon a review of their Situation I am inclined to think they will find it necessary to assume their Independence & to organize their internal Govt. This Step appears to me to be advisable & necessary to secure unanimity & prevent licentiousness & cannot have any effect to prevent their application for admission into the Union under the New Govt. which must require aconsiderable length of time to bring it about in a Constitutional way. A Connection with foreign powers is certainly liable to many of the objections you mention & ought never to be thought of if to be avoided without a Sacrifice of Right. If the Western people can be put into possession of their Rights & secured in the enjoyment of them under the influence of the Genl. Government reason & gratitude & Justice dicta[te th]at their Allegiance should continue inviolate. But on the other hand if that Govt. is unable or unwilling to secure to them equal protection, Rights & Benifits, Reason points out the propriety of seeking these wherever they are to be found. My Journey to the Eastward was partly to gratify my Curiosity but more to discover the real Sentiments of the Eastern States relative to the Western Country, particularly respecting the Mississipi---;from my observations I do not  August 6, 1778  think we have any reason to fear a Sacrifice of that Right but I see no probability that any measures will be taken to put us in possession of it in any short time. The Spanish Ports are now open (by Curtesy) for their Fish. Were any attempt made to wrest the Mississipi out of their hands this advantage which is great would immediatly be denied & can we expect that those who attempted to sacrifice that Right for this advantage will now sacrifice this advantage by asserting that Right? We must place our dependence upon other measures which time & prud[ence] will dictate. Congress is now engaged in aranging the new Government. Electors are to be appointed the 1 Wedensday in Jany., to elect President 1st Wedensday in Feby & New Congress to meet 1st Wedensday in March. Where is yet uncertain---;it was determined at Baltimore, [...]t vote reconsider'd & tis doubtful whether this [...] or at this place. Great [...] upon this question & I fear may produce consequences unfavorable to the New Constitution by exerting disgust in some part of the Union. I enjoy my usual health & have been very happy; had a most agreeable trip to the eastward was treated with every mark of attention & hosp[i]tality & formed an acquaintance with the Principle Characters. Adieu be content & happy, J Brown ""

 [August 6? 1788](1) Whereas by the recommendation of the federal Convention assembled at Philadelphia, Congress are desired (inter alia) to fix the Place, where Proceedings are to commence under the federal Constitution, 1st <<And whereas, the States which have parted with all those Powers, which regulated their national & aggregate Interests, & which they have vested in the federal Government, have been fully pursuaded, that in so doing they have consulted their mutual advantage, by their consolidating & Strengthening the Powers of the Union,> 2 <<And whereas, it is essentially necessary to the Peace, Prosperity & Preservation of the Union, that in all the Arrangements made by Congress, the respective Interests & Accommodation of the States be impartially attended to,>  <<And Whereas, the Dangers that the Union has most to apprehend, arise from the unequal Portion of Strength, possessed by the Northern & Southern States, which involves the Necessity of taking Care that the Ambition of the  August 6, 1788  powerful Members, should not be accompanied by the Means, of degrading the Weak, & rendering them Subordinate & Dependent, which might tend to dissolve the Confederacy, as has happened with other political Leagues constituted on dissimilar Terms,> And whereas, the Power of regulating Commerce which may confine & monopolize the carrying Trade, and Establishing such high Duties on the Importation of foreign Articles of Consumption (in order to encourage the domestic Manufactures of the Country) as may operate as a Prohibition, may be exercised by the Seven navigating & manufacturing States alone, & which may be made the Engines of Severe oppression to the Southern States, & which renders it their Interest to guard against the Effects of such a Combination. 3 And whereas, the Southern States have been more Seriously alarmed on these, than on any other Points, & have Selected them, as inducing the strongest Objections to the federal Constitution; should therefore the Seat of Government be placed amongst the navigating & manufacturing States, it must evidently discompose the Harmony of the Union, by creating strong Apprehensions of an Influence & Cooperation of Interests, which would engender Commercial & Fiscal Regulations, exceedingly oppressive & injurious to them; the government would consequently commence in Distrust, proceed with jealousy, & possibly terminate in Discord; for if Influence, by facilitating the Means, gives the Opportunity, & a distinct & Separate Interest forms the Impulse, to concert & carry into Effect Schemes of Oppression, for any part of the Union, there is Nothing to depend upon, as an adequate Controul, to check the Inducements, that will exist to Sacrifice the weaker Party. That a Conjecture concerning the Extent of Influence is well founded, we need only recollect, that most of the Officers who will grow out of the Necessities of Revenue, & are an Appendage to that System, most of the Appointments of thefederal Judiciary, on whose Decision will depend the great Controversies, in which States both foreign & domestic will be Parties, as well as those betwixt Citizens of the different states; most of the Officers in the military Establishment of the Union, most of those, Superior & Subordinate, in the great Departments, will probably be chosen from the Inhabitants of the Surrounding District, as they will possess the Advantage of Soliciting & Supporting their Pretensions, by personal Application & Address, And whereas, there is great Cause of Alarm in the Facility with which a combined Force in the federal Legislature, if connected with the adjacent States, may be assembled, whenever any great Question to which they were attached, was to be agitated, or any great Point determined in which it was necessary to outnumber their Opponents, & accomplish the Secret Wishes of an interested Majority. It becomes an Object, therefore, deeply affecting the Interests of the Union, to determine, where the federal Government shall be   placed, to Satisfy the general Wishes, & consult the mutual Convenience of the Union; where, it will be the best Situated, to preserve the Confederacy by Suppressing Faction, guarding internal Tranquillity, & repelling external Invasion, for, if its Influence will be great in the first Years of its Establishment, by the Creation of numerous offices & the Enjoyment of a most extensive Patronage, Congress should so place it, that the first Fruits of its Benefits may circulate as equally as possible, & that it may equally diffuse its animating Effects. To answer this salutary purpose it must be placed in the Centre of the Union, from whence its Operation may diverge, & be proportionally felt throughout the whole Extent of the United States. If it is placed at a Distance from this central Point, its Foundation will be laid in extreme Partiality, & a View to local Aggrandizement & particular Interests, which Spirit, if too much cultivated in one part of the Union, must beget so unequal a Division of Strength, as must terminate, when aided by ambitious Views, in the Extinction of the Confederacy, or the Degredation of a considerable Portion of it. And whereas, it has been contended by very respectable Authority, that this Government was on too extended a scale, & that its Movements could not be sufficiently energetic to reach to, & controul the Extremities, & that the Reins of Government would consequently be relaxed at a Distance from the Seat of Empire. Now, to obviate this Objection as far as possible, & to satisfy every part of the Union, that there is an equal Attention paid to its Interests & Convenience, its Position should be fixed in the Midst of the Population of the Country, where, by strengthening the Centre, the Extremities are fortified; where, the collective resources of the Confederacy may be drawn into a Point, & administered with the greatest Facility; where, the speediest Intelligence of hostile Preparations & Movements may beobtained, & a military Force to oppose them, directed with the greatest Dispatch. By being thus Situated, the more Southern States, which are in the Neighbourhood of continual Danger from their Contiguity to the settlements of foreign Nations, as well as to hostile Tribes of Indians, will feel a Confidence, by knowing that the Government, to which they look up for Protection, is placed as near them, as the general Interests of the Country will permit. Besides, the frequent & necessary Communications betwixt the Members of the federal Legislature & their Constituents, will be thereby facilitated, as well as those, betwixt the Officers of the great Departments, & their respective Dependencies in the different states. And whereas, the Place where Congress resides should be free from Danger, & not exposed to the predatory naval Incursions of an Enemy, for without Such security the Functions of Government must be Suspended during an Alarm of War, untill a Place of Refuge can be found where the Deliberations of Congress could be free from Apprehension, & where its Records could be deposited in unmolested Security.  And whereas, the Objects that will press most on the Attention of the first Congress will be those of Commerce & Revenue; the Regulation of the former & Establishment of the latter, require the Government to be Situated in a maritime, opulent, & populous Country, as well to promote the success of the great operations of Finance, which essentially depend on the Confidence of the monied Interest, as to profit by the Institution of a Bank, which is an Engine of powerfull Effect to aid the fiscal Administration, by anticipating the Revenues of the Country, & facilitating the requisite Supplies to the Treasury. And whereas, Pennsylvania is not only the middle State that Separates the Union into equal Divisions, but is Situated in the very Centre of the national Population as must appear evident from the equal Number of senators and Representatives that the respective States in the Northward & Southward Districts, are, by the Constitution, entitled to Send to the federal Legislature, And whereas, by being thus critically placed in the Midst of the Union, it fortunately happens, that Pennsylvania is a State of great Resource & Vigor, inhabited by a frugal & industrious People, & is calculated to afford a respectable Weight to aid the Government, in counterposing the undue Preponderance of either the Northern or Southern Scale, as well as to furnish Assistance, by a well trained Militia, to any Part of the Union that may require it; altho these Circumstances which under the old Confederation, might beget a political Jealousy in other states, must under the federal Constitution become a Cause of Congratulation, as by the Consolidated System of Union, all the States are melted down into one great Mass of common undivided Interest, & the Benefits to be produced by the Exertions & local Advantages of one State, are proportionally participated of by all the others, more particularly, as the most productive Branches of Revenue are exclusively appropriated by the generalGovernment, And whereas, from the general Expectation throughout the United States, that Pennsylvania would be the state where Proceedings under the new Constitution would commence, which opinion was founded not only on its various Advantages, both local & political, its central & secure situation, but from its having been the Place, where the united voice of America fixed the first Congress, and where the United Voice of America assembled the federal Convention, the Convention of the State of Pennsylvania have voted for the Accommodation of Congress untill it has fixed a permanent Residence, the Use of all their public Buildings, Situate in Philadelphia, with an elegant Garden as an Appendage, occupying an entire Square, which Buildings, are Sufficiently extensive to Supply large & commodious Rooms for two deliberative Assemblies, as well as Offices for the Secretaries & the different departments.

 My dear Allida New York [August 7? 1788](1) I was this day sitting in a crowd of angry contending demagouges &  August 7, 1788  partaking but too much of the spirit which govern'd them when your charming letter of the 3d was presented to me. I had but barely time to run it over till the debate took a turn which brought with it a necessity for me to speak---; conjecture its effects. For the first time in my whole public life, I was able to subject my temper entirely to my understanding, to abstract the subject from everything personal, and to triumph over myself if not over my opponents. How great the obligation my dear Alida, and how strong the reason that you should write often, since you write with such effect. 'Tis true this may in one sense may be consider'd as accidental; as exactly such a concurrence of circumstances may not happen again; but others as important, and in which the exercise of good humor may be as necessary to success & Expectations as the exercise of good sence, turn up so frequently in the course of even every-day business, that a mind but moderately impress'd with the truth and importance of the remark, cannot wish for too many motives to gentleness and forbearance, nor too many guards against an opposite disposition. Accept then my dear Girl another Duty, and not only shape my opinions, but fashion my temper---;make it like your own, and I shall then become a permanent example of moderation to even deliberative Assemblies. But why question your ability to discharge the office I before assign'd you---;or why suppose that greater intimacy can dissolve a charm founded in qualities which it is the effect of Time to strengthen and extend? No Alida I have neither mistaken you nor myself---;those qualities you possess, and 'tis human nature to love and admire in proportion as we approach and enjoy them. \""I have already experienc'd (you say) that we cannot journey thro' this life without making some sacrifices and the sooner we accustom ourselves to consider them as duties the more willingly shall we perform them. And (you add) do you not already discover the effect of my imaginary influence.\"" And letme ask in turn whether it is by writing maxims of so much wisdom & elegance as this that you mean to prove that your real influence either will or ought to be less? however you may have intended it---;it is evidence eno' to me that it will, as it should, be greater. Yes my fair philosopher \""the web of this life is of mingled yarn, good & ill together,\"" and we must sacrafice as well as enjoy. Yet conscious as I am of the truth of the fact, I know not when I have been more unwilling to submit to it's necessity. With every wish to be at Clermont I must yet be here, and here for the miserable purpose of pleading a State Interest, and carrying a City point. For strip the question that has so much warm'd and agitated us for 10 days past, of local interests and personal views---;'tis a Meer Bagatelle whether the new Congress be conven'd at Philada. or N York. Tis such incidents that so much disgust me with the political walk, and make me so often enquire whether upon the whole \""the   post of honor is not a private Station.\"" On this point however I will only add, that wretched as the subject of our debates is, it is not yet exhausted, and after determining on Baltimore one day and New York the next,(2) all is again afloat, and as much uncertainty prevailing when we shall end or where we shall settle as at the first moment the discussion began. I hope my second letter (of Sunday last)(3) has not been so tardy in its passage to you as the first. I have often heard complaints of the post-office---;and should this instance be repeated, I shall begin to add mine to the number. The delay was there. But did you really resort to Job for instruction? Could I seperate the idea of pain from impatience or could I believe that it were possible for you to have felt the one without suffering some degree of the Other I am almost wicked eno' to wish it as ineffectual as advice usually is. Does not this illustrate some one of Rochefocault's maxims? 'Tis certainly somewhat tinctur'd with the selfish principle of his erroneous creed, and I retract it. I dined with Mary & Edward today. They are well tho' a good deal scorch'd & fatigued by their Rhode Island Trip. John has been very unwell for some days past, a slight fever & swelld face---;not love---;have been his complaints. I this moment parted from Mrs. Lewis & her little daughter at Mrs. Jay's---;& shall pass such part of to-morrow wt. her as I shall be able to steal from public engagements, Affecty. yours, J.A. ""

 My dear sir, New York August 7 1788 My last Letter(1) informed you that the Town of Baltimore had been fixed on by Congress as the Place for commencing Proceedings under the new Government. As this was a Southern Position, uniting the Suffrages of the Seven southern states, it was expected that it would have been retained, untill the Eastern States made overtures to accommodate, by offering Philadephia as an alternative, in which they would concur. But our Expectations were defeated by the Defection of So Carolina, which State, on a Motion to Strike out Baltimore & insert New York, gave an unreserved Concurrence, from an Idea Suggested that Baltimore was only a circuitous Route to Philadelphia. So violent are their Antipathies to this latter Place.(2) August 7, 1788  The Delegates of Rhode Island, who are Strong Antifederalists, & whose state has formally rejected the Constitution, were Seduced into a Vote, (which was requisate to compleat the Stipulated Number to insure Success) to put a Government in Motion, highly inimical to their Views. The Indecency of Such Conduct Struck even their own Partisans with Astonishment. But a determination on the Place, is only one part of the Ordinance; the Periods, on which the Electors & the President are to be chosen &c, constitute very essential Objects, which they absolutely declined having any Agency in determining. It becomes necessary after the various Parts of the Ordinance have been individually deliberated on, & assented to, that a Question Should be taken on the whole, which has no Authenticity untill it receives the sanction of Seven States. A Sense of the Striking Impropriety of concurring in an Act of this Nature, has determined the Delegates of the State of Rhode Island not to vote on this Question, more especially as it is clearly evident that they have no right---;they have made this Declaration in Congress. The Consequence will be that Seven States will not be found, who will concur in the Ordinance, whilst New York continues the destined Place for assembling the new Congress. This must Stagger the Minds of the Eastern Delegates, who are convinced that the present Arrangement is an Act of Partiality & Oppression to the Southern States, & has a View to local Aggrandizement at the Expence of a considerable Part of the Union. Thus Stand Affairs at present---;What will be the result---;Time will discover---;the various Vicissitudes that have already occurred in the progress of this Business, leave no Room for probable Conjecture. At any rate, there is an Appearance of a longer Detention, which for Several reasons, has become very inconvenient.

 My Dear Sir, New York, August 9th 1788. The last letter which I had the pleasure to receive from you is dated the 23d of October, 1785, now almost three years---;a long time indeed, so much so, that I begin to be apprehensive some untoward accident has befallen. What most naturally strikes me is, that probably the channel at Hamburg, through which by your desire I have always directed to you, is interrupted by death or otherwise or that I have mistaken the address. I wrote to you in September last year,(1) enclosed your Diploma for the Cincinnati, & a proposed plan of our new Government. I also informed you pretty minutely what quantity of the Certificates you transmitted to me came to hand---;the depreciation certificate never arrived. A number of the most respectable officers of the New England line have actually gone to Settle at Muskingum, have laid out a city, & are August 9, 1788  busy surveying their lands. I mentioned to you my having invested most of your property in that company. I believe your share will amount to near 2,000 acres---;a city lot, & an out-lot of 8 acres; also 80 acres at the Falls of the Hockhocking. I much fear the progress of that Colony will be interrupted if not totally checked for a time---;tho' the Indians have been already repeatedly treated with; and at their own request, one was to have been held this month at Muskingum, as they expressed themselves, to clear up and finally adjust all matters in dispute; yet they commit daily murders---;& have been so extremely audacious as to attack the guard that was carrying provision to feed them at the Treaty; it is, therefore, at this moment doubtful whether any treaty will take place. But if they will not treat & be peaceable too, they are hastening their fate---;Delenda Est Carthago. Two Campaigns well conducted will drive them over the Mississippi. There are two tracts of land set apart to satisfy the Bountys for the late army---;I mean the Continental---;of a million acres each---;one taking in the forks of Muskingum, & the other at the mouth of the Wabash. They will be laid out, I expect, next year, so that you still have one chance left that your lot may fall at Mohickon John's Town. If a general Indian War should take place, it will procrastinate the whole of this business. Our new plan of Government is acceded to by all the states except N. Carolina & Rhode Island: The Convention of the former is now sitting, & an account of their adoption is hourly looked for. The new Congress will meet next March---;where, is not yet fixed---;perhaps in this city---;perhaps Philadelphia---;& not improbably Lancaster, but Either is only meant as temporary: a permanent India City is hereafter to be laid out, which, in my opinion, will be on the bank of the Susquehanna or Potomac---;possibly Carlisle. My time in Congress will expire the 1st of November next. We have establisheda regular post to Fort Pitt, so that should you write, address me in Carlisle in Pennsylvania---;no matter what Post Office it first reaches. Kentucky has increased so rapidly that the State of Virginia has joined them in an application to Congress to be erected into an Independent State. I am well persuaded that unless the Indian war puts a stop to emigration, one or more States will be set upon the Ohio in less than ten years. I wrote you last May(2) a short note by Mr. Paradise, bound to France, who promised to forward it to Hamburgh; my letter of last year was by the Chevalier Paul Jones: This goes by London, which is a reason for not being so particular as I could venture to be through another channel---;indeed, my chief object at present is, to try in what channel there is most certainty of reaching you.  I am dear sir, your very sincere friend, Wm. Irvine  P.S. Should our new plan of Government succeed, which I have little doubt of, it is not unlikely that something may be done in the mercantile plan you hinted at, in your letter of October, 1785; but I think it will be more probable that my son Callender will help to carry it into execution than myself: He is now at College, is 14 years old, & I hope will be graduated in three years. More of this when I shall again have the happiness of a line from you. ""

 Dear Sir New York August 10th. 1788 Your favor of the 28th May(1) came to hand a few days ago for which accept my warmest Acknowledgements. I am well convinced of the Justness of your remarks respecting the importance of strengthening & maintaining the connection between the District of Kentucky & the Maritime States. During my residence in that Country it was my constant care to cultivate that Idea But I am sorry to inform you that from the present complection of affairs there is reason to apprehend that the Connection will not be of long duration. Congress have rejected their application to be admitted into the Union as an Independent State notwithstanding it was acknowledged to be reasonable---;thinking it inexpedient in the present State of the Confederacy & that the admission of a New State might affect the Ballance of power unless Vermont could be brought forward at the same time. This will be considered by the people of that Country as a great disappointment inasmuch as they have been more than three years in bringing forward this application & as they are now refered to the new Government, to be admitted under which in a Constitutional Mode must necessarily be attended with considerable delay. Their vast increase in population (amounting to at least one hundred thousand souls in that District alone) added to the great danger & difficulty attending a communication with the Seat of Government renders their connection with Virginia so burdensom that there is every reason to expect that immediately on hearing that Congress have refused to receive them they will assume their Independence. Should they take this Step I think it very problematical whether or not they will apply for admission into the new Confederacy; especially as they are generally opposed to the new Constitution apprehending much inconvenience & danger from the Judicial System & fearing that the Powers vested in  August 10, 1788  the General Government may enable to carry into effect the proposed Treaty with Spain relative to the Navigation of the Mississipi. Indeed the ill advised attempt to cede the navigation of that River has laid the foundation for the dismemberment of the American Empire by distroying the confidence of the people in the Western Country in the Justice of the Union & by inducing them to dispair of obtaining possession of that Right by means of any other exertions than their own. However as we are informed by the Governour of the Western Territory that there is great reason to apprihend a general Indian War, I hope that Kentucky will see the danger & impropriety of breaking off from the Union at this time & that it may still be in the power of Congress to conciliate their minds & to secure their attachment to the Confederacy. I inclose you two Gazettes containing the Ratifications of the New Constitution by Virginia & New York.(2) The Convention of N Carolina has been for some time past in Session & we daily expect to hear that she has adopted it. Rhode Island it is expected will shortly see the propriety of acceeding, as yet there is a majority in that State opposed. Those who were opposed in those States which have ratifyed appear generally to acquiess. Congress has been for some time past engaged in giving it operation. Electors are to be appointed on the first Wedensday in January, to chuse a President on the first Wedensday in February & the New Congress to meet on the first Wedensday in March next but the place where has been the subject of much warmth & is not yet agreed upon---;tho I think it probable that it will be at Philadelphia. I expect to sit out in a few days for the Western Country(3) shall take pleasure in communicating to you the News of that Country by every opportunity. Should you be so good as to honor me with a letter it will find a ready conveyance from New York to me by Post. Before I conclude this letter I must in Justice to my feelingsexpress my gratitude for the many favors I have recd. from you; be assured that they have made a lasting impression upon my mind, & that it is in a great measure to your friendship & Instruction that I am indebted for my Sucess in life.

 My dear Sir, New York Augt. 10. 1788 Having but a few Minutes notice of this opportunity by Mr. Tillier I can make but little more use of it, than to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 27th of May, and to send you the second Vol. of the FOEderalist. The first, I hope, you have received before this.(1) Virginia & New York have both adopted the Constitution, as you will be more particularly informed by Mr. Madison & Mr. Brown, who have written you. North Carolina commenced her session on the 17th Ult. and is probably the 12th Adopting State before this day. Rhode Island has taken no regular Step in the business as yet---;a kind of informal reference of it was made to the people by the Legislature, which terminated something like a rejection. I suppose however that she must soon take measures for adopting. Perhaps no coercive measures would be pursued to compel her, but it is impossible she can continue to treat with contempt a measure which is so generally embraced by the other States. The good fortune of the Chevalier Jones in the service of the Empress gives me much pleasure. Your hint respecting a similar promotion here, shall be attended if there shall appear, in the Course of the present session of Congress, a prospect of succeeding in an attempt to procure it.(2) I regret however that whilst foreign Nations are contending for eminence in confering distinctions upon this officer, This, of which he professes himself a Citizen, should appear, scarcely, to remember the events which founded his Character.

 My dear sir. New York August 10th. [17]88. We have the pleasure of having received just now your letter of the 20th July, but our joy is much diminished by the information it contains, relative to your own health. We hope sincerely that long since you have recovered from the severe fit under which you laboured when you wrote your letter, & that it has concluded this visit of the gout. Your account of the prospect of our crop is very pleasing but since the date of this intelligence, has happend the violent storm, whose effects I so much apprehended, & of which I have not yet heard. Whenever you see Carter pray press him to make ample provision of hay for winter use, & when you see Panton urge him to finish my house in due season for our return, which will be in October. Congress are yet engaged concerning the temporary residence of the fOEderal Govt. N York will probably succeed notwithstanding the ardent love which so many bear to Philada. & therefore Potomac will have a good chance for the permanent residence. At all events I think that the ten miles square may be to the south of the Susquehannah which will assist in its consequences very much the trade of the Chesapeak. Mrs. Lee desires me to tell you expressly that she has undergone a change much for the better, that she feels the most grateful sense of your constant endeavors to restore her health, & that she hopes to be able to manifest for a length of years the love she bares to you, to her aunt & her other friends of Chantilly. Is Henry weaned.  Adieu, most truely yours, H. Lee 11th August. Mrs. Lee is unwell this morning. The burning & tingling has returned. ""

 Dear Sir New York Augst. 10. 1788 Mr Warville(1) has just arrived here, and I seize an opportunity suddenly brought to my knowledge to thank you for your several favors, and particularly for the pedomiter. Answers to the letters must be put off for the next opportunity. My last went off just as a vote was taken in the Convention of this State which foretold the ratification of the new Government. The latter act soon followed and is inclosed.(2) The form of it is remarkable. I inclose also a circular address to the other States on the subject of August 10, 1788  amendments, from which mischeifs are apprehended.(3) The great danger in the present crisis is that if another Convention should be soon assembled, it would terminate in discord, or in alterations of the federal system which would throw back essential powers into the State Legislatures. The delay of a few years will assuage the jealousies which have been artificially created by designing men and will at the same time point out the faults which really call for amendment. At present the public mind is neither sufficiently cool nor sufficiently informed for so delicate an operation. The Convention of North Carolina met on the 21st. Ult. Not a word has yet been heard from its deliberations. Rhode Island has not resumed the subject since it was referred to & rejected by the people in their several Towns. Congress have been employed for several weeks on the arrangements of times & place for bringing the new Government into agency. The first have been agreed on though not definitively, & make it pretty certain that the first meeting will be held in the third week in March. The place has been a subject of much discussion, and continues to be uncertain. Philada. as least excentric of any place capable of affording due accomodations and a respectable outset to the Government was the first proposed. The affirmative votes were N. Hampshire, Connecticut, Pena., Maryd., Virga. and N. Carolina. Delaware was present & in favor of that place, but one of its delegates wishing to have a question on Wilmington previous to a final determination, divided that State and negatived the motion. N. York came next in view, to which was opposed first Lancaster which failed, and then Baltimore which to the surprize of every body was carried by seven States, S. Carolina which had preferred N. York to the two other more Southern positions, unexpectedly concurring in this. The vote however was soon rescinded, the State of S. Carolina receding from, the Eastern States remonstrating against, and few seriouslyurging the eligibility of Baltimore. At present the question lies as it was originally supposed to do between N. York & Philada. and nothing can be more uncertain than the event of it. Rhode Island which alone was disposed to give the casting vote to N. York has refused to give any final vote for arranging & carrying into effect a system to which that State is opposed, and both the Delegates have returned home.  Col. Carrington tells me he has sent you the first volume of the federalist, and adds the 2d by this conveyance. I believe I never have yet {mentioned to you that publication}.(4) It {was undertaken last fall by Jay, Hamilton and myself}. The {proposal came from the two former}. The {execution was thrown by the sickness of Jay mostly on the two others}. Though {carried in concert the writers are not mutually answerable} for {all the ideas of each other} there being {seldom time for even a perusal} of the {pieces by any but the writer before they were wanted at the press} and {sometimes hardly by the writer himself}. August 11, 1788  I have not a moment for a line to Mazzei. Tell him I have recd his books & shall attempt to get them disposed of. I fear his calculations will not be fulfilled by the demand for them here in the French language. His affair with Dorhman stands as it did. Of his affair with Foster Webb, I can say nothing. I suspect it will turn out badly. Yrs. Affecly., Js. Madison Jr ""

 My dear friend N. York Augst. 11. [17]88 The length of the interval since my last has proceeded from a daily expectation of being able to communicate the arrangements for introducing the New Government. The times necessary to be fixt by Congress have been many days agreed on.(1) The place of meeting has undergone many vicisitudes and is still as uncertain as ever. Philada. was first named by a member from Connecticut, and was negatived by the voice of one from Delaware, who wished to make an experiment for Wilmington. New York came next into view. Lancaster was opposed to it & failed. Baltimore was next tried and to the surprise of every one had seven votes, S. Carolina joining the Southern States & Penna. in the question. It was not difficult to foresee that such a vote could not stand. Accordingly the next day, N. York carried it on a second trial, and at present fills the blank. Its success however was owing to Rhode Island whose delegates have refused to vote on the final question & have actually gone home. There are not at present seven States for any place, and the result must depend (Unless R. Island shd. return with instructions as is given out) on the comparative flexibility of the Northern & Southern Delegations. In ordinary cases this  August 11, 1788  would not augur well to the latter. In the existing one something may be hoped from the palpable unreasonableness of the pretensions of N. York, which has 17 Reps. & 8 Senators on one side agst. 42 Reps. & 16 Senators on the other; which is not more than three hundred miles from the Eastern Extreme Metropolis and not less than 4 times that distance from the Southern, and which has no reference at all to the accomodation of the Western Country. I am persuaded also that if the first position be taken here the second will not be taken on the Potowmac & that this consideration is among the motives of those who advocate N. York. Indeed I know the latter to be one of the motives. The inclosed receipt is from the Commander of a Vessel bound to Richmd. who has charge of a Box for you containing 6 Copies of Mazzei's book,(2) 2 of which are for yourself, the other four for Wythe, Blair, Bellini & Oster, and 25 other Copies which he wishes to be disposed in Virginia. The price is not mentioned. You will therefore fix the price and put the books into the hands of some dealer in that article for Sale. I have on hand a hundred & odd copies besides to dispose of here in Philada., Boston & Charlestown. The box contains also Condorcet, and a book of Accounts sent you by Col. Carrington. I have red. your favor of the 27 Ult. I hope this will find you fully restored to health. The interruption of it which I did not know before accounts for that in the papers begun in defence of the Constitution.(3) I shall now look for [a] continuation. The papers published here under the n[ame] of Publius are not additional to those in the 2 Vol[ume] but a continuation of the Newspaper publication of the same. Yours Always & most affetly, Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir New York Augst. 11. 1788 I have been duly favored with yours of the 3d instant.(1) The length of the interval since my last has proceeded from a daily expectation of being able to communicate the final arrangements for introducing the new Government. The place of meeting has undergone much dis- August 11, 1788  cussion as you conjectured and still remains to be fixed. Philada. was first named, & negatived by a voice from Delaware. N. York came forward next. Lancaster was opposed to it & failed. Baltimore was next tried and to the surprise of every one had seven votes. It was easy to see that that ground had it been free from objections was not maintainable. Accordingly the next day N. York was inserted in the place of it with the aid of the vote of Rhode Island. Rhode Island however has refused to give a final vote in the business and has actually retired from Congress. The question will now be resumed between N. York & Philada. It was much to be wished that a fit place for a respectable outset to the Govt. could be found more central than either. The former is inadmissible if any regard is to be had to the Southern or Western Country. It is so with me for another reason, that it tends to stop the final & permanent seat short of the Potowmac certainly, and probably in the State of N. Jersey. I know this to be one of the views of the Advocates for N. York. The only chance the Potowmac has is to get things in such a train that a coalition may take place between the Southern & Eastern States on the subject, and still more that the final seat may be undecided for two or three years, within which period the Western & S. Western population will enter more into the estimate. Wherever Congress may be, the choice if speedily made will not be sufficiently influenced by that consideration. In this point of view I am of opinion Baltimore would have been unfriendly to the true object. It would have retained Congress but a moment, so many States being North of it, and dissatisfied with it, and would have produced a coalition among those States, a precipitate election of the permanent seat & an intermediate removal to a more northern position.  You will have seen the circular letter from the Convention of this State.(2) It has a most pestilent tendency. If an Early General Conventioncannot be parried, it is seriously to be feared that the system which has resisted so many direct attacks may be at last successfully undermined by its enemies. It is now perhaps to be wished that Rho. Island may not accede till this new crisis of danger be over. Some think it would have been better if even N. York had held out till the operation of the Government could have dissipated the fears which artifice had created and the attempts resulting from those fears & artifices. We hear nothing yet from N. Carolina more than comes by the way of Petersburg. With the highest respect & attachment I remain Dr Sir, Your affecte. servt., Js. Madison Jr. ""

 My Dear Sir(1) New York Aug 12. 1788 We have a question of very great importance depending in Congress, in which the vote of your state would be decisive. It relates to the place of meeting of the future Congress---;Six states and a half prefer New York five and a half Philadelphia. When your delegates were here they voted with us on the intermediate questions; but when the final question came to be put Mr. Hazard's scruples prevailed over his inclination for New York.(2) He however gave me to hope he would return in a short time. Mr. Arnold would have made no difficulty whatever if his colleague would have gone with him; but he could not be prevailed upon to do it. This is a matter of such moment not only to this state but to the Northern states in general that I have taken the liberty to address you on the subject, to request that every effort may be made to induce a representation of your state to come forward without loss of time. I am persuaded that the meeting of Congress here or at Philadelphia would make a difference on your politics and would facilitate or impede, as the one or the other place should obtain, the adoption of the Constitution in your state. The intimate intercourse between us and you makes us look up to you as to a natural ally in this matter. August 12, 1788  A doubt might perhaps be raised about your right to a vote under the present circumstances.(3) There is not a member of Congress but one who has even pretended to call your right in question. 'Tis agreed generally that the power of organising the government is given by the ratifying states to the United States in Congress assembled, who are mere agents under a special authority and therefore the non adopting states stand on the same footing with the adopting. Nor can the exercise of that right operate in any manner upon your situation. If the United States should even be considered as a foreign power, you might have a choice in such a question. Hazard I believe is softening, so that I should not think it politic to make any representation of his conduct which might irritate him. What is here said respecting him must therefore be received in confidence as indeed must be this whole letter. If any difficulty about expence should arise I will with pleasure accept a draft on me. You will excuse this intimation which arises from my information that your state has not made provision for its delegates & from a knowlege that individuals have been torn to pieces by your tender laws &c.

 Sir New York August 14th 1788 My present writing is not dictated by an eagerness to make unpleasant communications but by the united principles of duty and inclination to give your Excellency the earliest notice of every important occurrance. From North Carolina we have no official accounts or authentic letters but the inclosed advertizer announces the very unexpected intelligence of a rejection of the new System by a large Majority of the Convention of that State.(1) This report may not be true, yet it becomes me to remark that the delegates in Congress from that State seem to entertain no doubts on the Subject. Mr. Williamson observes that the opposition are of those who are the Zealous advocates for a paper Currency, that has depreciated fifty per Cent, and who are determined to keep it up untill their debts are paid. This ungracious occurrance is therefore another striking instance of the baleful effects of that fluctuating medium. The Ordinance for organizing the new government is not yet complete owing to the desertion of Rhode Island before the final Question was taken. I fear we shall not be able to induce the Southern States to meet earlier than the first of March. New York will probably be the place of meeting; but of this I cannot pronounce with Certainty. Of foreign affairs---;I have only to remark generally that the disposition for hostilities does not at all relax---;and that a general war will ensue seems to be the prevailing opinion in France.

 Sir New York Augt. 16th. 1788 Having receiv'd your Excellency's Letter of the 18th July accompanied by Papers relating to the Negociation of Peace with the southern Indians, we laid the Subject before Congress without Delay & obtain'd a Resolution for continuing Genl. Winn in the Office of Superinten- August 16, 1788  dant of Indian Affairs for 3 months after the 29th of August.(1) With respect to the other Objects connected with this Business & recommended by your Excellency to our Consideration, we have used our utmost Diligence, being fully sensible of it's high Importance to the Welfare of the Southern States. The Resolutions of Congress on the Subject we now enclose, & hope they will prove satisfactory & adequate to their Situation.(2) Having no Power to enforce Compliance from the State of North Carolina, we cou'd find no other Method of guarding against the evil Consequences of her Neglect, than that which is adopted in the last Resolution. Congress having before taken into serious Consideration the Continuance of Hostilities by the Creek Indians, did authorize the Superintendant to inform them, if necessary, that the Arms of the United States wou'd be employ'd to bring them to reasonable Terms of Accommodation.(3) The Secretary at War was at the same time required to report a plan for conducting the War, if it shou'd be inevitable. The Application of the State of Virginia & District of Kentucky, on the Subject of erecting the latter into a separate State, having been consider'd by Congress, a Resolution was pass'd, approving the Measure & recommending the farther prosecution of it under the new Government, as being alone competent to it's actual Accomplishment.(4) Congress having pass'd a Resolution to allow a farther Term of 3 months to the several States for delivering in their Claims upon the United States, a Copy of the same has been forwarded to your Excellency from the Secretary's Office.(5) The Act of Cession of western Territory by the State of Georgia being clogg'd with Conditions which were not thought proper to be acceded to by Congress, it was determined not to accept it but on other specified Conditions which were deem'd more eligible.(6) The Ratification of the new Constitution by the State of New Hampshire, making the 9th State, having been receiv'd,Congress immediately proceeded to the Consideration of the Measures recommended by the late general Convention as preparatory to the Meeting of the new Legislature. It is with regret that we find ourselves yet unable to communicate to your Excellency the final Result of the Deliberations on this Subject. After much Time spent in Debate on the several Periods to be fixt & the place for the first Meeting of the new Congress, a Set of Resolutions were at length compleated, which separately obtain'd the Approbation of the House, but on taking the Question upon the whole it unfortunately pass'd in the negative, so that the Business remains still undetermined. In the Resolutions alluded to, the first Wednesday in January next was fixt for the Appointment of   Electors, the first Wednesday in February for the Electors to assemble in the respective States & give their Votes for a President, the first Wednesday in March for the Meeting of the new Congress, & the City of New York for the place of Meeting. With respect to the Periods just mention'd, we flatter ourselves there will be no farther Debate, & we are the more inclined to wish so, as we had much Difficulty in getting the first (which is the most important) so well adapted to the Convenience of our State. It is indeed not intirely as we wou'd have had it, but it is much better than we had reason to expect, considering the Impossibility of avoiding Inconvenience to many of the States. Under this Arrangement our Legislature will be enabled to establish any Mode they may think proper for the Appointment of Electors, without the Necessity of either an extraordinary Meeting or a protracted Session. A Day somewhat later in the same Month wou'd probably have been more convenient, but that we were not able to obtain. The Difference of Opinion with regard to the place of Meeting, we apprehend, may still occasion some Trouble. On this Subject we have only to add, that since the Commencement of the proceedings thereon, Congress have receiv'd the Instruments of Ratification by the States of Virginia & New York. A Resolution of Congress appointing Mr. Joseph Martin Agent with the Cherokee Indians to act in Conjunction with the Superintendant for the southern Department, has been transmitted to your Excellency from the Secretary's Office.(7) We observe with much Concern that the latest Accounts from the Governor of the western Territory express much Doubt of the friendly Disposition of the Indian Tribes there & of the Success of the intended Negociation with them. Such Irregularities have been committed, by some of them, that Congress has thought proper to direct preparations for repelling their Attacks, & to require the Cooperation of some of the Militia of Virginia &Pennsylvania, if eventually it shou'd become expedient to employ them.(8) Measures having been taken by Congress to secure to the Officers & Soldiers of the late Army the Bounty Lands to which they are intitled,(9) it becomes our Duty to call the Attention of our Legislature to this Subject, that they may determine whether it is their Intention that the South Carolina Line to whom Bounty Lands have been granted by an Act of the State, shou'd also avail themselves of the Grants to be made by Authority of Congress. Shou'd this not be the Case, the Lands intended by Congress for the South Carolina Line, will become the property of the State, so far as the Act of the State has had Operation, & it will be necessary that some Steps be taken to establish their Claim. Shou'd we receive Instructions on this Subject, we shall immediately lay them before Congress, & endeavour to get the Business settled to the Satisfaction & Benefit of the State. Shou'd we not be in- August 17, 1788  structed, we shall conclude that the Legislature is content that the Lands shou'd be granted to the Individuals agreeable to the Ordinance of Congress, which does not take into View the Provision made by our Law. As every Question which involves in it a Construction of any of the constitutional Powers of Congress not clearly defined by the Articles of Confederation, is of Importance to the Legislatures of the several States, we find it incumbent on us to mention that in consequence of an Application from the Executive of Pennsylvania, Congress thought proper to order that a Detachment of Continental Troops in their March to the Westward shou'd so alter their Route as to pass into Luzerne County in that State & halt there for a limited time, with a View to assist, if it shou'd be necessary, in quieting the Commotions there. By a Letter since receiv'd, Congress are inform'd that this Measure is no longer deem'd necessary.(10) We are with much Respect, Your Excellency's Most obedt. Servts., Dl. Huger John Parker Thos.

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 18th 17[88] I should have acknowledged the receipt of your favor of the 22d of April immediately, but that I expected to get up to Pittsburgh before you left it, when I arrived there & found Mr. Duncan had gone down with you, as had authority to act for me with himself, & I did not wish to trouble you knowing you would be much engaged in the new scenes you had undertaken---;add to this the fluctuating state of things in that quarter, particularly an apprehension that that there was some  August 18, 1788  doubt whether the attempt to treat with the Indians would be successfull, of course too precarious to commence expensive operations. But as you will soon now be able to ascertain with more certainty what the result of the treaty will be and Mr. Duncan is still on the spot, and General Butler having examined the Water &ca you will probably be able to come to a conclusion before you seperate, I will write to Mr. Duncan to make such advances as may be necessary on my part & his. I enquired at Genl. Butler what kind of public securities & the quantity, necessary to be procured, as I might probably do it most conveniently when here, but he could not inform me certainly---;This therefore Mr. Duncan must also learn from you. [As the sta]tes except Rhode Island and North Carolina have adopted the new Government, accounts have Just arrived here that the latter have rejected by 100 of a majority in their Convention. Congress have been employed some time on an Ordinance for organizing the Government---;which was all pretty easily gone through til the plan of meeting of the new Congress became a question, since which there has been a stagnation, many plans have been proposed & rejected, some agreed to then reconsidered, in short there has been on this subject hitherto little spirit of accommodation shewn---;at present this business is suspended, in part occasioned by a kind of abdication of the Rhode Island Delegates, who did not think themselves at liberty to vote on the final question for organizing the Government, as their State had rejected, tho they did on the place of meeting---;some say they are to return with instructions, but I hope without, a greater degree of harmony will prevail.

 Hond Sir N. York Aug. 18. [17]88. I have recd. your favor of the 9th(1) inclosing a paper from Mr. Triplet.(2) The case is stated so imperfectly that it is impossible for me to take any step for bringing it before Congress, if that should be  August 18, 1788  proper. Mr. R. Morris I am told will be here soon, and I shall endeavour then to supply the omitted circumstances. In the meantime Mr. Triplet may either make out a fuller statement & forward it, or wait till he hears from me on the subject. I have had no opportunity of doing any thing as to Anthony, since my last. John continues to decline. I think he is in a consumption, and will not stand it very long. No late news of consequence has come from Europe. The war appears to be going on between the two imperial Courts & the Turks. And the affairs of France portend a serious struggle between the royal authority & the spirit of liberty. We just learn the fate of the Constitution in N. Carolina. Rho. Island is however her only associate in the opposition, and it will be hard indeed if those two States should endanger a system which has been ratified by the eleven others. Congress have not yet finally settled the arrangements for putting the new Government in operation. The place for its first meeting creates the difficulty. The Eastern States with N. York contend for this City. Most of the other States insist on a more central position. Tell my brother Ambrose if you please that he must draw on Mr. Shepherd for the price of the Negro boy for the French Marchioness.(3) On a second & more accurate examination of my papers I have found your loan office certificates.

 Dear sir(1) New York 18th Augt 1788. In yours of 28th June which did not come to Hand till on this Month you mention the Enquiries to be made concerning Bondfields Affairs. This I have don[e] to my own Satisfaction. I don't pretend to say that none of the Parties have received Payment, but having once claimed the Debt I think they are resolved uniformly to persevere in the Hope that there is no Proof to the contrary. Mr. Archd. Corrie having been at Edenton and recd Payment there admits the Payment and had he recd. the Paymt here it is at least possible that he would have ranked among the Creditors. Those Tories, for such the Creditors are every Hoof of them, seem to think that all Play is fair to recover by civil Process against those who worsted them by military Process or their Heirs. I need not put you in mind that there is a Statute of Limitation. This may occasionally save a man who would otherwise be defrauded by dorment Claims. Inclosed is a news Paper which gives you a sample of the Remarks on the unfortunate State of NC.(2) We shall often have the comfort of seeing ourselves classed with the honest & honourable State of Rhode Island. But having chosen its Company the State cannot complain of the classmen. He who associates with Thieves must expect to be accounted dishonest.

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 18. 1788. I had the pleasure on the 12 of July ulto. of receiving your favor of the 26 of June; but while I was happy in the information I received from you, of your welfare & That of your family, my joy was allayed by the news which accompanyed it from Major Hodgdon of your unexpected sufferings from the rioters in that country.(1) The account of your situation filled the minds of your friends with the greatest anxiety and very impatient were we until we heard of your release. I did not indeed think that, vile as those banditti were, they would venture to take your life or inflict direct injury on your person, further than by holding you in confinement; But considering your situation from the manner in which you was siezed, the hardships to which you must whilst in their savage power be exposed, & the painful a[n]xiety of your family at home, these & many other accidental circumstances must afflict you, & render your confinement extremely trying & painful. I have the great satisfaction now of writing to you and congratulating you on your safe return to your family & friends. We had an early rumour, of your being set at liberty, but no certain account until a letter from the Executive of Pennsylvania to their Delegates in Congress announced it. I had forwarded to your Brother at Salem such accounts as were favorable several times before I had the authentic news of your release, And last week I enclosed in a letter to your brother(2) one addressed to him I suppose from you & recommended to my care. I should have been much gratifyd by a letter from you at the same time, but have not a doubt it was for want of time & not inclination. I should have written to you before this time, & acknowledged the favor of your last, but was in doubt where I should find you. I shall now entrust this to the care of Major Hodgdon(3) and hope that it will find you in health, peace & happiness. I am not informed respecting your situation only that Mrs. Pickering iscome to Philadelphia & is going to Salem. I hope that she will arrive safe, where she will be most endearingly welcomed by her numerous friends. I conclude that you are yet in the country with your Sister & at least some  August 18, 1788  of the children. I cannot tell & will not undertake to conjecture what will be your future plans but I know that it is the united & ardent wish of your friends that you was not so far seperated from them. You cannot be insensible how tenderly affectionate your sisters all are towards you & their husbands partake with them in the sentiments. And your brother tho he may not express his sentiments in the same language, yet I do not think it is from want of affection to you. You will be the best judge what may conduce to your own happiness, interest & usefulness & that of your family, & wisdom & prudence under various considerations brot into view will direct you, but if you should think it expedient to altar your past determinations & return to New England your friends would rejoyce at the Idea. I do not expect to tarry here more than one month from this time;(4) should it be in your power to write to me within this time it will afford to me great satisfaction as well as to my wife who has been informed from me of you. I had a letter from her the last of July when she & the children were all well. I have not received any letter from your brother tho' I have written several to him & I also invited him to write to you thro my hand but have received none. He has considerable business that commands his attention & has so much writing which is necessary that he was willing to excuse himself from any more. I begin to be impatient to return home having been absent already seven months and I think that in a month more there will be nothing which will necessarily detain me here. We have lately had a very full Congress consisting of 40 members from the 13 States a greater number it is said than has been for 12 years past. There have been great disputes where the meeting of the first Congress should be under the new constitution. The question is not determined & I view it as uncertain but suppose the probab[il]ity is in favor of New York. Philadelphia & NYork are in competition. There are many considerations of weight on both sides & I think nearly balanced. New Hampshire would have been content with Phila. & gave their ay for it, when that place was proposed but when 7 states were not agreed in that by means of some southern states dissenting, we had no objection to N York as being more convenient to the eastern states, and accordingly voted for that likewise when proposed. We have continual accounts from the western frontiers as far as Georgia of Indian hostilities & there appears considerable dangers of a general war of the Indians. I believe from the accounts the Whites are very much to blame & from their imprudences may involve the U.S. in very great expence as well as themselves in distresses. From the European news it appears that great preparations are making by most of the nations for war while they profess their designs for peace, but Mr. Jefferson in a late letter to Congress says nobody doubts of a general war soon.(5) France is yet in great convulsion & the issue of the struggle there is very doubtful. The enthusiasm for   liberty is very prevalent & likely will not be suppressed without some blood. I hope we shall not be embroiled in the European quarrels. It is happy for us that we have got so far thro the difficulty of forming the new government & beyond expectation the states have agreed. I hope that we may yet be a wise & great & happy nation & that we leave a fair inheritance to posterity. I can only add that I am Dr Sr., your affectionate friend and Brother, Paine Wingate ""

 Dr. Sir New York, Tuesday Morning. [August 19, 1788](1) I find that Some of the Advocates for New York begin to be alarmed at the Tendency of their Perseverance in Supporting the Pretensions of a Place So very improper for the seat of federal Government. If they could have carried the Point by a Coup de Main, the public Mind would not have had Time to be agitated. The Delay has given room for reflection, & the more the Object is contemplated, the greater appears the Injustice, Oppression & Partiality, that must arise to the southern states from Such an Arrangement. The Friends to the federal Government, even in the Eastern states, if they wish the Tranquillity of the Union, must deprecate the pernicious Consequences that will ensue. It would have a good Effect to let it appear, that the Views of those who advocate the Claims of New York are Known out of the Doors of  August 19, 1788  Congress---;for this purpose, I have hurried over a rough Piece, which I would wish inserted in Dunlap's Paper to Morrow.(2) The signature does not involve an Expectation of much Attention to the Stile. It must be Kept an entire secret, that I am the Author. It is plain Argument, divested of personal reflections & can give no Offence. Care Should be taken to have it inserted in Several Philada Papers, as well as to introduce it in Some of those of New York, which possibly can be accomplished thro' the Agency of the Printers. It is impossible to determine as yet, what will be the Issue of this Business. Adieu, in great Haste, Yours &c, Wm Bingham E N C L O S U R E I am a plain unlettered man, but a good federalist, and strongly attached to the constitution and form of government established by the convention. I belong to a club that meet every evening, where none but federal liquors are introduced, such as Hare's porter, Haines's beer, or Jones's cyder. It is said that it requires some previous tuition to make a cobbler, but that every man thinks himself born a politician; this is literally the case with our club; But although we freely discuss all subjects of a public nature, we admit no crooked or eccentric paths in our politics, we endeavor to square our opinions by the straight lines of plain reason.  We have been lately much agitated with the question, concerning the place where the federal government is to be convened, which we think ought to have been determined as soon as nine states had ratified, but which we find is not as yet decided; this delay has given a great alarm, and has begun to create a very considerable clamor through the country.  Our first conjecture was, that an attempt was made to arrest the progress of this business, and that Congress was not willing to sign its own death warrant, or if it must die, like Macheath in the opera, it would die hard, and not part with its existence without a struggle---;this was soon found to be an anti-federal report. However, we have since been informed, that the contest in Congress is concerning the place where the new government is to be convened. The dictates of common sense induced us to believe, that Philadelphia being the place where the first Congress was assembled, and where the Federal Convention was appointed to meet, would be preferred, until a permanent residence was fixed by Congress, more particularly, as we never heard that any state had expressed a dissatisfaction with this arrangement. But we find that the city of New-York claims a preference over Philadelphia, Lancaster and Baltimore, which places, we understand,  have been successively in nomination. We have examined the pretensions of this city, and the causes that could lead its friends to advocate them. Some of our club, Messrs. Printers, are mechanics, who are in the habit of rearing their superstructures on solid foundations; they therefore require that arguments addressed to them, must be well supported. We began with an examination of the letter addressed to Congress, by the president of the convention, when the constitution was transmitted, in which he informs them that a spirit of amity and of mutual deference and concession alone induced so unanimous a concurrence to this plan of government, which the diversity of state interests seemed rather calculated to preclude. It was but a reasonable expectation, that the same spirit would actuate Congress, and that the first act of government would indicate a disposition to impart equal advantages and accommodations to every part of the union---;that consequently the government would be assembled to commence proceedings in the place, nearest the center of national population. The convention has furnished a rule by which the relative situation of each state, in this respect, may be determined, which is, by the number of representatives, that it is entitled to send to the federal legislature. We examined the pretensions of New York by this scale, and found that there were but 17 representatives from the states to the northward, and as many as forty-two from those to the southward, which calculated by 40,000 to each Representative makes 680,000 inhabitants on one side, and 1,980,000 on the other---;we found likewise that the extreme part of the district from which the 168,000 are to come, amount to above 1,000 miles and on the opposite side to about 350 miles. Such an arrangement militates against every principle of republican government, and of the federal constitution, which was instituted for the purpose of promoting the general welfare, and of securing equal rights to the people. It must involvethe southern states in the greatest inconvenience, from the number of persons that will have business to transact with the federal government, and the federal judiciary, who must travel such a great distance beyond the central point.  Besides, the more southern states, which are in the neighborhood of continual danger from their contiguity to hostile tribes of Indians, as well as to foreign nations, and which are so weak and defenseless, must complain at having the power of that government exercised at such a distance, whose protection alone can insure them tranquility; and in case of domestic insurrections, or external invasions, the necessary assistance must be delayed, in proportion to the time it will take in soliciting it---;the essential communications betwixt the southern members of the federal legislature and their constituents will be greatly obstructed by placing Congress in such an eccentric position;   and these communications will be required with the greater solicitude, as the states, having resigned such considerable powers in favor of the federal government, will be impatient to know in what manner they will be affected by the exercise of them, in the organization of the new system. The great and complicated interests of the western country, where new settlements are forming that will soon rise into independent states, demand a pointed attention, and require Congress to be placed in a central situation. We know, Messrs. Printers, that the southern and northern parts of the union have interests and pursuits essentially different---;the former, consisting chiefly of planters and consumers, and the latter of agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing people. We have been told, that the southern delegates in the convention, with great reluctance yielded to a bare majority the powers of regulating commerce, from an apprehension that a combination of states that had similar interests might be easily formed, which by partial operations of government, could greatly oppress the southern district of the union. We find, that this has been the popular topic of declamation, to work on the passions of the people, in the southern conventions, and we discover that Virginia has founded one of her proposed amendments on her fears on this subject; we are likewise told, that Patrick Henry so much deprecated the pernicious effects that might arise to Virginia from the exercise of this power, that he concluded a most eloquent harangue, by saying, that he would narrowly watch its tendency, with the eye of an eagle, watching its prey. If the strength and connection of the northern members of the confederacy have already created such great alarm in the southern states, why should it be increased by placing Congress in the midst of this district, thereby throwing all the influence of government in the scale that is already thought to be proponderant. This local influence must be immense when it isconsidered that the numerous appointments of officers under government will be generally confined to the inhabitants of the surrounding district, they being on the spot to solicit, and by personal application and address to enforce their pretensions. The revenues of the confederacy, drawn from all parts of the union, will be mostly expended in the adjacent country, to the great benefit and emolument of those states, which approach nearest to the seat of government; and in the discussion of great points which involve peculiar advantages to the northern parts of the union, the ease of obtaining a full representation of their members, so as to insure a decided majority, is certainly a cause of serious apprehension to the southern states.  I have been told, Messrs. Printers, that the kings of England have much increased the powers of the executive authority, since they have been compelled to exchange the stern voice of prerogative, for the more persuasive accents of influence; this influence must exist in every government, in proportion to the extent of its powers and of its revenue system; and its effects must be greatly felt in the districts which approach the place where the government is administered. To prevent the appearances of local aggrandizement operating at the expense of public interests, it becomes absolutely necessary to place the government in the center of the union, that its benefits and advantages may be equally diffused. I cannot expect, Messrs. Printers, that the sentiments of a plain man, like myself, can have any effect on the opinions of those great statesmen in Congress that hold the reins of government. But it certainly would be expedient at this critical period of our affairs, to sacrifice points of lesser magnitude, to preserve the Union. How can the northern states expect a ready concurrence of the southern, in granting a monopoly of the carrying trade, in establishing high duties on the importation of such articles from Europe, as they manufacture and can supply the southern states with, in the attainment of great advantages in commercial treaties, when their first agency in an act of government that has a view to the new system involves partiality and injustice as it regards the southern states, and must create in them, a spirit of discord and disunion, instead of a temper of harmony and conciliation, and which must necessarily operate in the formation of the first acts of legislation. It will be said that the delegates from a southern state, acquiesce in the obnoxious derangement; individuals may err---;but the people can never be mistaken---;for their language is always governed by their interests; and what the interests of that state are, viewing its local position, taking intoconsideration its surrender of powers to the general government, will not admit of a moment's hesitation to decide. It is really time this important question was determined. Every federalist throughout the union laments and deprecates the consequences of delay. Every anti-federalist rejoices in it, as most conducive to the purposes of confusion. It will not be surprising that New-York obstinately adheres to her pretensions; but it is to be expected that the other states, less interested in the event, will possess a more accommodating spirit, and put an end to a contest that has disgraced the councils of the nation, and must terminate, if longer pursued, in the most dreadful consequences to the Union.

 My dear Sir, New York 20th Augt. 1788 On my arrival I made some enquiries into the relative views and strength of the parties on the question lately agitated with so much violent intemperance in Congress. I found them nearly as I had left them, with wounds still smarting and the sicatrice unformed. And indeed at present they have the appearance of two fortified Camps within view of each other, neither of whom wish to come out of their  August 20, 1788  stronghold. What will be the probable consequence is mere conjecture. The Eastern States seem more anxious (though not more interested) to give immediate operation to the New Government than the people of the South, the late rebellion in Massachusetts urges to an immediate transition from this to a better Government. The powerful antifederal influence in this state will not weaken by delays. We can pretend that the Southern States will be very well accommodated if the new government shall [not] be put in motion until next fall coming a year and in a particular manner the state of Pennsylvania who can lay up a private purse out of her impost. Virginia is also a state of great internal resources and can better her funds by delay, what those arguments may produce depends upon the experiment. This my dear friend is a jesuitical policy which grows out of necessity, and is the only weapon with which we can combat an enemy with similar weapons and on similar ground. Honesty is certainly the best policy but it cannot always be brought fairly into view. As soon as opinion takes any form I shall send it to you, if it has but one feature---;at present there is no such thing by which we can judge of the event.

 My dear friend New York Aug. 22. [17]88. I have your favor of the 13th.(1) The effect of Clintons circular letter(2) in Virga. does not surprize me. It is a signal of concord & hope to the enemies of the Constitution every where, and will I fear prove extremely dangerous. Notwithstanding your remarks on the subject I cannot but think that an early convention will be an unadvised measure. It will evidently be the offspring of party & passion, and will probably for that reason alone be the parent of error and public injury. It is pretty clear that a majority of the people of the Union are in favor of the Constitution as it stands, or at least are not dissatisfied with it in that form; or if this be not the case it is at least clear that a greater proportion unite in that system than are likely to unite in any other Theory. Should radical alterations take place therefore they will not result from the deliberate sense of the people, but will be obtained by management, or extorted by menaces, and will be a real sacrifice of the public will as well as of the public good, to the views of individuals & perhaps the ambition of the State legislatures. Congress have come to no final decision as to the place for convening the new Governt. It is unfortunately become a question now between N. & South, and notwithstanding the palpable unreasonableness of the thing, an adherence to N. York in preference to any more central position seems to grow stronger & stronger, and upon grounds which tend to keep Congress here till a permanent seat be established. In this point of view I own the business has a serious aspect, considering the injustice & oppression to the S. Western & Western parts of the Union. Yrs. Affecly., Js. Madison Jr August 22, 1788  ""

 Dear Sir New York Augst. 23. 1788. My last went via England in the hands of a Swiss gentleman who had married an American lady, and was returning with her to his own country. He proposed to take Paris in his way. By that opportunity I inclosed copies of the proceedings of this State on the subject of the August 23, 1788  Constitution. North Carolina was then in Convention, and it was generally expected would in some form or other have fallen into the general stream. The event has disappointed us. It appears that a large majority has decided against the Constitution as it stands, and according to the information here received has made the alterations proposed by Virginia the conditions on which alone that State will unite with the others. Whether this be the precise state of the case I can not say. It seems at least certain that she has either rejected the Constitution, or annexed conditions precedent to her ratification. It cannot be doubted that this bold step is to be ascribed in part to the influence of the minority in Virginia which lies mostly in the Southern part of the State, and to the management of its leader. It is in part ascribed also by some to assurances transmitted from leading individuals here, that New York would set the example of rejection. The event, whatever may have been its cause, with the tendency of the circular letter from the Convention of N. York, has somewhat changed the aspect of things and has given fresh hopes and exertions to those who opposed the Constitution. The object with them now will be to effect an early Convention composed of men who will essentially mutilate the system, particularly in the article of taxation, without which in my opinion the system cannot answer the purposes for which it was intended. An early Convention is in every view to be dreaded in the present temper of America. A very short period of delay would produce the double advantage of diminishing the heat and increasing the light of all parties. A trial for one year will probably suggest more real amendments than all the antecedent speculations of our most sagacious politicians. Congress have not yet decided on the arrangements for inaugurating the new Government. The place of its first meeting continues to divide the Northern & Southern members, though with a few exceptions to this general descriptionof the parties. The departure of Rho. Island, and the refusal of N. Carolina in consequence of the late event there to vote in the question, threatens a disagreeable issue to the business, there being now an apparent impossibility of obtaining seven States for any one place. The three Eastern States & N. York, reinforced by S. Carolina, and as yet by N. Jersey, give a plurality of votes in favor of this City. The advocates for a more central position however though less numerous, seemed very determined not to yeild to what they call a shameful partiality to one extremity of the Continent. It will be certainly of far more importance under the proposed than the present system that regard should be had to centrality whether we consider the number of members belonging to the Government, the diffusive manner in which they will be appointed, or the increased re-  sort of individuals having business with the Legislative, Executive & Judiciary departments. If the Western Country be taken into view, as it certainly ought, the reasoning is still further corroborated. There is good ground to believe that a very {jealous eye will be}(1) kept in that {quarter on in}attention {to it and particularly when} involving a {seeming advantage to the eastern states} which have been {rendered extremely suspicious} and {obnoxious by the Missisipi project}. There is {even good ground to believe that Spain is taking} advantage of {this disgust in Kentucky} and is {actually endeavoring} to {seduce them from the union holding out a darling object which will never be obtained by them as part of the union}. This is a {fact as certain as it is important but which I hint in strict confidence} and with {a request} that no suspicion may be excited of its being {known particularly thro the channel of me}.(2) I have this moment notice that I must send off my letter instantly, or lose the conveyance. I must consequently defer further communications till another opportunity. In the meantime I am, Yrs. Affely., Js. Madison Jr. [P.S.] Along with this you will receive a copy of the report you desired from Mr. Thomson,(3) and a copy of the Federalist, a publication mentioned in my last. ""

 Dear sir New York [August] 23rd 1788 By Letters from sundry Correspondents it appears that North Carolina has at length thrown herself out of the Union, but she happily is not alone; The large upright and respectable State of Rhode Island is her associate. This circumstance however does not, I hope, render it necessary that the Delegates from NC should profess a particular affection for the Delegates from R.I. That State was some days ago represented by a Mr Arnold who keeps a little Tavern 10 miles out of Providence & a Mr Hazard the illiterate quondam Skipper of a small August 23, 1788  Coasting Vessel & now the very leader of I Know Ye Justices who officiates at County Courts & receives small Fees not as a Lawyer but Agent for Suitors. These two respectable Delegates with the innate Desire of promoting a bad measure lately voted on several Questions respecting the Organisation of the new Govt. in order to fix it in New York, a Corner of the Union, but before the final Question was taken on the Ordinance they caused a Member to move in Congress for a Vote \""That nothing which the Delegates from Rh Is. or NC had done or might do in voting on the Subject should be construed as in any measure affecting the Rights &c of their Constituents.[\""](1) This was to be a Bull or Absolution. On this Motion the Delegates from N.C. moved that the Word North Carolina should be struck out of the Vote of Absolutio, And thereon we called for the Yeas & Nays to prove that we did not wish to have NC associated in any Vote with Rh I, that we did not wish for Absolution being conscious of having pursued our Duty. That with Respect to the final Vote which was to be taken on the Ordinance we proposed never to assist in such Vote unless NC should confederate for we would not be guilty of paracide by throwing our State out of the Union. On this the Motion was withdrawn; the Rh. I. Gentlemen missed the promised Pleasure of doing wrong & on the next morning they set out Homeward. I wrote the Governor a Lette(2)r concerning the Conduct of some Members when the Business referred to was first moved in Congress and with my usual want of prudent Dissimulation I expressed an honest Indignation by calling Spade a Spade. This Letter it seems has been read in the Convention & a Correspondent up the Country writes me that he fears it has hurt me greatly. As I did not consider that Letter as official & one that should be communicated to a public Assembly I took no Copy of it and do not know what it contained, but as I am conscious that I never write in the most careless mood any thing but whatI think and as I am also conscious that since I have been honoured with a commission from the State I have not in a single Instance preferred my private Interest to the Benefit of the State, that I never have through private Indulgence or inattention omitted a single opportunity of serving the State. Being conscious of no corrupt motive my zeal on a late occasion to serve the State has not been abated at an Hour when I had reason to suppose that the Action would not be popular. Had I supported what I conceive to be a dishonest measure in pursuit of Popularity I should for the first Time, as a public man, had occasion to condemn my self. Doing what I conceive to be the Dictate of Honesty & true Patriotism I mean to abide Consequences, my friends know that I do not depend for a Support on public favour. The 22nd Amendment(3) so called was certainly a very important one for NC. If an East India Company or a Mediterranian Company should be erected it would greatly interfere with her Trade to those  August 24, 1788  Regions. What could have put foreign Troops into their Head? They should have excepted particularly against the Japanese who are Heathen. The 12th Amendment I take for an Original.(4) Others have talked about a Rebellion in a State but the N Ca. Convention speaks of the State being in Rebellion. Are these the same thing according to the conceptions of Tom Person & Tim Bloodworth, not forgetting the learned Judge Spencer! Is it like the various Expression of an old turned Hat & a turned old Hat? Perhaps they conceived that the federal Congress might undertake to declare that a State out of the Union was in Rebellion. To obviate this it would have been safer to have required thirteen Elevenths. The other Amendments or Pejorations I fully understand but this one I do not. Be pleased present my Respects to Mrs Iredell & believe me to be with great Regard, Dr sir, Your obedt servt, Hu Williamson ""

 Dear Sir New York Augst. 24. 1788. I was yesterday favored with yours of the 17th, 18th(1) under the same cover with the papers from Mr. Pleasants. The Circular letter from this State is certainly a matter of as much regret, as the unanimity with which it passed is matter of surprize. I find it is every where, and particularly in Virginia, laid hold of as the signal for united exertions in pursuit of early amendments. In Pennsylva. the antifederal leaders are I understand, soon to have a meeting at Harrisburg, in order to concert proper arrangements on the part of that State.(2) I begin now to accede to the opinion, which has been avowed for some time by many, that the circumstances involved in the ratification of New York will prove more injurious than a rejection would have done. The latter wd. have rather alarmed the well meaning antifederalists elsewhere, would have had no ill effect on the other party, would have excited the indignation of the neighbouring States, and would have been necessarily followed by a speedy reconsideration of the subject. I am not able to account for the concurrence of the federal part of the Convention in the circular address, on any other principle than the determination to  August 24, 1788  purchase an immediate ratification in any form and at any price, rather than disappoint this City of a chance for the new Congress. This solution is sufficiently justified by the eagerness displayed on this point, and the evident disposition to risk and sacrifice every thing to it. Unfortunately the disagreeable question continues to be undecided, and is now in a state more perplexing than ever. By the last vote taken, the whole arrangement was thrown out, and the departure of Rho. Island & the refusal of N. Carolina to participate further in the business, has left eleven States only to take it up anew. In this number there are not seven States for any place, and the disposition to relax, as usually happens, decreases with the progress of the contest. What and when the issue is to be is really more than I can foresee. It is truly mortifying that the outset of the new Government should be immediately preceded by such a display of locality, as portends the continuance of an evil which has dishonored the old, and gives countenance to some of the most popular arguments which have been inculcated by the Southern antifederalists. New York has appeared to me extremely objectionable on the following grounds. It violates too palpably the simple and obvious principle that the seat of public business should be made as equally convenient to every part of the public, as the requisite accomodations for executing the business will permit. This consideration has the more weight, as well on account of the catholic spirit professed by the Constitution, as of the increased resort which it will require from every quarter of the Continent. It seems to be particularly essential that an eye should be had in all our public arrangements to the accomodation of the Western Country, which perhaps cannot be sufficiently gratified at any rate, but which might be furnished with new fuel to its jealousy by being summoned to the sea-shore & almost at one end of the Continent. There are reasons, but of too confidential anature for any other than verbal communication, which make it of critical importance that neither cause, nor pretext should be given for distrusts in that quarter of the policy towards it in this. I have apprehended also that a preference so favorable to the Eastern States would be represented in the Southern as a decisive proof of the preponderance of that scale, and a justification of all the antifederal arguments drawn from that danger. Adding to all this the recollection that the first year or two will produce all the great arrangements under the new system, and which may fix its tone for a long time to come, it seems of real importance that the temporary residence of the new Congress, apart from its relation to the final residence, should not be thrown too much towards one extremity of the Union. It may perhaps be the more necessary to guard agst. suspicions of partiality in this case, as the early measures of the new Government, including a navigation act will of course be most favorable to this extremity. August 25, 1788  But I own that I am much influenced by a view to the final residence, which I conceive more likely to be properly chosen in Philada. than in New York. The extreme excentricity of the latter will certainly in my opinion bring on a premature, and consequently an improper choice. This policy is avowed by some of the sticklers for this place, and is known to prevail with the bulk of them. People from the interior parts of Georgia, S.C., N.C., Va. & Kentucky will never patiently repeat their trips to this remote situation, especially as the legislative sessions will be held in the winter season. Should no other consequence take place than a frequent or early agitation of this contentious subject, it would form a strong objection agst. N. York. Were there reason to fear a repugnance to the establishment of a final seat, or a choice of a commercial City for the purpose, I should be strongly tempted to shun Philada. at all events. But my only fear on the first head is of a precipitancy in carrying that part of the fOEderal Constitution into effect, and on the second the public sentiment as well as other considerations is so fixedly opposed as to banish the danger from my apprehensions. Judging from my own experience on this subject, I conclude that from motives of one sort or another ten States at least (that is 5 from each end of the Union) to say nothing of the Western States will at any proper time be ready to remove from Philada. The only difficulty that can arise will be that of agreeing on the place to be finally removed to and it is from that difficulty alone, and the delay incident to it, that I derive my hope in favor of the banks of the Potowmac. There are some other combinations on this subject into which the discussion of it has led me, but I have already troubled you with more I fear than may deserve your attention. The Newspapers herewith inclosed contain the European intelligence brought by the last packets from England. With every sentiment of esteem & attachment Iremain Dear Sir, Your Obedt. & Affecte. servt., Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear sir, New York, August 25 1788 The Spirit which now exists in Congress is of Such a Nature, as to require Reasons more forcible than the Strength of personal or Party Views, to eradicate it. August 25, 1788  Nothing can more effectually induce the Advocates for New York to abandon the Pretensions of this Place, than to find the public Mind agitated on the subject of the Delay, & the public Voice, clamorous for a more equitable & impartial Arrangement. The only Method to answer this Purpose is to awaken the People in the Eastern States & in So Carolina, to a Sense of the unjust Views of their Delegates in Congress, & to the pernicious Consequences that may result to the Union, from the Pursuit of Such Measures. You have an extensive Correspondence, & will have the Means of answering Such Views, without the Appearance of Design. The Legislature of Jersey is to meet this Week. It is an essential Object to induce them to instruct their Delegates to vote in favor of a more central & southern Position; that they may no longer concur in the Support of a Measure, which has in View local Aggrandizement, at the Expence of general Interests. From the Attachment that Exists in Jersey to the federal Constitution, much is expected from their Legislature. What they will decide on, will give the Ton[e] to the other states, whose Delegates have voted for New York, which renders it an Object of essential Consequence, to gain their Suffrages in our favor. As Dunlaps Paper & Halls, have an extensive Circulation, it would be very politic to insert Paragraphs on this subject, which would be transposed into other Gazettes, & have an excellent Tendency. I have wrote a few,(1) which I inclose you for the purpose, & would recommend that whenever any thing of this Nature is published, the Papers Should be transmitted to all the States.

 Sir, New York August 26h 1788. I am unable to say when the Act of Congress for putting the New Government into Operation will be agreed to:(1) The matter was taken up in Congress as soon as nine States had ratified, but the Convention of New York being then sitting, in which two thirds of the members were Opposed to the New Constitution, it was thought unadviseable to proceed in the business at the time further than agreeing upon the time to chuse Electors---;the time for them to meet to Elect a president & Vice President---;and the time of meeting of the New Congress: but the place of meeting was purposely delayed untill the New York Convention should come to some final determination. Two reasons induced Congress to this delay, first that New York could not be fixed upon as the place unless they ratified; secondly, to appoint any other place while they were deliberating would, in all probability insure a final rejection, to prevent which it was suffered to pass as a very probable event, if not as a matter of Certainty, that in Case they did Adopt, New York would be the place of meeting. This perhaps was one principle Cause of their adopting, and without their being led into this opinion I believe they would have rejected the Constitution. In this Business I feel no particular attachment in favour of N. York, nor as  August 26, 1788  they have adopted the New Constitution whereby all former grounds of Complaint are removed, ought I as a member from New Jersey to retain any resentment. I am influenced by other motives: for as it was a very important and desireable Object to have this State become a member of the New Government, so it is necessary for Congress to Act in such a manner as to avoid the Charge of deceiving the State in what I consider well grounded expectations: besides, all our public Offices are here and cannot be removed without a great expence which our Treasury cannot conveniently defray; and after all we might go to a place the New Congress might disapprove of as a temporary residence. New Jersey laying between New York and Philadelphia are equally contiguous to each and at this time in that point of view ought not to give a preference to either, such as a removal from one to the other. The same reason would hold good against removing to New York were Congress at Philadela.---;to which I may add, that a removal to Philada. would be losing all Chance of having the permanent Seat of Government fixed near the falls of Delaware as formerly agreed to, which is an Object New Jersey ought not to lose sight of so long as a probable Chance remains. To go to Philada. before the future Seat of Government is fixed on, will be giving up all prospects of this kind, as there will not be a probability of Obtaining it to the Northward of the place Congress shall be in at the time---;they may go from hence to the Delaware near Trenton, Pennsylvania may as formerly join in such a measure, but never will if Congress are at Philadela. These are reasons that induced me to give New York the preference. Should the Delegation of New Jersey join in favour of Philadela. it would be of no avail, it would only make an equal division of the States, there would in that case be five States and a half for New York, and the same number for Philadela.---;as Eleven only Votes upon the Occasion, and no more can be expected unless Rhode Island comesforward in favour of New York as is expected, the Delegation of North Carolina will not vote on the question. As there may be different Opinions in the Legislature respecting the Conduct of their Delegates on this question, I have taken the liberty to request your Excellency to Communicate to both Houses this Statement of the principle reasons that influenced my conduct which I trust will be satisfactory:(2) The several votes will appear in the Journals of Congress sent forward by the Secretary. In order to Accommodate all the States we were obliged to place the times for Electing &c. at periods much more distant than were Necessary for New Jersey, some Legislatures could not be convened earlier than November, none except the present meeting in New Jersey, will be before some time in October; should the business be delayed some time longer in Congress (which it is wished may not be long) no inconvenience will happen, provided the same go to the States by the time they meet in October.  I have the honor to be with great regard, your Excellencys Most Obedt. and Humble Servt., Abra. Clark(3) ""

I have not been able to read his Books, for my Eyes are often too weak to permit me to attend properly to necessary Business. I wish much to write to him, but know not what to write, & I fear he will take it unkind as he express'd great Solicitude to hear from me speedily. I think he is under a kind of Fanaticism which does not amount to what you apprehend.

His Letters to me are exceedingly long & for the reason above mention'd I shall perhaps not be able to send you Copies as soon as I cou'd wish, for I do not choose to shew them to any person who might transcribe them. I cannot express how much I wish to converse with you on this Subject, for I am anxious to have some fixt Opinion of hisSituation.

 Dear Sir Aug 29. 1788 The Baron De Steuben informs me that he expects to set out this day on a visit to your legislature to endeavour to procure some arrangement respecting the place at Hackensack some time since granted to him by your state upon certain conditions.(1) My anxiety for the Baron's situation induces me to take the liberty of asking your friendship to him as far as may consist with considerations of propriety. It is needless to say to you that he has been a most useful servant of the public. I imagine it is as little necessary to observe, that he is a man, the qualities of whose heart intitle him to the sympathy and good will of good men. I shall only add that he is in a condition, for a man of his Temper and habits, deplorable. He is as nearly as much in debt as all the property he has would sell for; and he is at the same time moneyless. Congress are now discussing his last application on the footing of a contract; but there are some circumstances which involve the transaction in obscurity; and there are individuals not disposed to overcome difficulties. I fear little is to be looked for. The question however is---;Shall we permit a man, who has essentially served the American cause, either to starve or to go abroad begging? We are informed here that there is some probability, that your legislature will instruct your delegates to vote for Philadelphia as the place of of the meeting of the first Congress under the new Government. I presume this information can hardly be well founded, as upon my calculations, there is not a state in the Union so much interested in having the temporary residence at New York, as New Jersey---;As between Philadelphia and New York. I am mistaken if a grater proportion of your state will not be benefitted by having the seat of the government at the latter than at the former place. If at the latter too, its exposed and exsentric position will necessitate the early establishment of a permanent seat; and in passing South it is highly probable the government wouldlight upon the Delaware in New Jersey. The Northern states do not wish to increase Pensylvania by an accession of all the wealth and population of the FOEderal City. Pensylvania herself when not seduced by immediate possession will be glad to concur in a situation on the Jersey side of Delaware. Here are at once a Majority of the States. But place the government once down in Philadelphia, Pensylvania will of course hold fast. The State of Delaware will do the same.  August 29, 1788  All the states South looking forward to the time when the ballance of Population will enable them to carry the government farther South, (say to the Potowmack) and being accommodated in the mean time as well as they wish will concur in no change. The Government from the delay will take root in Philadelphia & Jersey will lose all prospect of the FOEderal city within her limits. These appear to me calculations so obvious, that I cannot persuade myself, New Jersey will so much oversee her interest as to fall in the present instance in the snare of Pensylvania.

 My dear friend New York Augt. 30. 1788 I am going to write to you for the last time I suppose until I shall return home. This is a work of supererogation for I balanced my account with you in my last. But I am not very scrupulous about over paying you such a trifling matter as this letter. I have fixed the time of my return, which I do not think I shall exceed. Possibly I may set out a few days sooner. I hope I shall then have the great satisfaction of seeing you with all my other friends in health & good spirits. Betsey wrote me word that you had been unwell but was growing better. I conclude that my prescription, which so often had such a salutatory effect upon you arrived in a day or two after the date of her letter & hope it had the desired operation. I think Betsey is an excellent letterwriter and I would write her an a[n]swer if I did not intend to return so soon when I shall endeavor to make her a proper acknowledgement. I admire that short simple mode of telling news, which is peculiar to her letters. I must believe what she says is all true if she spoke her own mind & was not dictated by some body else. But when I recollect who has been instructing of her, I must be excused if I should scruple the veracity of some things. However I hope I shall never have reason to charge her with what I once did a friend of mine whom you know. I  August 30, 1788  promised to write to my wife every week until I set out, which will not be more than three. She has wrote to me so often that I shall not be out of debt to her. I will not now say any flattering things about her letters, lest it should excite your envey, only that they have been very agreeable to me. I have very sincerely said that of yours. My wife has mentioned to me the hair pins which I shall endeavor to procure. It will be my wish to bring home something that will be agreeable to both of you if it is only a pin, for each of you. If there is any thing else that either of you want that I can bring I hope to have the request as soon as possible. It is seven months this day since I left home and as my desire to return is strong so the expectation of it is the more satisfactory as I please myself that I shall be welcome to those parts. I have no female connections here whom it will be any mortification to me to part with, altho I have some of the other sex. The ladies here have such monstrous heads & rumps that I should not venture to approach either part. My &c has cost me so little that I shall have some money to bring home with me, which I believe will be as welcome as almost any thing. Mr. Poor is alive & well, in good business & likely to marry a rich wife. I can tell you more about him when I see you. He is not in the city. I have nothing else remarkable to tell you, and shall conclude this letter with some annecdotes of a female character which you will see some account of in the scraps of papers I shall enclose. Her name was Betsey Whitman of Connecticutt. She was the favorite child of a very worthy clergyman who is dead. Her mother was a fortune of very respectable family & lives to be distressed with her untimely end. She was a person of a most sprightly genius & uncommon literary improvements. She was handsome, amiable & polite. She was flattered, admired & caressed by a throng of sensible lovers. This in the day of her glory raised her vanity too high andmade her difficult to be pleased with any one enÃ´ to be married. Among others Mr. Buckminster of Portmo. courted her & went expecting to marry her but she then refused him; as she had done with many other advantageous offers. At length she began to be neglected as a person too difficult to be pleased, and at last was seduced by a married man of mean character. By whom she proved with child & cost her her life; partly by mortification & partly by undue methods to conceal her guilt. I can add no more, but to assure you that I am P Wingate(1) ""

 Sir public New York 1st Septr. 1788. The Delegates to represent the State in Congress from the first Monday in November next were chosen, I think, in the following Order, White, Ashe, Hawkins, Stokes, Williamson, McDowell.(1) The three first named have the Option, by general Order, of serving first, but I presume that Mr Ashe has resigned and it is said not to be probable that Mr Stokes will come to Congress on the next Winter. I am not informed whether Mr Hawkins proposes to come but you are probably informed by this Time whether any three of the four Gentlemen first named propose to attend in Congress from the first of Novr. next. If they have not given you Notice of such Intention it will become my Duty to attend, and being determined punctually to perform every Service that I owe the State I propose to hold myself in Readiness to attend in Congress accordingly. You will therefore be pleased to issue Warrants in my favour for the next six Months Salary as Delegate in Congress. If you are so good as [to] put the Warrants into the Hands of Mr Collins he will negotiate them for my Account. By looking over the public Journal you will observe that many Things continue to engage the Attention of Congress which are of considerable national Importance---;Questions which respect old Claims against the public and the calling Delinquents to Account and lowering the national Debt. Whether North Carolina shall be confederated or not she is equally interested with other States in those Measures.

 New York 3d. Sept. [1788] Sunday last bro't me two letters. The romans had their white days & so have I. Henceforward then I devote the 31st of August to smiles & good fortune. I had pass'd the day abroad---;'Twas night before I got home, when, little expecting the entertainment you had provided me, I withdrew to my room, and there meant to have talkd away an hour with some dead consign'd you & myself to heav'n, & then have gone quietly to bed; but the sight of your packet broke in upon the order of this Arangement & so engag'd me in contemplation, that it was morning before I could bring myself to relinquish you even to Heav'n. My reflections took a turn that was natural eno.' I w[ent] into a long and very minute examination of what I have b[een] & what I am---;& made out two exact Accounts of Armstrong [. . .] & vacant, indifferent to all the World, and without a subject, but himself, for the exercise of either a hope or a fear; & Armstrong warm & occupied---; touch'd & animated by everythg About him, and living not for him- September 3, 1788  self, but for another. Need I tel[l] You the effect? 'Twas such as reconectd me to myself, and delighted me with you. 'Twas such as made me look with Contempt upon the past, and with reverence upon the present. 'Twas such in short as persuaded me that the heart could be happy that wanted either exercise or object. Thus persuaded Alida, I resolv'd that mine should never want either. But what are resolutions that cannot execute themselves? 'Tis you alone who can fill and employ mine, and were I by any possible accident to loose you, it would again be idle & I would again be wretched---;Most wretched, Alida, for I have now tasted pleasure, and know what it is to be happy. \""Every new Account of my feelings leads, (you say), to a new discovery of your own.\"" Compare these then with yours---;Judge of them together, and tell me if they resemble each other. This will again make you say \""a great deal\"" but the confessions of lovers are never \""monstrous\"" remember my theory of the heart---;how poor in expression? how little eloquent? I think it; how often oblig'd to resort to signs for an utterance of what it feels? Why then stifle an exertion? Why suppress a syllable or a sigh? I am pleas'd with your opinion of North & his wife for I am pleas'd with the fa[mily]. I like her for his sake, & him for his own. I wish them happy with all my heart---;nor have I any difficulty in beleiving them to be so. 'Tis hardly possible to remain long insensi[ble] of a woman's fondness. It has so many ways of shewing itself & so graciously too, that it cannot fail to be felt & return'd. Even where sensibility is wanting it may not be entirely without Success. It will address itself to the understanding, and recommend itself at least to esteem, on calculations of Interest. But remember that I dont mean to apply this to my friend North. And \""there's no medium in the maried State---;Completely happy or completely wretched?\"" You did well to appeal to the little tremble rather than to the french maxim,for beleive me Alida it can do more in illustrating a point of that kind than all the french & Eng[lish] maxims put together. The head & heart are as much at variance on this subject, as on any other. The first will talk a great deal about the force of habit, the extent of politeness, the influence of este[em] & the convenience of appearances; & many other things so [that?] laws of this world have substituted for affection & will assure you that with these we may do very well; but app[ly] the heart & it denies them all. It neither feels nor employs [reason?] and declares, that without love, all these artificial props to matrimonial happiness, will crumble into nothing under a single gust of interest, or of passion---;while love alone, will easily resist the combind assaults of Time, of Temper, & of Fortune. The head will then call all this rhapsody & nonsense, and endeavor to Shew that the marriage state is a more equal one than is generally imagind & abounds less in storm or sunshine than Poets & lovers & fabulists have describ'd: While the Heart as possitively as-  serts, & very soon demonstrates, that from the intimacy of the connexion it must consist of a great variety of offices, which indifference could not discharge, which must necessarily be done well or ill---;Kindly or unkindly, & which involve of Course, the opinion with which we began. If this state of the argument be just \""Tis prudent\"" as well \""as enchanting\"" to listen to the heart, & adopt its conclusions. Be not afraid then my dear girl, \""visit the paper tree,\"" \""read the letters engrav'd upon its bark,\"" \""gratify your affection,\"" \""nor blush at the recital of it.\"" But \""I am not hereafter to hear from you more than once a week.\"" Why so Alida? Is the sacrafice of time too great? Can you deny me two hours in the week? If not Revoke your decree & make me twice as happy as you intended. You are good eno' to approve my not going to Philad. & think my motives such as would be satisfactory to any mind not too much tied down to the usages of the world. There is a great deal of good sense in the remark & you must allow me to admire it abstractedly from its application to the present Case. Those who mean to sacrafice but little to the customs & opinions of the many should early begin to undervalue them, & this will ever be the case with such as know them well. The source of nine tenths of them is either folly or meanness. On the subject which gives rise to these reflexions I find I have still some persecution to suffer; & Yesterdays post brought me the wishes of so many friends, express'd in so warm a manner, that it was with difficulty I could resist their invitation. My Physician's opinion at length decided mine, & I resorted to my old expedient of pen & Ink. I expect however another attack---;Whether I shall find fresh reasons to combat that, I know not---;one that I feel most, I shall dare least to express, but this I leave you to conjecture. I am extremely glad to hear that Mrs. Tillotson's complaints have been lessen'd by her visit to Clermont. Dr.Bard has been prescribing (even at this distance) for her, & directs, that she should leave Rhinebeck & breathe the air of N. York for a Month or six weeks, but this advice Mrs. Lewis has I suppose communicated. I will certainly attend to Mrs. Montgomery's commission but the post office has now no letters for her---;Jones when here got sev'ral from Europe some of which were I presume for her. I saw Mrs. Lewis on Sunday Evening---;but not since I received your letter. \""Others have your good wishes\"" but why prohibit me from communicating them. I find I have got to my sixth page and have not once thought of thanking that infinite goodness that could not deliberately inflict a disapointment. This was indeed good & I feel the obligation it confers. You know by this time the cause of your disappointment. Such or similar & equally unavoidable must ever be the cause of my disappointing the smallest hope or wish of my Allida. September 4, 1788  Edward does not go till Saturday. Remember me to your Mama---;Mrs. Montgomery, Kitty & Joanna, & be assur'd that I am with all possible affection, Your J Armstrong jr.(1) ""

 Dear Sir New York Septr. 4th 1788 Parson Boyd will this day sail from here for Georgia, and go immediately to Augusta, which is so direct an opportunity, that I cannot resist the propensity of droping you a few lines, altho we have little news that is worth communicating. Congress have not yet agreed on the place for the first meeting of the Legislature under the new Constitution. Several places have been proposed among which are Anappolis, Baltimore and Lancaster, but the competition at present lies between Philadelphia and New York, and on this question there is a diversity of opinion; it is said by the advocates for Philadelphia that it is more central and possess other advantages in an equal degree and ought therefore to be the place of residence of the National Government. To this it is objected and said that the National Legislature ought not to reside in a large Commercial City where the members would be subject to the undue influence of the local policy of the place, and that such large City would derive such advantages as would be injurious to the equal rights and priviledges of the other members of the union, contrary to the genius and principles of Republican Government and will evidently tend to facilitate the growth of that Aristocrasy or Monarchy, so hatefull to Americans, and to which there is too much reason to apprehend the New government will have a tendancy. That the place for the parmanent Residence of the New Congress is an object of much importance, and highly interesting to those States which are so Situate as to stand in competition for that advantage and they will be induced by their own Interest to make advantageous offers to the United States to establish the federal Town in their respective limits, if Congress in the first instance does not give any partial advantage, and therefore they say the first Congress under the New Constitution ought to meet in New York where all the Officers and documents of Government are and from whence the new Legislature may with more impartialitydetermine where the parmanent Residence of the National Legislature ought to be. September 4, 1788  These considerations divide Congress on the question, and I cannot at present conjecture what may be the result.

 Sir New York September 5th 1788 I have to acknowledge the honor of your Excellencys obliging favor of the 25th Ultimo, and it is with real regret that I am again constrained to inform you that the ordinance for the organization of the new government remains incomplete;(1) owing to the absence of the delegates of Rhode Island and to a want of that spirit of accommodation which has hitherto confessedly marked the conduct of New Hampshire on this subject. The ordinance has once been completed in all its parts and when the final question was about to be taken the delegates of Rhode Island left the Hall & the City. The time for choosing electors, of their meeting and the assembling of the New Congress was fixed at later periods than could meet the wishes of the Eastern States in order to accommodate the southern. The Question on the place for commencing proceedings under the new Government was first taken for Philadelphia---;when the delegates of New Hampshire and Connecticutt (conceiving it to be the wish of the Southern States, and being actuated by that spirit of accommodation & conciliation which it is their ardent desire to see operating in the general government of the States, and on which our national prosperity so greatly depends) gave their assent. But to their surprize the question was lost, by the negative of South Carolina and the division of Delaware and Georgia, among the southern States. The Question was afterwards taken for New York in a full representation of all the States and carried, South Carolina Voting in the affirmative & Georgia divided---;but as the final question did not obtain, owing to the circumstance above related, an attempt has since been made to send out the ordinance without inserting the place leaving it for the new Congress to assemble where the old Congress should be setting at the time, but without success. Thus  September 6, 1788  has the business past on from day to day waiting the return of the delegates from Rhode Island. As it seems to be the general opinion that New York or Philadelphia must be the place for the first Congress to assemble in and as seven States and an half are in favor of the former and half the Delegation of Delaware, in addition, pointedly opposed to the latter it appears to be the effect of unwarrantable obstinancy that the minority will not concede the point in question without further delay. I hope however that we shall be able to finish this business within a few days when I shall do myself the honor to give your Excellency the earliest notice. With the highest Respect I have the honor to be Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant, N. Gilman ""

 Hond Sir N. York Sepr. 6. 1788 I forward this by the mail expecting it will be at Fredg. in time for Mr. A. Shepherd who left this a day or two ago. Nothing of much consequence has occurred since my last. The current intelligence you will find in the inclosed gazettes. The Antifederalists are every where exerting themselves for an early Convention. The circular letter from this State, and the rejection of N. Carolina, give them great spirits. Virginia, I suppose from the temper of the present Legislature will co- operate in the plan. Congress have not yet settled the place for the meeting of the new Govt. It is most probable that the advocates for N. York who form at present the greater number, will prevail. In that case, altho' I think it a very unreasonable thing for the Southn. & Western parts of the Union, the best face must be put on it. I have not yet been able to determine whether Anthony is still in Philada. I am inclined to believe he is not. Indeed some circumstances wd almost tempt me to think he never has been there. On this supposition John must have practised a gross deception on us. He could have no motive for this unless it were a spite to Billey, which I fancy he entertained. But the deception could hardly promise a gratification that would prompt it. He is still very sick, and his recovery not very probable. I find on enquiry that the loan office Certificates which I told you I had only mislaid, not lost, must go to N. Carolina for settlement. If an oppy. offers I shall accordingly send them thither unless otherwise directed by you. I have not yet seen Mr. Morris & have therefore not been able to do any thing in the affair of Mr. Triplett.

 Gentlemen [September 6? 1788](1) It is with great Diffidence that I venture an Opinion on the interesting Subject that is submitted to your Care, but as North Carolina must be more immediately affected by the Treaty you are preparing to make(2) than any other State, Georgia excepted, and as that State has no Representative in the national Senate by whom her Claims or Interest might be stated, I shall take the Liberty of mentioning some Facts that are extremely interesting to the Happiness and Peace of her Citizens. According to the Treaty of Hopewell, as you may observe, the Lands between French Broad and Holstein Rivers are disclaimed by the Commissioners or given up as Indian Property; The Settlers to be removed if Congress should think fit; and all other Settlers to the Southward and Westward of the Boundary there described are absolutely to be removed within six Months. Now this particular Article of the Treaty,(3) as I conceive, cannot easily be enforced; perhaps it ought not to have been made. If it could be so altered, by Consent of the Indians, as to accommodate the Necessities of the present Settlers, who appear to have good Titles or who have obtained Peaceable Possession, a great Proportion of the Citizens of that State would rejoice in the Measure and much trouble would be evaded. Governor Johnston, on the Subject of that Treaty, several Months ago wrote me as follows:(4) \""The People inhabiting the Lands in the Forks of French Broad and Holstein Rivers claim under Grants from the State, regularly issued from the Secretarys Office, and executed by the Governor; These People are therefore as much under the Protection of the State, as any  September 6, 1788  other of her Citizens, for which Reason &c the Treaty of Hopewell will probably ever be reprobated &c.\"" You will not be surprised that People should have settled in the Fork above mentioned, when you are told that in Consequence of Treaties had with the Indians the Northern Boundary of the hunting Grounds of the Cherokees is thus described in an Act of the Legislature of that State, \""Beginning on the Tenessee Rivers where the southern Boundary of the State of North Carolina intersects the same, nearest the Chickamawga Towns, thence up the middle of the Tenessee and Holstein Rivers to the middle of French Broad, thence up the middle of the said French Broad River, which Lines are not to include any Island, to the Mouth of big Pigeon River, thence up the same to the Head thereof, thence along the dividing Ridge between the Waters of Pigeon River & Tuckasege River to the said southern Boundary, thence West with the said Boundary to the Beginning.\"" You will be pleased also to observe that there is another very numerous Class of Settlers absolutely devoted to the Indians by the Treaty. Their Claim indeed is not so good as the Claim of those who live in the fork, but it is plausible. They interest our Humanity and instead of removing them, which would be rather cruel and very difficult, perhaps the Indians may be prevailed on to admit by Treaty that those People also shall be considered as living without their hunting grounds. The People of whom I speak live on the South Side of French Broad. Governor Johnston speaking of the Act of Congress of the first of September ult. respecting Troops to be sent for the Protection of the Cherokees expresses himself thus, \""Much will depend on the Discretion of the Officer who has the Command of the Troops destined for that Service; should he pursue the Resolve of Congress literally he will ruin a very respectable Settlement of upwards of 1500 Families settled on the South Side of French Broad River. Those People settled there, I am informed,with the Consent of the Indians and have had no Share in the Outrages that have lately been committed by Sevier and others, but have always lived in Amity with the Indians. They are avowedly within the Indian Boundary and have made an Application, which is to be laid before the next general Assembly, for Directions in what Manner they are to proceed to obtain a regular Title to their Lands.\"" What Steps the Assembly have taken in favour of those People I am not fully informed, but understand that some Thing has been done. In the mean while it is obvious that such a Body of People, thus circumstanced, claim no small Degree of Attention. I have the Honour to be, with the utmost Consideration, Gentlemen, Your most obedient and very hble Servant,  Hu Williamson  ""

 Sir public New York 6th Septr. 1788. Inclosed is a Proclamation with sundry Resolves of Congress respecting the Indians on our Frontier.(1) You will receive from the Secretary of Congress the Copy of Papers that have been received from different Quarters respecting the Barbarities that have been practised against the Cherokees by People who do not profess themselves amenable to the Laws of our State.(2) You know that a Treaty is now pending with the Southern Indians and Georgia, that has long been suffering under the Knife; begins to hope for a general Peace; In such a Conjuncture the Conduct of Mr. Sevier was not only fatal to their Hopes but perfectly alarming to the States of South Carolina & Virginia; each of them might suffer by a general Indian War and the Delegates from those States earnestly required that preventative Measures should be taken. While this Question was agitated in Congress you may believe that the Delegates from North Carolina found themselves in a very delicate and critical Situation. The Treaty of Hopewell had given much Offence to many good Citizens in our State, because it was supposed to have surrendered Lands to the Indians which they had formerly sold or ceded to the State; but this Treaty was now to be quoted and it had already been entered on the Journals of Congress April 17th 1786, which is considered as a Ratification.(3) The Delegates were fully persuaded that a great Majority of the People who inhabit the Counties of Washington, Lincoln, Green & Hawkins are peaceable and good Citizens and they knew that the Inhabitants of Davidson and Sumner Counties had ever claimed and been entitled to the Protection of the State. We resolved that Nothing in our Power should be unattempted to preserve Peace in those several Counties and to save the unoffending Women and Children from the Hand of the Savage. This could not be done without taking Notice of the Treaty, but the Delegates attempted such Amendments as seem to render the Treaty very harmless. After causing severalThings to be struck out, which had been reported by the Committee, we moved the final Proviso  September 6, 1788  which is inserted in the Proclamation.(4) This Proviso, as we conceive, leaves, by implication, Every Claim of the State in its usual Force. Whenever the present Settlements shall have acquired sufficient Strength and the State shall be desirous to extend her Settlements, she has only to buy a farther Claim of Soil from the Indians or shew that she has antient Claims of a greater Extent. The Treaty of Hopewell will never operate against the territorial Claims of the State whenever she thinks fit to make them. The Proviso respecting the Settlers near the Fork of the french broad is professedly made a negative one. The Delegates could not agree to confirm them in their Possessions because we have been told that they have no Titles from the State; we only proposed, for the Information of the Indians, that they shall not be removed by the Operation of the Treaty. On the whole, our Object and Desire in the first Place was to save the State if possible from the heavy Expences of an Indian War and to preserve the weak and scattered Settlers in our Western Counties in safety and Peace; on the other Hand we wished not to give additional Force to any Act by which the Rights of the State might be impaired. In such apparent opposition of Interests it may be impossible to give universal Satisfaction and it may at the same time be criminal to refuse an Opinion. In whatever Light this Subject may be viewed by our Constituents the Delegates have the Satisfaction to be conscious that their Object was to save the Lives of many innocent & helpless fellow Citizens. I have the Honour to be with the utmost Regard, Sir, Your most obedient and very humble Servant, Hu Williamson ""

Had I done this, my promise, which I have now sat down to execute, would have implied a condition, & not have been binding but under a change of circumstances; While, as it is, I can but aim at what I should be, betray myself at every line, & at lest, to avoid the shame of detection honestly confess (as I now do) that a repetition of the causes to-day have not at all lessen'd their effect, & that I continue to be more flat & sour & Cold than I ought to be on any occasion, but particularly when I'm writing to one who is herself all equanimity & tenderness. I feel & acknowlege the folly of making oneself an Index either to men, weather, or busin[ess], but so shap'd & compos'd are we, that stretch us ten times a day on the wheel of error---;still we mistake, & tho' we repent very sincerely, we repent without any amendment. I will make no apology for all this---;that would be apologizing for an apology---;for it is seriously meant as an excuse for what I could not but discover at some turn or other of my pen. Besides are not the diseases of the  September 11, 1788  352mind like those of the body---;that can only be cur'd by being known & communicated; & to whom should I so soon communicate them as to you, for from whom could I expect so efficient a remedy? You will hear them patiently & prescribe willingly & wisely. Indeed I can even imagine a gratification in it to you---;for tho' the least agreeable evidence of confidence & affection I get certainly tis among the last & greatest. 'Tis a sure proof that I open my whole heart, when I cannot more suppress the story of my faults & foibles. This to some lovers might be a very dangerous experiment---;not so much from the extent of their defects, as the folly of their Mistresses---;But here I am again fortunate. Neither your sense nor observation allow you to believe in the possibility of a Sir Chas. Grandison,(2) & with all your partiality, you Could never have suppos'd me to have been faultless. But let me turn from myself, & talk of you. \""You are happy---;you would not exchange your present feelings for anything you have felt before---;you have examin'd your heart & find it touch'd with gratitude as well for the sensibility you find it possess'd of, as the subject it has chosen for the exercise of that sensibility.\"" When I read this Alida, to reflect but a moment upon it, I am perfectly asham'd of myself & of all I have written; & am on the point of blotting it out for ever, & beginning another letter under very different sensations; which sentiments like these I have quoted, cannot fail to excite. You before taught me to Compare myself, with myself---;but hereafter I shall compare myself with you---;& learn of you at once how to feel, & how to Express my feelings. I anticipated the construction your fears would put on that ill- judg'd expression concerning my Physician's opinion---;& took care to state it as it was really meant in my letter by Edward. You shall never however entreat me in vain & tho' there's no immediate room to exercisethe caution you enjoin---;it shall not be forgotten---;nor shall \""any concern interfere with an attention to that health, which has become so interesting to you.\"" My jaunt to Philad., disagreable as I have ever view'd it, has at length become necessary & longer to resist the opinions as well the wishes of my friends & advocates would border upon the obstinacy of disrespect & want of friendship---;Imputations which I would ever wish to avoid---;& which I hope I shall never deserve. 'Twill be some days before I set off---;but I shall in some future letter advise you of the Time & (what will be of more consequence) the mode by which we can communicate at the increas'd distance of a hundred Miles. You shall hear from me often. You gave me infinite pleasure by revoking that cruel Edict \""you shall hereafter hear from me once a week\"" nor was ever a more gracious  answer given to an humble remonstrance. Were the monarchs of the world to govern in that way, they would never want faithfull or obedient subjects.  You have by this time seen Mary & Edward. Knowing that she could communicate but little, I took care to supply the defect by a very long letter. It may have been my fault that she could not communicate more. I know it has been my misfortune that I have not seen her oftner. One is allways a gainer by even seeing a fine Woman---;but (which by the way does not apply to all fine Women) she may be heard as well as seen with advantage. This I dont take merely on trust, I think it a fair inference from even the little conversation [I] have had with her & greater acquaintance will, I dare say, ripen this belief into assurance. I pass'd a part of this afternoon with Mrs. Lewis. I hit upon this as an expedient to prepare myself for writing to you---;Nor was it her fault if it did not suceed---;she was as charming (as she indeed ever is) as it was possible---;but the blue devils had got so fast a hold of me that nothing short of your magic could dispossess them. In how many ways do you oblige me! I am extremely happy to hear that the Chancellor & Mrs. L. have got back in so much health. Let me beg you to make my Compliments to them, & do not forget me to those more immediately with you. I am with the utmost affection, Your J Armstrong jr. ""

 Sir New York Sept. 11th. 1788. I acknowledge the honor of receiving your Excellency's favor of the 11th Ulto., also yours of the 2d instant to Mr. Gilman and to me, enclosing our Commissions for the ensuing year. I thank your Excellency for your obliging attention in sending on our commissions,(1) and Mr. Gilmans acknowledgements, at his desire, are joined with mine; but I hope and expect not to have occasion for my commission. I think it likely that the states will not be generally represented in Congress after November next, and unless any emergency should make it necessary for the delegates to attend, I conceive that it will be judgd most expedient to let what little business may be left, pass over to the new government. Your Excellency observes that you do not recollect any business of the state that will require my attendance after the general business is compleated, and that I must use my own judgement in determining when to return home. My wish is to return as soon as may be without neglect of my trust, and as several of the delegates from other states are already gone, and others will probably soon follow, and as there does not appear to be any matters of great consequence to be decided before the end of the present year, except such as may be dispatched in a few days, I shall conformably to my inclination, and I believe the interest of the state, leave this city for home on the last of next week, unless something unexpected should prevent. I am happy to have your Excellency's approbation respecting the late loan. I do most sincerely joyn in your congratulations on the general adoption of the new constitution. Altho' North Carolina, being mislead by the information received from this state, and not discovering their mistake until too late, did not ratify; yet all accounts from that state agree, that they will as soon as may be take the matter into consideration again and adopt, as they would doubtless have done had they heard from New York convention a day or two sooner. A delegate in Congresslately from Rhode Island, and who has heretofore been antifederal, says that state is now in a fair way of calling a convention, and he is of opinion that they will ratify. So that we may hope once more to see a union of the thirteen states, and I trust in a government that may make us a great and happy nation. My Colleague has informed your Excellency of the reasons which actuated our conduct in the late endeavours to organize the new government.(2) They were such as we supposed ought to influence us, and would vindicate us from any blame, in the past delay. Nothing has been further attempted in this business since Mr. Gilman wrote, but we have reason to think it will be compleated in a few days. I do not imagine that the delay as yet has put off the time when the operation  September 12, 1788  of the new government would commence, or has been injurious, further than a waste of time in Congress, and keeping the public in a painful suspence, and some little irritation of the parties. These it is true, tho I think they will be attended with no very disagreeable consequences, are evils which I wish had been avoided, and that the government had commenced with a perfect harmony of sentiment. Had all parties been as disinterested as the delegates of New Hampshire in this affair it might have been the case; but the rivalship of Philadelphia and New York would not admit of it. The Minister of the United Netherlands has lately been recalled & taken leave of Congress.(3) The United States of America have upon the occasion received fresh assurances of friendship from the States General, but are not informed of the reasons of the recall of the minister. It is easily conjectured however that it was because he was not in the interest of the Prince of Orange. Congress has this week elected Genl Irvine of Pennsylvania and the Hon. John T Gilman Esq. of New Hampshire commissioners for settling the accounts of the several states agreeably to the Ordinance of May 7, 1787. The third who is to be from the Southward is not yet chosen.(4) We have no late European news and I have nothing else material to write. I have the honor to be with great respect your Excellency's most obedient and humble Servant, Paine Wingate ""

 Dear Sir, New York September 12th 1788 I received last week by post your letter of the 12th dated at Pittsburgh.(1) Since my last to you your whole contract & project for the purchase & settlement of western lands, has been on the point of being annihilated. On the 18th of August a motion was made in Congress by Mr Williamson in the words following viz. \""Resolved that the several acts of Congress of October 2nd, 22d & 23rd 1787 whereby the board of Treasury are authorised to contract &c.\""(2) I called upon the Committee with Mr Marsh & Mr Boudinot just as they were meeting to draft their report which would have been (if approved in Congress, which I very much apprehended) fatal to your purchase. I stated to them that it was not your intention to settle but upon the limits prescribed by the Board for one million---;that instead  September 12, 1788  of barely depositing 72,000 Dollars as the Board in their report had loosely expressed it, you had regularly paid in Certificates & military rights to the whole amount of the first payment for that quantity & that the ignorance of both parties with respect to the course of the rivers bounding your purchase had been the reason of your declining to agree to any precise limits before that necessary information could be obtained. We acquainted them in short that we considered & held the United States firmly bound by the contract & that their receipt of the first payment on acct of it was sufficient evidence. The Committee after consulting with the board, informed us that even if the first payment had been made for a million, your proposed contract was for two---;that altho' in the course of making your payments, you had withdrawn your proposals for two & given in others for one million, yet the Board disliking the Boundaries prescribed for the smaller quantity, had not closed with them, but had proposed in their turn what they thought, reasonable limits which you had not signified your acceptance of---;That therefore in strict or legal construction they considered Congress as absolved from every engagement with you, but they would nevertheless agree, if we would come forward & subscribe to the limits offered by the Board in their letter to you of the 16th of June, to wave their report to Congress, & stay further proceeding until we had concluded it. Thus circumstanced a choice was hardly left us & we agreed to close with & subscribe to, their proposals as soon as the writings could be prepared. Since that time, the Board has started another objection which I believe neither you or we had apprehended or foreseen---;They say that a late letter of the Geographer to them, states that there are but about three millions of Acres in the New England purchase, if so, that the sum deposited by you is but half the amount of the first payment for a million---;Altho I referred themto the Map & pointed out the New England tract thereon as delineated & painted by Hutchins himself, & proved to them by measurement that it was six times as large as the million bounding upon it which was reserved for the army, they notwithstanding, refuse to execute the writings until the sense of Congress shall be had. I know not what will be the event of the business, but I trust the objection is too ill founded & unreasonable to meet with the approbation of that body. Before the departure of the next Pittsburgh post, I trust, it will be decided, when you shall hear from me again. Your letter of agency arrived at a lucky instant to enable us to prevent measures being taken to declare that no contract existed with you on the part of the union, which would have been followed by orders to the Governor to prohibit any settlement upon any other than the New England lands. It was by no means my wish to have my name inserted in your letter of agency but since it is there, I shall endeavour to conduct the business entrusted to the best possible advan-  Portrait of Jonathan Dayton  tage of yourself & the others concerned. We have already in the commencement of it's prosecution met with numerous embarrassments, we hope they will not continue, if they should we shall take the best measures to face & overcome them.(3) Septr 12th(4) This morning Mr Marsh came over agreeably to my appointment to execute & subscribe to, the contract we had drawn up---;The Board receded from the objection as to quantity mentioned on the other side but raised a new difficulty as to our power of Attorney which they said was very imperfect & insufficient---;It recites in it's beginning that a contract, had been entered into between you & the Board & refers to that written agreement, which the board says never had existence. They say it is true Congress authorised them to contract with you for two millions on certain terms, but that you never came forward & contracted---;They say also that you proposed to purchase instead thereof but one million with certain boundaries, to which they disagreed---;that they in their turn offered to sell you a million with other boundaries which you by letter declined. From all this they infer that there is not only no written [Ms uncertain] you express but not even a verbal contract between you & also that there never has been either. They add that all the powers you have vested us with, refer to & are founded upon this supposed contract which, you suggest, actually exists between you & them & which they know nothing about & consequently cannot acknowledge. They have even gone to the expence of employing & consulting Council on the occasion, by whom, our power is declared to be altogether defective. They offered to contract with us for the land in our own names & right which we have refused---;& they have at length consented to accept our signatures as Agents for you upon our agreeing to annex a proviso that we will procure from you a more ample & sufficient power of Attorney, or failing to do that, thatwe will, individually & in our proper characters, consider & acknowledge ourselves bound to perform the conditions & stipulations. It will be necessary or at least desireable that you make out this power immediately, acknowledge it before one or the other two Judges of the Western territory & forward it by the first opportunity. As soon as this business is compleated on our part, Mr Boudinot &c. mean to agree for the million on the little Miami, which they propose to divide into forty shares and have promised me that you may take what number of them you think proper. All are to come in by their plan on equal terms, they do not seem disposed to promise a preference in favor of Capt. Stites but say they will leave the consideration of his case to the whole of the associates. The contracts of Morgan & Flint & Parker are destroyed, & the rise of Certificates makes the people here less eager to engage in land speculations than when you left us. I enclose you a copy of the letter of agency & of your acct as you requested. You may remember Mr  Boudinot's giving you credit for 1033 44/90 of the loans he had made you upon your engaging to give me up a Certain Certificate lodged by you in the treasury for that amount, which you told me you were not able to get as it had been cancelled. I have called upon Mr Boudinot since for those I lodged with him on acct of it & he tells me I must first procure your signature to the inclosed in order to annul the rect he gave you expecting you would restore me that Certificate. Be so good as to sign & send it by the first conveyance. On account of some errors & erasures in the writings & for the sake of inserting the proviso we are obliged to draw them all over again which will delay their execution until next week. As to your complaint of want of assistance on the part of the proprietors of the reserved township, I shall not of myself undertake to determine whether it be well or ill founded, but as they proposed to have a meeting shortly I shall take that opportunity of laying it before them. With regard to the four sections adjoining to the town & upon the Ohio which I engaged, I will esteem it a favor, if you will direct the surveyor to delineate them on paper, as well their situation & the fractional parts between them & the river as their true quality. This he can do so soon as you have laid out the town & I will cheerfully pay any extra expence that may attend it. When done he will make me out an extra copy & I will thank you to forward it witht delay. Besides the above sections I have in military rights about 8,000 Acres, but I shall leave it to Mr Denman who has proposed to unite our rights, to locate where he pleases. Your accts & indeed all those of an official nature which we have received of the disposition of the Indians in your quarter, are very unfavorable. I have never been very sanguine in my expectation of entering into a treaty with those people which would have permanence. My only hope was that by fair words & presents they mightbe induced & inclined to a two or three years peace, by which time you would be enabled not only to make head against, but if they should prove hostile, utterly to exterminate them. I would not however be understood to mean that I think it would be just to war with them as soon as you have the ability. The law of right & wrong is an universal law & has it's influence amongst the most savage as well as the most polished nations. I hold it unjust to take possession of & settle upon their lands before you have fairly made a purchase, & very highly so to attack to punish & destroy them unless driven to it by their unprovoked aggresions. We this day passed the ordinance for organizing the new government.(5) The meeting of the new Congress is directed to be on the first Wednesday in March next in this city. There is a dearth of news among us at present, when I write again I may probably have some to give you.  I must request you to write to me by every opportunity(6) & to believe that I am with great sincerity, Your friend & servt, J.D.

 My dear General. New York 13th. Sept. [17]88. At length the new govt. has received the last act necessary to its existence. This day Congress passed the requisite previous arrangements. The first Wednesday in January the ratifying states are to appoint electors, on the first Wednesday in February the president is to be chosen, & the first Wednesday in March is the time, & this city the place for commencing proceedings.(1) Some delay has attended this business from a difference in opinion respecting the place of meeting, but this delay has not in the least affected the sooner or later operation of the constitution. The southern gentlemen did not accord in the place of temporary residence, from a discordance in sentiment, of its effect on the establishment of the permanent seat of govt. Some considered this city, others a more southern position, as the most favorable theatre to negotiate the determination of the ten miles square. Many plausible & some cogent reasons are adducible in support of either opinion & time only can shew which is founded in propriety. The solemnity of the moment, & its application to yourself, has fixed my mind in contemplations of a public & a personal nature and I feel an involuntary impulse which I cannot resist of communicating without reserve to you, some of the reflexions which the hour has produced. Solicitous for our common happiness as a people, & convicted as I continue to be, that our peace & prosperity depends on the proper improvement of the present period, my anxiety is extreme that the new Govt. may have an auspicious beginning. To effect this & to perpetuate a nation formed under your auspices, it is certain that again you will be called forth. The same principles of devotion to the good of mankind which has invariably governed your conduct, will no doubt, continue to rule your mind however opposite their consequences may be, to your repose & happiness. It may be wrong, but I cannot suppress in my wishes for nationalfelicity, a due regard to your personal fame & content. If the same success should attend your efforts on this important occasion, which has distinguished you hitherto, than to be sure you will have spent a life, which providence rarely if ever before gave to the lot of one man. It is my beleif, it is my anxious hope that this will be the case, but all things are uncertain, & perhaps nothing more than political events. The new govt. tho about to commence its proceedings & received by a large majority of the people with unprecedented unanimity & attachment, must encounter from the nature of human affairs many difficultys. These obstacles to its harmonious progress will  September 13, 1788  receive additional weight & influence from the active & enterprizing characters who continue to inflame the passions & to systemize the measures of opposition. The circular letr. from this state, seems to be the standard, to which the various minoritys will repair, & if they should succeed in bringing quickly into action the objects of that letr., new & serious difficultys might arise, which will cross & may destroy the govt. in its infancy. Much will depend on the part which the assembly of Virginia may adopt in this business, & from the complexion of that body, little is to be hoped. They appeared to be generally opposed, & Mr. Henry with many other conventional coadjutors, are members of the legislature. Madison will not be there, nor is there a friend to govt. or the assembly of comparative ability. It would be fortunate if this gentleman could be introduced into that body, & I think it is practicable. Mr. Gordon one of the Orange members would readily vacate, to let him in, & the county would certainly elect him. In my letr. of this date to Doctor Stuart, I have mentioned this suggestion. It would certainly be unpleasant to you & obnoxious to all who feel for your just fame, to see you at the head of a tumbling system. It is a sacrifice on your part, unjustifiable in any point of view. But on the other hand no alternative seems to be present. Without you the govt. can have but little chance of success, & the people of that happiness, which its prosperity must yield. In this dilemma, it seems wise that such previous measures be in time adopted, which most promise to allay the fury of opposition, to defer amendments, till experience has shewn defects & to ensure the appointments of able & honest men in the first Congress. One of the best means to accomplish this seems to me to bring into the assembly of Virga the aid before mentioned. Indeed, I know of nothing so effective, for on the conduct of Virga every thing will depend.Her example will be followed, & if she supports with promptitude the system recommended by this state, confusion & anarchy may be the substitutes of order & good govt. With much freedom have I disclosed to you & to you only, my sentiments on the present epocha as it involves in it, yourself. I am persuaded you will attribute my conduct to the motives which gave birth to it---;zeal for the public prosperity, solicitude for your fame & happiness. In a few weeks I shall return to Virga, if by land, I shall pay my respects to Mount Vernon,(2) when it will be more in my power to explain fully my opinion. If any thing in this city would be agreable to you, it will give me pleasure to obey your commands & I can send any articles by water to Alexa. It is most probable we shall return by sea, in which case they can be taken with me. Mrs Lee begs to be presented to your lady. I have the honor to be with unalterable attachment yours truely Henry Lee  ""

 New York, 13 September [1788] This letter will be accompanied by an act of Congress of this morning, which Mr. Secretary Thomson will have the honor of transmitting.(1) The public interest and expectation excited by the subject of it, the time employed in its discussion, and the temper in which it has been advocated by some states and opposed by others, make it not less necessary, than respectful, that we should state the facts under which we gave the assent of Pennsylvania to the decision which has been taken. These are: 1st. That some states who invariably contended with us for giving a more central residence to the national government withdrew themselves from Congress while the dispute was depending, leaving the minority extremely small and without a hope of succeeding, but such as grew out of the bare possibility of a change of sentiment or relaxation of obstinacy in the majority. And 2d. That others of the same description, believing that the organization of the new government could not be longer suspended without risking consequences more disagreeable than any that could result from the mere circumstance of the place at which the government might be convened, determined to yield the objections they had made and acquiesce in the appointment of New York. Under these facts the delegates of Pennsylvania were left to choose between opposing alone and unsuccessfully, or submitting to the predetermined sense of the Union. We did not hesitate in choosing the latter, persuaded that of the two alternatives, this was at once the most dignified and wise. MS not found; reprinted from Minutes of the Third Session of the Twelfth General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, p. 238, DLC(ESR).

 My dear friend Richmond [New York](1) Septr. 14. 1788 Your favor of the 3d instant(2) would have been acknowledged two days ago, but for the approaching completion of the arrangement for the new Govt. which I wished to give you the earliest notice of. This subject has long employed Congs. and has in its progress assumed a variety of shapes, some of them not a little perplexing. The times as finally settled are Jany. for the choice of Electors, Feby. for the choice of a President, and March for the meeting of the Congress. The place, the present seat of the fedl. Govt. The last point was carried by the yielding of the smaller to the inflexibility of the greater number. I have myself been ready for bringing it to this issue for some time, perceiving that further delay, could only discredit Congs. and injure the object in view. Those who had opposed N. York along with me could not overcome their repugnance so soon. Maryland went away before the question was decided in a temper which I believe would never have yielded. Delaware was equally inflexible. Previous to our final assent a motion was made which tendered a blank for any place the majority would chuse between the North River and the Potowmac.(3) This being rejected the alternative remaining was to agree to N. York or to strangle the Govt. in its birth. The former as the lesser evil was of course preferred and must now be made the best of. I acknowledge at  September 14, 1788  the same time that I anticipate serious inconveniences from it. It will I fear be regarded as at once a proof of a preponderancy in the Eastern scale, and of a disposition to profit of that advantage. It is but just however to remark that the event is in great degree to be charged on the Southn. States which went into that scale.(4) It will certainly entail the discussion on the new Governt. which ought if possible to be exempt from such an additional cause of ferment in its Councils. N. York will never be patiently suffered to remain even the temporary Seat of Govt. by those who will be obliged to resort to it from the Western & Southn. parts of the Union. This temporary period must continue for several years, perhaps seven or eight, and within that period all the great business of the Union will be settled. I take it for granted that the first Session will not pass without a renewal of the question, and that it will be attended with all the unpleasing circumstances which have just been experienced. In the last place, I consider the decision in favor of N. York as in a manner fatal to the just pretensions of the Potowmac to the permanent Seat of the Govt. This is unquestionably the light in which many of the advocates for N. York view the matter. The Legislature of N. Jersey which lately met approved of the part taken by her delegates on the principle that the first meeting of the Govt. at N. York would give the best possible chance for an early choice of the permanent Seat, as this would do, for a preference of Trenton. As the case now stands, the Susquehanna is probably the most that can be hoped for, with no small danger of being stopped on the Delaware. Had any place South of the Delaware been obtained, the Susquehannah at least would have been secured with a favorable chance for the Potowmac. The result of the Meeting at Harrisburg is I am told in the press & will of course be soon before the public.(5) I am not acquainted with the particulars, or indeed with the general complexion ofit. It has been said here that the meeting was so thin as to disappoint much the patrons of the scheme. I am glad to hear that Mazzei's book is likely to be vendible. The copies allotted for this and several other markets will not I fear be so fortunate. Yrs. Affecly., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir N. York Sepr. 14. 1788 The delay in providing for the commencement of the Government was terminated yesterday by an acquiescence of the minor number in the persevering demands of the major. The time for chusing the electors is the first Wednesday in Jany. and for chusing the President the first Wednesday in Feby. The meeting of the Govt. is to be the first Wednesday in March, and in the City of New York. The times were adjusted to the meetings of the State Legislatures. The place was the result of the dilemma to which the opponents of N. York were reduced of yielding to its advocates or strangling the Government in its birth. The necessity of yielding, and the impropriety of further delay, has for some time been obvious to me, but others did not view the matter in the same light. Maryland & Delaware were absolutely inflexible. It has indeed been too apparent that local & state Considerations have very improperly predominated in this question, and that something more is aimed at than merely the first Session of the Govt. at this place. Every circumstance has shewn that the policy is to keep Congress here till a permanent seat be chosen, and to obtain a permanent seat at farthest not beyond the Susquehannah. N. Jersey, by its Legislature as well as its Delegation in Congress, has clearly discovered her view to be a temporary appointment of N. York as affording the best chance of a permanent establishment at Trenton. I have been made so fully sensible of these views in the course of the business as well as of the impropriety of so excentric a position as N. York that I woud have finally concurred in any place more Southward to which the Eastern States wd. have acceded, and previous to the definitive vote, a motion was made tendering a blank for that purpose. At any place South of the Delaware, the Susquehannah at least would have been secured, and a hope given to the Potowmac. As the case is, I conceive the Susquehannah to be the utmost to be hoped for, with no small danger of being stopped atthe Delaware. Besides this consequence, the decision will I fear be regarded as at once a proof of the preponderancy of the Eastern strength, and of a disposition to make an unfair use of it. And it cannot but happen that the question will be entailed on the New Governmt. which will have enough of other causes of agitation in its Councils. The meeting at Harrisburg is represented by its friends as having been conducted with much harmony & moderation. Its proceedings are said to be in the press, and will of course soon be before the public.(1) I find that all the mischeif apprehended from Clinton's circular letter in Virginia will be verified. The Antifederalsts. lay hold of it with eagerness as the harbinger of a second Convention; and as the Governor espouses the project it will certainly have the co- operation of our Assembly. September 14, 1788  I inclose a sensible little pamphlet which falls within the plan of investigating and comparing the languages of the Aboriginal Americans.(2) With the sincerest attachment I am Dear Sir, Your Obedt. & very hb[le. servt.], Js.

 My Dear Friend, New York Sept. 15th. 1788 I now do myself the pleasure to return the Pamphlet, agreably to your request, which you was so kind as to favor me with the perusal of.(1) Your remarks upon the old federal system perfectly accord with my ideas of that il[l] concerted Fabric, and fully display the necessity for a change. I sincerely wish we could as well associate our opinions as to the New Constitution: it is, however, by that comparison of ideas which you have done me the honor to propose, that so desirable an object is to be obtained, and whatever may be the difference between us upon this important subject, I yet acknowledge myself under much obligation for the extensive field you have opened to my view, discovering the quicksands & Rocks to be guarded against, in directing the ship we have launched. You have gone deeply into the subject, and presented many points which still engage my serious contemplation. Upon one or two of your objections I will, however now submit some thoughts which occur to me. The power of direct Taxation is the first in Magnitude---; this, my dear Friend, is, in my estimation the vital principle of the Government; take it away and the Govt. must decline into, nearly, the same contemptible situation which has characterized the old one, or the responsibility of the States must be secured by means such as you have hinted, and seem to rely upon, but which in my opinion, would be utterly inconsistent with every idea of freedom: in the one case we shall have gained nothing by the change in regard to Revenue, but the impost; in the other, Tyranny, which you so much dread will be established, or at least introduced. You declare this power to be unnecessary, because, when the U.S possess considerable Revenues, & have at their command a Fleet & Army, with the absolute controul of Trade, you cannot but suppose that their constitutional demands & requisi- September 15, 1788  tions, will be complied with. As your reliance seems to be rested upon these circumstances of power, it is to be presumed you calculate upon the actual exercise of Military force, or the apprehension of it by the States; in either case the compliance is to be effected under military influence. Now, my dr sir, would this entitle the Constitution to the republican Character? to my Conception of a free Govt. the accomplishment of all its internal purposes by the ordinary operation of Civil authorities, constitutionally created, is essential; and in the levies of Money, in particular, this ought to be the case. Nor do I agree with those Gentlemen who think that the right of the U.S to Tax, should be consequent only upon a failure in any State to comply with a requisition, for this would eventually lead to a necessity for the exercise of military force, if the money should be got at all. Place the business upon this footing, and the federal authority, in whatever shape it might be introduced, would come under the odious character of a minister of punishment---;faith could not be placed in Citizens of the same State as agents---;resort must be had to those of other States not alike delinquent, & these could not be expected to effect any thing without military aid. But let the Genl. Govt. have, at once, the power of direct Taxation, such as the Constitution gives, and wise arrangements may be made for the collection, by agents who shall be respectable Citizens of the States in which they are respectively to act, say the Sherifs or other Collectors of the Counties who act under the authority of the State---;one man may be vested with both authorities; the people will scarsely discern a difference between the one & the other power, and a ready obedience will be yielded. But, perhaps, the impost will be sufficient for all the purposes of the Union! Why then give also a power to collect money by direct Taxation? Should it prove that the impost be sufficient, there can arise no inconvenience from theother power being vested in the Fedl. Govt. because it will never be exercised; But on the other hand should the impost prove deficient public ruin might ensue from a want of the command, constitutionally, of other resources, it is therefore prudent to secure such a provision. The most certain way to prevent oppressive strides of power, is to make a constituional provision for every contingency. Your difficulties upon the judiciary appear not to have been brought to any decided objection---;you suggest, however, a dependance upon the State Courts for carrying into effect the greatest part of the Laws of the Genl Govt---;you do not say whether they ought in these cases to derive their authority from the Genl. Govt., & therefore I can not combat your opinions upon this point. My idea, is that all the Courts, upon which the Federal Laws depend for their execution, ought to derive their author[i]ties from, & be amenable to, the Federal Govt. and I think it would be wise to institute, the state courts, where they are well established, as the inferior Federal Courts; here I   pursue the principle which governed me as to the collection of Taxes; one that will diffuse the fedl. authority in full efficiency, and at the same time, will scarsely occasion a visible change in the accustomed police of the States. I perfectly agree with you that the federal Govt. which we are erecting, can only be successful by preserving a due distinction between the proper objects of it, & those of the State Govts. and it appears to me that the institution of the State Courts, where they are well established, into the inferior fedl. ones, will give us, at least a flattering prospect, that this discrimination will be kept---;the Judges will feel an equal obligation & attachment to both, and will be impartial, as well as able, guardians of each---;but should the U.S. erect separate Courts the probability is, that bickerings will arise between the two jurisdictions; this, as you say is in the discretion of the Congress, & I trust, that that discretion, will be exercised properly. Your remarks upon the Executive pretty fully accord with my ideas. I have always thought that to assign a Council for the guide of the Chief Magistrate, who is to act by written Laws, is absurd, & that it, in fact, gives him a shelter from the Consequences of the most flagrant abuses. My further remarks upon this subject will be reserved until I have the pleasure to see you in October, when I shall freely confer with you, and doubt not that many of the points upon which we now differ will be placed in different lights in the Minds of each. You have doubtless been anxious to see the act for giving the Govt. effect, & must have heard something of the cause of the suspension. The southern States thought it incumbent on them to get the meeting more central than N. York---;this certainly was a point of great importance, for if it is effected early in the meeting of the New Govt. a warm contest must first be felt, which will destroy the harmony of the Body for perhaps the remainder of the session.If such removal should not be effected, there will nevertheless have been a warm contest, with the additional mischief of all the great & permanent arrangements being made in the Centre of that part of the Union against Which great jealousies already exist in the southern States---;and when it is considered with what facility majorities may be made & preserved by calling in absent members &c. this jealousy must be still agravated. Upon this question we were deserted by South Carolina, & half of Georgia, and our old Freind Harry,(2) took the same side as he did in the Mississippi business---;you must have seen the papers in which most of the votes which passed in the early part of this affair have been published. We last Friday determined to yield to the Majority for N. York rather than hazard the consequences of a longer suspension. I shall be with you by the meeting of the Assembly of which I learn that I am a Member---;in the mean time believe me to be, my dr sir, Your Afft. Freind & Serv, Ed.

 My dear City of New-York 16. Sepr. 178[8] Altho I wrote you in the forenoon,(1) I have come to a Resolution now to write you again; whether you can get time to read all the Letters I send you, or not, I dont know---;but untill you tell me I write you too often, I shall continue to write so often and whenever I feel disposed for this kind of amusement. I assure you 'tis my chief and greatest delight while I am seperated by a distance of near four hundred miles from my dear family. When I took my pen up I proposed to write you a political Letter altogether, without saying a word about family or any thing relating thereto. I thought, & still am of opinion, that you ought to have now and then, for novelty sake, a little something about Congress and Congressional matters---;that when your female friends enquire of you the state of politics, you may, if you do not choose to enter upon the subject in conversation, hand them the Letter for them to read for themselves. Then to proceed---;Before I got here in August the Congress had entered upon the business of puting the new Constitution into motion. By the plan of Government proposed by the Convention last fall, it was resolved that when nine states should have adopted the plan and transmitted their adoption to Congress---;Congress should forthwith assigne a time for the States to appoint electors of a president---;& the time for the electors to meet & give their votes for a president---;and appoint a time and place when & where the Congress under the new Government should meet and commence operations. Accordingly, on Saturday the Congress resolved that the first Wednesday in January be the day for choosing electors in the several States, and the first Wednesday of February the day for the electors to meet and give in their votes for President, and the first Wednesday in March the time for commencing operations under the New Constitution, at the City of New York. There has been much altercation in Congress about the place---;whether itshould be the City of N---; York, or some place more southerly---;and Philadephia seemed generally advocated by those who opposed New-York. But notwithstanding the dis- September 16, 1788  putes upon this subject Congress at last unanimously agreed upon this City. There were nine States present---; viz, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New-York, New- Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South-Carolina & Georgia. The other States were not present. I suppose you, and your federal friends, are up in arms against North-Carolina for rejecting the Constitution. But, here your information is premature. They have not actually rejected the Constitution, neither are they any ways disposed to seperate themselves from the Union. But on the Contrary, their Convention passed two Resolves much to their honour. They resolved that it be recommended to their General Assembly to take the speediest measures, the situation of their Government would admit, to redeem their paper money. And secondly---;whereas that Convention had seen fit neither to adopt, nor actually reject the Constitution proposed to their consideration, and as ten States had adopted it, these adopting States would forthwith proceed to organize the Government, and it was highly probable the Congress would immediately lay an impost upon certain Goods imported into those States, therefore they Resolved that it be recommended to their General Assembly, that as soon as Congress should Lay an impost on Goods, that State should lay a similar Impost on the same Goods imported into North-Carolina, & the same be appropriated to the use of Congress. Thus you see this State is federally disposed, tho they have not adopted the Constitution. They have simply recommended certain amendments to the consideration of a future Congress or Convention; which, on the principle of them, being ingrafted into the Constitution, they will then adopt the Government. I would continue this a little longer---;but my paper is up. Yours most affectionately, Geo. Thatcher ""

September 19, 1788  Being at Liberty to speak with some freedom respecting certain late Negotiations, It is true that Authority had been given by Congress to our Minister for foreign Affairs to negotiate a Treaty with the Minister of Spain, It is also true that the Delegates from several States in the Union seemed to think that the Navigation of the Messissippi might be profitably and prudently bartered with Spain for certain commercial Privileges for a given number of Years, but the Delegates from those very States seem now to be perfectly convinced that the Measure would not be prudent nor practicable. The Subject is now much better understood and the late Increase of Settlers in the western Country has been so rapid beyond all their Ideas of probability that they are now fully agreed with us that Nature and the fitness of Things must have their due Operation. All the States referred to voted with us on the late Question and at present there is no Power remaining in the Hands of any Minister for making any Treaty by which the Navigation of the Mississippi can possibly be affected.

 Dear Sir New York Sepr. 21. 1788 Being informed of a circuitous opportunity to France I make use of it to forward the inclosures.(1) By one of them you will find that Congress have been at length brought into the true policy which is demanded by the situation of the Western Country. An additional resolution on the {secret journal}(2) puts an {end to all negotiation with Spain} referring the subject of a {treaty after this} assertion {of right to the Missisipi to the new government}.(3) The communication in my last will have shewn you the {crisis of things} in that {quarter a crisis} however not particularly {known to Congress} and will be a {key to} some of the {Kentucky toasts in the Virginia gazette}.(4) The Circular letter from the New York Convention has rekindled an ardor among the opponents of the federal Constitution for an immediate revision of it by another General Convention. You will find in one of the papers inclosed the result of the consultations in Pensylvania on that subject.(5) Mr. Henry and his friends in Virginia enter with great zeal into the scheme. Governour Randolph also espouses it; but with a wish to prevent if possible danger to the article which extends the power of the Government to internal as well as external taxation. It is observable that  September 21, 1788  the views of the Pennsylva. meeting, do not rhyme very well with those of the southern advocates for a Convention; the objects most eagerly pursued by the latter being unnoticed in the Harrisburg proceedings. The effect of the Circular letter on other States is less known. I conclude that it will be the same every where, among those who opposed the Constitution, or contended for a conditional ratification of it. Whether an early Convention will be the result of this united effort, is more than can at this moment be foretold. The measure will certainly be industriously opposed in some parts of the Union, not only by those who wish for no alterations, but by others who would prefer the other mode provided in the Constitution, as most expedient at present for introducing those supplemental safeguards to liberty agst. which no objections can be raised; and who would moreover approve of a Convention for amending the frame of the Government itself, as soon as time shall have somewhat corrected the feverish state of the public mind, and trial have pointed its attention to the true defects of the system. You will find also by one of the papers inclosed that the arrangements have been compleated for bringing the new Government into action. The dispute concerning the place of its meeting, was the principal cause of delay, the Eastern States with N. Jersey & S. Carolina being attached to N. York, and the others strenuous for a more central position. Philadelphia, Wilmington, Lancaster & Baltimore were successively tendered without effect by the latter, before they finally yielded to the superiority of numbers in favor of this City. I am afraid the decision will give a great handle to the Southern Antifederalists who have inculcated a jealousy of this end of the Continent. It is to be regretted also as entailing this pernicious question on the New Congs. who will have enough to do in adjusting the other delicate matters submitted to them. Another consideration of great weight with me is that thetemporary residence here, will probably end in a permanent one at Trenton, or at the farthest on the Susquehannah. A removal in the first instance beyond the Delaware would have removed the alternative to the Susquehannah and the Potowmac. The best chance of the latter depends on a delay of the permanent establishment for a few years, untill the Western & South Western population comes more into view. This delay can not take place, if so excentric a place as N. York is to be the intermediate seat of business. To the other papers is added a little pamphlet on the Mohegan language.(6) The observations deserve the more attention as they are made by a man of known learning and character, and may aid reserches into the primitive structure of language, as well as those on foot for comparing the American tribes with those on the Eastern Frontier of the other Continent. In consequence of your letter to Mr. Jay on the subject of \""outfit\"" &c, I had a conference with him, and he agreed to suggest the matter to Congress.(7) This was done and his letter referred back to be re-  ported on. The idea between us was that the reference should be {to a committee but his letter} coming {in at a moment} when {I happened to be out} it was as in {course referred to his department}. His {answer suggested} that as {he might be thought eventually concerned} in {the question} it was most {proper for the consideration of a committee}. I had {discovered that he was not struck} with the {peculiarities of your case even when insinuated to him}. How far the {committee will be so} is more {than I can yet say}. In general I have no doubt that both {it and Congress are well disposed}. But it is probable that the idea of a {precedent will beget much caution} and what {is worse there is little probability of} again having a {quorum of states for the business}. I learn from Virginia that our Crops both of Corn & Tobacco, (except in the lower Country where a storm has been hurtful) are likely to be very good. The latter has suffered in some degree from superfluous rains, but the former has been proportionally benefitted. Accept my most fervent wishes for your happiness. Yrs Affectly., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir New York Sept. 21. 1788 I received your favor of 27t August enclosing a Copy of an Address to the good people of No Carolina.(1) You will now give me leave to thank you for that enclosure. I do hope and flatter myself that there is too much good Sense, candor and personal independence among the Majority of that state not to do some justice to the merit of that publication. I mean that they will, at least, allow it a cool, liberal & dispassionate reading: a claim which the Author has an undoubted right to expect. No Carolina, you know Sir, has been generally considered to depend, in some measure, on her Neighbours for her politicks: at least it is affirmed that She discovers on all occasions, an imitative disposition. An opinion which has been so unexpectedly Contravened by her late Conduct that you will find no difficulty in figuring to yourself the extreme astonishment manifested on all hands at the News of her rejecting the Constitution. The thorough investigation which that Subject had undergone; the late period at which it was taken up by our State, added to the Example of so many respectable States, had induced a kind of repose in the public Mind with regard to the Event of her deliberations, from which the transition was not very difficult to Censure & crimination. Hence the reason, probably, that all were so ready in agreeing to impute her Conduct to the very virtuous Motive of preserving paper money & tender Laws. Indeed some, taking a retrospective view of her conduct since the revolution and finding her more delinquent in complying with requisitions &c., have not hesitated to pronounce her of little moment to the Union. However this like all other violent Gusts, was too impetuous to last long, & I now have the pleasure to assure you that her Conduct is considered in a much less censorious light. The resolutions passed by the Convention were too evincive of a federal disposition at least, not to have had considerable influence in changing the public opinion.Congress have at length finished the preparations necessary to give the New Government Effect after a great deal of debating & perhaps some warmth; occasioned by the indecision, or rather division of the Members about a place the most proper for the first meeting &c &c. This Question, Sir, had the power to collect all the delegations from the different parts of the Union, so that there has not been a fuller Congress since the declaration of Independence. However this busi- September 21, 1788  ness being settled, Congress, I fear, like all other Bodies about to expire, will scarcely have a Witness of it's dissolution.

 Gentlemen New York Sept. 22. 1788 We have attended to the letter you did us the honor to write on the 15th Instant, in which you adhere to your objection to the sum standing as a charge against the Union, which has been paid by the State of Virginia, to Doctor Draper for his depritiation.(1) It appears that you now rest this objection upon two grounds: 1st. That Doctor Draper was not an Inhabitant of Virginia, and within the discription of officers refered to that State for settlement, under the resolution of the 13th of June 1781. 2dly, That the auditor of the State, neglected to obtain from the Treasury of the United States, a statement of the payments which had been made to the applicant, or to require such a Statement from himself: whereupon we beg leave to observe as to the first, that we are well assured, that upon investigation, Doctor Draper will be found to have been an Inhabitant of Virginia, at the time of his entering the service, and to have joined the Army in one of the Regiments of the line of that State: As to the second, it appears to us, that when the United States, refered certain Officers to their respective States for settlement, in the unreserved terms, of the Resolution of the 13th June 1781, it became incumbent on them, to transmit the necessary statements for preventing impositions, and that it could have been expected, that the individual States were to call for them. We are however happy in being able to inform you, that every difficulty upon this point is superceded by a compliance with the alternative which you have brought to view; for the Virginia Act authorising the settlement of claims, such as Doctor Draper exhibitted, acquired from the applicants in order to guard against fraud on every side, returns upon oath, of all advances which they might have received, either from the State or the United States. Septmber 22, 1788  We are thus careful to inform you fully upon this subject, in order that the United States may be proceeding in proper season against doctor Draper for their indemnification.

 Dear sir New York 22nd Septr. 1788 Before this Time you must have heard that the new Govt. is to originate on March next(1) before which Time Virginia could not have made all her Elections, with Time for the Members, say from Kentucke, to attend. The new Congress is to meet in New York a Place very eccentric. Eastern Members will be able to attend with too much Ease, this will give them a legislative Advantage, an improper one. Had N. Car. been in the Union her five Members in the House of Represent. would have readily turned the Scale in favour of a more Southerly Position. My Patience and Temper have been tryed by this Question and the more so perhaps because for some Time past I have not considered it proper to vote on the Subject. I think that all Attempts to induce our Assembly to call another Convention immediately will be to little Purpose, for whatever we may publicly say I do privately think that a Want of honesty is at the Bottom with many of our Oppositionsts. If they seriously have alterations at Heart I think they had best adopt in order the sooner to secure them by legal compulsion. Be pleased to calculate N Hampshire, Massachusets, N York, Virga., N Car & S Car. call for Amendments & a strong Body in Maryland & Pensylvania. The Representatives from the six States requiring Amendments will be 37 while those from the other seven States are only 28. To say nothing of the Help the amending Corps may get from Pensylvana. and from Maryland. In this Case they may compell Amendments by refusing to vote supplies except for a very limited Time until the Amendments are made. That our State might not be universally abused abroad I have written the best Apologie I could  September 22, 1788  make for it which you will see in the N York Daily Advertiser for 17th Inst., a Copy of which I have inclosed to Mr. Collins. Be assured that I am with the utmost Regard, Dr sir, Your most obedt Servt., Hu Williamson ENCLOSURE The State of North-Carolina, by not adopting the new Constitution, is lately become the subject of much criticism and censure. In this instance, having done what is supposed to be wrong, it is hardly admitted that ever she did any thing that was right. We are told that during the war, her exertions were trifling---;that she had never contributed to the national expence---;and that she now refuses to confederate, from a desire to promote the fraudulent tender of paper money. Charges against the unpopular are usually listened to with avidity, but happily none of these charges are well founded, however current they are in circulation. During the whole of the late war, whenever the neighbouring states were invaded, North-Carolina was sure to send them assistance. We have seen in the course of one campaign, six or seven thousand men of the North-Carolina militia, in one of the neighbouring states, or on their march to its relief; and she now counts three or four thousand of her citizens who fell a sacrifice in Georgia or South-Carolina, to their zeal for the safety of the Union. We say nothing of her continental line, nor of those who fell within the state while the enemy pervaded every part of it. Is it probable that such armies were supported without money? Surely not. But North- Carolina has uniformly paid and supported her own militia, though they were in the continental service, and she has furnished provisions to a considerable part of the continental troops in the Southern armies. Who has paid for the vast stores that have been consumed by such bodies of armed men? In other states, commissioners have been appointed to settle the claims of individuals against the United States, and certificates for many a million, have been issued by those commissioners; but nosuch officers have had occasion to settle accounts in North-Carolina, because the state has taken upon itself all the debts that were due to her citizens by the Union, except a finall balance that was due to her continental line. These debts have amounted to several millions. Some part is already paid---;there is a large balance remaining. From the public accounts it would appear, that in the year's 1782 and 1783, North Carolina had paid nothing towards the specie requisitions, while South-Carolina had paid her quota, but this is a difference only in appearance---;for the state last mentioned, has a specie credit for all supplies furnished the army from the beginning of 1782, while North-Carolina, that furnished large supplies, stands without any credit, because she has not brought up her accounts. For several years North-Carolina has been oppressed by discharging the debts she had assumed to her continental line,   and some others of her citizens---;but she has lately begun to make effectual payments into the national treasury. On the last year she paid near thirty thousand dollars in specie, and we are told that she has another large payment ready to be made. It is true that paper money has been issued in that state, and it was made a legal tender, but it is also true, that the general sense of the people is not in favor of fraudulent payments---;on the contrary, it is common for juries, in actions of debt, to consider the depreciation, and assess damages accordingly. Has the virtue of their citizens done the same thing in other states, where bad money is a legal tender? But North-Carolina has not adopted the new Constitution, and therefore it is alledged that she is antifederal, and an enemy to good government. This is the last charge, and like the rest, it is worse founded than people are apt to believe. It is now generally agreed that the new Constitution will admit of some amendments---;they have been pointed out. It will also admit of several explanations or alterations, by which it may be rendered, not a better system, but a safer one against the machinations of wicked men. Some of those explanations will doubtless be made by the general concurrence of the states, because they obviate powers, which no man can advocate. But North-Carolina has proposed one amendment, marked No. 7(2) , which others of the states may not be disposed to make, and yet experience has taught her, as well as Virginia, that such amendment is extremely proper. The state wishes to see the alterations made which she has pointed out, and for this very reason, she wishes to see the new government commence. If eight states only had confederated, when the Convention of North- Carolina sat, perhaps they ought to have made the ninth, but ten states had confederated, consequently the general system was secure. The pause that North-Carolina has made can occasion no delay in the necessary measures, and no state except herself, can beinjured by it. We are told, indeed, that she ought to have adopted the new system, that so she might have assisted in making the proposed amendments; but she replies that, if other states are seriously disposed to make reasonable and profitable alterations, they can do it in a short time without her assistance; but if they are dissembling---;if they are about to drop the spirit of accommodation, and to hold by majorities what they have gained by accident, she is safest where she stands. A cautious politician has little faith. Let us attend to the Convention. On the 2d of August it was thus determined \""Whereas this Convention has thought proper neither to ratify nor reject the Constitution proposed for the government of the United States; and as Congress will proceed to act under the said Constitution, ten states having ratified the same, and probably lay an impost on goods imported into the said ratifying states; Resolved, That it be recommended to the legislature of this state, that whenever Congress shall pass a law for collecting an impost in the states aforesaid, this state enact a law for collecting a similar im-  post on goods imported into this state, and appropriate the money arising therefrom to the use of Congress.\"" It was also on the same day \""Resolved unanimously, That it be recommended to the general assembly to take effectual measures for the redemption of the paper currency, as speedily as may be consistent with the situation and circumstances of the people of this state.\"" These acts afford the clearest proof that the Convention of North Carolina was not actuated by the dishonest spirit of paper money. They are also in proof that she wishes to co-operate with the union, and hold herself in readiness to confederate whenever certain steps are taken, which may readily be taken without her assistance. If it shall be urged that she might now confederate without any danger, and that her efforts would be of use to other states, whose interest is nearly the same, the writer confesses that he is of the same opinion. He thinks that some alterations which equally affect the several parts of the union, will certainly be made, because the spirit of a nation is not to be resisted. But there are two or three alterations which respect the southern states, that they may have a greater security against illiberal or oppressive combinations; these alterations he suspects will not be made, because the most trifling seeming advantage is seldom relinquished; but he apprehends no danger from the consequence. The evils which North-Carolina apprehends are of such a nature, the measures would be in themselves so iniquitous, and so abhorrent to the feelings of every southern man, that despotism itself would hardly attempt them, and all its arts and auxiliaries would never be able to put them in force. Be this as it may, in all abstract questions of this sort concerning the expediency of measures, people are apt to differ, and North-Carolina in the present case has chanced to differ from her sister states; but notwithstanding of such difference, it should be remembered that she has hitherto been second to few of the states insubstantial attempts to serve the nation. Her late conduct is free from every charge of selfishness or dishonesty, and we are bound to believe that she is determined to support the Federal Union. September 16 A Republican. ""

All agree that Amendments are Indispensably necessary---; And Where We had it in our Own power before, the Convention have transferred it to the union at Large And We now cant get the Amendments unless of the States first agree to a Convention and as Many to agree to the Amendments---;And then Â¾ of the Several Legislatures to confirm them.

But so it is And We must make the best of it. Our only safety now is in geting the Amendments Confirmed.

 My dear friend New York Sepr. 24. 1788 I have been favd. with yours of the 12th instant.(1) The picture it gives of the state of our Country is the more distressing as it seems to exceed all the known resources for immediate relief. Nothing in my opinion can give the desired facility to the discharge of debts, but a reestablishment of that confidence which will at once make the creditor more patient, and open to the solvent debtor other means than bringing his property to market. How far the new Government will produce these effects cannot be yet decided, But the utmost success that can be hoped from it, will leave in full force the causes of intermediate embarrassment. The additional pressure apprehended from British debts, is an evil also for which I perceive at present no certain remedy. As far however as the favorable influence of the new Govt.  September 24, 1788  may extend, that may be one source of alleviation. It may be expected also that the British Creditors will feel several motives to indulgence, and I will not suppress a hope that the new Govt. will be both able & willing to effect something by negociation. Perhaps it might not be amiss for the assembly to prepare the way by some act or other, for drawing the Attention of the first Session of the Congress to this subject. The possession of the posts by G. Britain, after the removal of the grounds of her complaint, by the provision in the new Constitution with regard to the treaty, will justify a renewal of our demands, and an interference in favor of American Citizens on whom the performance of the treaty on our side depends.  Congress have agreed to some resolutions in favor of the Mississippi which are well calculated to appease the discontents of our Western brethren.(2) You shall soon have a copy of them. They are grounded on a remonstrance from N. Carolina on that subject. By the way how has it happened that the last resolutions of Virga. were never forwarded to the Delegation?(3) I refer to the inclosed papers for the current News, and remain, Yrs. Affecly, Js.

 Dear Sir New York, Sepr. 26, 1788. I have been duly favored with yours of the 26th ulto. from Pittsburg.(1) I believe you are already pretty well acquainted with my ideas of Government so far as they vary from the plan chalked out by Mr. Jefferson. But in compliance with your request on that subject I will take the first convenient occasion of explaining them in writing. The delay cannot I presume be material as the formation of a Government for Kentucky must already be concluded, or suspended for reasons which will not cease immediately. On the other subject, which employed our confidential conversation just before your departure, you are also possessed of my sentiments.(2) It has been frequently since in my mind as its importance made unavoidable, and the first impressions have been in no degree weakened by my reflections. Having no cypher concerted with you it would perhaps be improper to commit my thoughts to a letter which is to pass through so precarious a conveyance. It will be sufficient to say in general that I anticipate every political calamity from the event which was for the first time suggested to my contemplation; and that I cannot but persuade myself that it will by degrees be viewed in all quarters, as no less unnecessary than it certainly is critical and hazardous. Besides a variety of considerations which encourage this persuasion, and which being well known need not be mentioned, I will add with pleasure the two following resolutions lately passed in Congress, which wear a very different aspect from some former proceedings, and which I sincerely believe are the result of the real opinions which now prevail on the subject:(3) In Congress, Sepr. 16, 1788 On the report of the Committee &c. to whom was referred the report of the Secry. of F. Affairs on a motion of the Delegates of North Carolina stating the uneasiness produced by a report \""that Congress are disposed to treat with Spain for the surrender of their claim to the navigation of the River Mississippi\"" and proposing aResolution intended to remove such apprehensions: Resol'd. that the said report not being founded in fact the Delegates be at liberty to communicate all such circumstances as may be necessary to contradict the same & to remove misconceptions. September 26, 1788  Resol'd. that the free navigation of the River Mississippi is a clear and essential right of the United States & ought to be considered and supported as such. The terms of the last Resolution, and particularly the word essential, which was not inserted with[ou]t attention to its force, mark in the strongest mann[er the l]ight in which the subject is now regarded. In addition to these acts, is another entered on the secret journal, but tacitly allowed to be confidentially communicated, which explicitly forbids any further negociation with Spain, and hands over the business with this assertion of right, to the ensuing Government. We have no late intelligence from Europe, nor have I any thing further to add at present than that I am with the sincerest esteem and attachment your friend & servt. Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sally, City of New-York 29 Septemr. 1788. I have this morning come to a new Resolution respecting my Letters to Correspondents at Biddeford; and in order to lessen their number(1) and save a little time to myself, as also to add a new motive for friend Hill, & perhaps some others, to call the oftner upon you; I propose, for the future, to write all the news I can collect, and other circumstances worth communicating, to you. Tho' I am fond of writing, it is disagreeable to write the same things over and over to different persons, in different Letters. I dont mean by this to induce them to omit writing, as often as usual, to me. They may individually communicate various matter to me and each something new, tho I could only tell the same story to each of them. This may further procure you some agreeable amusement---;which I wish to effect as much as possible. But occasionally I shall answer their Letters upon particular subjects. So much by way of introduction---;Now for the News---; On Saturday there met together a number of private Gentlemen of this City and voluntarily subscribed upwards of eight thousand Dollars towards the building an addition to the City-Hall to accommodate the New-Congress. And this day the work is begun; many hands are employed in collecting materials and laying the foundation. They intend to have it compleatly finished by the first of March, the time of the first meeting of Congress. There is great policy in this---;For there may  September 30, 1788  be an attempt on the first meeting of Congress, by some of the middle States, to adjourn to Philadelphia, or some place more central. But there being a general dislike to Philadelphia, the only place where Congress could be accommodated, there is very little probability of their removing to that place---;And if then there shall be convenient Buildings already erected in this City, free of public expence---;it will be a sufficient balance to erecting, at public charge Temporary Buildings, in any other more southern place---;and be the means of Congress residing here till a Federal Town shall be agreed upon. This will be highly beneficial to the City and State. It may also accellerate the Building a federal City---;which some politicians think will be productive of the common Good. The Legislature of New-Jersy during their last Cession, which was finished on the ninth instant, ceeded to Congress a district of Land not exceeding ten miles square, and powers of exercising Jurisdiction over the same, for the Seat of federal Government---; provided it should be agreeable to Congress to make the Seat of empire in that State.(2) But I am of opinion that whenever a permanent seat shall be fixed upon it will be further South than this. Unless Canada, or Nova-Scotia should, by some unaccountable Revolution, before that takes place, join the United States. And even in this case The State of New-York will have as good, & perhaps, better claims for that honour. I dont know but this Letter is too long; but such as it is, as to length and matter, you and our friends have it. I am, dear Sally, yours &c, Geo. Thatcher ""

 Dear Sir, New York September 1788(1) Your Excellency's friendly and obliging letter of the 28th Ulto. came safely to hand. I thank you for your assurance of seconding my application to General Morgan. The truth of that affair is, that he purchased the watch for a trifle of a British soldier, who plundered Major Cochran at the moment of his fall at York Town.(2) I should be deeply pained my Dear Sir if your scruples in regard to a certain station should be matured into a resolution to decline it; though I am neither surprised at their existence nor can I but agree in opinion that the caution you observe in deferring an ultimate determination is prudent. I have however reflected maturely on the subject and have come to a conclusion, (in which I feel no hesitation) that every public and personal consideration will demand from you an acquiescence in what will certainly be the unanimous wish of your country. The absolute retreat which you meditated at the close of the late war was natural and proper. Had the government produced by the revolution gone on in a tolerable train, it would have been most adviseable to have persisted in that retreat. But I am clearly of opinion that the crisis which brought you again into public view left you no alternative but to comply---;and I am equally clear in the opinion that you are by that act pledged to take a part in the execution of the government. I am not less convinced that the impression of the necessity of your filling the station in question is so universal that you run no risk of any uncandid imputation, by submitting to it. But even if this were not the case, a regard to your own reputation as well as to the public good, calls upon you in the strongest manner to run that risk. It cannot be considered as a compliment to say that on your acceptance of the office of President the success of the new government in its commencement may materially depend. Your agency and influence will be not less important in preserving it from the future attacks of its September, 1788  enemies than they have been in recommending it in the first instance to the adoption of the people. Independent of all considerations drawn from this source since the point in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability with which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being at the head of it. I forbear to urge considerations which might have a more personal application. What I have said will suffice for the inferences I mean to draw. First. In a matter so essential to the well being of society as the prosperity of a newly instituted government a citizen of so much consequence as yourself to its success has no option but to lend his services if called for. Permit me to say it would be inglorious in such a situation not to hazard the glory however great, which he might have previously acquired. Secondly. Your signature to the proposed system pledges your judgment for its being such an one as upon the whole was worthy of the public approbation. If it should miscarry (as men commonly decide from success or the want of it) the blame will in all probability be laid on the system itself. And the framers of it will have to encounter the disrepute of having brought about a revolution in government, without substituting any thing that was worthy of the effort. They pulled down one Utopia, it will be said, to build up another. This view of the subject, if I mistake not my dear Sir will suggest to your mind greater hazard to that fame, which must be and ought to be dear to you, in refusing your future aid to the system than in affording it.

 Sir(1) [September? 1788](2) Your favour of the 6th of September has been duly handed to me,(3) and I receive great pleasure from the hopes you appear to entertain of a favourable turn of affairs in Vermont in regard to the new Government. It is certainly an object of mutual importance to yourselves and to the Union and well deserves the best endeavours of every discerning and good man. I observe with satisfaction your opinion that Vermont will not make a point of introducing amendments (I mean as a condition of her accession). That ground would be the most hazardous which she could venture upon, as it is very probable that such amendments as might be popular with you would be deemed inadmissible by the friends of the system who will doubtless be the most influential persons in the national councils and who would rather submit to the inconvenience of your being out of the Union 'till circumstances should alter, than consent to any thing that might impair the energy of the Government. The article of taxation is above all the most delicate thing to meddle with; for as plenary power in that respect must ever be considered as the vital principle of government; no abrigment or constitutional suspension of that power can ever upon mature consideration be countenanced by the intelligent Friends of an effective national government. You must as I remarked in my former letter rely upon the natural course of things which I am satisfied will exempt you in ordinary times from direct taxation, on account of the difficulty of exercising it in so extensive a country, so peculiarly situated, with advantage to the revenue or satisfaction to the people. Though this difficulty will be gradually diminished from various causes, a considerable time must first elapse; and in the interim you will have nothing to apprehend on this score. As far as indirect taxation is concerned it will be impossible to exempt you from sharing in the burthen nor can it be desired by your citizens. I repeat these ideas to impress you the morestrongly with my sense of the danger of touching this cord and of the impolicy of perplexing the main object with any such collateral experiments. While I am glad to perceive that you do not think your people will be tenacious on the point. It will be useless for you to have any view in your act to the present Congress. They can of course do nothing in the matter. All you will have to do will be to pass an act of accession to the new constitution on the conditions upon which you mean to rely. It will then be for the new Government when met to declare whether you can be received on your terms or not. September ?, 1788  I am sorry to find that the affair of boundary is likely to create some embarrassment. Mens minds every where out of you[r] state are made up upon and reconciled to that which has been delineated by Congress. Any departure from it must beget new disscussions, in which all the passions will have their usual scope, and may occasion greater impediments than the real importance of the thing would justify. If however the further claims you state cannot be gotten over with you I would still wish to see the experiment made though with this clog; because I have it very much at heart that you should become a member of the Confederacy. It is however not to be inferred that the same disposition will actuate every body. In this state the pride of certain individuals has too long triumphed over the public interrest and in several of the Southern states a jealousy of Northern influence will prevent any great zeal for increasing in the national councils the number of Northern Voters. I mention these circumstances (though I dare say they will have occurred to you) to show you the necessity of moderation and caution on your part and the error of any sanguine calculation upon a disposition to receive you at any rate. A supposition of this nature might lead to fatal mistakes. In the event of an extension of your boundary beyond the Congressional line would it be impracticable for you to have commissioners appointed to adjust any differences which might arise? I presume the principal object with you in the extension of your boundary would be to cover some private interests. This might be matter of Negotiation. There is one thing which I think it proper to mention to you about which I have some doubt; that is whether a legislative accession would be deemed valid. It is the policy of the system to lay its foundations in the immediate consent of the people. You will best judge how far it is safe or practicable to have recourse to a Convention. Whatever you do no time ought to be lost. The present moment isundoubtedly critically favourable. Let it by all means be improved.  I remain with esteem, Sir, Yr. Obed & hum s---; A Hamilton ""

 Dear Sally, City of New-York 1 October 1788. If it affords you any pleasure to hear of my being home-sick, this must be a most gratefull epistle, for it will tell you the news---;and I declare it tells the truth, that I am very home-sick---;never more so in my life, and have been so for several days; upon the whole I think it increases, notwithstanding my endeavour to put home out of my mind. But this endeavour, I find very much resembles good people's attempting to comfort and console one another under heavy afflictions---;it only makes home so much the more charming, and absence the more irksom. This is a cold, cloudy, day. I have got a fire in my chamber. I hate to step out; but still I had rather be seting by our own fire at Biddeford with the family about us. In mine of yesterday, or the day before I desired you not to write me after the eighteenth of this month; if I had requested you not to write me again after the receipt of that Letter, it would have been as well, for I am doubtfull whether I shall be here to the end of this month.  I told you there was an addition going to be made to the Building Congress now sets in. Twenty or thirty people are daily to work upon this; and the house we now set in must, immediately be unroofed---;And Congress must of course adjourn to some other house for the present. There is none where they can be very well accommodated, And I should not wonder if an adjournment without day should take place. If this should be the case you may look for me some time in this month. According to my plan you will now call for the news, & politics. The southern mail arrived to day about twelve, & brings account of the Pennsylvania election, which was yesterday at Philedelphia. Robert Morris & William McClay were choosen federal Senators for that State.(1) The former lives in the City of Philadelphia---;and is the greatest Merchant, perhaps, in all America. He was for several years Financier-General of the United States, in which Office, he acquired immenseRiches---;whether honestly or dishonestly---;is not for you or me to determine, nor is it of any consequence to us now. And it may be enough to regulate his future Conduct for him to know, which I believe he does, that the people in general think pretty independently upon this subject; and three to one dont hesitate to say, in speaking of his wealth, that ill-gotten Riches are of short duration.  Wm. McClay, the other Senator, was originally a Lawyer---;he lives now on a large Farm upon the River Susquehanna about one hun- October 1, 1788  dred & ten or twenty miles from Philadelphia; he is a member of Council in that State; and highly respected by the Landed interest, as Morris is by the mercantile. I hope to be able, in my next, to give you a more particular detail of these two Senators---;their Characters---;and the views of the parties that choose them. It is an object with me to acquire as accurate a knowledge, as possible, of the Members of the first Congress under the new Constitution. Adieu, my dear---;the first part of this Letter will please you---; & the latter our friends, Silas, Hill, &c &c. Geo. Thatcher ""

 Sir public New York 1st Octr. 1788(1) The Delegates have more than once recommended to the Legislature to adopt more effectual means to establish the various Claims of the State against the Union for Supplies and Services rendered during the late War, from the Desire of relieving the Taxes & Burdens of our fellow Citizens. I continue to have much Reason to suspect that many proper Charges are not stated---;that many useful Documents in support of our Claims remain to be collected. I shall try to explain my Ideas on this Subject that you may be enabled to communicate the same, if they shall appear to deserve Attention. On the last Year Congress passed an Ordinance for settling the Accounts between the United States and the individual States. This Ordinance is inclosed and three Commissioners have lately been chosen for settling those accounts;(2) but as the Delegates from States who have no doubtful or unauthorised Accounts (and they are a great majority) were interested in chusing Commissioners in the same Predicament, the Persons chosen are from New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Georgia;(3) Those States, as we are informed, do not claim a single Dollar from the Union but what are fully authorised by Acts of Congress, and it is probable that the Commissioners will be very tardy in admitting the Claims of other States, which are unsanctioned by Congress, lest they should thereby increase the Burden of their own States. In this View of the Case we are not to hope for Favours; we can only expect what may be demanded from the cold hand of Justice. What are the Claims that may be established by the State of North Carolina! This Question does not appear to have been fully considered. If you will be pleased to consult an Act of Congress of June 3rd  October 1, 1788  1784 giving Instructions to the Commissioners who were to settle the Claims of individuals in the several States you will find that where written Documents could not be produced, the Commissioner was authorised to receive such other Evidence as should be satisfactory to him and the best that the Circumstances of the Case would admit.(4) This very Rule must be used by the Three Commissioners lately appointed in settling the Claims of the several States against the Union in order that all Accounts may be settled on uniform and equitable Principles. But this Rule does not apply except to Advances and Disbursements, Payments and Supplies that have been made under the Sanction of Acts of Congress. On the Head of advances or Services which have not been sanctioned by the Resolves of Congress or supported by regular Vouchers we have little to expect even though such advances have been made for the Benefit of the United States. It is therefore our Duty to consider what advances or Services may be fairly covered by the Resolves of Congress. Under this Head we shall state all the Expences that were incurred in the Years 1775--;6. All the Troops that served during that Period, as well in the State as in South Carolina or Virginia are clearly to be charged to Account of the United States. The several Bodies of Militia who at different Periods were raised for the Defence of the southern States are obviously in the same Predicament and the Militia who afterwards served in the State in the Years 1780--;81, during the Invasion as well as those who served in Virginia are indisputably to be charged to the Account of the United States; for all Services approved of by Congress by the Commander in Chief or the continental Officer commanding in a separate Department are thus to be charged. All the Provisions and Stores furnished the southern Army on the four last Years of the War are also to be charged in this Account. It is said to be extremely difficult to distinguish those Services from which the State Debt properlyarose such as the Indian Expeditions & Guard Ships or Batteries on the Coast, from those other Services that have been performed for Purposes that were properly national. Or rather it is difficult to distinguish the charges on our Books that have arisen from one or the other. Perhaps there is a straight Rule by which the Line of division may be drawn, or new Charges may be raised. The Journals of the Council or of the several executive Boards that have existed in the State compared with the muster-rolls and other Documents will shew what Number of Militia have been raised on different Occasions and the particular Services in which they have been employed as well as the Duration of the several Tours of Duty. The Pay of the Officers and Privates at different Periods may readily be ascertained and the concomitant Expence of Horses, Carriages, Provisions &c. In such a Charge much will be lost to the State, because there was much Waste. In speaking of the several charges that may be raised against the Union perhaps we should not   overlook the Expences of recruiting the continental Line though this Account as I conceive has never been stated in any of our Books. The Eastern States alledge that they have furnished more than their Quota of Men for the continental Service and they have formally claimed an Allowance for every supernumerary according to the Bounty they paid, which towards the End of the War was considerable. It will be recollected that in 1781--;2 our State raised men by Draughts for the continental Service, whenever a draughted man hired a substitute he was obliged to pay a considerable Bounty. The Average of such Bounty may be ascertained, and it should be taken for the true Bounty paid for every Recruit. Though some of the Eastern States may have performed more than their Quota of Duty in the continental Line I conceive that North Carolina will not be in Arrears when all the continental Service performed by her Militia is taken into Account; We certainly shall be ahead of our sister & neighbouring States. Be this as it may, I conceive that North Carolina should be prepared to charge her Bounties in Case they are allowed to any other State. I have said that North Carolina must suffer much Loss in being obliged to raise her Charges according to the number of Militia that shall appear to have been employed in the national Service, but I question whether this mode of raising an Account is not preferable to the other Plan that seems to be in Contemplation, as subject to fewer Losses. If we have recourse to the general Mass of Accounts as settled, and take our Charges from the Books of the Comptroller, I take for granted that no Account will be admitted but such as are clearly continental in distinction from State Charges; but I am taught to believe that many of the Accounts, perhaps half of them, though properly continental, bear no distinguishing marks by which it can be clearly determined that they were raised for continental Service. This must occasion much Loss, but it is farther alledged that the Accounts of aconsiderable Part of our Citizens have been settled under great loss by Depretiation in such manner that less than five Shillings Specie has been allowed for an hundred Weight of flour and other Things in Proportion. If our Supplies shall be charged to the Union in this manner one Loss multiplied into the other will hardly leave a fourth Part of the proper Credits. You have seen how complicated and numerous the Claims are which our State may adduce against the United States properly sanctioned by Resolves of Congress, but no small share of Diligence and Abilities will be necessary, fully to investigate and illucidate those several Charges. Would it not be proper to direct the Comptroller or some other Person who shall acquire a perfect Knowledge of the Accounts and Services of the State and shall be possessed of all the Journals, Letters, Papers and other Documents that may help to explain this Subject to attend the Continental Commissioners while they are settling Accounts---;that he may explain and support the sundry  October 1. 1788  Claims of the State. Such a Measure as I am told will be adopted by some other States. It is a Business of vast Importance; Millions are depending. At present I find it no unpleasing Consideration that in Case Justice should in any Degree be refused us we have a reserved stake by which we may relieve our Burden; I mean the Western Lands. They are no bad Pledge of national Honesty. In order that you may compare the present Situation of North Carolina, as it stands on the Scale of Debtors when compared with the other States, I shall try to give you such a Statement of the national Accounts as may tend to cast some Light on this complicated Subject. By one of the Papers that is herewith inclosed(5) you will see how much Mony has been advanced to the several States out of the national Treasury from the Beginning of the late War. North Carolina is charged with 2,780,959 Dlrs in continental Mony. This reduced to Specie by the Scale is 788,032 Dlrs. The State has a Credit for 72,040 Dlrs paid to different Officers, value per Scale 1,400 Dlrs. But the whole Sum advanced to the different States is 10,536,821 Dlrs when reduced to Specie, and the Amot. of the Payments that have been made on this Account is 937,912 Dlrs. It may be observed that the Quota of North Carolina when compared with the Sum required by Congress from the Union has been nearly as 74 to 1000, which is 1/13th nearly. The Sum we have received is hardly one thirteenth of the general Loan, but our Quota of the Mony---;repaid is 70,878 Dlrs, hence it follows that we are 69,478 Dlrs in Arrears when our Payment is compared with the Payments made by the other States. The several States have paid into the general Treasury at different Times in Specie 3,190,149 Dlrs, one thirteenth of this Sum is 245,396 Dlrs, but our State has Paid in Specie 28,486 Dlrs. Thus our Payment when compared with the Specie Payments by other States is deficient by 216,910 Dlrs. The Payments of Indents made by the several States amounts to 1,881,138 Dlrs, ourQuota or 1/13th of this Sum which remains to be paid is 144,702 Dlrs. The amount of the Loan Office Debt when reduced to Specie is 11,400,485 Dlrs, our Quota of this Debt is 876,960 Dlrs, but the Sum loaned in North Carolina is only 113,341 Dlrs and if we are to suppose that the Sums loaned in each State, or Certificates for the same, generally continue in the Hands of it's particular Citizens, we must infer that the Citizens of North Carolina have less than their Quota of those Securities by 763,619 Dlrs. The Amount of Certificates issued for Lottery Tickets is 63,316 Dlrs. It is presumed that a small Portion of those Securities is in the Hands of Citizens of North Carolina. Some thing must be due on this Account but I have made no Charge. The Amount of Certificates issued by Commissioners for settling Accounts in the Commissary, Quarter-master, Clothing, Hospital and Marine Departments is 934,472 Dlrs. It is alledged that none of those  Certificates that may deserve Notice are in the Hands of Citizens of N Carolina; our Quota is 71,882 Dlrs. The Amount of Certificates issued to the continental Line of the Army is 10,900,558 Dlrs. Our Quota of this Sum is 838,504 Dlrs, but the Certificates issued to the North Carolina Line do not exceed 385,146 Dlrs whence it appears that we have less than our Quota by 453,358 Dlrs. The Amount of Certificates issued by Commissioners who have been appointed in the several States to settle the Claims of individuals against the United States is 3,723,625 Dlrs. Our Quota of this Sum is 286,432 Dlrs, but the Portion that seems to be in the Hands of Citizens of N Carolina is only 8,695 Dlrs, hence it follows that we have less than our Quota by 277,737 Dlrs. The Amount of our Deficiencies may then be stated as follows. In Mony borrowed 69,478 Specie Payments 216,910 Indents 144,702 Loan Office Securities 763,619 Certificates in Staff Departts. 71,882 Army final Settlemts. 453,358 Certifs. by State Commissrs. 277,737 1,997,686 Dlrs Thus it appears that our State or private Citizens in the State must have an addition of near two Million of Dollars in National Securities before we are on a par with other States, and we are to recollect that the Claims hitherto settled are chiefly private ones. None of the States have hitherto settled their general Claims against the Union for Services and Supplies. Some of the States have large Claims. Virginia has half a million, as the Condition annexed to her Cession of western Territory; it is probable she will establish half a million besides, for Militia Services and Supplies. Every State has its Claims and fortunately for themselves most of them have good Accounts & can support every Claim by the Acts of Congress. Perhaps half a Million of Dollars may average the Amount of Claims that may hereafter be admitted in the several States, it may be some what less. On this Supposition North Carolina must establish Claims for twomillions & an half of Dollars before she is on a Level with her Sister States. Much Care will be required, of such materials as she has, to raise this Fabric. You will be pleased to excuse the length of this Letter, Doubtless this is the last Time in which it can be my duty to give Information of this kind to the State, and I wish the Service had now been executed by an abler Hand, but if I have mistaken the Subject or the Interest of the State, I am confident the Error does not arise from Indolence or Inattention; for I can truely say that from the first Moment on which I was honoured by a Commission from the State I never have devoted  October 2, 1788  an Hour to personal Service or private Amusements that could have been employed in serving the Public.  The Subject is before you, I take it to be one by which the Happiness of our fellow Citizens may be greatly affected, but you are the best Judge of the measures that may be most proper for discovering or collecting sufficient Documents by which we may be enabled to explain and substantiate all our Charges against the United States. I have the Honour to be, with the utmost Regard, Sir, Your most obedient and very hble Servant, Hu Williamson ""

Upon fully considering this subject in all its points, we have determined that it will be but the most safe Course to rely upon the validity of the Transaction against the United States, for the following Reasons. 1st.

I suppose it will have a water passage and as I know that to be somewhat doubtfull I write again to-day. I hope this days post will be kinder to me than that of Saturday last. Don't however beleive that any retaliation mix'd itself with the cause of my not writing on Sunday. The history of that omission will be it's apology.

I should have added the nature of these arangements, for this will shew you how little they depend upon myself & will account for any excess of the time I have given myself to be in this place. 'Tis among the number of good offices done me by my Colleagues that for 6 Months past they have most industriously propagated a belief that I had renounc'd Pennsylva. & her interests & had in fact become quite a New Yorker.

Now tho' utterly false & tho' by this time treated as such in Pennsylva. yet it is the effect of even a suspicion of this kind to quicken my sense of public duty & to lead me by every possible means to demonstrate that under any circumstances I can never either neglect or betray the trust committed to me. The arangement then to which I alluded was not that of private confidence, (which must be at an end between us) but of public agreement---;that in short, they would assent to an adjournment or tacit dissolution of the body. This is I find agreeable to others & must at all events happen in th[ree] weeks from this time. I c[an] communicate these facts only as [th]ey may explain my situation, & account fo[. . .] longerabsence than you might else expect from me. I am perhaps more uneasy about this than I ought, and certainly more than I should, were my pleasure in the interview less than I'm sure it will be. But I have my resource in one of your earliest maxims---;\""that this Life was a life of sacrafice & that the sooner We beleiv'd it---;the readier would we submit to the crosses that await us.\""  Under any circumstances I am my dear Alida your's most Affy.,  J Armstrong jr.

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 8. 1788 Herewith inclosed are a letter for yourself forwarded to my hands from General Washington, and two others for the Marquis, one from the same quarter, the other from myself.(1) I put both the last under cover to you, not knowing what regard may be due to Newspaper authority, that the Marquis is under the open displeasure of the Court, and may therefore be the less likely to receive letters thro' any other channel. Sometimes the report runs that he is in the Bastile; at another that he is at the head of a revolt in some one of the Provinces.(2) My last letters have followed each other so quickly and the last of all is of such recent date,(3) that this opportunity by a gentleman going to France, enables me to add little to what has already communicated. The result of the Meeting at Harrisburg was the latest event worthy of notice at the date of my last. Nothing has since taken place in relation to the New Government, but the appointment of Mr. Robt. Morris, and a Mr. McClay, to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate. A law has also passed in that State providing for the election of members for the House of Reps. and of electors of the President. The Act proposes that every Citizen throughout the State shall vote for the whole number of members allotted to the State. This mode of election will confine the  October 8, 1788  choice to characters of general notoriety, and so far be favorable to merit. It is however liable to some popular objections urged agst. the tendency of the new System. In Virginia, I am inclined to think the State will be divided into as many districts, as there are to be members. In other States, as in Connecticut the Pena. example will probably be followed. And in others again a middle course be taken. It is perhaps to be desired that various modes should be tried, as by that means only the best mode can be ascertained. There is no doubt that Genl. Washington will be called to the Presidency. For the vice Presidency, are talked of principally Mr. Hancock & Mr. Adams. Mr. Jay or Genl. Knox would I believe be preferred to either, but both of them will probably chuse to remain where they are. It is impossible to say which of the former would be preferred, or what other Candidates may be brought forward. I have a letter from Mr. George Lee Turberville of Virginia requesting me to mention to you a report proceeding from Greenwich that a Docr. Spence and his lady, (the former a Virginian of respectable family in the lower End of the Northern Neck, and whose mother is still living, in a second marriage with a Docr. Thomson of Westmoreland County) were captured on their way to Virginia and carried into Algiers. This event is said to have happened seven or eight years ago, though discovered but lately, it having been taken for granted that the vessel and all on board had perished at sea. I am much inclined to believe that this supposition is the true one, and that the Greenwich story has no foundation. I communicate it nevertheless as requested by Mr. Turberville, that you may have an opportunity of collecting for the friends of Docr. Spence any information which may be interesting to them, and of taking any steps that such information may suggest in behalf of the distressed. I have already acquainted you with the result of my enquiries in the case of Mrs. Burke.(4) The effects in the hands ofWm. S. Brown had been delivered over to a Mr. Kemble, a respectable mercht. here,(5) who is admtr. to the deceased Burke and who tells me that the whole Estate of the latter does not pay his debts. I shall send along with this a few seed of the sugar maple, the first & the whole that I have been able to obtain. I wish you all happiness & remain Dr. Sir, Yrs. most Affecly., Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 8th. 1788 I have been favored with several letters from you since the date of my last; but some of them having been recd. in Virginia I am not able now to acknowledge all of them by their respective dates. The date of the last was in May.(1) You ask me why I agreed to the Constitution proposed by the Convention at Philada.? I answer, because I thought it safe to the liberties of the people, and the best that could be obtained from the jarring interests of States, and the miscellaneous opinions of Politicians; and because experience has proved that the real danger to America & to liberty lies in the defect of energy & stability in the present establishments of the United States. Had you been a member of that assembly, and been impressed with the truths which our situation discloses, you would have concurred in the necessity which was felt by the other members. In your closet at Paris and with the evils resulting from too much Government all over Europe fully in your view, it is natural for you to run into criticisms dictated by an extreme on that side. Perhaps in your situation I should think & feel as you do. In mine I am sure you would think & feel as I do. To the paragraph in your letter of the 9th of May on the subject of a Mission to Holland or Italy, I can say nothing more than that it is a business which belongs now to the new Govt. or if I were to say more, my friendship would guard you agst. any reliance on such an event. In the first place, nothing can be more uncertain than the nature of the System which will be adopted with regard to foreign affairs. And in the next place, nativity, is a sort of merit which prejudice rates too high to be outweighed by any other sort of merit. The Americans are an enlightened & a liberal people, compared with other nations; But they are not all philosophers. I have recd. the copies of your book and have taken the measures proper for disposing of them.(2) The number allotted to Virginia are selling there I amtold very well. I am afraid the other portions will not be equally successful. The French language is the greater obstacle, as many who can read it, expect the work will be translated into a language they can read still better. October 9, 1788  Dorhman tells he means to remit you forthwith via London about Â£300 Sterling. If he does, and I flatter myself he will not fail, it will pass thro' the hands of Mr. Jefferson. His affairs here do not produce ready means: but I hope you will be ultimately secure agst. loss. Are we ever to see you again in America? Here or elsewhere, God bless you. Js. Madison Jr. ""

 [New York, October 9, 1788] I thank you My Dr. Sir for your obliging congratulations on the event(1) towards effecting which your aid as a joint labourer was so essential. I hope experience may show that while it promotes the interest of this place it will not be incompatible with public good. We are making efforts to prepare handsome accommodations for the session of the new Congress. On the subject of Vice President, my ideas have concurred with yours, and I believe Mr. Adams will have the votes of this state. He will certainly, I think, be preferred to the other Gentleman.(2) Yet, certainly, is perhaps too strong a word. I can conceive that the other, who is supposed to be a more pliable man may command Antifoederal influence. The only hesitation in my mind with regard to Mr. Adams has arisen within a day or two; from a suggestion by a particular Gentleman that he is unfriendly in his sentiments to General Washington. Richard H Lee who will probably, as rumour now runs, come from Virginia is also in this state. The Lees and Adams' have been in the habit of uniting; and hence may spring up a Cabal very embarrassing to the Executive and of course to the administration of the Government. Consider this.

Have you any Expectation of Amendments? And after all, will it be an eligible Mode of Government. I confess that I dislike the Form, even with every Limitation of Power that can be contrived. I see more & more that the Election of Representatives will be attended with a great deal of Intrigue, that it will be a Representation of an Aristocratical Party, will lay a Foundation for consolidating the Governments, & will hold out the Name & Shadow of Freedom in place of the reality. I perceive that the FOEderalists (as they stile themselves) will jockey their Opponents in the Mode of Election in some of the States, if not in all. In Pennsylvania they have determined that the Election shall be general & not by Districts, & they use fallacious Arguments in Support of it. But the true Reason is, they think that the FOEderalists are the more numerous & therefore will by this Mode be able to make the whole Representation of their own Party; whereas an antifOEderal District wou'd send an antifOEderal Member. In this State I presume the contrary D[...] will be held, otherwise the Antis wou'd send the whole Representation. I wish the Opposers of the Constitution in all the States may be aware of this.

It rarely happens that old men are the chosen confidants & companions of young ones; & when it does, 'tis, perhaps, an honor to them both. It argues some analogy of character, whatever may be the difference of years. It is a kind of proof that the old man is neither narrow, nor sour; and that the young one is neither dissolute nor frivolous.

The delay proceeded from the idea that the subject would either have been previously covered in Kentucky or not be so immediately resumed. I enclosed in my last the Resolutions of Congress concerning the Mississippi.(4) No other articles of moment has lately passed, and it is uncertain whether there will again be a quorum, at least during the present Fedl Year. Our intellegence from Europe comes through the ordinary channels only, but it seems to prove that war has eventually commenced between Sweden and Russia. The affairs of France remain in the same uncertainty as for sometime past. I enclose a few of the late gazettes from which you will collect most of the data on which our political calculations with respect to Europe are founded. Yours affecly, Js. Madison Jr.(5) Reprinted from Madison, Papers (Rutland), 11:280. 1 The resolves of the sixth Kentucky Convention assembled in Danville July 28th had proposed that a seventh convention meet in November to pursue Kentucky statehood and \""to form a Constitution of Government for the District.\"" These resolves had appeared in the New York Daily Advertiser for October 10.

For a detailed examination of these \""Observations,\"" see ibid., pp. 281--;95. 4 See Madison to Brown, September 26. 5 Madison's colleague Edward Carrington, writing from Baltimore, penned the following letter to James Monroe this day while enroute home from New York. \""Being this far on my way to Richmond, and intending to make several calls on the way, I take the advantage of a leisure moment to acknowledge the Rect. of yours of the 24th Ult. I am chagrined that you should, for even one moment, have entertained an idea that my delay to answer your letters of the Summer, was produced by considerations less freindly, than have ever actuated me towards you; but you have releived me by declaring that every such idea is removed. The truth is that I found it no agreable task to combat the opinions of one with whom I have been accustomed to coincide in a long Course of public duty which United us together: in this situation you will naturally account for the procrastination which so long defered my writing to you. \""We are to meet in the Legislature, where the new Constitution is to furnish much business, of which, efforts towards alterations will form no small part. The circular letter of N. York I am told is received with avidity amongst you.

 Sir New York Octr 13th 1788. Congress have resolved that the Commissioners lately appointed shall enter on their Duty after they shall have been informed that the Returns of the Papers and Vouchers from the several States are ready for their Inspection.(1) Hence it must be on February or March before they can begin, but I am informed that some of the States as Pensylvania, Virginia and perhaps South Carolina cannot have delivered in all their Claims before the Time expires on which the District Commissioners are permitted to receive such Claims, whence it is probable that an Application will be made by one or another of those States for a longer Day in which they may be suffered to deliver in or to forward their Claims against the Union. From late Information I am induced to fear that our State may not have given in all its Claims against the Union before the Commissioner shall have finished the Time for which he was appointed, in this Case the State will doubtless wish for a longer day & I think it probable that the Delegates in Congress on such Intimation from the State will not find it difficult to obtain a farther Resolve that may remove any Difficulties. October 13, 1788  In your Letter of 16th June(2) you was pleased to intimate that \""The people between French broad River and the Holstein complain that Congress \""have neglected to take up some Matters respecting their Interests which were referred to them in the late Treaty &c.\"" In consequence of this Intimation you will observe that the Delegates obtained a Proviso to be inserted in the late Proclamation(3) in favour of those People but we knew nothing of another Settlement on the South Side of French broad who could not be covered by that Proviso; However being now informed that there are peaceable Settlers, Citizens of the State who may be disquieted by the Operation of the Treaty I shall certainly count it my Duty to move in Congress for an express Vote or Resolve that no Citizen of the State be disquieted in his Possession under the Cover of any Treaty made with the Indians provided such Citizen is observant of the Laws of the State or within its Protection. In the mean while I think you may be assured that no Citizen of the State within the Lines mentioned in the Hopewell Treaty or without those Lines will ever be incommoded by any Officer acting under Congress because the only Object of such Officer must be to remove lawless intruders on the Indians, but the Indians could hardly request the Removal of People who have settled by their Permission; but there is a more conclusive Reason viz The Indians must be protected by the State of N. Carolina or remain without Protection, for the Handfull of Troops now in the public Service over the Ohio have too much to do in that Quarter to be able to do other Duty. In fact a general Indian War with the Western Indians, those over the Ohio, seems to be impending. The British at Detroit by giving the Indians large presents seem to be attempting to prevent them from treating with us, for the Governor of the Western Territory is now attempting to hold a Treaty. Very few of the Indians have come in. A Cloud seems to be collecting. Two small Parties of Continental Troops havelately been assaulted & some of them killed by different Tribes of Indians. Fifteen hundred Militia of Pensylvania are ordered to be in Readiness to oppose those Indians, but Govr St. Clair writes that more will be necessary.(4) Under such appearances perhaps you will think with me that our State will be happy if by their own Prudence and Exertions they can mantain Peace with the neighbouring Indians.

The fear of a precedent will probably lead to an allowance for a limited time, of the {salary as enjoyed originally} by {foreign ministers} in {preference to a separate allowance for outfit}. One of the {members of the treasury board}(4) who ought, if certain facts have {not escaped his memory to witness the reasonableness of your} calculations, {takes occasion I find to impress a contrary idea}. Fortunately {his influence will} not {be a very formidable obstacle to right}. The States which have adopted the new Constitution are all proceeding to the arrangements for putting it into action in March next. Pennsylva. alone has as yet actually appointed deputies, & that only for the Senate. My last mentioned that these were Mr. R. Morris & a Mr. McClay. How the other elections there & elsewhere will run is matter of uncertainty. The Presidency alone unites the conjectures of the public. The vice president is not at all marked outby the general voice. As the President will be from a Southern State, it falls almost of course for the other part of the Continent to supply the next in rank. South Carolina may however think of Mr. Rutlidge unless it should be previously discovered that votes will be wasted on him. The only candi- October `17, 1788  dates in the Northern States brought forward with their known consent are {Hancock and Adams} and {between these it seems probable the question will lie}. Both of them {are objectionable and would I think be postponed} by the {general suffrage to several others} if they {would accept the place. Hancock} is {weak, ambitious, a courtier of popularity given to low intrigue} and {lately reunited by a factious friendship with S. Adams---;J. Adams} has made {himself obnoxious to many} particularly in the {Southern states by the political principles avowed in his book}. Others {recollecting his cabal during the war against General Washington}, knowing {his extravagant self importance} and {considering his preference of an unprofitable dignity to} some {place of emolument} better {adapted to private fortune as a proof of his} having {an eye to the presidency conclude} that {he would not be a very cordial second to the general} and that {an impatient ambition} might {even intrigue for a premature advancement}. The {danger would be the greater if} particular {factious characters} as may be the case, {should get into the public councils. Adams} it appears, is {not unaware of} some {of the obstacles to his wish}: and {thro a letter to Smith} has {thrown out popular sentiments as to the proposed president}.  The little pamphlet herewith inclosed will give you a collective view of the alterations which have been proposed for the new Constitution.(5) Various and numerous as they appear they certainly omit many of the true grounds of opposition. The articles relating to Treaties---;to paper money, and to contracts, created more enemies than all the errors in the System positive & negative put together. It is true nevertheless that not a few, particularly in Virginia have contended for the proposed alterations from the most honorable & patriotic motives; and that among the advocates for the Constitution, there are some who wish for further guards to public liberty & individual rights. As far as thesemay consist of a constitutional declaration of the most essential rights, it is probable they will be added; though there are many who think such addition unnecessary, and not a few who think it misplaced in such a Constitution. There is scarce any point on which the party in opposition is so much divided as to its importance and its propriety. My own opinion has always been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. At the same time I have never thought the omission a material defect, nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason than that it is anxiously desired by others. I have favored it because I supposed it might be of use, and if properly executed could not be of disservice. I have not viewed it in an important light 1. because I conceive that in a certain degree, though not in the extent argued by Mr. Wilson,(6) the rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal  October 17, 1788  powers are granted. 2. because there is great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude. I am sure that the rights of Conscience in particular, if submitted to public definition would be narrowed much more than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power. One of the objections in New England was that the Constitution by prohibiting religious tests, opened a door for Jews, Turks & infidels. 3. because the limited powers of the federal Government and the jealousy of the subordinate Governments, afford a security which has not existed in the case of the State Governments, and exists in no other. 4. because experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights on those occasions when its controul is most needed. Repeated violations of these parchment barriers have been committed by overbearing majorities in every State. In Virginia I have seen the bill of rights violated in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current. Notwithstanding the explicit provision contained in that instrument for the rights of Conscience it is well known that a religious establishment wd. have taken place in that State, if the legislative majority had found as they expected, a majority of the people in favor of the measure; and I am persuaded that if a majority of the people were now of one sect, the measure would still take place and on narrower ground than was then proposed, notwithstanding the additional obstacle which the law has since created. Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the danger of oppression. In our Governments the real power lies in the majority of the Community, and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended, not from acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of the constituents. This is a truth of great importance, but not yet sufficiently attended to: and is probablymore strongly impressed on my mind by facts, and reflections suggested by them, than on yours which has contemplated abuses of power issuing from a very different quarter. Wherever there is an interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done, and not less readily by a powerful & interested party than by a powerful and interested prince. The difference, so far as it relates to the superiority of republics over monarchies, lies in the less degree of probability that interest may prompt abuses of power in the former than in the latter; and in the security in the former agst. oppression of more than the smaller part of the society, whereas in the former(7) it may be extended in a manner to the whole. The difference so far as it relates to the point in question---;the efficacy of a bill of rights in controuling abuses of power---;lies in this, that in a monarchy the latent force of the nation is superior to that of the sovereign, and a solemn charter of popular rights, must have a great effect, as a  standard for trying the validity of public acts, and a signal for rousing & uniting the superior force of the community; whereas in a popular Government, the political and physical power may be considered as vested in the same hands, that is in a majority of the people, and consequently the tyrannical will of the sovereign is not [to] be controuled by the dread of an appeal to any other force within the community. What use then it may be asked can a bill of rights serve in popular Governments? I answer the two following which though less essential than in other Governments, sufficiently recommend the precaution. 1. The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion. 2. Altho' it be generally true as above stated that the danger of oppression lies in the interested majorities of the people rather than in usurped acts of the Government, yet there may be occasions on which the evil may spring from the latter source; and on such, a bill of rights will be a good ground for an appeal to the sense of the community. Perhaps too there may be a certain degree of danger, that a succession of artful and ambitious rulers, may by gradual & well-timed advances, finally erect an independent Government on the subversion of liberty. Should this danger exist at all, it is prudent to guard against it, especially when the precaution can do no injury. At the same time I must own that I see no tendency in our governments to danger on that side. It has been remarked that there is a tendency in all Governments to an augmentation of power at the expence of liberty. But the remark as usually understood does not appear to me well founded. Power when it has attained a certain degree of energy and independence goes on generally to further degrees. But when below that degree, the direct tendency is to further degrees of relaxation, untilthe abuses of liberty beget a sudden transition to an undue degree of power. With this explanation the remark may be true; and in the latter sense only, is it in my opinion applicable to the Governments in America. It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power, and that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by experience. Supposing a bill of rights to be proper the articles which ought to compose it, admit of much discussion. I am inclined to think that absolute restrictions in cases that are doubtful, or where emergencies may overrule them, ought to be avoided. The restrictions however strongly marked on paper will never be regarded when opposed to the decided sense of the public; and after repeated violations in extraordinary cases, they will lose even their ordinary efficacy. Should a Rebellion or insurrection alarm the people as well as the Government, and   a suspension of the Hab. corp. be dictated by the alarm, no written prohibitions on earth would prevent the measure. Should an army in time of peace be gradually established in our neighbourhood by Britn. or Spain, declarations on paper would have as little effect in preventing a standing force for the public safety. The best security agst. these evils is to remove the pretext for them. With regard to monopolies they are justly classed among the greatest nusances in Government. But it is clear that as encouragements to literary works and ingenious discoveries, they are not too valuable to be wholly renounced? Would it not suffice to require in all cases a reserved right to the Public to abolish the privilege at a price to be specified in the grant of it? Is there not also infinitely less danger of this abuse in our Governments, than in most others? Monopolies are sacrifices of the many to the few. Where the power is in the few it is natural for them to sacrifice the many to their own partialities and corruptions. Where the power, as with us, is in the many not in the few, the danger can not be very great that the few will be thus favored. It is much more to be dreaded that the few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many. I inclose a paper containing the late proceedings in Kentucky.(8) I wish the ensuing Convention may take no step injurious to the character of the district, and favorable to the views of those who wish ill to the U. States. One of my late letters communicated some circumstances which will not fail to occur on perusing the objects of the proposed Convention in next month. Perhaps however there may be less connection between the two cases than at first one is ready to conjecture.  I am Dr Sir with the sincerest esteem & Affectn, Yours, Js. Madison Jr ""

 My dear friend New York Ocr. 17. [17]88 Inclosed are 4 letters from Mazzei & one from Mr. Jefferson which you will be good eno' to dispose of. I have a letter from the former in which he begs me to add my importunities to you & Mr. Blair, for speedy succour if possible.(1) I have one also from the latter, but it contains nothing of much consequence. His public letters to which it refers have not yet been communicated from the Office of Foreign Affairs. Through other authentic channels I learn that the States general will pretty certainly be convened in May next. The efficacy of that cure for the public maladies will depend materially on the mode in which the deputies may be selected which appears to be not yet settled. There is good reason also to presume that as the spirit which at present agitates the nation has been in a great measure caught from the American Revolution, so the result of the struggle there will not be a little affected by the character which liberty may receive from the experiment now on foot here. The tranquil & successful establishment of a great reform by the reason of the community, must give as much force to the doctrines urged on one side, as a contrary event would do to the policy maintained on the other. As Col. Carrington will be with you before this gets to hand I leave it with him to detail all matters of a date previous to his departure.(2) Of a subsequent date, I recollect nothing worth adding. I requested him also to confer with you in full confidence on the appointments to the Senate & to the H. of Reps. so far as my friends may consider me in relation to either.(3) He is fully possessed of my real sentiments and will explain them more conveniently than can be done on paper. I mean not to decline an agency in launching the new Govt. if such should be assigned me in one of the Houses, and I prefer the latter chiefly because if I can render any service there, it can only be to the public, and not even in imputation, to myself. At the same time mypreference I own is somewhat founded on the supposition that the arrangements for the popular elections may secure me agst. any competition which wd. require on my part any step that wd. speak a solicitude which I do not feel, or have the appearance of a spirit of electioneering which I despise.

 Sir public New York 17th Octo. 1788. The length and frequency of the Letters, on public Affairs, with which I have taken the Liberty of troubling you would require an Apologie was it not that I had rather submit to a charge on this Account than be suspected of neglect of Duty or Inattention to the Interest of the State. With this you will receive a Copy of the printed Journal of Congress to the 1st Inst. Near the End of the Journal you will find the Report of a Committee who have taken much Pains to understand the Administration of the Treasury.(1) The Operation of this Report compared with the Act of May 22nd may prove a salutary Lesson to Speculators & public Defaulters and may help to save our Constituents from the Tax of many a Dollar. The Secretary of Congress has doubtless forwarded an Act of Septr. 16th respecting the Practice of transporting convicted malefactors from foreign Countries.(2) Inclosed is a Paper that respects a  October 17, 1788  late Importation of such People. On the last Year others had been Landed to the Eastward in Massachusits. Congress have complained to the British Court concerning the Cargo that was sent from New Providence; Perhaps a greater insult to any Nation could hardly have been offered. On the 13th Inst I wrote you in much Haste a Letter which may not have come to Hand. The Object was to inform you that the Board of Commissioners for settling Accounts between the several States and the Union can hardly be ready to proceed to Business before Feby or perhaps March next. My Information induces me to believe that three or four of the States cannot have given in all their Claims when the Time expires in which the District Commissioners are at Liberty to receive Claims; hence it will follow that those States will desire the Indulgence of more Time. I think it probable that North Carolina may wish for more Time to deliver in her Claims, in this Case the Delegates certainly will not fail to move for such a Resolution on the first Intimation from the State and I presume that a longer Day might readily be obtained. Our Affairs with the Western Indians wear a very gloomey Aspect. The Indians are coming very slowly to a Treaty, about this Time to be held at Muskingum and many of them have sent Word that they shall come Armed. The British at Detroit hearing of this Treaty have been giving the Indians considerable Presents though it was but a short Time since they had given them other Presents uncommonly large. A Party of Indians have lately attacked a Convoy of Provisions on the Wabash, killed ten continental Soldiers & wounded eight; they had some Weeks before that killed several continental Soldiers who were guarding Provisions. The Wabash Indians are daily bringing in Scalps. Genl. St. Clair the Governor of the Western Territory, who is holding the Treaty, has, in pursuance of a Vote of Congress requested of the Executive of Pennsylvania & Virginia to hold 1500 of their Militia in readiness to opposethe Indians & he has written to Congress some days ago that he fears the number mentioned will be insufficient.(3) The British are tampering with the Indians on this Side and the Spaniards have lately, very exceptionably, presumed to hold a Treaty with Indians who live within the Territories of the United States. In this State of Indian Affairs, and considering that there is but a Handfull of national Troops in Service, I think it clear that North Carolina must depend on her own Prudence or her own strength for the Measure of Peace that she may enjoy with the neighbouring Indians. I have the Honour to be with the utmost Consideration, Sir, Your most obedient and very hble Servant, Hu Williamson ""

Informs that the part preceding this has been officially Transmited. By the resolution of the 20th Sept.(1) you will find an Indent requisition on the States for the present year. I presume that Indents may be obtained on better Terms at this time then at a future time and that it will be for the Interest of the State to make timely Provision to Discharge her Quota of Indent Requisitions. By the Resolution of the 9 & 13 Sept Three Commissioners are appointed in pursuance of the Ordinance of May 7th, 1787,(2) They being Impowered by Said Ordinance to admit claims against the Union that are not Supported by Vouchers (as theren set forth) on prenciples of Equity and Justice.

This is a Subject on which I have Contemplated for a Considerable Time and it appears of Such Importance as to require United wisdom and mature Deliberation to enable the State to pursue Prudent Measures.(3) The Federal Lands in the Western Country which on principles of g[o]od Policy must be appropriated as a fund for Sinking the National Debt, are Selling and preparing for Sale for that purpose.

 Dear Sir N. York Octr. 20. 1788 I acknowledge with much pleasure your favor of the 6th instant.(1) The \""balmy\"" nature of the resolutions concerning the Mississippi will I hope have the effect you suggest; though the wounds given to some & the pretext given to others by the proceedings which rendered them necessary, will not I fear be radically removed. The light in which the temporary seat of the new Government is viewed & represented by  October 20, 1788  those who were governned by antecedent jealousies of this end of the Union, is a natural one; and the apprehension of it was among the most pesuasive reasons with me for contending with some earnestness for a less eccentric position. A certain degree of impartiality or the appearance of it, is necessary in the most despotic Governments. In republics, this may be considered as the vital principle of the administration. And in a federal Republic founded on local distinctions involving local jealousies, it ought to be attended to with a still more scrupulous exactness. I am glad to find you concurring in the requisite expedients for preventing antifederal elections, and a premature Convention. The circular letter from this State has united and animated the efforts on the adverse side with respect to both these points. An early Convention threatens discord and mischeif. It will be composed of the most heterogenious characters---;will be actuated by the party spirit reigning among their constituents---;will comprehend men having insidious designs agst. the Union---;and can scarcely therefore terminate in harmony or the public good. Let the enemies to the System wait untill some experience shall have taken place, and the business will be conducted with more light as well as with less heat. In the mean time the other mode of amendments may be employed to quiet the fears of many by supplying those further guards for private rights which can do no harm to the system in the judgment even of its most partial friends, and will even be approved by others who have steadily supported it. It appears from late foreign intelligence that war is likely to spread its flames still farther among the unfortunate inhabitants of the old world. France is certainly enough occupied already with her internal fermentations. At present the struggle is merely between the aristocracy and the monarchy. The only chance in favor of the people lies in the mutual attempts of the Competitors to make their side of the question thepopular one. The late measures of the Court have that tendency. The nobility and Clergy who wish to accelerate the States General wish at the same time to have it formed on the antient model established on the feudal idea which excluded the people almost altogether. The Court has at length agreed to convene this assembly in May, but is endeavoring to counteract the aristocratic policy, by admitting the people to a greater share of representation. In both the parties there are some real friends to liberty who will probably take advantage of circumstances to promote their object. Of this description on the anti-court side is our friend the Marquis. It is not true I believe that he is in the Bastile but true that he is in disgrace, as the phrase there is.

Letters from Mr Jefferson authenticate this document.(1) They mention also the disgrace as it is called of the Marquis.(2) The struggle at present in that Kingdom seems to lie entirely between the Monarchy & aristocracy, and the hopes of the people merely in the competition of their enemies for their favor. It is probable however that both the parties contain real friends to liberty who will make events subservient to their object. The Count Moutier & the Marchioness Brehan are to set out this day for Mount Vernon. I take it for granted you are not only apprized of the intended visit, but of the time at which the guests may be expected.(3) The State of Connecticut has made choice of Docr Johnson and Mr Elseworth for its Senators, and have referred that of its representatives to the people at large, every individual Citizen to vote for every Representative. I have not heretofore acknowledged your last favor, nothing material having turned up for some time, and the purpose of Col. Carrington to see you on his way to Virginia superseding all the ordinary communications through the epistolary channel. It gives me much pleasure to find that both the opposition at first and finally the accession to the vote fixing N. York for the first meeting of the new Congress has your approbation. My fears that the measure would be made a handle of by the opposition are confirmed in some degree by my late information from Virga. Mr. Pendleton the Chancellor tells me he has already met taunts from that quarter on this specimen of Eastern equity & impartiality. Whether much noise will [be] made will depend on the policy which Mr. Henry may find it convenient to adopt. As N.

 Dear Sir, New York---;October 22nd 1788 After long altercation & many difficulties & disputes with the board of Treasury altogether unexpected & unforeseen by us, we have at length mutually entered into & executed an instrument of writing, closing with & binding, the contract for your purchase on the Miami.(1) This did not take place finally until the 15th Inst. The general boundary is the same as mentioned by the board in their last letter to you, but other parts of the contract are more favorable, than you had stipulated for inasmuch as it expresses that the lands to be conveyed to you in consequence of the first & second payments shall lye along the whole breadth of the tract (viz. 20 miles) on the Ohio & thence so far up the Great Miami and the opposite parallel northeastern line as will include the quantities to be conveyed, (the different locations to be made compactedly & as nearly square as may be). This point, important to the settlement, we obtained by dint of perseverance the board continually insisting that they had agreed with you that your first & second locations should be laid along the great Miami, occupying a comparatively small front on the Ohio, & running the whole depth & to the extreme interiour part, of the purchase. As it seemed to be most agreeable to you, I have so managed the business relative to the application of the East Jersey company for the purchase of the little Miami tract, as that all progress therein will be suspended until I can hear more particularly from you or some other applicant for the same land should appear, which however I do not think likely to happen; but if it should, the Board have promised that they shall have preference in consequence of priority of application. It behooves us at this time most especially, while the public securities are yet low, to be diligent in our exertions to prepare for the second payment---;that being made, & our deed obtained, we need feel very little concern as to the residue,since nobody would chuse to purchase in our rear, cut off & thrown at a distance, as they would be, by our settlement, from the immediate navigation of the Ohio. As a foundation to proceed upon in endeavouring to gain associates & as an induce- October 22, 1788  ment for the people of this country to become so, it is proper & indeed necessary that we should have certain communications from you upon the spot, such as a plat or map as particular & exact as time, season & circumstances will admit, together with a general description of it's soil, face &c, drawn from direct observation. The strokes lately given by the savages to two or three of your parties however inconsiderable in themselves will nevertheless serve to damp the spirit of emigration beyond the Ohio, & there is reason to apprehend from the unfriendly aspect & disposition which some of the neighboring tribes seem to bear towards you, that their enmity may too soon break out into action & not only check the sales of shares in the first instance here, but (what is of much more consequence) retard or prevent a quiet lodgment there. We are likely to be very much embarrassed for want of a list of the Proprietors of the certificates lodged by you, to direct us in the issue of the Indents. I must intreat you to send it to me without delay & direct where it may be found, as it does not appear to be in the treasury where you acquainted me you supposed you had left it. Major Platt has this day given me notice that he holds your order for about 3000 Dollars Indents, which I shall discharge next week when we draw them. I wish to know what encouragemt you meet with from the people of Kentucke, & whether they are disposed to become purchasers & settlers with you. They are the kind of men whom, most of all, you need, hardy, enterprizing & accustomed to the Indian operation & warfare. The federal year is so near it's expiration, that we now no longer make a house, altho' a few weeks ago, the representation was more compleat than had been known before since 1776. It is to me very doubtful whether we shall have nine states on the floor again between this & the meeting of the new Congress, however much the situation of our affairs in the west orthe turn & state of European politics may require it. The people in their rage for the new constitution, seem to act as if the whole business of the union, nay every thing besides should give way to, or stand still until, it's operation, and they many of them really think, that with a kind of magic process it will, at the instant of it's commencement rid us of all our embarrassments, & make our circumstances flourishing. Altho' strongly prepossessed & very partial in favor of that system, (especially when compared with the present) I cannot nevertheless go all lengths with such enthusiasts. Time & a variety & succession of political indiscretions have brought upon us the calamities we are experiencing, and nothing but time & a series of wise, prudential management and political economy will extricate us from them. In order to counterbalance the evil predictions of it's enemies, the favourers of the new government have been lead to utter prophecies   with regard to it as extravagant on the other hand; the many have given into the belief & suffered their expectations to be unreasonably raised, expectations not to be gratified, & which in the event of their disappointment will probably furnish the first ground of discontent & give a new opening for antifederalism under more favourable auspices than heretofore to revive it's attacks. Sincerely do I pray, my friend, that my apprehensions may prove to be ill founded seriously do I wish that the hopes of the most sanguine may be answered but well I know that the success of an experiment like this is too apt to depend upon the impressions which it makes at it's outset & neither you nor I can undertake to say that this is not one of the last tryals to be afforded to this or to any other country, whether the people have ability to govern themselves or must in all cases submit to receive a master of their own or others chusing.

If they are out of print, I shall take it as a favor if You will cause copies to be made & sent on of the laws passed pursuant to the recommendations of Congress, and particularly that of the 13th April 1787, which is herewith enclosed.(4) As the Government which is soon to commence under the new Constitution is vested with the power of regulating commerce with foreign Nations, and of laying and collecting duties & imports, it will be of importance to them to be informed of the actual state of the commerce & the laws of each State imposing duties or regulating trade; I shall therefore take it as a favor if Your Excellency will cause copies of such laws of Your State as relate to this subject to be forwarded to this Office as soon as possible. With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Most Obedt. & Most Humble servant, Cha Thomson October 22, 1788  ""

I have written this day to Mr. Gilman,(2) in which I request his explicit answer, whether he can attend on the day named or if not on what day he can.

Many reasons might be urged in favor of the propriety of meeting at the time appointed, but you are too sensible of it to need these.

 My Dear friend Ocr. 28---;[17]88. I inclose herewith two pamphlets on the questions agitated in France. They are written by the Marquis Condorcet, and contain more correct information than has been communicated to the public through any other channel.(1) I inclose also a Gazette containing observations on Manufactures by our acquaintance Mr. T. Coxe.(2) You will probably think them worth handing to the Printer for republication. Another Gazette gives you the current information from Europe. The change in the French Ministry is believed, and is a proof of the critical distress for money which pressed the Court. The public mind seems not to be yet settled on the Vice President. The question has been supposed to lie between Hancock & Adams. The former is far the more popular man in N. England, but he has declared to his lady, it is said, that she had once been the first in America, & he wd. never make her the second. On the other hand, Adams has signified, it is said, that he will serve the public in no other office.  October 28, 1788  I disbelieve neither of these anecdotes. At the same time it is very possible they may be given out for particular purposes. I wish you to give my respects to Mr J. Page, and to let him have the perusal of the Pamphlets after you have used them.  Yrs. Affecly., Js. Madison Jr ""

 New York Ocr. 29 [1788]. At the date of my last on Friday(1) was a week since which I have not recd. and answer, I expected by this time to have been in Philada. My plan has been impeded by several circumstances. The only insuperable one has been a continued indisposition which has at length terminated in a complaint which has been promoted by my sedentary life, and which incapacitates me for travelling.(2) I am at present having medical relief, and shall leave this as soon as I can. I calculate on some pretty early day in the approaching week. John will not accompany me, nor probably have much further connection with any corporeal beings; though he enjoys the fallacious hope of being soon recovered, and is fondly persuaded that some little transitory & variable symptom is the only obstacle to it. He was removed to quarters which will cost me less, where he will be less disturbed & where he will less incommode others. I have an order for his admission into the Almshouse, but for several reasons I chose rather to submit to the expense, at least for a while, than to avail myself of that resource. I have heard nothing lately from Mr. Randolph. He quits the Government about this time and goes into the assembly. It is not impossible that he may be succeeded by your friend Col. Grayson, though the event will depend on several contingencies. I have heard from Mr. Jefferson as late as the 12th of August. He was then well and by his silence leaves it to be inferred that his whole family was so. Adieu, Js Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir New York 29 Octr 1788 In your determination to relinquish political pursuits I am glad to find you have not involved your political friends in the same resolution, which, until your favor 22d come to hand this day I began to apprehend. Be assured I shall omit no opportunity of evincing \""my desires to keep up a communication.\"" I presume by this time the Court are assembling, and from various circumstances, I can easily suppose, modes as well as elections, are very uncertain. I presume from the circumstance of Mr Kings going post haste to Boston, he is also amongst the Candidates.(1) From intimations, that not all the middle states will vote for Mr H, & that some of the Southern will vote for Mr Randolph, it remains doubtful who will be V President. Your determination to sitt down to your private business I have given you my sentiments upon. Five or six years application will make you more independent, that anything the USA can give you in that time, And when you have a wish for public employment, you may make your own terms. When I see how much more every way independant, the private man is, How much freer from anxiety, toil, & mortification, than the crouded, studious, busy man of the public, at his best state is, I cannot but wonder at any mans counting public employment who can live without; And in this sentiment I dont speak the language of disappointment; I have been favord by my Country beyond my exp[ect]ations, And know I have numerous friends still disposed to push me forward;(2) Neither am I old or sick; yet this truth is long since strongly marked on my mind, and because I cannot use better words, pronounce the pursuits, vanity & vexation. Vain however as they may be, I suspect my friend will plunge anew into them, before the time I have prescribed above; & it will be no surprise to find him engaged in opening the spring Campaign. Brother Thacher has left me several days since,(3) and not being more than two states represented, nor more than 4 or 5 members here,& no prospect of new Congress until Decemr, I determine on Monday, accompanied by Doctr Tucker, to sett off for Massachusetts. Mr Smith Letter was safely delivered.  You had probably with you the report of the Comit on board of Tresury. Williamson was very sanguine to have it printed in the Journals,(4) as in business which might do the Committee some honor, But they made a shocking blunder in the report, of the amt more than 300,000 dolls.; & so hurried was the business lest another day should occasion deficiency of nine states, that Congress accepted the report, & the blunder is printed in all the Journals; by which it appears, there is 300,000 dolls in the Chest, when there is not a shilling.(5) Moreover the Comitt reported that B of Tresury exceeded their orders in con- October 29, 1788  tracting for the forty five ton Copper premium upon 300 tons with Jarvis;(6) This the board think themselvs indelicatly used in; And had I noticed it, in the single cursory reading with which I was favored, I should have made my feeble opposition; Because I think the power was strongly implied, & if it was erroneous, I think being an error of Judgment should have been more delicately treated. Inter nos, Hascal is here,(7) he intimates that our state will suffer for want of exertion in our Committe, he has however filed the accounts. Also I had a hint that the ordinance for appointing the three Commissioners, is some how or other so cooked, that the Penobscott business, altho consolidated at Â£116,000, will be thrown out by that Board. Farther, the Resolve for depreciation passing several days only after our troops first disbanded, we are like to have a dispute about that also. So true is it, in public & in private Concerns, that the free horse is ridden to death. The expenditures of our Board of War, the great disproportion of men are had in the field, The astonishing loss by old money, and want of alertness in bringing forward accts with regularity & in season, will hang like a millstone about the neck of Massachusetts for ages. Two Ideas are impressed upon my mind, upon which I want your opinion, One is, the expediency of assuming the State debts, Another is the appointment of a competent accountant, if such one can be found, acquainted with the business, to advocate our claims before the board. Mr Osgood is again drooping, I think his complaints obstinate. Compliments to all friends from yr most H. Svt, Sam A [Otis] ""

 Friday 30th, Octob. [1788] Your letter of the 23d, for which I know not how to thank you either as I ought or as I wish, did not reach me 'till Wednesday, & then at so late an hour as to prevent my using the post of Thursday in acknowleging it's receipt & if possible in atoneing for my silence.(1) If Alida there was any insincerity in that omission, it was surely of a very venial sort, & may be class'd with those pious frauds that (in all events) have an apology in their object, & (if successfull) a justification in their effect. I know your sensibility---;I was persuaded of your affection & I ask'd myself whether I did not owe to the latter some care of the former. Could your sollicitude & sighs have either abated my fever or remov'd my pain, it would have been right to have told them---;but as the reverse would have been their effect, I thought (but I may have mistaken) that duty was on the side of silence. In this doubt of my own reasonings as well as in compliance with your wishes my conduct hereafter shall be different, & as I admit your right to know all, it shall be my business to conceal nothing. 'Tis true then that I have been a good deal indispos'd---;but not dangerously so. My fever often remitted & sometimes intermitted & all my Other symptoms seem to have been govern'd by that. 'Tis rather unfortunate that the great remedy in all such cases, is no remedy to me, as from some cause or other quite unknown to myself & I beleive quite inexplicable to the faculty, the bark of all things most disagrees with my constitution. I have therefore been Obliged to lay it aside & to depend on regimen, & the (in general) less efficacious applications of Camomile, Vitriol &c. &c. Their operation is slow, but friendly, & already enables me to go abroad (with caution) & to live a little in society. This too is not without its effect, & join'd to the approach of the cold weather, which has my most hearty wellcome, will I hope soon enable me toenjoy a pleasure I have so long promis'd myself, & so anxiously wish'd for. Beleive me my dear girl nothing can make me more sollicitous than I am to do away any anxiety of your's on the score of distance---;nor can I possibly have an encreas'd sense of your Mama's kindness nor of the attentions which in any situation, I should meet with at Clermont. The moment therefore that my physicians pronounce it safe, I shall set out to thank you personally for all your care & kindness---;this I have every reason to hope for in a few days. You now have a most scrupulously exact account of what my indisposition has been, & what it is---;& will I hope, like myself, find no room to be alarm'd about it. 'Till I can fix a day for leaving Town, I shall continue to write  October 30, 1788  by every oppertunity, & should you not hear from me thus punctually place it to the account of the post office---;not to any relapse into illness. I must entreat you to remember this. Jones's apparent silence had no doubt a strange aspect to Mrs. Montgomery, anxious as she must have been, on the subject of her destiny for the winter. She surely cannot (with all her devotion for the Country of St Patrick) be displeas'd with the manner in which the winds & waves & other circumstances have determin'd it. A spring Voyage will be a thousand times more Agreeable as well as safe; & (with her motives for making any), convenience & pleasure ought to be studied as well as meer security. Sunday 2d Nov., 5 OClock in the Evg. I have waited with much anxiety for a letter from you 'till this moment. The post has but now come in---;but I forgive his delay, for he brings me three, (of the 26th, 27th & 30th). By what I wrote on Friday you will find that your's of the 23d have been receivd. Your Mama's packet came in time for John. He did not set of[f] till to-day. A word or two in answer to your three favors. My mind would be at ease, were I sure your's was so. It was the effect of my last letters \""to relieve you from pain---;to restore you to tranquility.\"" Will you promise that it shall be the effect of this \""to releive you from apprehension & to restore you to chearfullness,\"" also? If an assurance, that my complaint has ceased to be more than troublesome, will accomplish this, I now make it most seriously & sincerely. I this morning sent for my Physician to ask him whether he thought I could risque the journey---;his answer was that \""should the weather continue fine for a few days longer, so far from being dangerous, the journey would be proper, & servicable.\"" I rode 15 or 16 miles to-day, & am the better for doing so. What I have most to complain of now is the disagreeable but necessary restriction of diet & exercise. I have appetite but dare noteat, & when the sun refuses to shine, I'm a close prisoner 'till his humor changes. You ask if \""business will not prevent my sharing your fire-side [. . .] Winter.\"" I possitively answer, no. However inconvenient on the score of business---;I will share it. But is it determin'd that you stay? And the poor bird is still a Captive. \""His wings are clipp'd & he can Neither support himself against famine, nor protect himself against the Hawk.\"" How fruitfull is Tyranny in apologies for itself---; first create an inability to live out of chains, & then Use that inability as an argument against striking them off. My curiosity (not my compassion) lead me some days ago to visit two beautiful captives of the same kind. They were the Flamingos of the West Indies. (If Buffon is at the Manor you will find an interesting description of them.) 'Tis a lover & his Mistress---;nor has romance anything to exceed his attachment or   her fidelity. He is the captive of force or fraud---;she of choice. \""Slavery with him she exclaim'd is better than liberty without him.\"" The possessor of my heart shall be the leader & companion of \""my fortunes.\"" Such is the story they tell. Be this as it may---;they are two of the handsomest & most interesting figures I ever saw. Not the less so perhaps for looking as if they had a sense of their Misfortunes. My complemants to all the ladies. Tell Mrs. M. that I saw Jones yesterday---;that he then said he would write---;but his letter has not yet come. He is well. You may venture to write again & indeed till we meet.(2) It can at most be but a letter return'd, not lost. I am with all possible affection & respect, Your J Armstrong jr. ""

14858,dg025327,1788,the Queries of the Comte de Moustier,"""the Queries of the Comte de Moustier
 [October 30, 1788](1) 1. Quelle est l'opinion des habitans les plus instruits de la Virginie, sur le Contrat de la ferme avec Mons. Rob. Morris; et quel est le Systeme qu'ils voudroient y substituer? 1. It is not easy to give a precise answer to this question; many of the best informed not having been led to communicate their opinions, and others having been directly or indirectly interested on one side or the other. It seems to have been rather the prevailing opinion that the Contract was more hurtful to the price of Tobacco, than a supply of the Farmers Genl by purchases made in the English or other Foreign Markets. This opinion must be founded on a supposition that the mercantile sellers in Europe could more easily combine and counteract the monopoly than the Planters of America. It does not appear that those who dislike the contract have particularly turned their thoughts to a system proper to be substituted. The general idea seems to have been that some arrangement in France disarming the monopoly there of its influence, direct or indirect, on the market here could alone effectually answer the purpose. 2. Ne pourrions nous pas fournir Ã  trÃ¨s bon marchÃ¨ le gros lainage pour l'habillement des Negres? 2. The manufacture of this article being extremely simple & easily accomodated to the use, the event of a competition must depend on  October 30, 1788  the comparative price of the material. The cloathing of Negroes is made of the coarsest materials. It is at present supplied in part by family manufacture, especially where a few negroes only belong to the same master, and this resource is daily increasing. Principal part however comes from G. Britain and if no foreign competition interferes, this must be the case for a considerable time. 3. Quels sont en general les objets de commerce, dont il pourroit Ãªtre interessant d'encourager l'importation, soit en France soit aux Antilles? 3. Virginia produces Tobacco, Wheat, Indian Corn, Lumber, Salt-provisions, coal, Iron, Hemp, tar, pitch turpentine, flax seed. Ship-building can be carried on also advantageously. It is the interest of Virginia to find encouragement for all these articles; and of France to give encouragement so far at least as she does not herself produce them. Tobacco, naval Stores, ready-built Vessels, flax-seed---;and occasionally wheat and flour also, are wanted in France. Flour, Bread, Indian corn, salt provisions, lumber and ready built vessels of inferior size, are adapted to the wants of the Islands. 4. Quelles sont d'un autre cotÃ¨ les marchandizes du Royaume ou des Isles, dont les Virginiens paroissent avoir le plus grand besoin? 4. As Virginia does not manufacture, and consumes less or more of a very great variety of articles, she may be considered as wanting most of the French Manufactures recommended by their quality and price. At present the coarser woolens of France are inferior to those of Britain, and her coarser linens to those of Germany. In the articles of hardware & leather, the English have also greatly the advantage. Wines, brandies, oyl, Fruits---;silks, cambricks, Lawns, printed goods, glass, Kid Gloves, ribbons, superfine broad- Cloaths &c are articles which may be best obtained from France. The Goods imported as valued at the ports of delivery, between Sepr. 1, 86 & July 20, 87 amounted to 949,444.00--;7 excluding Salt---;distilledSpirits, Wine, Malt liquors, Cheese, Tea, Sugar, Coffee. These paid a duty ad quantitatum & therefore the value does not appear. It need not be remarked that in all cases the entries subject to duty fall short of the truth. The productions of the Islands most wanted in Virginia are Sugar & Coffee. (Between Sepr. 1, 86---;& July 20, 87 were entered 2,126,673 lb. Sugar---;& 147,591 of Coffee.) Molasses also is wanted; and Taffia perhaps in a small degree. Cotton is raised in Virginia as far it is needed for domestic manufacture. 5. Est-il vraisemblable que les eaux de vie de France fassent tomber entierement le Rum des Isles? A quoi peut se monter la consommation annuelle des vins de France en Virginie? 5. It would be very difficult for brandy entirely to supplant Rum. A moderate preference however would soon make it a formidable rival. The small encouragement hitherto given to brandy has had a very   sensible effect in promoting the use of it, and as antecedent habits become weakened the use will spread of itself. The brandies (doubtless from France with very trifling exceptions) entered on the Custom House books between Sepr. 1, 86 & July 20, 87 amounted to 10,630 Gallons; and it is conjectured that the direct importations not entered with the considerable quantity introduced by the way of Maryland where the duty has been lower, may amount to half as much. The rum entered within that period amounted to 499,083 Gallons. The Gin to 9102Â½ Gals. & the cordials & other spirits to 4169Â½ Gals. The Wines entered within the above periods amounted to 109,948 Gals. on which quantity abt. 40,000 Gals. were French. 6. Se sert-on beaucoup du sel de France pour les salaisons et que faut-il faire poure en rendre l'usage plus commun? 6. French salt is little if at all used in Virginia. The eye is displeased at its colour, and the supposition is favored by that circumstance that it is dirty and inferior to the British & other White Salt. The objection suggests the means of rendering the use more common. 7. La Virga. commencetelle Ã  exporter elle-mÃªme ses denrÃ©es, et quelle est la proportion de sa navigation avec celle des autres nations pour le transport des Tabacs et autres articles? 7. Of the Vessels entered between the above dates---;The American amounted to 26,705 Tons The British & those of other nations not in alliance 26,903. The French & those of other nations in alliance 2,664. The law having required no other discriminations, the Custom House books do not furnish a more particular answer. 8. Comme les Americains desirent beaucoup d'obtenir de nouvelles faveurs dans nos Antilles, que pourroient-ils proposer pour fac[i]liter un arrangement de cette nature sans trop prejudicier aux avantages que la France ne cesse de tirer de ses Colonies? 8. The answer to this important question, ought to be the result of much information as well asconsideration. At present Mr. M. is not prepared with such an one. When ever he shall have formed an opinion on the subject which he thinks worth the attention of Ct. M. it shall be communicated. ""

 My dear friend N York Novr. 2. 1788 I recd. yesterday your favor of the 23d Ult.(1) The first countenance of the Assembly corresponds with the picture which my imagination had formed of it. The views of the greater part of the opposition to the fOEderal Government, and particularly of its principal leader, have ever since the Convention, been regarded by me as permanently hostile, and likely to produce every effort that might endanger or embarrass it. The defects which drew forth objections from many quarters, were evidently of little consequence in the eye of Mr. H---;ry. His own arguments proved it. His enmity was levelled, as he did not scruple to insinuate agst the whole System; and the destruction of the whole System, I take to be still the secret wish of his heart, and the real object of his pursuit. If temperate and rational alterations only were his plan, is it conceivable that his coalition and patronage would be extended to men whose particular ideas on the subject must differ more from his own than those of others who share most liberally in his hatred? My last letter(2) with Col. Carrington's communications to which it referred, will have sufficiently explained my sentiments with regard to the Legislative service under the new Constitution. My first wish is to see the Government put into quiet and successful operation; and to afford any service, that may be acceptable from me, for that purpose. My second wish, if that were to be consulted, would prefer, for reasons formerly hinted, an opportunity of contributing that service in the House of Reps. rather than in the Senate; provided the opportunity be attainable from the spontaneous suffrage of the Constituents: Should the real friends to the Constitution think this preference inconsistent with my primary object, as Col. Carrington tells me is the case with some who are entitled to peculiar respect; and view my renouncing it as of any material consequence, I shall not hesitate to comply. You will not infer from the freedom with whichthese observations are made, that I am in the least unaware of the probability that whatever my inclinations or those of my friends may be, they are likely to be of little avail in the present case. I take it for certain that a clear majority of the Assembly are enemies to the Govt. and I have no reason to suppose that I can be less obnoxious than others on the opposite side. An election into the Senate therefore can hardly come into question. I know also that a good deal will depend on the arrangements for the election of the other branch; and that much may depend moreover on steps to be taken by the Candidates which will not be taken by me. Here again therefore there must be great uncertainty, if not improbability of my election. With these circumstances in view, it is impossible that I can be the dupe of false calculations, even if I were in other cases disposed to indulge them. I trust it is equally im- November 2, 1788  possible for the result whatever it may be, to rob me of any reflections which enter into the internal fund of comfort & happiness. Popular favor or disfavor, is no criterion of the character maintained with those whose esteem an honorable ambition must court. Much less can it be a criterion of that maintained with ones self. And when the Spirit of party directs the public voice, it must be a little mind indeed that can suffer in its own estimation, or apprehend danger of suffering in that of others. The Sepr. British Packet arrived yesterday, but I do not find that she makes any addition to the Stock of European intelligence. The change in the French Ministry is the only event of late date of much consequence; and that had arrived through several other channels. I do not know that it is even yet authenticated; but it seems to be doubted by no one, particularly among those who can best decide on its credibility.  With the utmost affection I am my dear Sir, Yrs. Sincerely,  Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir N. York Novr. 2. 1788. Your favor of the 20th Ult. not having got into my hands in time to be acknowledged by the last mail, I have now the additional pleasure of acknowledging along with it your favor of the 24 which I recd. yesterday.(1) You wish to know my sentiments on the project of another general Convention as suggested by New York. I shall give them to you with great frankness, though I am aware they may not coincide with those in fashion at Richmond or even with your own.(2) I am not of the number if there be any such, who think the Constitution, lately adopted, a faultless work. On the Contrary there are amendments wch. I wished it to have received before it issued from the place in which it was formed. These amendments I still think ought to be made according to the apparent sense of America, and some of them at least I presume will be made. There are others, concerning which doubts are entertained by many, and which have both advocates and opponents on each side of the main question. These I think ought to receive the light of actual experiment, before it would be prudent to admit them into the Constitution. With respect to the first class, the only question is which of the two modes provided be most eligible for the discussion  November 2, 1788  and adoption of them. The objections agst. a Convention which give a preference to the other mode in my judgment are the following. 1. It will add to the difference among the States on the merits, another and an unnecessary difference concerning the mode. There are amendments which in themselves will probably be agreed to by all the States, and pretty certainly by the requisite proportion of them. If they be contended for in the mode of a Convention, there are unquestionably a number of States who will be so averse and apprehensive as to the mode, that they will reject the merits rather than agree to the mode. A convention therefore does not appear to be the most convenient or probable channel for getting to the object. 2. A convention cannot be called without the unanimous consent of the parties who are to be bound by it, if first principles are to be recurred to; or without the previous application of of the State legislatures, if the forms of the Constitution are to be pursued. The difficulties in either of these cases must evidently be much greater than will attend the origination of amendments in Congress, which may be done at the instance of a single State Legislature, or even without a single instruction on the subject. 3. If a General Convention were to take place for the avowed and sole purpose of revising the Constitution, it would naturally consider itself as having a greater latitude than the Congress appointed to administer and support as well as to amend the system; it would consequently give greater agitation to the public mind; an election into it would be courted by the most violent partizans on both sides; it wd. probably consist of the most heterogeneous characters; would be the very focus of that flame which has already too much heated men of all parties; would no doubt contain individuals of insidious views, who under the mask of seeking alterations popular in some parts but inadmissible in other parts of the Union might have a dangerous opportunity of sapping the very foundationsof the fabric. Under all these circumstances it seems scarcely to be presumeable that the deliberations of the body could be conducted in harmony, or terminate in the general good. Having witnessed the difficulties and dangers experienced by the first Convention which assembled under every propitious circumstance, I should tremble for the result of a Second, meeting in the present temper of America, and under all the disadvantages I have mentioned. 4. It is not unworthy of consideration that the prospect of a second Convention would be viewed by all Europe as a dark and threatening Cloud hanging over the Constitution just established, and perhaps over the Union itself; and wd. therefore suspend at least the advantages this great event has promised us on that side. It is a well known fact that this event has filled that quarter of the Globe with equal wonder and veneration, that its influence is already secretly but powerfully working in favor of liberty in France, and it is fairly to be inferred that the final event there may be materially affected by the prospect of things here. We are not sufficiently sensible November 5, 1788  of the importance of the example which this Country may give to the world: nor sufficiently attentive to the advantages we may reap from the late reform, if we avoid bringg. it into danger. The last loan in Holland and that alone, saved the U.S. from Bankruptcy in Europe; and that loan was obtained from a belief that the Constitution then depending wd. be certainly speedily, quietly, and finally established, & by that means put America into a permanent capacity to discharge with honor & punctuality all her engagements.

The Resolutions were certainly & bona fide, meant however to counteract the tendency of those proceedings, and hand over the subject to the new Government under favorable circumstances. A declaration that the right was an Essential one & ought to be supported as such, was thought sufficiently forcible and unequivocal. It would not have done to have put an absolute bar to a temporary forbearance, because that might have stood in the way of any arrangement suspending the use for ever so short a time, and ever so beneficial & desireable to the Western peoples themselves. The impossibility of mistaking the object of the Resolution is strengthened in the case by the unpublished Resolution expressly interdicting further negociations with Spain. Gardoqui it seems considers the proceeding as putting an end to his views, and says he shall in consequence of it return to Spain. What think you of the following project to which he gives his countenance. George Morgan of N. Jersey has proposed that a large tract of several hundred miles extent on the West side of the Mississippi shall be granted to emigrants from the U.S. who are to receive from Spain each about 20 Dollrs. bounty, a Settlement in land, and to enjoy certain immunities as free men, but in general to be Spanish Subjects: to be under Spanish laws, and be the instruments of Spanish policy. Gardoqui gives serious encouragement to the scheme, and Morgan is taking preparatory steps on his part.(2) I give you this in confidence because I have recd. some parts of it under that veil, and have not as yet sufficiently ascertained the circumstances relating to other parts. A watchful eye ought to be kept on the machinations of Spain. Your bargain with Col. Nicholas involves circumstances of which I am not a competent judge. I sincerly wish it may answer all your calculations. The salubrity of Charlottesville & its neighbourhood to Monticello are advantages which in anyresult, will make the bargain valuable to you. We have no late information from Europe, nor any thing from any domestic quarter worth mentioning. Your letter to your brother will go as you desire by the British Packet which sails today. The letter to Mr. Jefferson was not inclosed as you intended. The delay is not of much consequence as there is no opportunity [of it being?] sent.

 Dear Sir N. York Novr. 5th. 1788 The inclosed memorandum was put into my hands by Mr. St. John the French Consul. He is a very worthy man & entitled by his philanthropy and zealous patronage of whatever he deems useful, to much esteem and regard. You will therefore oblige me by putting it in my power to afford him the little gratification he asks.(1) I have another request to trouble you with, which concerns myself. Col. H. Lee tells me that he has purchased the tract of land thro' which the Canal at the great falls is to run, and on which the bason will be, for Â£4,000. The tract contains 500 Acres only and is under the incumbrance of a rent of Â£150 Sterlg. per annum; but on the other hand derives from its situation, as he supposes, a certain prospect of becoming immensely valuable. He paints it in short as the seat of an early Town, the lots of which will be immediately productive, and possessing other peculiar advantages which make the bargain inestimable. In addition to many instances of his friendship he tenders me a part in it, and urges my acceptance on grounds of advantage to myself alone. I am thoroughly persuaded that I am indebted for the proposal to the most disinterested and affectionate motives, but knowing that the fervor with which he pursues his objects sometimes affects the estimate he forms of them, and being in no condition to make hazardous experiments, it is adviseable for me to have the sanction of other judgments to his opinions. You are well acquainted with the situation and can at once decide whether it presents the material and certain advantages on which Col. Lee calculates. A general intimation therefore of the light in which the matter strikes you, will lay me under a very particular obligation. I am by no means sure, that in any result it will be in my power to profit by Col. Lee's friendship, but it may be of some consequence whether the opportunity be worth attending to or not. My information from Richmond is very unpropitious to federal policy. Yours is no doubt morefull and more recent. A decided and malignant majority may do many things of a disagreeable nature; but I trust the Constitution is too firmly established to be now materially vulnerable. The elections for the Legislatures of Penna., N. Jersey, & Maryland ensure measures of contrary complexion in those States. Indeed Virginia is the only instance among the ratifying States in which the Politics of the Legislature are at variance with the sense of  November 5, 1788  the people expressed by their representatives in Convention. We hear nothing from Massachts. or N. Hampshire since the Meeting of their General Courts. It is understood that in both the appointments & arra[n]gements for the Government will be calculated to support and as far as possible to dignify it. The public conversation seems to be not yet settled on the Vice President. Mr. Hancock & Mr. Adams have been most talked of. The former it is said rejects the idea of any secondary Station; and the latter does not unite the suffrages of his own State, and is unpopular in many other places. As other Candidates however are not likely to present themselves, and New England will be considered as having strong pretensions, it seems not improbable that the question will lie between the Gentlemen abovenamed. Mr. Jay & Genl. Knox have been mentioned; but it is supposed that neither of them will exchange their present situations for an unprofitable dignity. I shall leave this in a day or two, but am not yet finally determined how far my journey may be continued Southward.(2) A few lines on the subject above mentioned will either find me in Philada. or be there taken care of for me. Should any thing occur there or elsewhere worth your attention it shall be duly communicated by Dear Sir your very respectful and Affectionate Servant, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir New York, Novr. 9. 1788 Your last letter but one met me at Albany attending Court;(1) from whence I am but just returned. Yours of the 2d instant is this moment handed me.(2) I am very sorry for the scism you hint at among the FOEderalists; but I have so much confidence in the good management of the fast friends of the constitution that I hope no ill consequences will ensue from that disagreement. It will however be worthy of great care to avoid suffering a difference of opinion on collateral points to produce any serious division between those who have hitherto drawn together in the great national question. Permit me to add that I do not think you should allow any line to be run between those who wish to trust al- November 22, 1788  terations to future experience and those who are desirous of them at the present juncture. The rage for amendments is in my opinion rather to be parried by address than encountered with open force. And I should therefore be loth to learn that your parties have been arranged professedly upon the distinction I have mentioned.

 Dear Sir Philada. Decr 2d 1788 The information conveyed in your favor of the 17th ulto.(1) lays me under great obligations. It was by no means my wish to have imposed the task of so full and particular a view of the subject. The general result in your own mind was all that I had in contemplation. One of the papers herewith inclosed will shew you the state of the election for the Senate in Massts.(2) It was understood here that Mr. Bowdoin was appointed & I have transmitted the error to some of my correspondents. N. Hampshire has made choice of President Langdon & Judge Bartlett. N Jersey of Mr. Patterson and Docr. Elmer. Delaware of Mr. Read and Mr. Bassett. South Carolina has postponed her choice till January. Mr. Izard, Mr. J. Rutledge, Mr. Butler and Mr. C. Pinkney are the subjects of conversation. Penna. alone has arrived at the elections for the other branch. The entire result is not yet known; but a sufficient number of the Counties have been heard from to warrant a confidence that 7 out of the 8, and a probability that the whole eight, will be found in the federal ticket. This prospect is on the whole auspicious; and shews the folly of Virga if the measures of the legislature are to be taken for the sense of the State in urging another  December 2, 1788  Convention at this time. The real friends to the object professed by the leaders at Richmond, ought to see that the only hope of obtaining alterations lies in not aiming at too many, and in being conciliatory as to the mode.  I came to this City with a view either to return to New York or proceed to Virginia as circumstances might require. I was not sure that the spirit of party might not take pleasure in superseding the opportunity of remaining longer in N. York. That I find has not been the case and a task which I had assigned myself for the winter, or rather a part of it, would be favored by a situation in which I could have access to the papers of Congress. On this account, a return to N York for the ensuing fraction of a year would not be inconvenient.(3) But I am pressed much on several quarters to try the effect of presence on the district into which I fall, for electing a Representative; and am apprehensive that an omission of that expedient, may eventually expose me to blame. At the same time I have an extreme distaste to steps having an electioneering appearance, altho' they should lead to an appointment in which I am disposed to serve the public; and am very dubious moreover whether any step which might seem to denote a solicitude on my part would not be as likely to operate against as in favor of my pretensions. In this situation, I am not clearly & finally decided as to the part which ought to be taken. When I see the counties with which Orange is associated, I shall perhaps be more able to form some estimates which should influence my determination. This information I hourly expect, and in case it should induce me to continue my course to Virginia, I shall leave this immediately, or at least as soon as I can bear the journey. I have for some time past been much indisposed with the piles. They have not yet entirely gone off; and may possibly detain me some days longer than the season would otherwise admit.

 Dear Sir Philadelphia Decr. 8. 1788. This will be handed to you by Mr. Governeur Morris who will embark in a few days for Havre, from whence he will proceed immediately to Paris. He is already well known to you by character; and as far  December 8, 1788  as there may be a defect of personal acquaintance I beg leave to supply it by this introduction. My two last were of Ocr. 8 & 17th. They furnished a State of our affairs as they then stood. I shall here add the particulars of most consequence, which have since taken place; remembering however that many details will be most conveniently gathered from the conversation of Mr. Morris who is thoroughly possessed of American transactions. Notwithstanding the formidable opposition made to the New federal Government, first in order to prevent its adoption, and since in order to place its administration in the hands of disaffected men, there is now both a certainty of its peaceable commencement in March next, and a flattering prospect that it will be administred by men who will give it a fair trial. General Washington will certainly be called to the Executive department. Mr. Adams, who is {pledged to support him}(1) will probably be the vice president. The enemies to the Government, at the head & the most inveterate, of whom, is Mr. Henry, are laying a train for the election of Governour Clinton, but it cannot succeed unless the federal votes be more dispersed than can well happen. Of the seven States which have appointed their Senators, Virginia alone will have antifederal members in that branch. Those of N. Hampshire are President Langdon & Judge Bartlett---;of Massachussetts Mr. Strong and Mr. Dalton---;of Connecticut Docr. Johnson and Mr. Elseworth---;of N. Jersey Mr. Patterson and Mr. Elmer---;of Penna. Mr. R. Morris and Mr. McClay---;of Delaware Mr. Geo. Reed and Mr. Bassett---;of Virginia Mr. R. H. Lee and Col. Grayson. Here is already a majority of the ratifying States on the side of the Constitution. And it is not doubted that it will be reinforced by the appointments of Maryland, S. Carolina and Georgia. As one branch of the Legislature of N. York is attached to the Constitution, it is not improbable that one of the Senators from that State also will be added to the majority. Inthe House of Representatives the proportion of antifederal members will of course be greater, but can not, if present appearances are to be trusted, amount to a majority, or even a very formidable minority. The election for this branch has taken place as yet no where except in Penna. and here the returns are not yet come in from all the Counties. It is certain however that seven out of the eight, and probable that the whole eight representatives will bear the federal stamp. Even in Virginia where the enemies to the Government form of the legislature it is computed that more than half the number of Representatives, who will be elected by the people, formed into districts for the purpose, will be of the same stamp. By some it is computed that 7 out of the 10, allotted to that State, will be opposed to the politics of the present Legislature. The questions which divide the public at present relate 1. to the extent of the amendments that ought to be made to the Constitution. 2.  to the mode in which they ought to be made. The friends of the Constitution, some from an approbation of particular amendments, others from a spirit of conciliation, are generally agreed that the System should be revised. But they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty, without abridging the sum of power transferred from the States to the general Government or altering previous to trial, the particular structure of the latter and are fixed in opposition to the risk of another Convention, whilst the purpose can be as well answered, by the other mode provided for introducing amendments. Those who have opposed the Constitution, are on the other hand, zealous for a second Convention, and for a revisal which may either not be restrained at all, or extend at least as far as alterations have been proposed by any State. Some of this class are, no doubt, friends to an effective Government, and even to the substance of the particular Government in question. It is equally certain that there are others, who urge a Second Convention with the insidious hope, of throwing all things into Confusion, and of subverting the fabric just established, if not the Union itself. If the first Congress embrace the policy which circumstances mark out, they will not fail to propose of themselves, every desireable safeguard for popular rights; and by thus separating the well meaning from the designing opponents, fix on the latter their true character, and give to the Government its due popularity and stability. {(2)Moustier proves a most unlucky appointment}. He is {unsocial proud} and {niggardly and betrays a sort of fastidiousness toward this country}. He {suffers also from his illicit connection with Madame de Brehan} which is {universally known} and {offensive to American manners---;she} is {perfectly soured toward this country}. The {ladies of New York} (a {few within the official circle excepted}) have for some {time withdrawn their attentions from her. She knows the cause},is {deeply stung by it, views every thing thro the medium of rancor} and {conveys her impressions to her paramour over whom she exercises despotic sway}. Latterly {their time has [been]} cheifly {spent in [travelling](3)}. The first {visit was to an Indian treaty at Fort Schuyler} and {thence to the Oneida town}. The {next to Boston} and {thence to N. Hampshire}. The {last to Mount Vernon from which} they but {lately returned}. On {their journeys} it is {said they often neglect the} most obvious {precautions for veiling their intimacy}. At {Boston he im}prudently {suffered etiquette to prevent even} an {interview with Governor Hancock}. The {inhabitants taking part with the governor} neither {visited nor invited the count}. They were the less apprehensive of a misinter{pretation of the neglect as the} most {cordial intercourse} had {just preceded between the town} and {the French squadron}. Both the {count and the marchioness are particularly unpopular among their countrymen here}. Such of them as are not under {restraint make very   free remarks} and are {anxious for a new diplomatic arrangement}. It is but right to add to these {particulars that there is reason to believe} that unlucky {impressions were made on the count at his first [arrival?]} probably {by de la Forest the consul a cunning disciple I} take it {of Marbois's politics} and by something in {his communications with Jay} which {he considered as the effect of coldness} and {sourness toward France}. I am a stranger to the {errand on which G. Morris goes to Europe}. It {relates I presume to the affairs of R. Morris} which {are still much deranged}.(4) I have received and paid the draught in favor of Docr. Ramsay; I had before paid the order in favor of Mr. Thomson, immediately on the receipt of your letter. About 220 dollars of the balance due on the last state of our account, were left in Virginia for the use of your Nephews. There are a few lesser sums which stand on my side of the account which I shall take credit for, when you can find leisure to forward another statement of your friendly advances for me. I shall leave this place in a day or two for Virga. where my friends who wish me to co-operate in putting our political machine into activity as a member of the House of Representatives, press me to attend. They made me a candidate for the Senate, for which I had not allotted my pretensions. The attempt was defeated by Mr. Henry who is omnipotent in the present legislature and who added to the expedients common on such occasions, a public philippic agst. my federal principles. He has taken equal pains in forming the Counties into districts for the election of Reps. to associate with Orange such as are most devoted to his politics, and most likely to be swayed by the prejudices excited agst. me. From the best information I have of the prevailing temper of the district, I conclude that my going to Virga will answer no other purpose than to satisfy the Opinions and intreaties of my friends. The trip is in itelf very disagreeable both on account of itselectioneering appearance, and the sacrifice of the winter for which I had assigned a task which the intermission of Congressional business would have made convenient at New York.

 Dear Sir New York. Jany 13th 1788 [i.e., 1789] My Engagements in Society here interfere much with my Attentions to my friends in Philad. Nothing else prevented my writing you by this days post. It is probable however I may have more to communicate in Consequence. I find Mr. Adams much spoken of here as V.P. but I think he will lose votes in some places from a fear that he will be put too near the January 13, 1789  Portrait of Samuel A. Otis  Genl. If there were danger of that I should be against him, but Virginias pride, interest & affections will secure her antifederal votes in favor of Gen. W. & render her rejection of him impossible. I have come to believe Mr. Adams's friends are taking pains to secure his Election. Whatever appears in his favor should be now very sensible and moderate---;not calculated for popular impression. I wish to be perfectly unknown & unobserved, but I shall not omit to promote him. New York has again clog'd the federal System by suspending her election of Senators & Electors.(1) It is thought by many here the Senate will give way. I doubt it much. The Scene of emotion at Albany is almost as great as that at Poughkeepsie was. It appears probably that Massachusetts will be very long in fixing their Electors & Reps. for it seems there must be a Majority of the whole voters. I have recd. a letter from Maryland from wch. I find they want information about the person proposed as V.P. I have answered it as you will suppose. What I mention on this point of the V.P. confine to Mr. Wilson, and request him to say Nothing of me. It is rumored here that the Election for Reps. in South Cara. has not gone very well. Four are said to be lost, but I cannot believe it.  My reception here has been polite, respectful and very cordial. A few military men have mentioned the publications with pointed disapprobation. I find our Senators & Representatives & the general Conduct of the Cause in Pennsa. extremely agreeable here. The city election for Electors seemed to create delight. While several states shew a Jealousy of Pennsa., all seem to esteem & rely on her wisdom & strength and to expect much from the Influence of her example. Four States are represented & three in part. A Quorum from seven will be here by the 20th---;when a president will be chosen. Mr. Wadsworth has been mentioned to me. I have some wishes on this Subject of which more hereafter. We have noEuropean News. Jersey has given us six federalists as electors, & Connecticut has given us federalists as Representatives & Electors. That state is much to be relied on. Since the Pennsylvania & Connecticut elections have gone so well it is impossible two thirds can be brought to require a Convention on any dangerous Amendments. I find by accounts just recd. that there is reason to believe 5 of the Massachusets returns will be complete, & federal---;the other three must be tried over again.  I wish our papers were a little milder on the Subject of New York. It does harm here among the foreign people & men in Government. Give this hint to Mr. Brown---;and tho our friend Mr. Hall is a chaste printer---;it may not be amiss to mention it to him---;at the same give my respects to him. January 19, 1789  I find the Subject of manufactures will require a delicate hand to manage them with the Union at large. I fear the interference of the legislature of Pennsa. will be found necessary to maintain ours at first. But say Nothing of this for it will require explanation.(2) With my respectf. comps. to Mrs. R, I am Yr. affecte. friend & Serv,  Tench Coxe(3) ""
