  Sir Princeton 4th August 1784 [i.e., 1783]  Your Excellency has been very unfortunate in the means you employed for conveying intelligence. Yours of the 20th May came to hand 10 or 12 days ago & not sooner, of course the Philadelphia printers had copies of it from other newspapers before we could send them a manuscript.(1) Inclosed is Master Rivingtons veritable Gazette not Gazette of verity in which you will observe the speech is reprinted. Had the Executives of other States at an early hour recommended those generous & manly sentiments which you have proposed to the General Assembly much confusion might have been prevented in the United States, and those vagabonds would properly have been considered of little importance who like flies on the political wheel have, poor Devils, in vain attempted to retard the progress of Liberty. The definitive Treaty has indeed been strangely delayed but we have not received a single Line from one of our Ministers on that subject since (I think) the 7th of April. We knew that the extraordinary political Phenomenon, the absolute want of a Ministry in England for near seven weeks, delayed all negotiations. Our last accounts stated that negotiations seemed to go on seriously. There is reason to believe the definitive Treaty was signed at Paris on the 27th May, near 20 Days might be required for ratification in the several European Courts concerned, before which no publication could be made. We however may daily look for a Copy to be ratifyed here. The reasons which induced Congress to adjourn to this place have been pretty fully explained in a Public Letter from the Delegates.(2) Concerning our future motions I cannot even give you conjectures, except that I suppose we shall leave this before Winter, because I think we cannot continue here with any degree of comfort during the Winter. Invitations for going to different places croud thick upon us. I have written to the Post Master General (3) respecting the Letters which are detained in the office at New Bern. Should you have received these Letters befor[e] this comes to hand I shall be obliged to you for  AUGUST 4, 1783  an exact Copy of the endorsement on each of those Letters. If they are still detained you will be so good as cause a friend in New Bern to take a Copy of the whole superscription & send it to the Delegates. If the post officers are clearly culpable we shall know what measures should be taken, if the detention arises from some ambiguity in the words of the ordinance, the ambiguity must be removed. If the name of a member of Congress is on the Letter or of one of our Public Ministers, or if it is to the Govr. of a state it should doubtless be free provided it is said by the inscription to be free or to be on public service. But there have been several complaints of Letters detained in the first of these predicaments merely because they had not also the marks free or public service on them. In all such cases however a Habeus Corpus has issued. I have the honor &ca. Hugh Williamson  ""

  Dear Sir Annapolis Jan. 1. 1784. Your favour of the 10th Dec. came to hand about a fortnight after its date.(1) It has occasioned me to reflect a little more attentively on Buffon's central heat than I did in the moment of our conversation and to form an opinion different from what I then expressed. The term 'central heat' does of itself give us a false idea of Buffon's hy-pothesis. If it meant a heat lodged in the center of the earth and diffusing it's warmth from thence to the extremities, then certainly it would be less in proportion to the distance from that center, & of course less under the equator than the poles, on high mountains than  JANUARY 1, 1784  in deep vallies. But Buffon's theory is that this earth was once in a state of hot fusion, and that it has been, and still continues to be, cooling. What is the course of this process? A heated body being surrounded by a colder one whether solid or fluid, the heat, which is itself a fluid, flows into the colder body equally from every point of the hotter. Hence if a heated spheroid of iron cools to a given degree, in a given space of time, an inch deep from it's surface, in one point, it has in the same time done the same in any & every other point. In a given time more, it will be cooled all round to double that depth, so that it will always be equally cooled at equal depths from the surface. This would be the case of Buffon's earth if it were a smooth figure without unevennesses, but it has mountains and vallies. The tops of mountains will cool to greater depths in the same time than the sides of mountains & than plains in proportion as the line a.b. is longer than a.c. or d.e. or f.g. In the valley the line h.i. or depth of the same temperature will be the same as on a plain.(2) This however is very different from Buffon's opinion. He sais that the earth being thinnest at the poles will cool sooner there than under the equator where it is thicker. If my idea of the process of cooling be right his is wrong and his whole theory in the Epochs of nature is overset. The note which I delivered you contained an acknowledgement of my having borrowed from you a draught for 333 1/3 dollars and a promise to repay it on demand. This was exclusive of what I had borrowed in Philadelphia. We have never yet had more than 7 states, and very seldom that, as Maryland is scarcely ever present, and we are now without a hope of it's attending till February. Consequently having six states only, we do nothing. Expresses & letters are gone forth to hasten on the absent states that we may have 9 for a ratification of the definitive treaty. Jersey perhaps may come in, and if Beresford will not come to Congress, Congress must go to him to do this one act.(3) Even now it is full late. The critical situation in which we are like to be gave birth to an idea that 7 might ratify, but it could not be supported.(4) I will give you a further account of this when it shall be finally settled. The letters of our ministers inform us that the two empires have formed a league defensive against Christian powers & offensive agt the Turks. When announced by the Empress to the K. of Prussia he answered that he was very sensible on it as one is when informed of important things. France answered in a higher tone and offered to mediate. If Prussia will join France perhaps it may prevent the war: if he does not, it will be bold for France alone to take the aid of the Turks on herself. Ireland is likely to find employment for England. The United Netherlands are in high fermentation. The people now marshall themselves in arms and exercise regularly under the banners of their towns. Their object is to reduce the powers of the Stadtholder.   I have forwarded your letter to mrs. House. Mrs. Trist I expect left Philadelphia about the 18th of Dec. for Pittsburgh. I had a letter from her in which she complained of your not having written and desired me to mention it to you. I made your excuse on the good grounds of the delays you must have experienced on your journey & your distance from the post road: but I am afraid she was gone before my letter reached Philadelphia. I have had very ill health since I have been here and am getting rather lower than otherwise.(5) I wish you every felicity and am with sincere affection, Your friend & servt. Th. Jefferson ""

  Dear Sir,(1) Annapolis Jany. 1st. 1784  I have received a letter from our friend Doctor Franklin informing that a Mr. DuPont had at the desire of his Serene Highness the Margrave of Bade, requested him to procure a certificate of the death and burial of a Mr. Adam Marggrander, a subject of that Prince.(2) This Mr. Marggrander, as Mr. duPont informs, set out from his own Country in 1774 for Philadelphia in company with a Mr. Gucker de Schreck and was employed there by a Mr. Heintz a brewer in Market Street, and was drowned. As the Prince interests himself warmly in this matter, Mr. Franklin has earnestly requested me to procure if possible what is desired, and as I am persuaded Mr. duPont must have mispelt your name and that it was at your Brewery Mr Marggrander was employed, I take the liberty of troubling you with this and requesting you if a register has been kept of the deaths and burials to obtain an authenticated extract from it as far as respects Mr. Adam Marggrander, or if that has not been the case to procure a certificate of his death and burial duly attested under the hand and seal of some public Officer and send it to me, that I may transmit it to the Doctor.

  [January 2, 1784] (1)  Whereas it is stipulated in definitive treaty of peace between the United states and his Britannic majesty that the ratifications of the said treaty shall be exchanged on or before the 3d day of March next and there now remains before that period little more time than is requisite for the passage of the sd. ratification across the Atlantic; And Congress consisting at present but of 7 states, these differ in opinion, some of them considering 9 as requisite under the Confederation to the establishment of every treaty while others are of opinion that nine having ratified the Provisional treaty, and instructed their ministers to enter into a definitive one conformable thereto which is accordingly done, seven may under these particular circumstances ratify what has been so declared by nine to have their approbation; and those of the former opinion being equally desirous with the latter that no power which it may be supposed they possess should remain unexercised for the final ratification of this instrument provided it may be done with the preservation of good faith towards the other contracting party and without being supposed to convey any opinion of Congress that such ratification is authoritative, which supposition would be contrary to truth:  Resolved therefore that the states now present in Congress do declare their approbation and ratification of the said treaty; that the same be duly attested under the seal of the states: and transmitted to our ministers: that so soon as nine states shall be present in Congress, the said treaty shall be submitted to them and their ratification & when obtained shall be transmitted to our ministers also in hope of it's reaching them by the stipulated time, in which case this shall be used and the former cancelled; that if however they do not receive the  JANUARY 3, 1784  ratification by nine states before the time for exchange they then produce the act of the seven states, offering it to the acceptance of the other party in exchange for theirs with assurance that it will be followed by another expedited by nine states which shall be delivered to them also; and at the same time explaining (if they find it necessary for the preservation of our good faith) the differences of opinion which exist as to the competence of seven states to this act; or if it be more eligible to the other party that then they agree on a further day for the exchange of ratification.

  My Dear Sir, Annapolis 5 Jany. 1784 I should have done Myself the pleasure of replying to your kind Epistle of 20 Septemr. before this time, but a variety of Engagemts. prevented me. We have Equal Merit in Opening the Correspondence. You wrote before you knew I had taken up the Quill, as did your Humble Servant before He knew, you would keep your promise. Therefore Your reproaches must be Withdrawn. Yours came to Hand just at the Moment of Election, when Our passions were all alive, Each straining Every Nerve to place the Characters We Esteemed in the House of Assembly--the success of Our Labors you have had from Our Friend \""Just so.\"" My Appointment to the Seat I am now in immediately Succeeded this Business--these two Events must therefore be my apology. Your Observations on the Late American Business, are good. Dr Rush, a few days ago sent me per post your Letter to Him--in that, you are much more explicit, and don't think I flatter you when I inform you, that Many Compliments were paid to My Friend by Gentlemen, whose Opinions he respects--however, I will quit the subject as I know you are very irritable, a little smoothing down may not be disagreeable to you, as well as some other Folks. I fancy you have had a Minute Detail of the Motions of Congress, with the reasons 'pro and Con'. If I have time before this Vessell goes, I will give you My thoughts & Information, and unravel some Matters, which I am sure will strike you, and that from your perfect knowledge of Characters & Circumstances, you will join Issue with me. I thank you for your kind Expressions and Services with regard to My relation in London. Some Letters from Me, which must have got to your Hands immediately after date of yours, will make you Acquainted with some particulars, which may point out My Wishes, and in what Manner you can do me very Essential Services. I need not tell you what were My feelings on taking a Seat in the supreme Council of the Nation--you can guess better than I can Ex- JANUARY 5, 1784  press them; I wish I had You at My Elbow; My Bashfulness is intolerable, I sweat at Every pore, but have made some Essays, and am determined to blunder on, till I can speak (if possible) without Embarrassment. I had not a Single habit of public Life about me, and therefore quite a Virgin Character (I don't say any thing of other parities). Unfortunate for Our Delegation, not a limb of the Law among Us, tho I cannot Complain of My Colliague Genl Hand, who is Sensible and Intelligent, and at the same time, too Modest. Mifflin is Out of the Question, being Our president, I can only have His assistance in the Closet, except Voting. Here we have been seven States for a Month, and though perfectly Competent in My Opinion, to the Ratification of the Definitive Treaty, it is not yet done. At first blush, on reading the 6th Section 9th Article of the Confederation I was of another Opinion--but on mature Consideration, I now think seven may Confirm what Nine Consented to--that is--Nine States instructed Our Ministers to make the preliminary or rather the provisional Articles, A Definitive. I have not made politics A Study, but I recollect the triple Alliance, made by Sir W. Temple. The United Netherlands, by their Constitution, require a Unanimous Vote of the States on the Question of peace or war, but in this Instance, a Majority determined.(1) The Swedish Court by their Minister, told the States, their Act was Unconstitutional, and demanded a record should be made by Each State and registered in its Archives. This, they absolutely refused, and yet the Treaty was good. The Interference of One Foreign power, to controul the Act of Another, is too idle to argue on. In Commonwealths, the Members of the Great Council are amenable only to their Constituents, the Sovereignty, which sent them to it--for my part I will, should the Question come before Us, at every risque of displeasure of the State I have the Honor to represent, Vote for the immediate Ratification. The Consequences, from another conduct, are too strikingly Obvious, and too serious to enter into their Detail. Our Election of Directors comes on in a few days.(2) I suppose My absence will induce the proprietors to drop me, but I would rather continue and have hinted as much to Our Worthy president, your Father in Law.(3) I hope you will be with us before the Expiration of another year, and I shall be always happy to sit at the same board with you. Now I am on this subject, I must acquaint you that 33 1/3d has been given for the old Stock--so writes My Brother SCM (4) to me by last post--the Dividend for the last Six Months, will be between 7 and 8. I am now at the fountain head of Information of a particular kind but not of the sort to Entertain you. We have Complimentary Letters from all the powers of Europe, and some of the Tawny Ones--from the Gallic Cock to the Humble Knights of Malta--from the Nuncio of His Holiness and the Emperor of Morocco.  We have had some Excellent Letters from Our Ministers abroad, the Contents of which are highly interesting, but the seal of secrecy is fixed on them, and of Course I am debarred from the pleasure I should Enjoy by Communicating them to you. Our Files are pretty well Loaded, but I think with a little Industry, the Most important papers may be got thro.' Those of Lesser Moment may be left. Congress may then seperate and a Committee of the States take up the Business. Our President will of Course be the Delegate for Pensilvania in the Committee, and I shall return with Infinite Satisfaction to the pursuits of private Life. I am too Domestic an Animal to be at this distance from My family, added to which, the cares which ever follow an Encreasing House make a strict Attention to Business Necessary.(5) I must Endeavour to bring up the Losses of the last year of the War, which you know the Merchants of Philada were very sensible of & We were not without our Share. I hope you complied with a former requisition of mine, I mean the New publications--if not, I now lay my Commands on you--it was certainly a Modest one and ought to have attention paid it. Before I quit, I'll just tell you there is No prospect of a Convention being agreed on by the Hon. Censors--their doings, as Jonathan says, are rather of the Conclave Complexion. Let me beg you to present My Compliments to Mrs. Bingham, and to ask you how many Young Ones you score now. I suppose you'll bring over with you, An American, English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian & Morrocco Brood--for I take it for granted you'll be Employ'd in begetting in all these Countries. What say you to a plenipo's Commission to the Numidian prince? Adieu My Dr sir & believe me with Great truth & affect. Yr. Friend & Servt. Cad.

The Secretary informed me that Mr. Jefferson, who drew up the report, had sent it in; but desired it might not be read till he could attend, which the state of his Health did not permit to do on this day.(1) I have read the report, it contains a recital of the resolutions & proceedings of Congress relating to appeals, and of the powers given by the several Acts of New Hampr. to Congress in those cases, & concludes with recommending a Resolution purporting that the Court of Appeals were not authorized by any resolutions of Congress to take Cognisance in the Case of the Lusanna.

  My dear Friend, Annapolis 14th Jany 84  The definitive Treaty is this Day ratified by Congress, & I have but a few Moments by Colonel Harmar, who is charged with the Delivery thereof,(1) to inform You that Mr Dana is arrived & requested to attend Congress.(2) I have suggested to some of my Friends the good policy of appointing him to a Seat in Congress, & to him the Advantages to be at this Time expected from the Measure; & I flatter myself, it will be adopted. The Dispatches by Mr Thaxter have been committed & a Report is made for authorizing Yourself, Doctor Franklin & Mr Jay to negotiate Treaties with every power mentioned in your Letters.(3) The general principles of the Treaties are stated in the report, conformable to which You are to be authorized to enter into them, without first reporting to Congress, as was proposed by the Resolutions of October last, pasd at Princeton. Those proceedings appeared to me calculated to defeat every Treaty & confine our Commerce to France & Holland, for after you had formed the projects, as they are called, & sent them to America, projects of another Nature, would have been contrived here to have made alterations which would have in Effect rendered null your proceedings. I hope the report will pass as it now stands & that You will be expeditious in the Business. I observe by your Letters that according to your Orders You have reported your conferences to the Secretary of foreign affairs.

  Dear Sir Annapolis 15 Jany 1784  Yesterday nine States being for the first time since October last represented, Congress immediately took up and ratified the definitive  JANUARY 15, 1784  treaty with the unanimous consent not only of all the states represented but of every individual Member in Congress. And that it might reach you with the greatest dispatch they immediately sent off col J Harmar with the ratification by the way of New York, there being no vessel sailing from this bay. They also sent a duplicate to be forwarded by Mr Morris, and this day from an earnest desire that it may if possible arrive in due time they have determined to send lieut col D.S. Franks with a triplicate to take the chance of a vessel from some of the eastern ports.  I wrote a few lines by Col Harmar to inform you that I had receivd your favour of the 13 Sept with the papers enclosed and have taken steps to obtain the information desired.(1) I have written to Mr R Haines respecting Mr Marggrander, And have directed enquiries to be made respecting Charles Francis D'Averton and Gabriel Vigeral.(2) The memorial of Doct D Barry & Wife I have communicated to the delegates of North Carolina, but apprehend if matters are as stated in their memorial they have only to send an agent with proper powers to obtain the object of their wishes. As to the paper stating the Granville claim I have also communicated it to the North Carolina delegates, but apprehend that is a business which must be settled with the government of the states as the claim of Mr Lotbinier must be with the government of the state where his lands lie. The demand on Baron Steuben is only proper for an Attorney at Law, and by no means a state matter and therefore I must beg leave to decline meddling with it. I have the satisfaction to inform you that a disposition begins to prevail in the states to comply with the requisitions of Congress and to grant funds for the regular payment of the interest and discharge of the principal of the debts contracted by the war. I make no doubt but the creditors in Europe are anxious and uneasy at the backwardness of the states. But whoever consults the history of nations will find that taxation is among the late Acts of government, that in governments which have been long established it is not without great difficulty that permanent funds are introduced and even in the oldest governments new taxes often occasion great uneasiness. Considering therefore that in the United States every thing is new and unusual instead of being surprized at the backwardness of the people in this respect, it is rather a matter of wonder that they have made so great a progress and have discovered such a facility of getting the better of that aversion to taxes which is so universally prevalent. For my own part I have a great confidence in the good sense of my country men in general, nor can I admit a doubt but that they will speedily fall upon measures to do justice to all the public creditors. Though you and I have lived to see a great work accomplished, yet much still remains to be done to secure the happiness of this Country. May that Almighty Being who has thus far conducted us safely through many scenes of difficulty and distress   inspire the people of these United States with wisdom to improve the opportunity now afforded of becoming a happy nation. I need not recommend col Franks to your notice as you are already acquainted with him. He has great Merit for the early part he took & the sacrifices he has made in the late controversy & his steady adherence to our cause.  I long for the pleasure of seeing you, but forego that pleasure with the more ease as I am sensible you are usefully employed in a work which is of great importance to our country. I need not assure you that I am with the most perfect esteem & respect, Dear Sir, Your affectionate old friend, Cha Thomson  ""

  Dear Sir, Annapolis Jany 15. 1784 Though I am sensible that lieut Col D. S. Frank, who is the bearer of this needs no introduction or recommendation to you, yet I cannot suffer him to go without a line from me. He is intrusted with a triplicate Ratification of the definitive treaty, which passed yesterday, the first time we have had nine states represented since Octr. last, and which was done with the unanimous consent not only of every state but of every member in Congress. The proclamation and recommendation of which he carries copies passed also with a like unanimous consent; so that I have strong hopes the treaty will be carried into full effect, and that when the passions of the people are cooled a spirit of conciliation will prevail. But considering what many have suffered, whose feelings are still alive & whose wounds are not yet closed And considering that our new established governments have not attained their full tone and vigour, it can hardly be expected that people will in a moment forget what is past and suddenly return to an interchange of friendly Offices with those, whom for years past they have considered as their most bitter enemies. My apprehensions are greatest from your state where the people have suffered most, and yet there is such a spirit and vigour in that government, that I trust matters will be conducted with prudence and moderation. We have had no delegates from that State since the first Monday in November, occasioned as I am informed by a law of the state which prevented the meeting of the Assembly till the city was evacuated.

  Dear Sir (1) Annapolis Jan. 16. 1784. Lt. Colo. Franks being appointed to carry to Paris one of the copies of our ratification of the Def. treaty, & being to depart in the instant of his appointmt. furnishes me a hasty opportunity of obtruding myself on your recollection. Should this prove troublesome you must take the blame as having exposed yourself to my esteem by letting me become acquainted with your merit. Our transactions on this side the water must now have become uninteresting to the rest of [the] world. We are busy however among ourselves endeavoring to get our new governments into regular and concerted motion. For this purpose I beleive we shall find some additions requisite to our Confederation. As yet every thing has gone smoothly since the war. We are diverted with the European accts. of the anarchy & opposition to government in America. Nothing can be more untrue than these relations. There was indeed some disatisfaction in the army at not being paid off before they were disbanded, and a very trifling mutiny of 200 souldiers in Philadelphia. On the latter occasion, Congress left that place disgusted with the pusillanimity of the government and not from any want of security to their own persons. The indignation which the other states felt at this insult to their delegates has enlisted them more warmly in support of Congress & the people, the legislature & the Exec. themselves of Pennsylvania have made the most satisfactory atonements. Some people also of warm blood undertook to resolve as committees for proscribing the refugees. But they were few, scattered here & there through the several states, were absolutely unnoticed by those both in & out of power, and never expressed an idea of not ac- JANUARY 16, 1784  quiescing ultimately under the decisions of their governments. The greatest difficulty we find is to get money from them. The reason is not founded in their unwillingness, but in their real inability. You were a witness to the total destruction of our commerce, devastation of our country, and absence of the precious metals. It cannot be expected that these should flow in but through the channels of commerce, or that these channels can be opened in the first instant of peace. Time is requisite to avail ourselves of the productions of the earth, and the first of these will be applied to renew our stock of those necessaries of which we had been totally exhausted. But enough of America, it's politics & poverty. Science I suppose is going on with you rapidly as usual. I am in daily hopes of seeing something from your pen which may portray us to ourselves. Aware of the bias of self love & prejudice in myself and that your pictures will be faithful I am determined to annihilate my own opinions and give full credit to yours. I must caution you to distrust information from my answers to Monsr. de Marbois' queries.(2) I have lately had a little leisure to revise them. I found some things should be omitted, many corrected, and more supplied & enlarged. They are swelled nearly to treble bulk. Being now too much for MS. copies, I think the ensuing spring to print a dozen or 20 copies to be given to my friends, not suffering another to go out.

Being to return in half an hour I could only, after perusal of my letters, hastily inclose to your excellency a copy of the proclamation announcing the ratification of the peace, which we were enabled to expedite on the 14th inst. that being the first day on which nine states have attended during the present Congress. This irregularity in the post will account for your having received no letter from Mr. Hardy, the corresponding member for the month. An indisposition at present puts it out of his power to write, in which case, according to our arrangement, the duty devolves on the next member in the nomination. The right of individual correspondence however still remaining to us I take the liberty of communicating the occurrences of the time.(2) The important subjects now before Congress are 1. authorizing our Foreign ministers to enter into treaties of alliance and commerce with the several nations who have desired it. 2. arranging the Domestic administration.  3. establishing Arsenals within the states, and posts on our Frontier. 4. Disposing of the Western territory.  JANUARY 17, 1784  5. treaties of peace and purchase with the Indians.  6. Money. Your Excellency will perceive that these are questions of such difficulty as must produce differences of opinion, and of such importance as forbid a sacrifice of judgment to one another. We have but nine states present, seven of which are represented by only two members each. There are 14 gentlemen then, any one of which differing from the rest, stops our proceeding, for all these questions require the concurrence of nine states. We shall proceed in a day or two to take them up, and it is my expectation that after having tried several of them successively and finding it impossible to obtain a single determination, Congress will find it necessary to adjourn till the spring, first informing the states that they adjourn because from the inattendance of members their business cannot be done, recommending to them to instruct and enable their members to come on at the day appointed, and that they constantly keep three at the least with Congress while it shall be setting. I beleive if we had thirteen states present represented by three members each we could clear off our business in two or three months, and that hereafter a session of two or three months in the year would suffice.

Western territory. Indian affairs. Money. None of these subjects can be transacted but with the concurrence of 9 states. Of the 9 now present 7 are represented by two members each. There are 14 gentlemen then, any one of whom differing from the rest, can stop any vote. The questions are important & difficult, and such as the best & wisest men would divide on. I am satisfied therefore that we cannot get 9 states to concur in a single one of the above subjects. We shall begin tomorrow to bring them on. A few experiments will I expect evince the truth of my conjecture, and the necessity of our adjourning till the spring, informing the states that we adjourn because their business cannot be done in so thin a house, & urging them to instruct and to enable their delegates to come punctually to the day of adjournment, and never to be represented by less than three members. The true reason that the delegates do not attend is that their states do not furnish them with money, and if they advance them some to get them here they are then left in the lurch and obliged either to make mean shifts or to go home. Spirited members prefer the latter and thus we are kept with a house incompetent to business. I think if we had a full house, that is, 13 states with three members from each so that no votes might be lost by division we might clear our docket in two or three months, and that an annual session of two months will hereafter suffice. A committee of the states must be left to transact ordinary business. The Russian manifesto is come to hand. It is as flimsy & barefaced as that of the Turk is nervous, substantial & masterly. This is an extract from the latter. \""What Northern power has the Porte offended? Whose territories have the Ottoman troops invaded? In the country of what prince is the Turkish standard displayed? Content with the boundaries of empire assigned by god & his prophet the wishes of the Porte are for peace, but if the court of Russia be determined in her claims, and will not recede without an acquisition of territory which does not belong to her, appealing to the world for the justice of the proceeding, the sublime Porte must prepare for war, relying on the decrees of heaven, and confident of the interposition of the prophet of prophets who will protect his faithful followers in the hour of every diffculty.\""(1) I fear France will be drawn into this war; hope Prussia will, and think Great Br. will reserve herself for Ireland and perhaps for us. A wanton insult lately, which I do not think myself at liberty to particu  larize, has discovered a sulleness, a rancour and a mysterious reserve which is fitted to generate new troubles.(2) A new war on us while France is otherwise engaged would be a calamity of unknown extent. Tho' we possess resources to a certain degree, experience shews that they are utterly inaccessible to any existing power, and we cannot avail ourselves of the prompt resource of paper money with which we began the last war. I wish you a great deal of happiness and am with sincere esteem Dr. Sir, Your friend & servt, Th. Jefferson P.S. Where should I direct your letters to be left?  Reprinted from Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:470-72.  1 This extract of the Turkish response to the Russian ultimatum had appeared in the January 14 issue of Francis Bailey's Freeman's Journal (Philadelphia).  2 For speculation that the \""wanton insult\"" was a recent British encroachment on the Massachusetts-Nova Scotia frontier, see Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:472n, 511-12.

  Dear Sir, Annapolis 19 Jany. 1784. I have received your two letters of 20 & 21 Decr. last (1) by Mr. Carlton who tarried in this City only one day & went on to the Southward to visit some friends from whence he proposed to return in a few days. As there were only seven States represented when he was here I advised him to defer bringing on his business till his return when I expected there might be 9 States assembled. You may depend on my best endeavours to serve him as far as is in my power. I am exceedingly glad to find that, in the expenditure of so many millions as passed through his hands, his accounts so nearly close. I cannot entertain a doubt but that Congress will make him an allowance for extra services considering his responsibility & the risques he must have run for which the Salary of 900 dollars a year is by no means an adequate Compensation. But when there will be states enough represented to do this I cannot now conjecture. At present there are only eight in town.(2) Considering what a deep share I have taken in this controversy and how anxious I have ever been not only for the success of our cause but for the honor and dignity of the United States you will readily conceive that a recollection of the events which have taken place these six months past must give me the most pungent pain. During the Contest I have been witness to scenes which gave me extreme uneasiness and distress, but I had this consolation that we had an object which engaged the attention of foreign nations, an army and a general struggling with difficulties and in spite of cold, hunger and nakedness bearing up against & checking a powerful invading foe, & sometimes gaining important advantages. But now that the war is closed with honor and success the Eyes of all Europe are turned upon that council which it was supposed directed the measures of this Continent in high expectation of seeing traits of wisdom, dignity and prudence, and what a scene they have exhibited? Oh that it could be obliterated  JANUARY 19, 1784  from the annals of America & utterly effaced from my memory! You will judge of the feelings of some of the members by an expression which Mr Read used in a late Speech, while C____, said he, are vagabondizing from one paultry village to another it is impossible for gentlemen to have to recourse to books or to consult writers on the laws of nations. I enclose you a half sheet of the journal from this first Monday in November, and if the printer can get another half sheet ready before the post arrives I will add it. These which I imagine will comprehend the whole transactions to this time will give you some idea of the business transacted. You will then see that the indian treaty, the peace establishment, the western country, and in short every thing that concerns the honor, dignity, peace, happiness, prosperity and safety of the US remain & are like to remain in the state you left them. The definitive treaty indeed is ratified. A Representation of Nine states was with great difficulty got together on the 14 which continued for three days; and as the members were extremely uneasy on account of the time elapsed and the danger of the ratification not getting across the Ocean to be exchanged within the time limited, they immediately embraced that opportunity, ratified the treaty and dispatched the ratification by two couriers. The first (col Harmar) set off from this on the 15 to take passage in the packet from New York and the other lieut col Franks set out on the 17 to go in the first vessel that sails from any of the eastern ports. This and accepting the resignation of the General is almost the only business done.  I am sorry you have thought it necessary to resign.(3) I heartily wish you had been with us. I think you might have been of great service. Several are beginning to see the impropriety & ill consequences of their past Conduct and I am persuaded you might have been instrumental in bringing them again to right. A great majority are convinced that this is not a proper place for the residence of C____ and I have some reason to think that several are ashamed of their two fOEderal towns. I except however the father of the project4 who is of so peculiar a cast of mind that his pleasure seems proportioned to the absurdity of his schemes & who is only mortified when reason & common sense prevail. But a truce with politics. Mrs. T is obliged for your remembrance of her & returns her compliments to you & Mrs. Peters, to whom you will please to make my compliments acceptable. I am with much esteem & respect, Dr Sir, Your affectionate, Cha Thomson  ""

  Sir Annapolis 20th Jany. 1784 I Sincerely congratulate you upon the return of Peace, whereby the rights we have long contended for are fully established on very honorable and beneficial terms.  The definitive Treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States was ratified in Congress last week, and the ratification forwarded to New York to go by a French Packet which was to sail this day. It was unanimously ratified by Nine States, no more being represented, a Proclamation & recommendations pursuant thereto have been agreed to, and ordered to be forwarded to the Several States by the Secretary. There are but 8 States now represented, one of the Members from Delaware went home last Saturday, on account of Sickness in his family.(1) There are Several important matters to be transacted, interesting to all the States. I hope that members will come on from Georgia as soon as possible. The impost on foreign goods recommended by Congress for raising a revenue for payment of the interest of the monies borrowed on the Credit of the United States, is fully complied with by the States of Massachusets, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. New Hampshire has likewise Agreed to it in a Committee of the whole but the act was not compleated when the Delegate from that State came away. The Assemblys of Connecticut, and New York are now sitting. Congress are in hopes to adjourn by the first of May, and have a recess 'till next fall, in case all the States transmit their acts for enabling Congress to levy and collect the Duties seasonably for them to make an ordinance for carrying it into effect, that being a matter of the utmost importance for Supporting the National Credit of the united States, and doing justice to the public Creditors both at home and in Europe; and I apprehend it  JANUARY 20, 1784  will be impracticable to raise a Sufficient revenue in the ordinary way of taxing. Raising money by imposts, takes it at the fountain head, and the consumer pays it insensibly and without murmering. I wish the result of your State on that requis[it]ion may be transmitted as soon as possible. The disposition and Settlement of the western territory is another object that will come under the consideration of Congress. The State of Virginia has Ceded to the United States all the Lands claimed by that State North-West of the Ohio on terms acceptable to Congress.  Enclosed is a Copy of the act of Massachusetts for enabling Congress to levy an impost which I think is well Guarded.2 I have also enclosed a Letter from Governor Trumbull on public Service.

It appears to your Committee that the controversy between the states of Pennsylvania & Connecticut for the territory on the Western side of Delaware river alledged to be within both their boundaries was originated in Congress so early as the 5th day of Octob. 1775, and was frequently & much agitated therein from that time to the 3d day of Nov. 1781. that the state of Pennsylvania did then petition Congress that the same might be determined according to the 9th Art. of the Confederation. that Congress did on the 14th day of the same month direct a notification to the state of Connecticut of the petition from Pennsylvania, and assign a day for proceeding thereon. that the same was regularly proceeded on according to the 9th Art. of the Confederation, and that the judges met at Trenton on the 12th day of Nov. 1782 to hear and determine the same.  that a fair, full, & patient hearing of the parties by their agents, was given, and mature consideration had by the said court from the said 12th day of Nov. day by day without intermission till the 30th day of Dec. when final sentence was pronounced: that this sentence was with the unanimous concurrence of the said judges.  JANUARY 21, 1784  that no improper biass or conduct in the judges or any of them is suggested or supposed.  that the said 9th Article of the Confederation declares that the sentence of such a court shall be final & conclusive. Resolved therefore that the said sentence ought not to be revised.

  Sir. Annapolis 24th Janury. 1784  I have the Honr. to enclose the Copy of a resolution reported by a Committee on the Memorial from the State of New Hampshire respecting the Brigantine Lusanna.  This report I called for on Wednesday last, that being the first time a sufficient number of States had been present to form an House after Genl. Sullivan left this City; on the report being taken up, a Motion was made the Copy of which I also enclose. That motion being rejected I called the Yeas & Nays on the resolution; when a motion was made and carried to adjourn:1 this was done with a view to git rid of the question. Indeed I had no expectation that the resolution would then have passed, had the question been taken, but was determined to have bro't on the question at a future time, by a new Motion. There does not appear any probability that the resolution will pass till more States are present which I hope on this, as well as many other accounts will soon be the case. Mr Blanchard has wrot me an account of his appointment to be my Colleague. I sincerely wish he may arrive in time to give the Vote of the State in this matter. My Situation is at present very disagreeable. I had disposed of both my Horses before my leaving Princeton, and as Congress did not seem to be fixed in that Station, I neglected to procure necessary Articles of Cloathing for the Winter, in order that my baggage might be more easily convey'd to whatever place might be agreed on for a temporary residence. In my journey here I have found traviling very expensive, & since my arrival board much dearer than either at Princeton or Philadelphia. The circumstance of being obliged to borrow Cash without any certainty when it will be in my power to repay it, and from persons who will soon want it for their own expenses; and of being unable to purchase necessary articles of Cloathing to be decent & comfortable is very humiliating. I flatter myself, however, that I shall soon be relieved from these inconveniences by Mr. Blanchards arrival. I cannot forbear expressing my apprehensions, of the ill consequences which may happen to the interests of the State I have the Honr. to represent, by suffering itself to be without any Vote in  JANUARY 24, 1784  Congress, had New Hampshire been present, I have not the least doubt that the enclosed resolution would before this day have passed.

  Sir [February 1, 1784] (1) A grand Committee of Congress is now engaged in preparing estimates of the necessary federal expences of the present year (2) from the first to the last day of it, inclusive and of the articles of interest on the public debts foreign & domestic which call indispensably for intermediate provision while the impost proposed ultimately for their discharge shall be on it's passage through the states; these estimates are to lead to a new requisition of money from the states, but the committee have hopes that this new requisition may be lessened if not altogether dispensed with provided a full compliance can be obtained with the former requisitions of Nov. 2, 1781, for 8 millions of dollars & of Octob. 16, 1782, for 2 millions of dollars.(3) They suppose that the requisition of 8 millions was greater than all the objects of it did in event require. They suppose further that some of these objects have been transferred to other funds. Of course there will be a surplus remaining after all the demands paid & paiable out of this fund. In like manner the 2 millions having been part of 6 millns. estimated on a war establishment and peace taking place immediately after, they expect a surplus may remain on this also after all paiments made & to be made out of it. These surpluses which will be reached by no former appropriation & which are therefore fairly open to be newly appropriated they ask of you to estimate according to the best of your information that they may see how far an enforcement of them will go towards supplying the demands of the current year: but that they may know how to call on the several states to pay up their deficiencies, it will be necessary also for you to inform them what proportion of these requisitions had been paid up by each state to the 1st day of Jan. 1784.  Another object claimed the attention of the Committee. By a vote of Sep. 4, 1782, 1,200,000 Dollars were required from the states for the special purpose of paying interest, with a permission to them to pay first out of their quotas the interest on loan office certificates and other liquidated debts, loaned or contracted in their own states, so that the balance only was to be remitted to the Continental Treasury.(4) Have any such balances been remitted, or have you any information how far the several states have proceeded to comply with this requisition by paimt. of interest within their own state?  FEBRUARY 1, 1784  A former committee had been appointed to revise the civil list and to adapt it to the change of circumstances which peace has induced.(5) They have gone through that work except so far as it relates to the department of Finance, by which I mean to include the establishments in the several offices of the Superintendt, Comptroller, Auditors, Register, Treasurer, & the Commissioners for settling the accounts in the several states, and the accts of the Staff departments. They hope from your letter in answer to one written you by Dr Williamson their chairman that you are turning your attention to this subject and that you will be so kind as to inform them whether any of the offices or officers in that department may be dispensed with under present circumstances so as to lessen it's expences without endangering more substantial loss, a true and laudable OEconomy being their object. I take the liberty of mentioning this subject to you only because the Grand Committee under whose instructions I write, will of course be delayed in their estimates till the other committee shall have made a full report on the civil list.  With you I know it is unnecessary to urge as early an answer as is practicable and have therefore only to add assurances of the sincere respect & esteem with which I have the honor to be &c. ""

I make this early application; because it is not probable that there will be more than one session before I shall leave Congress, and that I presume will be some time this month.  Before I left Princeton I had expended the money I had received from the treasurer as well as other money I had taken with me, and was obliged to borrow to discharge my board. At Philadelphia I purchased some cloathing; this, the repayment of what I had borrowed, my expenses for board there, on the road to this place and since I have been here, have consumed so large a part of the last grant that without a further supply it will be impracticable for me to discharge the debts I shall have contracted before my return.  Sensible of the difficulty with which money is collected and of the numerous demands on the treasury I have reduced my expenditures to as small a compass as possible in order to lessen the occasion for calling upon the State. Before I left Princeton I sent home one of my horses; when I got to Philadelphia I sent of[f] the other (if I could have sold them there would have been less necessity for this application) and I would have dismissed my waiter also had it been possible for Mr. Howell and myself to pass the winter with any degree of conveniency, not to mention decency, without a servant. The board and wages of my waiter has made and will make my expenses greater than those of my colleague. Notwithstanding every retrenchment, such is and hath been my expense that I am compelled to sacrifice decency to my finances.  How degrading, how humiliating it must be to a gentleman not to be able to return the invitations he receives I leave to the feelings of my constituents. I could wish that a stile of living more simple, and more conformable to republican principles universally prevailed; but  FEBRUARY 1, 1784  luxury seems to increase, and it is to be lamented that the character and influence of a State, as well as of its delegates depend very much upon the mode in which the latter live.  I should not have been so particular; but there are men of generous dispositions who, from their plain stile of living, and from their not having been abroad in a public character, cannot easily conceive how a delegate can, without profusion expend fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars a year.  For want of nine States we have not been able to transact business of importance. After having wrote many pressing letters, and sent off two expresses, nine States were at length collected, and the definitive treaty ratified. As soon as this was done one of the Delaware members left Congress; and there have been only eight States represented since his departure. Georgia has not had a delegate on the floor for a twelve month. New-Hampshire has had but one ever since I have attended, New York is not at present repre[sented] and New-Jersey has but one member. We hope to have a representation from these States in the course of a month or six weeks and then we promise ourselves that business will proceed with so much celerity, as to admit of a recess or adjournment some time in May. In the mean time matters are ripening, as far as they can be matured, for the decision of nine States.  The business that hath been completed since our last joint letter (1) hath not furnished materials enough for another. Mr. Howell who hath an excellent talent at collecting intelligence, who is very attentive to every thing that passes, and whose more peculiar province it is to transmit information to the northern part of the State, has sent on from time to time every material advice from our Ministers abroad, and respecting congressional transactions. The act of Virginia acceding to the resolution of Congress, touching their western cession has not yet come to hand. (2) That State and the State of Maryland have passed acts empowering Congress to prohibit the importation of British goods in British bottoms &c &c. A copy of the Act of Virginia, & an extract from that of Maryland I send inclosed.(3) Heavy imposts, to be appropriated to the use of the States where collected, I think would be the best way to effect a reversion of the obnoxious order of the Brit. King in council. As for giving to Congress powers to regulate trade I should not be disposed to consent to it. Congress have lately received a letter from Mr. Adams dated London Novr. 13th, l783.(4) The substance whereof is as follows, the great business of the ministry is \""to keep their places.\"" They drove out Shelburn, condemned his peace which the Whig part of them would have been very glad to have made, they now pretend to cherish the principles of the navigation act, and the King has been advised to recommend this in his speech, and the Lords have echoed it in very strong   terms. The coalition appears to stand on very strong grounds, the Lords and great commoners who compose it count a great majority of members of the house of commons. They are endeavouring to engage the Bedford interest with them; to persuade Thurloe to be again chancellor, and Mr. Pitt is tempted with the place of Chancellor of the exchequer; which Ld. John Cavendish wishes to resign. Ireland is still in a State of fermentation, throwing of[f] the Admiralty, Post-Office and every other relick of British Parliamentary authority, and contending for a free Importation of their woolen manufacturers into Portugal, for the trade to the E. Indias, to the U. States, and all the rest of the world.  This rivalry of the Irish is terrible to the ministry. The E Indias exhibit another scene which will be terrible to the ministers. Here center the hopes of England.  No system can be formed which will give universal satisfaction. Some require the government to take that whole country into their own hands, others demand aid in cash and troops to the company. Opposition will probably be first formed upon Indian affairs. An enormous loan is the most popular thing a Statesman can undertake; so certain is the bankruptcy of this country. Opposition will declame upon this topic, but will make no impression. The United States will be another object of debate. If an opposition should be formed and concerted I presume one fundamental of it will be a liberal conduct towards us. They will be advocates for some freedom of communication with the West Indias, and for our having an equitable share of the carrying trade. Administration on the other hand will with great difficulty be perswaded to abandon the mean contemptible policy which their proclamations exhibit.  The public creditors in the city and neighbourhood of Philadelphia lately presented a memorial to Congress setting forth that the Genl. Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania did on the 2lst of March last pass an act authorizing and directing the treasurer thereof to make and issue notes and deliver the same to Thomas Smith Esqr. Contl. loan-officer to enable him to pay one years interest on loan office certificates &c &c, That the Loan-officer refused to pay the interest on loan office certificates bearing date between the first day of Sept. 1777 and the first day of March 1778 unless they consent to a liquidation of depretiation on the Interest of this class of certificates equal to that which is established for the principal of the final redemption--upon which Congress [adopted] the following resolution:(5) Resolved that the interest which has or may come due on loan office certificates bearing date between the first day of Sept. 1777 and the first day of March 1778 is not subjected to any depretiations.  I am much obliged to your excellency for the letter with which you was pleased to favour Mr. Howell and me; and hope for the continuance of your goodness. Present my regards to your lady and your chil-  dren, and believe me to be with the highest sentiments of esteem, Your Excellency's most obedt. servant W Ellery P.S. Mr. Howell presents his respectful compliments. ""

  Dear Sir. Annapolis Feb. 1st, 1784. In a former Letter (1) I made mention of the robbery of the Mail at Princeton last fall. I now enclose copy of a Letter from the Post-master general No. 1, with resolves of Congress No. 2, on that Subject.(2) No. 3 contains certain resolves allowing the State of Virginia to keep up armed vessels & guards, for defence of their trade & to guard the public prisons & Stores.(3) The Delegates of Virginia had instructions to apply for these resolves when that State had in contemplation the collection of duties on its trade under its own authority. It is said (but their act has not been transmitted to Congress) that that State has lately adopted the Continental 5 pr Cent. Impost. In that case these resolutions will probably be useless to them, as Continental armed vessels & Continental guards must be introduced & employed to enforce whatever Ordinances Congress may, from time to time find expedient to adopt.  No. 4, contains certain resolutions of Congress on the Subject of an Indian pacification.(4) The pacific & generous views of Congress are declared towards those Indians who have, in the late war, joined the British arms & are now disposed to peace; and the district of Territory wanted for a new State is described. It is expected that large presents must be made to the Indians at the proposed Treaty. Virginia having conformed her cession to the views of Congress, as soon as the purchase, or cession shall be obtained of the Indians by fair Treaty, the title of Congress will be incontestable, & our land-office will be opened. No. 5 contains a resolve of Congress on a memorial of the public creditors in the City & Liberties of Philadelphia.(5) I hope this resolution will be satisfactory to the public creditors in our State--it is  FEBRUARY 1, 1784  only explanatory of the resolution of the 28th of June 1778. The amount of L.O. Certificates which draw real Intrest on the nominal depreciated principal is about 2½ millions dollars--must note that a Committee is appointed to devise & report means of discharging them. The State of Maryland has assumed on itself upwards of a hundred thousand pounds their currency of the L.O. debt due to its citizens, & issued to the holders State certificates, the intrest of which is to be paid annually by the State, & the principal in due time.(6) No. 6, contains measures adopted to obtain a full representation in Congress.(7) All measures, on this head, have hitherto proved ineffectual--only eight States are present. We have had nine but about a week since our adjournment to this place. What baneful planet interposes its malign influence!!! This is all the Apology I can make for not having better answered the just expectations of the people who have honored me with their confidence, & the important trust of representing them in Congress. Those who have less confidence than I have in the views of the present Congress, are less mortified on this occasion. No. 7, contains an act of the State of Maryland laying a duty on British vessels, &c.(8) Five Shillings per Ton is to be paid by all British vessels & 2 per Centum on their cargoes, in addition to duties already laid, or to be laid, on other vessels & cargoes. The act also empowers their delegates to ratify an additional article to the Confederation on the Subject of commerce.  In a late Letter from Mr. Adams he observes that the present British Ministry (which being a coalition was thought to stand on a tottering foundation) gains strength & stability:(9) and that it is to be feared that the Orders of the British King in Council restraining our carrying trade will not be soon repealed. In that case some counteraction may be wise & proper on our part. I wish this subject may receive a serious consideration. What several States have done may be seen in the public papers. It may be observed that Maryland has imposed duties on British trade to be paid into their own Treasury--And that altho' they are disposed to invest Congress with power to prohibit the Importation of Foreign goods, &c. yet they are not disposed to invest Congress with power to impose duties on such goods. The power of regulating trade, so far as such regulations are bona fide not calculated to raise a revenue therefrom, would, in my humble opinion, be less dangerous in the hands of Congress than the power of raising a revenue. No. 8, contains copy of an Act of Massachusetts investing Congress with power to levy & collect a 5 pr Cent. Impost.(10) I cannot learn that they have complied with the other parts of the System of April 18th last; and a failure in one point, according to the resolves, will frustrate the whole. I observe that they have annexed some important proviso's; And I will take the Liberty to name a few more.  1st. That the State should have credit for the monies collected within them respectively.  2dly. That all the officers employed in the collection & management of the revenue within the States should be appointed by, & accountable only to their States respectively. 3dly. That the Ordinance, under which the duties are to be collected, should be framed by Congress & laid before the respective States to be enacted & executed under their authority. Should this Subject be taken up by the Legislature of our State & find powerful advocates, it is my earnest request that the official Letters which I have heretofore written on this subject may be read, for the information of new members previous to putting the question, & considered as containing my present Sentiments & advice. This will prevent me the necessity of enlarging at present, which would only be a repetition of what is already on your Files.  Our Ministers have not been able to negotiate for a term for the payment of British debts--nor for the release of intrest. It was well argued by them that G. Britain was the aggressor in the war--and therefore in equity responsible for its consequences--That it had disabled us & ruined many--That it would be for their intrest to give a term & so prevent numberless bankrupcies among us--that by their wrong done to us it was impossible for us during the war, to make payment & of course we were not in equity bound to pay intrest, which is in the nature of dammage. Even a lawful tender was impracticable. It is held, however, that intrest ought only to be allowed on Special contracts therefor & not on accounts. As the law is opened to British Creditors by the definitive Treaty, some States, whose citizens are greatly in debt to British Merchants, are alarmed. It is said that a bill is to be brought in the next Session of the Legislature in Virginia, to suspend execution on judgments for debts contracted before 1775--as well among their own citizens, as when one party is a foreigner.  The Minister of France has lately arrived in this City. He was received with demonstrations of joy. He has sent a note to Congress informing that his Most Christian Majesty has been pleased to repeat his arret, suspending payment on navy bills for one year, so far as may respect the citizens of the United States.(11) Should you be of opinion that these enclosures are of sufficient importance, you will be pleased to lay them before the Honorable General Assembly at their next Session--And to assure them of my best wishes to promote the welfare of the State & the public good. I have the honor to be, dear Sir, with much esteeme, your most obedient hble Servt, David Howell ""

  Sir, Annapolis Feb. 1st, 1784. Your favor of Nov. 18th directed to Mr. Ellery & myself came duly to hand. I delayed answering it with a view of joining Mr. Ellery in writing an official Letter, but as he informs me that he wrote you by the last post,(1) I have thought it my duty to write without further delay. I am sensible of your attention in laying our several Letters before the Assembly--and of their goodness in making us the necessary grants of money for our expences. As our grants were made payable to the Deputy Governor, we have taken the Liberty to draw upon him in favor of Messieurs Hewes & Anthony of Philadelphia, whose friendship has relieved us & enabled us to come forward to this place. It is nearly three months since Congress left Princeton & in this time, excepting the ratification of the definitive Treaty, nothing of consequence has been done. Notwithstanding the Summer had passed without a full House, or doing much business; our hopes were sanguine that a full representation would come in this winter & enable us to dispatch the most important business & adjourn over the Summer. As yet we have been disappointed, eight States only are present--and nine have not been on the floor at once for more than about a week since our adjournment to this place, notwithstanding the most pressing applications have been made to the delinquent States. This is a Subject of no small chagrin to us, who are living at the public expence & prevented from doing the public business by an obstruction, which, on our part, is involuntary as well as invincible. No business has been omitted, to the transaction of which the States present have been competent, by the Confederation; & great industry has been used in digesting & preparing the remaining business that it may be the more readily dispatched by a full House. Whatever dissatisfaction may prevail with the people at large on account of their business not having been done; I hope their censure will be directed to its proper objects, Viz, those members of Congress who have criminally  FEBRUARY 1, 1784  absented themselves from their duty in the delinquent States--or those States, which have neglected to appoint suitable men, or suitably to reward them, to come forward & join Congress. We are momently in expectation of a fuller House. What prevents the Delegates from Delaware, N. Jersey, N. York, & N. Hampshire from coming forward we are yet to learn. Georgia was hardly expected. It is said they are occupied in disposing of & settling the lands betwixt them & the Missisippi, which, of right, belong to Congress.  It will perhaps be said that Congress ought to adjourn to next Summer; but can there be a better prospect of a full House next Summer than there was of having one this winter--or than there is even now of two or three more States coming in? And besides, there are some objects which call loudly for the immediate attention of Congress--Such as, the reduction of the civil List--Treaties of Commerce--Settlement of public accounts--Old Continental money--Requisitions for supplies of the current year--requisitions for intrest on the national debt--And I will mention one more, which has great influence on my mind--it is our Western Lands. This is an object of great magnitude, and has been attended with great embarrassments. By the last act of Virginia the affair is concluded with them. A purchase, or cession is yet to be obtained of the Indians by a Treaty--a district for a new State is to be marked out & terms of Sale & settlement, with provision for government, ascertained. Multitudes of Emigrants are passing over the mountains & planting themselves indiscriminately on the best lands. The Settlements at & about Kentucke already disregard the Government of Virginia, & are on the point of hazarding their Independence. It is the opinion of the best informed that a moment is not to be lost in taking our measures on this Subject. Our obligations to the Army & to the public creditors call for decision. A fund so important to public credit, in my opinion, claims our earliest attention & careful Improvement: moreover, Should dispersed & disorderly Settlement prevail over these lands--Should combinations with Indians, & disaffected, or corrupted white people be formed, the U. States might be involved in very serious difficulties. But after all, if the States will not send forward their Delegates, it will become the duty of Congress, & perhaps soon, to adjourn & to assign the reason thereof to the States: & to inform them, in very plain terms, that unless they will so far do their duty to the Union as to keep up a suitable representation, the business of the Confederation cannot proceed. By late Letters from the State I am informed that our State Impost is honestly paid & productive. This news gives me pleasures as it confirms my opinion of the practicability as well as safety of State Imposts. Excises & Sumptuary laws may open further reforms to the State & relieve the Landholder in any degree which the public good may require: But as I am convinced that such insensible modes of taxation   fall ultimately on the consumer & eventually oppress the poor, I do not wish to see them adopted in this country any further than real necessity may justify.  It is my opinion that the late order of Assembly directing the Loan Officer to consolidate, & to issue his notes for one years intrest of L.O. certificates issued from his office had become really necessary. I am sorry that the benefit of this measure is to be confined to such holders of sd certificates as are citizens of the State.(2) This restriction will prove injurious to foreigners, & is not agreeable to the design of the requisition. Pennsylvania first adopted this plan, &, it seems, other States have followed their example, & perhaps the business will in future be done in this line; but what means have Congress to remedy the case of foreigners, who must wait for the surplussages to be remitted from the States to the public Treasury. The Minister of France has already remonstrated to Congress on this head (3)--and did it with the better grace as he had it in his power, at the same time to assure us that his Most C. Majesty had repealed his arret suspending payment on navy bills so far as the same respected citizens of the U. States. I pray you to make known these things to the General Assembly at their next Session; & to assure them of my sincere concern for their intrests. I have the Honor to be your Excys. most obedient & most hble Servt. David Howell  ""

  Annapolis 1st Feby 1784 My Dear, my good Mrs. Stocton (1) must not impute her not having heard from Me sooner to a Want of respect for her or to a want of a proper Sense of gratitude in myself; I assure her I entertain too lively a Sense of her favours and value her friendship too highly to incur a forfeiture of them willingly. She must for a moment step into the shoes of a distressed almost distracted Lover and if she will but for a few Minutes look round her in that Character she will pardon all the Negligence, all the Seeming inattentions to other than the one Subject. Let her but add to the anxiety of the last Character the additional distressing scene of pale Sickness in the object beloved she will then readily excuse poor Read for all his seeming Ill behaviour. But to my good Friend I may Speak a little plainer. Your obliging sympathy forced me to Confess my case to you when I last Saw you and I will now tell you all. On my Coming down here I went immedi- FEBRUARY 1, 1784  ately to the House of the father of my Charmer. I was received with the most marked politeness by the family, but my girl was too ill to be seen. I found means of writing to and hearing from her that her attacht. was undiminished. She became worse, which oblig[ed] me to wait on a Lady (my Cousin) in my carriage from Annapolis to see her. I still cou'd not be bless'd with a sight. I was almost mad. With the father I conversed at a distance on the subject but as my last letters were unanswered I was desirous to have him break the subject. The Lady at last was near death. She made no Secret of her Attachment. I made a third Visit carried up Doctr. Williamson & was received with the love, the affection of a son. I know the Old Gentleman loved me but he was offended I had spoken to his Child before I paid him the Compliment of informing him of my Intention. He had made many general appologies for his opposition. I forgive him, most heartily forgive him tho' his obstinacy has cost me dear.  But to speak of a more interesting scene, I have been admitted to visit my dear Girl! God, what a Change. I was almost petrified--positively I was Speechless, and if my limbs had been as much affected as my tongue, I had better turn away. I embraced all that remains of the once blooming lovely Miss Calvert. Now alas! a pale emaciated Skelleton. She saw me and received me with that regard, true Modesty and distress that an absence of upwards of Two years wou'd naturally occasion & was tho' prepared for the interview very much overcome. Judge my dear Madam of my feelings, When I heard from her own lips that uneasiness of Mind and I the subject, had placed the finest woman on the Continent in such a state! Is this possible? Can your sex love with such truth? Pardon these questions! From my own feelings I know the violence of the Attachments & the Sincerity of the Men but I own the frequent Inconstancies of the ladies & the ease with which they put off & forget love Engagements makes me rather doubtful in the Cases of females. Every assistance is now afforded and we have hopes but the Season--a Violent Cough & a threatned Consumption fill me with apprehensions which I will not attempt to paint, I am unequal to the task! Your own fine feelings & Comprehensive genius will better conceive them! All opposition at an end, I am a little more tranquil and in ruminating on past Scenes Morven frequently rises up to my Imagination. I place me by your Social fire Side, almost take the hand of my dear Sister Polly & am ready to Speak to Mamma. Sometimes I think I hear you say, the Scrubs have forgot us Polly! The gaiety of Annapolis has turned their heads. I see your expressive look & feel reproof but I have not deserved & I will not in future deserve it. Tho' the Muse of Morven left unsung the parting of a Read, he has no right to say he was neglected! What right Can he have to Claim a first place in her esteem. Osgoods, Carrolls, McHenrys & many other Names art before   Yours Read! but most of all the gentle Hawkins is preferred, & yet the pulse of friendship beats higher & with more truly sympathetic & responsive throb in no Man's breast! But you are rough, you are Uncouth, in short Read you were almost disagreeable. Admitted, but you will I hope be permitted to admire, to praise & to wish the esteem of the Inhabitants of the peaceful Morven. Let these suffice and be Content. Time however will best shew whether there was most Sincerity in any other Name than that you bear.  Hawkins is gone! quite gone! & the amiable, the lovely L____s____n will not I fear see him soon if ever again. Mercer has been for 6 Weeks in Virginia. McHenry is in Philada & we are told Married to his beloved Miss Caldwell. Carroll is out of Congress. Osgood goes to balls & dances like any kind of thing but faugh! The beast still Chews that vile wad Tobacco. Doctr. WmSon. is with us & makes as many wry faces as ever. He is my present oracle & prescribes for my lovely Miss Calvert. The rest of Congress are new faces except Gerry who is as usual. My Colleague (2) & his Lady are at last here. His coming enabled us to ratify the Def. Treaty. Both himself & Mrs. B are in better health.

  Dear Sir. Annapolis Feby. 2d. 1784. Your Favor of 11th Jany. I had the Pleasure of Receiving this Day; I am happy to find that you was not fatigued with the long Detail I gave you of the Doings of Congress. I have no Copy thereof, & cannot say precisely how my Opinion stands therein. But I did not suppose that Room was left for the following Observation of your's; \""Perhaps you think that Influence not a baneful one, if so, you will not wish to destroy it.\"" If I have been inexplicit heretofore, I will be explicit in this; & if my Opinion does not exactly coincide with your's, it will not arise from any sinister Views in  FEBRUARY 2, 1784  me. I wish for nothing but Health, & Competence; the first the public cannot give; & the second, I had rather obtain any other honest Way, than from the public. You say, you have not the same Apprehensions from the Decisions of Congress that I express, that they appear to you to be founded in good Policy. The Reason you give is, that the alternate Removal of Congress must make it Difficult to establish the same Kind of System, the Places pitched upon being such, Numbers will be wanting tho' all should be devoted--and that it is also probable, that it will operate an important Resignation. I shall venture an Opinion partly in Opposition to this, which is that the changing of the Members of Congress, will generally speaking, tend more to destroy an undue Influence, than an alternate Removal. And let Congress have set where they might this Year, it would have been a very different Body from the last. This I find in Fact, & you may turn your Eye upon the lists of last year, & if you will find the Principal Intriguers, who from long Experience had acquired & established a systematical Adroitness at manOEuvreing, are by the Confederation ineligible this year, as the States have construed it, by omitting to chuse them. Let those Men have been placed in a Situation excluded from all the World besides themselves, they would have carried with them the same Views of Government, & the same Spirit of Intrigue, & what would prevent their exercising it, but a respectable Majority of honest & independent Men. I would not have it understood by this, that I am indifferent as to the Place where Congress shall set; for I am fully in Opinion, that either Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or any other populous City, would be an improper Place for Congress to set in, because in all such Places there are plentiful Materials for setting in Motion a thousand hidden & secret Springs, which carefully arranged & combined, will produce astonishing Effects. I only mean to suggest the Difference between Men already formed, & Men to be formed for certain Purposes. Here I agree with you, that Cities are not calculated to form the best political Dispositions. But this is not much to the Purpose now--Congress having first fix'd upon a single Place that was not a populous one, for the constant Residence of Congress. The Question then is, whether it was political & wise to fix upon another Place, in similar Situation, & agree to an alternate Residence. There are in my Mind, but two Reasons of Consequence that can be urged in Favor of it. The one is, the accommodating the several Parts of the United States, principally in Point of Travelling. The other is founded in the probable Tendency it may have, to render less energetic, an undue Influence. Multiply the Place of the Residence of Congress, & the Obstacles to Intrigue are proportionately multiplied. That this will be found true in Practice, is a mere Matter of Opinion. But that it would proportionably multiply the Difficulties & Delays in transacting the Business of the United States, is hardly Matter of Opinion. I agree that the   first Reason has weight, but it is ballanced by an invincible Objection, which is, that the Delegates, from the Eastward, cannot live so far southward as Georgetown. The Summers there will either destroy or debilitate our best Constitutions. Place Health in one Scale, & Travelling in the other, & how light will the latter appear, in Comparison with the former. I confess I do not find these Reasons simple & unconnected, of sufficient Weight in my Mind, to determine positively, that the second Resolution was founded in Wisdom. And I therefore, if I mistake not, gave to you another Reason in Vindication of my voting for it; which was, to prevent our being carried to Philadelphia. Had it not been for this Resolution, we should have unavoidably centered there. In this point of view, was it wise, or unwise? My vote discovers my Opinion, but not my Reason for it. I am not sure it will bring about the Resignation you refer to; & if it does not, we are in more Danger of being sported with, where we can have little or no Knowledge of his Transactions, as is the Case with us now, than if we were to direct his constant Attendance in the Place where Congress shall set. To this Objections are made; such as, the greater his Distance, the less will be his Influence. But that Office must certainly be where Congress may be. With Respect to this Officer, I apprehend you doubt whether our Sentiments are the same. I will tell you very freely, that I am clearly in Opinion, that in mere Money Transactions, he has saved the United States a very large sum; I am of this Sentiment, because a comparison of Expenditures, shows, that since he has been in Office, the Expenditures have not amounted annually to half so much as they did before. I am also of Opinion that much more Regularity has been introduced in Keeping the Accounts than ever existed before. This is a Matter in my Mind of very great Importance. And without the strictest Attention to it, the several states ought not to trust Congress with a single Farthing of their Money. I lay it down as a good general Maxim, that when a Person is to be attacked, it is wise not to endeavor to depreciate his real Merit; because this puts into his Hands an Advantage: if he can clearly exculpate himself in Part, it renders that which is really true, liable to suspicion, & consequently less efficacious. If you suppose that Person has rendered the public no valuable Services, I acknowledge there is a very considerable Difference in our Sentiments. If you suppose that he may have rendered valuable Services, but that his Notions of Government, of Finance & of Commerce, are incompatible with Liberty, we shall not differ. I think therefore the Fort to be rais'd against him ought to stand on this Ground. If in urging his Dismission, or rather a new Arrangement of the Office, it shall become necessary to be personal. But I hope it will be generally agreed, that if it was necessary to create an omnipotent Financier in 1781, that Necessity does not exist now. I am clearly against the Office in its present Form. And I am not sure any Form will do.   Your Sentiments with Respect to the southern States, are very candid & charitable. Charity is an amiable Virtue. And in this Case, it covers a Multitude of Sins. How far their Apprehensions of being fixed permanently at Trenton, may operate, I know not. But this I am sure of, that they do not mean to have two fOEderal Towns. And I venture to predict that there never will be two. They will endeavor to have the Resolutions of Congress so altered, as to have one permanent Place of Residence in some Part of Maryland or Virginia; & if they cannot effect this, they can another Point, which will be, to fix Congress again in Philadelphia. Here probably will be the Issue of fOEderal Towns. I cannot find the shadow of a Reason to alter my former Opinion, with Respect to their aristocratical Principles; & if they vary from these, it will be to monarchical ones. It is impossible in the Nature of Things, that their Governments should be democratic. It is also impossible, that there should be a Coincidence of political Views, in some Matters of very great Importance to the Eastern States: for those who have appeared to be honest Republicans, of which Number I have had the Misfortune to find not more than two or three, have uniformly depreciated our Exertions, & denied to us that Justice, which is clearly due. Time only can discover which had the most Reason for his Opinion. I sincerely wish the Event may be as happy & favorable, as you expect it will. The present Members of Congress wear a different Aspect from those of the last year, but we have not had a fair Opportunity to discover their political Views. You ask what we have done to forward our commercial Arrangements. I answer, we have done nothing to forward them; nor scarcely any Thing else. Since we have been at Annapolis, we have had Nine States, but about six or seven Days--at present we have no Prospect of a sufficient Representation to transact the Business, which is necessary to be done, previous to the Adjournment of Congress. There are but a few Matters that keep Congress together, & these require the Assent of Nine States. It is cruel to the last degree, in those States which neglecting to keep up their Representation, oblige us to waste our Time, & spend the Money of our Constituents, without being able to render them Services equivalent. But the Fault lies not with us.  I am perswaded that our Commerce is of the highest Importance to us as a Nation: that the closest Attention must be paid to our commercial Arrangements--and until they are placed upon the fair and liberal Footing of mutual Reciprocity--& until they are extended to all Nations, that will afford us an advantageous Market for our Exports or that will furnish us upon the best Terms with Articles for our own Consumption, our commerce will be too limited & unproductive. It is not extraordinary that there should be a Desire, & even Attempts to limit our commercial Connections. But it will be strange, if we are so blind & inattentive to our own Interest, as to suffer ourselves to be   caught in the snare. I do not recollect any Branches of Trade that are of so much Importance to our State, as the Whale & Cod fishery, & the carrying Trade. These several Branches at present do not stand upon a sure Foundation. It is true, we have a Right to take Fish by the Treaty, But that does not point out what we are to do with them. The Benifit that might result from this Part of the Treaty, depends very much upon the liberal sentiments that Great Britain shall adopt, when she enters into a commercial Treaty with us. You do not want to be informed, that many of our own Countrymen do not only, not wish, but will use their Endeavors, that no such Connection shall ever be formed. Upon these three Branches of Trade, I conceive the future Wealth & Prosperity of our State entirely depend; & also the marine Power of the united States: the last, I am not anxious about in any other View than as the Result of the former. Bounties & Duties, may be so applied, as to destroy in a great Measure our Fisheries; These, & the carrying Trade, depend upon Treaties yet to be made. And would it not be astonishing, if we should for a great while to come, loose the Advantages that might result therefrom for the Want of Nine States in Congress. On these Points southern and Eastern Republicans will think very differently.  You observe that if the Impost should be given to Congress, yet the collateral Funds will not be given--That the warmest Advocates for the Impost, voted for it, because they knew that their Arguments were not true in Fact. They knew that they then voted away other People's Money; But when the Question shall be, to vote away their own Money, they will disagree to it. That consequently Congress will not have adequate Funds. You further observe, that a great Part of the Opposition to the Impost arises from a Want of Confidence in the Person, who is at the Head of the Treasury; from a Belief, that his Plans are artfully laid to subvert the Liberties of the People. That the Opposition to other Funds necessary to defray the Interest of the public Debt, is owing to the Want of honesty; & that nothing but the imminent Danger of a much greater Evil than that of parting with their Money, will induce the People to be honest: That not a single Government in the Union has sufficient Energy to enforce the Collection of their Taxes--That this is an Evil which will in the End produce it's own Remedy. That the States are only manOEuvreing, to rid themselves of the Burthen of paying Taxes. That no System can be devised, which would be satisfactory to all. That the true System is contained in the Confederation, or rather the Principles of a proper System. That you are perswaded that were the Impost to be collected & committed to the present Administration, it would be perverted to the most dangerous Purposes, & that this Kind of Revenue renders a fair Examination into mal Pra[c]tices, impracticable. And that Congress should persevere till they have as-  certained an indisputable Rule for apportioning the Quotas, & then assign them to the several States, with clear & Just Estimates, & if then the Taxes are not collected, the Fault will not lay with Congress, but the States who may be delinquent.  If you carry your Objections against an Impost so far, as to oppose it in every Shape, I cannot agree in Sentiment with you; but I will freely acknowledge that the more I reflect upon the Plan proposed by Congress, the more I dislike it. I apprehend the Difficulties in collecting of it would be insurmountable. The Expence will be unreasonably great. A fair Examination of the Proceeds will be beyond the Reach of the public. It is uncertain what System Congress will adopt with Respect to the Treasury Department; but it is in its Nature a Department, that ought to have the most vigilant Eye exercised over it. It is at best, a very dangerous Affair to the Liberties of the People. But I cannot think there can be a well founded Objection against a State Impost, collected by Officers appointed by, & accountable only to the State--And the Proceeds to be plac'd to the Credit of the State. I am perswaded that an Impost will not be safe in any other Hands. In that Way, it would be as safe to trust Congress with Money so collected, as with that, which should be collected in any other Way. You do not seem to be against a continental Chest, but against the Person, who is at the Head of it,(1) & the System under which he acts. But is it not better to go a Step farther, & annihilate the continental Treasury--at least so far, as respects american Debts that are ascertain'd, & which must be funded. Will it not simplify the Business very much, to have the public Debt divided among the Several States after the Rule of apportioning it shall be agreed upon. This would afford every State an Opportunity to take its own Way, & Time, to discharge its Proportion thereof. It would secure us from another Danger, which we shall otherwise be perpetually exposed to; for in the Hands of the Continent, the Debt will never be discharged. It is part of a System to have a perpetual public Debt--& I conceive a standing Debt, well funded to be more dangerous than a standing Army. The first will be the Parent of the latter. In this Case, by dividing we live, by uniting we run a very great Risque of loosing all that we ought to hold dear. You complain of the present Arrangement & Management of the Treasury. It is possible that it may be better form'd & directed; but there is a very great Probability that it will not. The Eyes of the proposed Cincinnati are fix'd, & pointedly fix'd on this Department. Funds are now the Object, & when continental Funds shall be obtain'd, that Department will draw the Attention of all the Cincinnati, of all the aristocratic, of all the unprincipled & subtle Intriguers of America, & their Power will be an overmatch for the honest and independent. The Children of this World are wiser, than the Children of Light. The honest Man is only on the defensive, & he may flatter himself of security & indulge   Repose. But the dishonest Subtlety is always on the Offensive, always Alert, & a Failure only gives Birth to another Attempt. The Language already seems to be this, \""In great Attempts it's glorious even to fail.\"" I do not express these Sentiments as being only afraid, that the Event may Justify them. I believe if Funds are obtain'd, the Issue of them will be fatal to the Liberties of this Country; & that it would be unnatural to expect a more favourable Issue.  I am sensible Objections of Weight are made against the immediate Division of the public Debt--such as, that the States which have little unlocated Territory, will not encrease in Wealth, but that the States which have a great Quantity thereof, will every year grow more important, therefore delaying the Division, will give the one a less, and the other a greater Proportion of the Debt. This is a saving Consideration; but it is not a safe one--And in a Case where their future Safety, if not Existence is concerned, it ought to have not Weight.  I think we must have a public Chest, to discharge the foreign Debt, which ought to be annihilated as soon as possible. After this, very little Money will be wanted by Congress--their annual Expences will be reduced very low. The Sum will be so triffling that no great Danger can arise from a Misapplication.  I think it was a great Oversight in the Confederation, that of establishing a Continental Treasury. And I expect our Liberties will receive the first, & probably the last, Wound, thro' this dangerous Machine. But as you observe, there is no Probability that it will receive much from the States very soon; There being no Probability that the Recommendations of Congress will be complied with seasonably (I seriously believe they never will) to discharge the annual Interest: Congress have appointed a grand Committee to bring in an Estimate of the Interest due for one Year, & propose making a Requisition upon the States for the Amount. Congress must do this from year to year, because they will have no other Mode to discharge it; therefore the Business will go on, in the Way you wish it should. It is true the Rule of apportionment is not ascertained; probably the one adopted last Spring will be adhered to by Congress.  The Head Officer of the Treasury has informed Congress this Week by Letter that he shall leave his Office in May next.(2) This will remove some of your Difficulties. But I must own it will not remove all mine. The Treasury, the Cincinnati, & other public Creditors, with all their Concomitants, are some how or other, in my Mind, inseparably connected. We have now three or four of the Cincinnati, Members of Congress on the Floor, they are not honorary, but real Members of that Institution. A Short Time will undoubtedly enlarge the Number in Congress. I have heard some of the Officers say, \""Fulfill your Promises, pay us honestly & the Cincinnati will be a harmless Body.\"" This seems to me to have a plain Meaning. If the Intention of this In-  stitution is, to connect throughout the Continent a large & important Body of Men to watch over the Doings of Congress, or of the State Legislatures, if there is a real Necessity for this, let the last be dissolved, & let the first take the Helmn. I cannot admit the Idea, that the Army will not be honorably paid. I hope it will be a free Act of the People. But if a Society is establish'd to extort it from them, it is at least casting a very gloomy Shade over the Virtue of the People. I cannot omit here comparing your Sentiments, with those of the Cincinnati; there seems to be a perfect Coincidence--they appear to be doubtful of public Faith; you say, \""the People will not pay their Taxes. they must see & feel, that this, which they consider as a great Evil, must be submitted to, in Order to avert another, which they Esteem a much greater.\"" I do not wish to suggest that the Cincinnati will become this \""greater Evil.\"" But the Thing is not impossible. And upon your Principles the Measure seems to be Justifiable. It is certainly Right to provide a Remedy against a certain Evil. Permit me to introduce a new Subject for your Consideration. I am apprehensive that the Plan for settling the Accounts of the several States with the Continent, will not answer the Purpose. I will therefore suggest the following; That the Debts actually contracted since the Commencement of the late war, & now due from the several States, in their separate Capacity, shall be made a continental Charge. I will not undertake to prove that the Proposition is equitable, But if no other Mode can be adopted, if the Plan which is now carrying into Execution, is attended with insurmountable Difficulties, we must submit to it, as the least of Evils.  Commissioners are appointed for the several States, finally to settle & adjust their Accounts with the Continent. They are to govern themselves by the Resolutions of Congress, which, from the Nature of the Business, can never be otherwise than inexplicit. The States have all of them undoubtedly expended large Sums of Money, which they did with a View of promoting the common Cause, without any special Resolution of Congress to cover the same; yet relying on the Justice of that Body, they confidently expect to be credited therefor; and if they should be disappointed in a Matter so tender, which will certainly be the Case in many Instances, it will deeply wound the Authority of Congress. The Orders to the Commissioners must be general, or particular. If general & discretionary, a State may be subjected to the Will & Pleasure of a Commissioner, which will never be the Case. And if particular, proper Vouchers, with explicit Resolutions of Congress, must be the Evidence of the Validity of all Charges. That all the States have kept their Accounts very irregularly, & that in numberless Instances, Vouchers necessary to support Charges, will be wanting, is not to be doubted. If a Remedy is not given in such Cases, Injustice will be done; if it is afforded, every particular Case   must be bro't before Congress, or the Commissioner, or a discretionary Power lodged somewhere, must be the Mode; I apprehend the first to be impracticable; & the other at least very objectionable. It is a very doubtful Matter, whether the Commissioners will be able in many years to close the Accounts--there is no great Reason why they should be in a hurry about it. If every Account is to be fairly transcribed, the Work in Detail must be immensely voluminous. The mere Expence of having the Accounts adjusted may be almost as great an Evil, as to let them remain unliquidated.  With Respect to the Proposition; It must be supposed that the Legislatures of the several States have exercised a proper Degree of Caution in contracting Debts. No good Reason can be given why they should involve themselves unnecessarily. Will it not naturally excite much Animosity, & ill Will, for Congress to call in Question their Wisdom & Prudence, more especially, for what they did after the Commencement of the War, until the Confederation was ratified. The Contest during that Period, depended in a great Measure upon their Patriotism & Exertions. That they may have erred in Judgment, that they may have conducted without Regularity & System, is not extraordinary. It is fortunate that all Matters have terminated successfully; & due Credit is to be given them for it. Will not the Policy be extremely narrow & contracted, if Congress should erect themselves into a Tribunal, to sit in Judgment upon the several Legislatures, who, if they submit, will not do it in the most cordial Manner. It is not difficult to form an Estimate of the Difference of the two Ways, with Respect to Harmony & Satisfaction. But as it may respect the Interest of the States, it must be mere Matter of Opinion. It may be observed, that during the Period of Time referr'd to, the Expenditures of the several States must have been principally, for public Purposes, save those for the Support of civil Government, which is not a Matter of much Consequence; The civil List of the several States, from what I can collect, is not very different as to the whole Amount. If it is agreed that the remaining Part of the States Debts was contracted for supporting the general Cause, the Enquiry will be, whether they have assess'd & collected from their Citizens, Sums of Money in Proportion to their Abilities as States; and if not, how this Inequality will operate. Suppose two States of equal Abilities, the one had collected an hundred Pounds from its Citizens, the other had contracted a Debt to the same Amount, it is plain that the Proposition would make a Difference of an hundred Pounds. But it is impossible that the Reality should operate so great an Inequality; because there is no State but what has collected considerable Sums of Money from its Citizens. There is one State in the Union, which is said to be in Debt twelve Millions of Dollars Specie; & that a great Part of this Debt arose from the Issuing of what were called Specie Certificates, which in the first In-  stance were pass'd at about Eighty pr. Cent. Discount compared with Specie. The Delegates of the State give the first as a Fact; but they do not agree to the last. The united States can never again be in Circumstances similar to those, previous to the Ratification of the Confederation. They now hope to be a happy, peaceable, & respectable Nation to the latest Ages. That this may really be the Case, much Liberality of Sentiment must be exercised among those that are truly Republican. Let us contrast the possible Inequality that might take Place from giving full Credit to the Wisdom & Prudence of the several sovereign Legislatures, for five or six Years only, with the unavoidable Discord that must ensue, if it is not done; & let a deliberate Opinion be formed thereupon; & will it not be in Favor of submitting to that possible Inequality, which in all Probability can never again exist under the regular Systems of Government that are now established. If the United States should ever be engaged in a War again, their past Experience will probably teach them to adopt in many Instances, very different Systems.  But in the present Situation of Affairs, considering that there are six States in the Union, whose private Debts are a mere triffle compared with some others, considering that nine States will be necessary to pass to the Credit of any State, a Charge not expressly authorized by the Resolution of Congress, that the Towns damaged & destroyed, Negroes carried off, Tobacco plundered & burnt, The Places laid Waste & in Possession of the Enemy. These & numberless other Charges, will be made, in Case we go on to liquidate upon the present Plan, considering these Things, does it seem probable that those six States will ever consent to any Thing more than what is expressly authorized already by the Resolutions of Congress. In Case the Proposition should be agreed to, what are to be done with the Securities? Are Funds to be given to Congress to discharge them? This would be neither necessary, nor admissable. The Amount of the States Debts, with that of the united States, might be divided among the respective States. When the Quotas shall be ascertain'd, the Amount of the State Debt, deducted (if less) from the Quota, will leave the Ballance which ought to be paid into the continental Chest.  I am strongly induced to believe that this Plan would tend to prevent much Discord & Animosity. It is not probable that it would operate equal Justice, neither do I suppose the present will; What a Field will be opened, if the Ravages occasioned by the Enemy are to be liquidated; yet this is set on Foot by the Superintendant of Finance; probably to Ballance the Claims of some States; & will it not have this Effect?  The Proposition, if agreed to, would very speedily ease the united States of nearly forty thousand Dollars pr. Annum, which they now pay to Commissioners & their Clerks for settling the Accounts of the sev-  eral States with the Continent, & which they must continue to pay many years to come upon the present Mode of doing the Business.  Several things would be necessary to be done, upon the new Plan; such as the adjusting of the Requisitions of Congress so far as they have actually been discharged by the States; the Calling in of the old paper Money--& the Making of a proper Allowance to the States, which have had Men in the Field over & above their Proportion, compared with other States. This is a Matter of exceeding great Importance, I do not pretend to give the above Sentiments as my decided Opinion; Whether the Accounts will ever be bro't to a close in this, or any other Way, is a Matter in my Mind very uncertain.  You will pardon me for being so very prolix as it is the last Letter I ever expect to write you in an official Capacity or rather as a Member of Congress writing to his Friend. I am, very sincerely yours, S. Osgood N.B. My Information respecting the Purport of the Financier's Letter was wrong. I did not hear it read, but upon particular Enquiry find he only Suggests an Intention of leaving his Office, the Time when is not mentioned. ""

  Sir, Secretary's Office Feby. 2d. 1784 I have received the letter which you did me the honor to write on the 29th Jany.(1) I am sensible that the want of a Secy. for foreign Affairs must have deranged the regular communication heretofore kept up between Congress and your Excellency, and the more especially as the expectation of speedily filling that Office prevented Congress from taking measures to supply his place. The letters and papers received from you since the resignation of Mr. Livingston are under the dates of the 10th June, -- Sepr., 17 do, & 2 Novr.(2) The first covered a memorial from Mr. Holker which was immediately referred to a Comee. who being called upon to report have informed Congress that at the request of Mr. Holker the business is postponed. The second was a memoire announcing the appointment of the Chevr. D'Annemours to be Consul Genl. of France in the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth  FEBRUARY 2, 1784  of Virginia and the States of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, and enclosing his commission. This memoire was laid before Congress on the 12th Sept. and on the 13th the commission was ordered to be registered and an exequatur to be issued, which was done immediately in due form and the commission returned.(3) The note of the 17th Sept. contained sundry matters of importance, to part of which an answer was returned on the 24th October (4) the receipt of which you acknowledge in your letter of the 2d November. The same note covered a copy of the Contract of the 25th February 1783 between his Most Christian Majesty and the Ud. States which had been received before through the Office of Finance and the ratification of which was delayed for want of nine States. But on the 31st October, the moment nine States assembled, Congress immediately embraced that opportunity to ratify the Contract and dispatched it to their Minister at the Court of Versailles in order to be exchanged. (5) That this has not been communicated to you is only to be attributed to the cause abovementioned. I now do myself the honor of enclosing a copy of the Contract as ratified. With regard to the payment of the interest of the sums which his Most Christian Majesty has been pleased to lend to the United States or for which he has made himself guarantee, nothing further has yet been done than what is contained in the resolutions of the 18th of April 1783--for the general discharge of the interest and principal of the whole debt contracted during the war, & to which Congress have not yet received answers from all the States. However a grand Comee. consisting of a member from each state are now sitting who have that among other matters in charge.

  Sir Annapolis 3d. Febry 1784. It is disagreable to me to inform your Honr. that no determination hath yet been taken on the Memorial from the State concerning the Brigantine Lusanna.(1) On the twenty ninth Ulmo. I again called for the Report of the Committee on that subject, whereupon a Motion was made and seconded to postpone it generally, I called the Yeas & Nays, and it passed in the affirmative with but one negative besides my own. FEBRUARY 4, 1784  General Sullivan has furnished me with an authenticated Copy of the proceedings of the Committee of Appeals, this I shall endeavor to make the best possible use of when ever the matter shall be again taken up, at present and until more States are represented no good purpose can as I conceive be answered by bringing it again under debate, as I have reason to think it would be either postponed or rejected. The sentiments of those few Gentlemen who oppose the resolution to me appear unaccountable, some of them at least admit that the Court had no cognisance, and at the same time object to any interference of Congress in setting aside the judgment: In these sentiments they seem immovably fixed, and on this ground have hitherto prevented any determination. It is with great impatence that I await the arrival of Mr. Blanchard, and earnestly wish he may be here soon as well on the account of this affair, and the public good, as the personal interest I have therein.

  Sir, Annapolis Feb 5th 1784. I have the honor to enclose the paper No. 1 containing Copy of a Letter, or remonstrance from the General Assembly of the State of Connecticutt to Congress.(1) It breaths the true Spirit of republicanism. I admire their Stricture on the Letter, published in the address of Congress to the States as a Letter sent to our State; but, which, I believe was in fact not sent. This Letter will however remain on the Journals of Congress as a monument of the Ingenuity & zeal of the day in which it was written. The paragraph referred to by Connecticutt I suppose to be the following in page 6th of the Address \""By the Confederation Congress have an absolute discretion in determining the quantum of revenue requisite for the national expenditure. When this is done, nothing remains for the States, separately, but the mode of raising.\"" (and the new System will take this away.) \""No State can dispute the obligation to pay the Sum demanded without a breach of the Confederation; & when the money comes into the Treasury, the appropriation is the exclusive province of the foederal government.\"" This construction, they observe, of the powers of Congress \""at one stroke vests Congress with the power of Sword & purse, & leaves nothing to the Individual States but an empty name.\"" I have long been of opinion that this is the real object in view with many, & I wish it to be brought to light. If the States give up to Congress the power of raising money from them & of disposing of that money, their particular sovereignties will, in fact, be all absorbed in one mighty Sovereignty--Against the abuses of which they will retain only the power of complaining & receiving for answer that they can have no remedy. This is precisely the present case of Connecticutt in regard to commutation. The pretensions of the particular States to Sovereignty after they have parted with the controul of their purses will be no less ridiculous than the claim of the man in the Fable to enjoy the Shadow after he had sold his Ass, alledging that altho he had parted with his Ass, he had not parted with the Shadow. Since I have touched on this very extraordinary Letter I pray your indulgence while I make two or three more remarks. Page 4 of the Letter. \""We must pledge an ascertained fund; simple & productive in its nature; general in its principle, & at the disposal of a single will.\"" & at the top of page 5--\""It has been remarked as an essential part of this plan, that the fund should depend on a single will.\"" The single will here referred to is not the will of the Superintendent of Finance, but the will of Congress. Let us examine this single will. It is either agreeable to the Will of a majority of the States, or not. If it is agreeable to the will of the States, it is as safe trusting to thirteen wills in the  FEBRUARY 5, 1784  States as to one will in Congress which is agreeable thereto; but if this single will is not agreeable to the will of the States it is no longer a good will, or it is no longer the proper representation of the States & of course should not prevail; therefore in the former case it would be useless to have the funds depend on this single will & in the latter case it would be wrong. It would also be unwise for thirteen Sovereign States to bind themselves to do by their deputies something, which by Hypothesis, they would be unwilling to do themselves. It may be further observed that in democracies there should be no single will above the will of the people at large: Such a Sovereign will would be complete Tyrany. At the bottom of page 6, \""The measure in question if not within the Letter, is within the Spirit of the Confederation. Congress, by that are empowered to borrow money for the Use of the United States. And, by implication, to concert the means necessary to the end.\"" This refinement in the present Instance, I apprehend, is misapplied. For the 2d Article of Confederation requires that all powers to be exercised by Congress should be expressly delegated to them. No measure, therefore, which is not founded in powers expressly delegated, can be founded in the Spirit of the Confederation, for that is its Spirit. That pure & free Spirit abhors powers by implication & oppugns all argumentative constructions. Page 4. \""The measure proposed is a measure of necessity.\"" Had the war continued & the States claiming western territory refused to cede their claims to Congress, this argument (which, if it is an argument, is a dreadful one) might have had some force. But peace has happily taken place. Agriculture & commerce are revived--common taxation is going on in all the States--State Imposts & excises are imposed & are very productive in several States. In others there are, in addition to the proceeds of confiscated Estates, large tracts of unlocated lands to be converted to their particular emolument. And, finally, an extent of excellent land of about five hundred thousand Square miles has become the incontestable property of the United States in Congress assembled. In this great resource lies a most ample fund for the Security of the public creditors. The calculation is easy. 500,000 Square miles afford 320,000,000 acres, which at 1/8 of a Dollar, or nine pence Lawful money per acre, would extinguish a debt of 40 millions of Dollars; but good judges are of opinion that it would fetch us a Dollar per acre, at least in public Securities. Where then is the necessity, let me ask in the name of every thing dear to mankind, where is this great necessity of having recourse to a measure of at least doubtful, if not dangerous, operation on the Liberties of this Country, to give greater Security to the public creditors? Where is the man, who is neither interested as a public creditor, nor an expectant of office, who can lay his hand on his breast, at this day, & say that a Continental Impost is \""a measure of necessity\""?  The plan of February 3d 1781 is now almost universally reprobated--yet how warmly was that urged & how ungenerously were its opposers censured! The day may come when those who now oppose the less dangerous plan of April 18th 1783, may receive the thanks of their Country. I have also enclosed to your Excellency in the paper No. 2, an estimate of the arrearages to the 1st day of January 1783 & of one years intrest arising on the Foreign & domestic debt.(2) A proposition has been referred to a Grand Committee with this estimate for them to report a requisition on the States for the payment of intrest on the national debt. Another proposition has been referred to the same Committee to call for estimates & to report a requisition for the expences of the current year. Congress seem resolved not to let public credit suffer while the States are deliberating on the proposals in their late Address. What the event of those recommendations will be, time will discover. I have transmitted copies of the acts of Pennsylvania & Massachusetts--these are all I have seen, altho' it is said that several other States have passed acts on the Subject. South Carolina rejected the measures last Summer; and there is no information from North Carolina, or Georgia. From what I have seen & heard as yet I entertain comfortable hope that those States which may adopt measures will embarrass their acts with such exceptions & provisos as may render their execution impracticable & take off the edge of the public resentment from those States which may reject them, in which I cannot think the State & I have the Honor to represent in Congress will be alone. Time will convince the projectors of the present day of the impracticability & folly of their innovations; & posterity will admire the wisdom, & sanction measures, of the Confederation. The States must govern themselves--maintain their separate Sovereignties--and adhere strictly to the principles of their Union & alliance with each other--& in a word, do justice--so may we expect the favor of mankind & the blessing of Heaven. With perfect Esteeme, I have the Honor to be, your Excellencys most obedient hble Servt, David Howell  ""

  Sir, Annapolis February 10, 1784. I am extremely mortified that through the delinquency of the post riders, my late letters to His Excellency the Governor, as well as to yourself will fail of arriving in the State in time to be laid before the Assembly at their February Session: And I must ingenuously confess that an apprehension that unmerited censure may fall on me for having omitted my duty is a principal Source of this chagrine which I feel, as the communications, which it has been in my power to make are not of much Importance to the State. For the last seven weeks two mails only have arrived at this place from the Southward--and in the last three weeks one only from the northward.(1) I have written from this place two Letters to his Excellency the Governor--one of which had enclosures--and two to yourself with enclosures being extracts of Letters from Europe--acts of Congress & of the States. These four Letters contain all the communications, of any consequence to the State, which it has been in my power to make: & it will appear by their dates that they were written in season to have arrived before the February Session, had there been no delinquency in the post-rider. I hope therefore when the above state of facts shall be known that I shall stand exculpated from any inattention to my duty. FEBRUARY 10, 1784  In consequence of late Letters from the State, as well as agreeably to my private opinion, I yesterday moved for a Letter to be written to the States giving them information that Congress had in contemplation a recess, or adjournment over the Summer--and that it was absolutely necessary for them immediately to send forward a representation to enable us to dispatch the public business in the mean time. The motion was approved from all parts of the House & referred to a Committee.(2) It is proposed to forward this Letter by express as conveyance by post is not to be relied on in this Season of the year. If this fails of bringing in a representation Congress must adjourn. You will readily conceive that our present Situation must be very disagreeable to men who really have the good of this Country at heart. To live at the public expence, when the public is already overwhelmed in debts and not be able to do the public business thro' the fault of others must be a painful Situation to a mind qualified for the office of a ruler of the people. I heartily wish for a full representation that we might be enabled in good earnest to put our Shoulders to the great business of the nation--nothing has been done since Congress has been in this place of consequence except the certification of the definitive Treaty. I have enclosed a copy of our Journals not so much to shew you what we have done as what we have not done. This will, however, explain to you the reasons why no more has been done. With perfect esteeme I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servt, David Howell  P.S. I have enclosed copy of the act of Maryland adopting the 5 Per Cent recommended by Congress. This I have taken from the laws of Maryland--no copy having been transmitted to Congress.(3) Read no further. D.H. As I was this day in conversation with a commutation-man on the Subject of a Continental Impost & he seemed to cast some blame on our State for not complying with the Impost--General Wadsworth who is now here as a Delegate for Connecticutt replied that \""Rhode Island had saved the Liberties of the U.S. once & perhaps they might again.\"" Mr. Blair McClenachan of Philadelphia, who was lately here on public business, did not hesitate to allow in conversation with me that it was fortunate for this Country that the recommendation of Feb. 3d 1781 did not take effect as it was not right, but he strenuously advocated the recommendation of the 18th of April 1783 as wise & good. Indeed it is generally allowed that our opposition to the other was meritorious--and I have had the pleasure of hearing many fine things said of the State, which have in a measure ballanced for the harsh things said of it last year. I will not repeat the compliments which have been paid to me personally by some perhaps sincerely, & by others, who con- FEBRUARY 12, 1784  clude by saying that they made no doubt but I should use my influence for the present measure. All the delegates from Massachusetts now here are measurably orthodox--and one of them said the other day that there was as much difference betwixt the present Congress & the last as betwixt light & darkness. The present Congress seem to me well disposed. D.H.(4) ""

  Dear Sir (1) Feby 12th 1784. It gave me much satisfaction to be informed, as I was by yours of Octr 10th which came to hand this morning, that you retain your Health--though I am sensibly affected by Mrs Ruston's repeated losses of her fine Boys. I am sure the Thought of having Sons who might be free men & Princes in a free Country must be singularly pleasing to a Lady who seems to possess so much of the true Spirit of an antient Spartan or Roman Matron. I mentioned her name to Dr Lee this morning who spoke of her with great respect and she knows he is not apt to be much attached to or to flatter Ladies, I admit that apathy and misanthropy itself could not excuse a man from bestowing Praise on such a Lady as the one referd to. Your father whom I saw on Novr last in Philada. told me that you talked of a visit to this Country. Be so good as to tell Mrs R that such a Visit would certainly cast me a Ride for I should not begrudge a Ride of some length to have the Pleasure of congratulating her on her arrival in that Country which In my Heart I think is the only country on the face of the Earth where human Nature is not degraded by some species of Servitude. How can you wonder that I did not write by my Brother? In fact he went contrary to my intreaties. I gave him no Letters nor ought but advice which was if he should do so absurd a Thing as take an oath of Obedience to that King--to see to it that he did not return at least during the War unless he wished to be treated by his nearest Relations as an Alien. Whatever I may have said about your sensations on the treaty of Peace you cannot suppose that I had serious doubts of your political Sentiments when you recollect that you was the only American in London to whom I even intimated a design of returning to  FEBRUARY 12, 1784  America, Captn Hutchins excepted who was then a Captn in the 40th Regt. and has since come over & is in our Service. I was then possessed of more secrets than his, but when a man is conscious of a fair Conduct arising from upright Intensions, I think him a small politician or a vile courter of popularity who will take the trouble of making a single declaration merely to remove the Suspicions or prevent the Tattle of idle or silly impertinents. Oft have I since that Time seen an Officer by an idle shew of his Intentions cut off a fair opportunity of defeating his Enemy. As all the vacant Lands were in the Charter Claims of one or another State Congress as such had none unless some States should relinquish. New York had relinquished and Virga has just relinquished her claim to all the Land on tother Side of the Ohio & extending from the Lakes to the Mississippi. Their act of Assembly came to hand three days ago and the Delegates on tomorrow or next day are to execute the Conveyance in behalf of the State. We shall have some Preliminaries to settle with the Indians who are many of them collected at this Inst. with the desire of treating with us. We are first to set off the Lands we owe to our Army. We shall then sell Land to sink our National Debt and I presume on the next Summer a good Part of that Country will be allotted to the Purposes mentioned. Several of the States however have large Tracts of vacant Land which they have not ceded to Congress. The Office in N. Carolina has been opened on the last Summer and much Land taken up since that Time. Part of the Debts of the State are sunk in that manner. I have taken up some Land in our Western Country in Company with two other Gentlemen, one of whom served with me in the Army, and since the Peace has had Leisure to attend to our joint private affairs. Thinking that a man might fairly risque his Property Where he risqued his Person, I had advanced freely to the State, or rashly as the more cautious expressd it. I am one of those who have in no Instance had occasion to complain of my Country. We can furnish a number of industrious Planters with a Tract of One hundred Thousand A[cre]s which is on Tenissee River which rises in the blue Ridge & runs into the Ohio. Those Lands are exceeding good, the Climate temperate so as to have hardly the appearance of Winter and withall very healthy. We are in contract for a larger Tract of four or five hundred Thousand Acres & by this Time I presume the Bargain is finished. That other Tract is on the Bend of what is calld the Cherokee River. Some of the best Land that was ever warmed by the Sun. I can only say that for your own Accot if you have any wish to have a few A[cre]s of terra firma & will explain your Views to me I will endeavour to see that you shall not be disappointed. Dont charge me again with severe insinuations when I remind you that aliens cannot hold soil in the United States. Is not the Word just marked a strange one when apply'd to a native of this Coun-  try. But such is the fact and you may be assured that we are very attentive to this Distinction. However the means of becoming a Citizen with us is extremely easy. Was not this distinction held up British Merchants and others would try to hold us again in a species of Slavery by getting Mortgages & other holds of our Lands. As for yourself it certainly will not be difficult for you to make a Trustee of some Person on whose name the Lands may be taken up and who may reconvey to you if ever the Time should come when you could hold the Soil in propri nomine, if not, it might be sold for your Benefit. I cannot devise what the Price of vacant Lands may be; those I mean in the disposal of Congress. You doubtless know that our national debt is estimated at some thing less than Ten Millions Sterlg viz 42 Mills. of Dlrs. Of this near 8 mills of Dlrs are due to foreign Countries viz France, Holland, Spain. The remr. is due to our late Army & other Citizens of these States, for their Claims they hold Certificates at the Interest of 6 Per Ct. Small as this National Debt is, from the strong Impressions made by the late Paper Money, The Certificates, which are also unfortunately on Paper, are much depretiated; a good deal more than your Bank Stock. It is probable that the Office will open for the disposal of Land at a certain number of Dlrs Per Hundd As. to be paid in Silver or Certificates, you may be assured that no man will pay Silver while he can buy Certificates as at present at 25 or 30 Per Ct. Certificates will doubtless in a short Time appreciate so that the first adventurers will be apt to get their Land, on the best Terms. Be pleased to observe this is matter of meer Opinion, for the Terms have not ever been mentioned in Congress in my hearing, and though I have nearly perfected a Plan for the general & particular partition of the western Country which seems to be approved of by those who have examined it; the Question of Value I have not once considered. On the other Questions there can hardly be a difference of Opinion. I fervently wish to see an extinction of our national Debt--The borrower is a Slave to the Lender. Arguments have been often advanced in favour of national Debt. There are also Arguments in favour of Vice & Luxury; they employ the poor. I wish to see America subsist without such Splinters. They may be apply'd to shattered frames. We are in the Vigour of Youth. Is it not strange, for it is certain, that some States whose numbers have been correctly taken, have increased in the Number of Inhabitants during the War. This is doubtless true also of the Inhabitants of the United States; And People are already removing in Thousands to live over the Mountains. We shall soon have three or four new States on the Waters of the Ohio. You know that Pennsylvana is now in the Center of Thirteen, but the Increase of States will be to the Southward. To this we look which is the true Cause why some of us are very desirous that Congress should at once take its Station and build a fOEderal Town near the falls of Potowmack. The Eastern States   having at present an equality of Votes are not willing to give up. They however candidly admit that they foresee the Time when the Southern Interest must prevail. In the mean while we shall accommodate ourselves as we can. The advantages of a temperate Climate over a Cold one are so obvious that the whole bent of Population is to the Southward. The former objections to those States being removed, which formerly arose from their forms of Govt. or religious Establishmts. being now removed--People follow the natural Bias of human Nature, which is to seek ease. If this remark is made particular and you should ask whether I have lately been consulting my Ease I shall admit that I have not. My sole ambition terminated in this That I might be a unit in that Band of Patriots who should establish Freedom in this new World, and my Hope was that I might weather the storm then to retire to the Enjoymt of Ease and Peace. To the Perfection of my Hopes & Wishes I have seen the restoration of Peace & security of Liberty but I cannot say that I enjoy Ease. For the space of near two Years I have not been absent from my duty in Congress a single day except three on which I had a slight Fever. For many years I have abstained from spirituous Liquors, so that except the few minutes which are necessarily bestowed on Meals and perhaps a few others at a Tea Table I am the perfect Slave of Business from morning until night. My Colleagues have been relieved a second and a third time since my arrival. My Tour of Duty has been continued and my last intimations from the State is that it is expected that I will serve while I am eligeable which happily is only three Years. You may possibly wonder why a man should wish to retire from the most honorable Station in a great Empire but I wish and long for a little Relaxation & the variety of a little Philosophical Study. Les Droits des Gens Though useful are not quite so entertaining as the Laws of Nature. Many is the favour your Sovereign has bestowed on the United States and the last is not the least. His Proclamation restraining our Trade will enable us to secure such Regulations of Commerce as Eight months ago I thought were in Danger. Immediately on the Cessation of Hostilities I attempted a measure to secure our Commerce but was not supported. I believe it was thought that the barbarity of the southern Campains or a temper naturally worn had induced me to apprehend worse than could probably happen even from the hands of Geo. the 3rd. Happily the very Circumstance that I predicted has turned up. I think we shall presently discover who has most occasion for a Commercial Treaty. Are Mr & Mrs Fisher alive?

  Dear Sir [Philadelphia] 13 Feb 1784  I put a Letter into the post office two days ago for you, and am this Moment informed by a Gentleman from New York, that the packet, on board of which Col. Harmar Embarked the 21st Ultimo, had returned into that port, having run ashore in the Neighbourhood of the Hook, and received so much damage, as to make it Necessary to refit. Colo.

  Sir, Annapolis Feby 14, 1784. Since our late dispatches from Mr. Adams (1) we have recd. nothing from our Ministers in Europe. By these we were informed of his and Mr. Jay's arrival in London, but as Congress hath appointed neither of these Gent'n to that court, nor directed the scene of negotiation even with that power to be chang'd from Paris, we presume their attendance there is merely on a private visit. As yet no arrangment is form'd in our foreign affairs. Commercial treaties with most of the powers with whom these States will have a commerc'l intercourse are still to be enter'd into. Whether the gent'n now in Europe will be jointly commission'd to treat with all these powers or particular courts will be assign'd to each is still to be the subject of discussion. The attention of Congress is engag'd more immediately in our internal arrangments but even in this time nothing is finally determin'd. The States are looking within themselves and calculating their several disbursements during the war and endeavoring to fix the payment on the U. States. Massachuss'ts hath lately demanded the redemption of the old emissions of paper money, the assumpsit of the U. S. to pay the expence of the expedition to Penobscot undertaken by authority of the State alone, together with some allowance for the large bounties given by that State to recruits for the army. To neither of these demands hath an answer as yet been given.(2) How far we shall lose or gain by any gen'l plan adopted here respecting State expenditures we have not sufficient documents to determine by. A great object with us will be to comprehend in any plan of that kind the remainder of our western expenditures wch. stand precisely on the ground of the expedition to Penobscot. We shall be happy to receive from yr Excel'y every communication upon this subject that you are possess'd of. We have it from private but respectable authority that the rupture between the Porte and the two empires will probably be accommodated by concessions on the part of the former without committing their pretensions to the calamitous and uncertain events of war. The diversion wh. a contest between these powers might have made to the force of our ally, circumstanc'd as we have been with respect to the definitive treaty, hath made the progress of this affr. a subject of consequence to us.

  Dear Sir. Annapolis 14th Feby. 1784  Your Favor of the 1st of Jany. I have had the pleasure of receiving, & should have answered it before this time, had I been able to collect any Information of Consequence relative to your Queries. You observe, that several questions arise with Respect to Confiscations, & the Affairs of the Absentees--That probably the Laws for Confiscation, are not, in some of the States the same in operation, as our Laws, which occasioned the 6th Article in the Treaty to be worded as it is. I have enclosed for your Information what our Commissioners have wrote Jointly on the Article respecting the Refugees;(1) & it is not in my Power to collect any other Information of Importance. New York has had no Delegate in Congress since we have been at this Place. New Jersey has had one only, & he is not able to give any Detail of the Proceedings of this State in these Matters, Neither can I collect any Thing from the Delegates of Pennsylvania that will throw any Light upon your Queries. Congress did on the 14th of January last make the Recommendation stipulated in the 5th Article (2)--And I apprehend the Business must now rest with the several Legislatures, who alone, have the Right & Power of altering the Laws respecting Absentees, & of making such others relative to them as shall not be expressly contrary to the definitive Treaty. Some may say, that what relates to them in the Treaty is so ambiguously express'd, as that it will be difficult to determine what may, or may not be opposed thereto. One Point I think is clear that the Refugees have nothing to expect, of Rights; The Legislatures must determine how far it is proper to extend their Lenity & Compassion towards them. The State of Maryland has confiscated real Estate, the Property of british Subjects to the Amo. of about £300,000 Sterg. Little is said about it. The former Owner of the greatest Part of it, Mr. Hartford a natural Son of the late Lord Baltimore, & his Heir, is now in this Place; He has made no formal application tho' he has been here since last August. It is supposed he waited for the Completion of the Definitive Treaty, since which the Legislature of this State has not been in session--from what I can collect, any Application of his will be fruitless. The State have also confiscated of his, about £30,000 Sterg. due for quit rents. This may be a Matter of more nice Discussion as it will come under the Denomination of a Debt due to a brittish Subject. It is said, that a Charge of an equal Amount will be made by the State on this ground, a certain Sum was laid on the Tonnage of Vessels & appropriated for the Defence of the State, which was received for many years & not applied to the Purpose for which it was granted, but the Proprietor or his Governor keept it to their own Use. There does not  FEBRUARY 14, 1784  seem to be in general a Disposition this Way to favor the Refugees. It is an old Observation, that Justice ought to begin at Home, that Beginning is yet to be made with Respect to our own Citizens; after we have provided for them honestly, which Heaven only knows how long it will be before this shall be done, I own that I see very little Prospect of it at present, then we may more clearly consider our Situation & know what we can do for others, who have been no small Cause of the Burthens & Distresses that we shall feel for many Years to come. Does Justice require that we should shew them Lenity? It does not seem to be agreed that they have any Demand upon us from that Principle. Does Policy then dictate to us a Revision of our Laws, Retribution & a free Admission of them amongst us? It is said that this would discover our Magnanimity in a Point of Light that would do Honor to our national Character among the European Nations--that it would operate strongly in our Favor as Britain might thereby be induced to make a much more liberal Treaty of Commerce with us; & the more liberal her's, the more so will be the commercial Treaties to be form'd with other Nations. This seems to carry with it a \""quid pro quo.\"" But it does not seem to me that any such Bargain can be made. The Britons from their Publications, appear to be divided in sentiment with respect to the Utility of a Treaty of Commerce with us. Some are for making a liberal Treaty, others are for making none. The Opinions of both Parties are founded in Interest. The first one ready & desirous of doing it without forcing upon us the Refugees. The others are against it in every Shape. The present Administration are much in this Opinion. They say, that since Peace has taken Place, it is evident that the Americans have forsaken the french Ports, that they have, & will naturally revert to the old Channel of Trade. That at present, such is the Government of the United States, that if they would, they cannot make general commercial Regulations to prevent it. That they shall therefore, without a Treaty have as much of our Trade, as they could expect to have with. They farther say, that the Americans wish to secure to themselves permanent Advantages from the Whale & cod Fisheries, but that it is not for the Interest of Britain to encourage or favor them, nor in the Carrying Trade, all which would tend to weaken very much the brittish Navy; for when these Priviledges shall be stipulated to the United States, Russia being by the present Treaty entitled to all the Priviledges which shall be granted to the most favored Nation, will also Share in them. These consider the Navigation Act, & a firm Adherance to it, as Matters of the highest national Consequence, & on which the future Prosperity, if not Existence of the Nation depend. But it is nearly of as high Consequence to us that they should relax; For without the beforementioned Branches of Trade; Masstts., especially, will have gained a Loss as St. Paul says--She will have gaind her   Independence at the expence of her only Resources of Wealth. She will have the Glory of being a sovereign, independent, poor State. This may save us from the Reproach \""sævior Armis--Luxuria incubuit, et que Vitia suerunt, Mores sunt.\"" (3)  But granting that we are to make a Bargain for the Refugees, ought not the Matter to be well husbanded. If thro' them we are to obtain a more liberal commercial Treaty, that Indulgence ought not to be granted until Stipulations are fairly entered into. We certainly have a Right to make the best we can of a bad Bargain. As it is possible, tho I do not think it probable, that Britain might be induced on Account of the Refugees to enter into a more favourable Treaty of Commerce with us, we ought by no Means to relax with respect to them, until we know her ultimate Intentions. You seem to be afraid to ask what is to be done, with Loan office Certificates & old Emissions.(4) Perhaps I have much more Reason to be afraid to give you an Answer. As to the last, we can take no Question in Congress upon the Matter, for Want of a sufficient Representation. We have had nine States represented but three Days only, since we have been in this Place--And when we shall have nine States again, I know not. Congress have but a few Objects of Consequence before them; they generally require the Assent of Nine States. If there was a full Representation, these might all, in the Course of two Months, be dispatch'd, & Congress might then have a Recess of five or six Months. If the States are not disposed to keep up a Representation, how can the Evil be remedied? Congress have no Power over their absent Members. As to Loan Certificates, it does not appear to me that there is a Probability that the States will give to Congress permanent & adequate Funds to discharge Interest or Principal. But we must wait the Issue. I am Dear Sir, your most huml Servt. Saml Osgood  ""

  Sir, Annapolis 16 Feby. 1784. Laws for an impost, agreeable to the recommendation of congress, are likely to take place throughout the states. Massachusetts & Virginia have lately come into the measure, by solemn acts. The delegates from Connecticut say their assembly will probably adopt it, at their present session. And the language of Rhode Island itself is, that their state will hold out no longer, than until all the other states have complied. A member from the last mentioned state asked me lately if Delaware had made a law for this purpose? (1) He said he had seen the impost laws of most of the other states & wished to see ours also, and to transmit a copy of it with some others to his state, that, with many examples before them, the legislature might be assisted in forming one to their satisfaction, as well as encouraged to Join in general conformity. I promised to procure a copy if I could: and if you will be so obliging as to order one from the clerk's office and forward it to me, it may contribute to relieve our little sister, from a very obstinate degree of folly. The trouble I now give you, sir, may suggest to your recollection, a resolution of congress of the 16th March 1778, earnestly requesting that attested copies of the acts passed by the states respectively, in pursuance of recommendations of congress, should be transmitted to congress, as soon as possible.2 The Delaware Law, I am informed (for I never read it) is not in exact conformity to the resolutions of congress, as are those of Pennsylvania & Maryland. Possibly then our law may undergo a revision & amendment. I shall therefore think it my duty not to make any other use of it, than to furnish my Rhode Island friend with a copy, unless by directions received expressly for that purpose, from your Excellency. Congress are about to send off another express to urge forward, if possible, a representation from the delinquent states. It is mortifying to me, to find Delaware again on the list;(3) and, that you must be  FEBRUARY 16, 1784  treated with another set of teazing resolutions. But, sir, the situation of congress is truly alarming; the most important business pending & not states enough to take it up; whilst those present are fatigued into resentment & almost despair, with loitering away their time, to little purpose, besides waiting for others to come. It is the resolute intention of congress to adjourn this spring, leaving a committee consisting of a member from each state. For this purpose, it is thought to be expedient, if not absolutely necessary, that every state should be represented; and this is to be the foundation of an address that is to go from north to south, and which you may daily expect. I expect nobody from Delaware before Col. Bedford. I hope he will lose no time after his circuit of courts is finished. I have the honor to be, with very great respect, Your Excellency's most obt.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Feb. 18. 1784. Your favour should not have been so long unacknowledged but that I have been in a state of health which permitted me neither to read, write or think.(1) I take advantage now of a small remission in a fever to write you a line of thanks by Monsr. Marbois. You write in a gout (I beleive it was) and I answer in a fever. In truth amidst this eternal surfeit of politics wherein one subject succeeds another like Aesop's feast of tongues a small entremÉt of philosophy is releiving. I carried your letter to the printer. He declared it exceeded the typographical art. He observed further that it would be very ill-judged in those capable of writing things of merit in substance, to introduce a merit of form: that it would transfer the whole credit from the writer to the printer, and Bell would become the first genius of America. What think you of these ballons? They really begin to assume a serious face. The Chevalr. Luzerne communicated to me a letter received from his brother who mentions one which he had seen himself. The  FEBRUARY 18, 1784  persons who ascended in it regulated it's height at about 3000 feet, and passed with the wind about 6 miles in 20 minutes when they chose to let themselves down, tho' they could have travelled triple the distance. This discovery seems to threaten the prostration of fortified works unless they can be closed above, the destruction of fleets and what not. The French may now run over their laces, wines &c. to England duty free. The whole system of British statutes made on the supposition of goods being brought into some port must be revised. Inland countries may now become maritime states unless you chuse rather to call them aerial ones as their commerce is in future to be carried on through that element. But jesting apart I think this discovery may lead to things useful. For instance there is no longer a difficulty how Congress shall move backwards and forwards, and your bungling scheme of moving houses and moving towns is quite superseded, (2) we shall soar sublime above the clouds. It is happy for us too that this invention happens just as philosophy is taking such a start in our own hemisphere: for I find by the last election of members to the Society (3) there are no less than 21 new philosophers found, every one of whom is superior to my countryman Madison. From philosophy I must pass on to domestic things and thank you for your notice of my little daughter whose education and improvement is my first object now. I am sure your advice and society will forward these works with her. I am sorry Cimetiere (4) thinks her a dull subject in his line. I do not foresee that she will ever have another opportunity of learning to draw, and it is a pleasing accomplishment and a valuable one in many circumstances.(5) As to his pay, I would wish him to receive what he thinks due to him, because I would even purchase his peace at that price. Perhaps I may be able to get him to persevere when I return to Philadelphia which will probably be in the spring--but stop or I shall let out the secret. Much health and happiness to yourself and family, and sincere respects to Mr. and Mrs. Rittenhouse, remaining myself with great sincerity Dr. Sir Your friend & servt, Th.

Under the fullest persuasion, that Your Excelly. has made every Exertion (consistant with the important office you fill) to bring forward another Member; I should not have so recently troubled you on this Score, were I not pressed to it at the particular desire of the present representation on the Floor of Congress: thus Constrained, I am again to Solicit Your Excellys. interference in this Business. In addition to the letter from the President, which accompanies this,(2) I have to Inform you, that the General discontent, which prevails among the Members attending, has become so serious & alarming, that it threatens a dissolution of Congress & Eventually that of the Union. Nor is it to be wondered at, that gentlemen, who have given the most assiduous attendance for these Six Months past, to promote the Interest, Happiness & Safety of the U.S. generally; should be disgusted at the delay of the important Concerns of the Union, being carried into Effect thro the remissness & inattention of the States particularly delinquent. There is no power in the Confederation; nor any Rule of the House to Compel the members to attend, or even to remain at the place where Congress are Convened; & should the Gentlemen who are now here, either thro a Sense of the Duty they owe to their States (in saving a useless Expence) or tired out with their repeated, yet fruitless endeavours to Coerce an attendance of those States unrepresented; wholly withdraw themselves: Your Excelly. will readily conceive the Confusion which would Ensue & the Danger arising to the Union at large.

I cannot help flattering Myself, that when this State of things comes to be laid before the Gentlemen, who are in the Delegation with me; that one or other of them will be induced to attend: and I must here take occasion to Mention also, that the adjournment to Trenton in the Spring will depend wholly upon the representation that Exists in Congress of the Nothern States.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Feb. 20. 1784. Your favour of the 11th inst. came to hand this day.(1) I had prepared a multitude of memorandums of subjects whereon to write you, but I will first answer those arising from your letter. By the time my order got to Philadelphia every copy of Smith's history of New York was sold.(2) I shall take care to get Blair's Lectures for you as soon as published,(3) and will attend to your presumed wishes whenever I meet with any thing rare & of worth. I wish I knew better what things of this kind you have collected for yourself, as I may often doubt whether you have or have not a thing. I know of no objections to the printing the revisal;(4) on the contrary I think good will result from it. Should this be decided I must make a short trip to Virginia, as from the loss of originals I believe my copies must often be wanting. I had never met with the particular fact relative to the grinders of the incognitum found in Brasil & Lima & deposited in the British museum which you mention from Dr. Hunter.(5) I know it has been said that in a very few instances such bones have been found in S. America. You will find a collection of these in 2. Buff. Epoq. de la nature 187. but they have been so illy attested, so loosely & ignorantly described, and so seldom even pretended to have been seen, that I have supposed their identity with the Northern bones, & perhaps their existence at all not sufficiently established. The authority of Hunter is respectable: but if this be the only well attested instance of those bones brought from S. America, they may still be beleived to have been first carried there either previous to the emigration of the Spaniards when there was doubtless a communication between the Indns. of the two continents, or after that emigration when an intercourse between the Spaniards of N. & S. America took place. It would be unsafe to deny the fact; but I think it may well be doubted. I wish you had a thermometer. Mr. Madison of the college (6) & myself are keeping observations for a comparison of climate. We observe at Sunrise & at 4 o'clock P.M. which are the coldest & warmest points of the day. If you could observe at the same time it would shew the difference between going North & Northwest on this continent. I suspect it to be colder in Orange or Albemarle than here. I think I informed you in my last (7) that an attempt had been made to ratify the Definitive treaty by seven states only, and to impose this under the sanction of our seal (without letting our actual state appear) on the British court. Reade, Williamson & Lee were violent for  FEBRUARY 20 1784  this, and gave notice that when the question should be put they would call the yeas & nays, and shew by whose fault the ratification of this important instrument should fail, if it should fail. I prepared the inclosed resolution8 by way of protest & informed them I would place that also on the journals with the yeas & nays, as a justification of those who opposed the proposition. I beleive this put a stop to it. They suffered the question to rest undecided till the 14th of Jan. when 9 states appeared & ratified. Colo. Harmer & Colo. Franks were immediately dispatched to take passages to Europe with copies of the ratification, but by the extraordinary severity of the season we know they had not sailed on the 7th inst. The ratification will not therefore arrive in time. Being persuaded I shall be misrepresented within my own state, if any difficulties should arise, I inclose you a copy of the protest containing my reasons.(9) Had the question been put there were but two states who would have voted for a ratification by seven. The others would have been in the negative or divided. I find Congress every moment stopped by questions whether the most trifling money propositions are not above the powers of seven states as being appropriations of money. My idea is that the estimate for the year & requisition grounded on that, wherein the sums to be allowed to each department are stated, is the general appropriation which requires 9 states, & that the detailing it out provided they do not go beyond these sums may be done by the subordinate officers of the federal government or by a Congress of 7 states. I wish you to think of this & give me your thoughts on the subject.(10) We have as yet no Secy. of Foreign affairs. {Lee}(11) avows himself a candidate. The plan of Foreign affairs likely to take place is to commission Adams, Franklin & Jay to conclude treaties with the several European powers, and then to return, leaving the feild to subordinate characters. Messrs. Adams & Jay have paid a visit to the court of London unordered & uninvited. Their reception has been forbidding. {Luzern[e] leaves} us in August, whether {recalled} or on {his own request} is not known. This information comes from {himself} tho' is not as yet {spok[e]n} of {publicly.(12) Lee} finding no {faction} among the {men} here, entered into that among the {women} which rages to a very high degree. A {bal[l]} being appointed by the one party on a certain {night} he undertook to {give} one, and fixed it precisely on the same {night}. This of course has placed him in the midst of the mud. He is {courting Miss Sprig} a {young girl} of {seventeen} and of {thirty thousand pound[s]} expectation. I have no doubt from some conversations with {him} that there is a design agitating to sever the {Northern Nec[k]} and add it to this {state. He} supported in conversation with me the propriety & necessity of such a general measure, to wit of enlarging the {small states} to interest them in the {union. He} deserves to be well {watched} in our state. {He} is extremely soured with it and is not cautious in betraying  FEBRUARY 20, 1784  his hostility {against it}.(13) We cannot make up a Congress at all. There are 8 states in town, 6 of which are represented by two members only. Of these two members of different states are confined by the gout so that we cannot make a house. We have not sit above 3 days I beleive in as many weeks. Admonition after admonition has been sent to the states, to no effect. We have sent one to day. If it fails, it seems as well we should all retire. There have never been 9 states on the floor but for the ratification of the treaty and a day or two after. Georgetown languishes. The smile is hardly covered now when the federal towns are spoken of. I fear that our chance is at this time desperate. Our object therefore must be if we fail in an effort to remove to Georgetown, to endeavor then to get to some place off the waters of the Chesapeak where we may be ensured against Congress considering themselves as fixed. My present expectations are, that as soon as we get a Congress, to do business, we shall attend to nothing but the most pressing matters, get through them & adjourn, not to meet again till November, leaving a Committee of the states. That Committee will be obliged to go immediately to Philadelphia to examine the offices & of course they will set there till the meeting in November. Whether that meeting will be in Philada. or Trenton will be the question and will in my opinion depend on the vote of {New York}. Did not you once suppose in conversation with me that Congress had no authority to decide any cases between two differing states, except those of disputed territory? I think you did.(14) If I am not mistaken in this I should wish to know your sense of the words which describe those cases which may be submitted to a federal court. They seem to me to comprehend every cause of difference. We have received the act of our assembly ceding the lands North of Ohio & are about executing a deed for it.(15) I think the territory will be laid out by passing a meridian through the Western cape of the Mouth of the Gr. Kanhaway from the Ohio to L. Erie, and another through the rapids of Ohio from the same river to Michigan & crossing these by the parallels of latitude 37°, 39°, 41°, &c. allowing to each state an extent of 2° from N. to South. On the Eastern side of the meridn. of Kanhaway will still be one new state, to wit, the territory lying between that meridian, Pennsylva., the Ohio & L. Erie.(16) We hope N. Carola. will cede all beyond the same meridian of Kanhaway, & Virginia also. For god's sake push this at the next session of assembly. We have transmitted a copy of a petition from the people of Kentucky to Congress praying to be separated from Virginia. Congress took no notice of it. We sent the copy to the Governor desiring it to be laid before the assembly.(1)7 Our view was to bring on the question.It is for the interest of Virginia to cede so far immediately, because the people beyond that will separate themselves, because they will be joined by all our settlements beyond the Alleghaney if they are the   first movers. Whereas if we draw the line those at Kentucky having their end will not interest themselves for the people of Indiana, Greenbriar &c. who will of course be left to our management, and I can with certainty almost say that Congress would approve of the meridian of the mouth of Kanhaway and consider it as the ultimate point to be desired from Virginia. I form this opinion from conversation with many members. Should we not be the first movers, and the Indianians & Kentuckians take themselves off and claim to the Alleghaney I am afraid Congress would secretly wish them well. Virginia is extremely interested to retain to that meridian, 1. because the Gr. Kanhaway runs from North to South across our whole country forming by its waters a belt of fine land, which will be thickly seated & will form a strong barrier for us, 2. because the country for 180 miles beyond that is an absolute desart, barren & mountainous which can never be inhabited, & will therefore be a fine separation between us & the next state, 3. because the government of Virginia is more convenient to the people on all the upper parts of Kanhaway than any other which will be laid out, 4. because our lead mines are in that country, 5. because the Kanhaway is capable of being made navigable, and therefore gives entrance into the Western waters to every part of our latitude, 6. because it is not now navigable & can only be made so by expensive works, which require that we should own the soil on both sides, 7. because the Ohio and it's branches which head up against the Patowmac affords the shortest water communication by 500 miles of any which can ever be got between the Western waters & Atlantic, & of course promises us almost a monopoly of the Western & Indian trade. I think the opening this navigation is an object on which no time is to be lost. Pennsylva. is attending to the Western commerce. She has had surveys made of the river Susquehanna and of the grounds thro' which a canal must pass to go directly to Philadelphia. It is reported practicable at an expense of £200,000 and they have determined to open it. What an example this is! If we do not push this matter immediately they will be beforehand with us & get possession of the commerce, and it is difficult to turn it from a channel in which it is once established. Could not our assembly be induced to lay a particular tax which should bring in 5 or 10,000 £ a year to be applied till the navigation of the Ohio & Patowmac is opened, then James river & so on through the whole successively. Genl. Washington has that of the Patowmac much at heart. The superintendance of it would be a noble amusement in his retirement & leave a monument of him as long as the waters should flow. I am of opinion he would accept of the direction as long as the money should be to be emploied on the Patowmac, & the popularity of his name would carry it thro' the assembly. The portage between Yohogania & the N. branch of Patowmac is of 40 or 50 miles. Cheat river is navigable far up. It's head is within 10 miles of the head of   the North branch of Patowmac & I am informed offers the shortest & best portage. I wish in the next election of delegates for Congress, Short could be sent.(18) His talents are great & his weight in our state must ere long become principal. I see the best effects produced by sending our young statesmen here. They see the affairs of the Confederacy from a high ground; they learn the importance of the Union & befriend federal measures when they return. Those who never come here, see our affairs insulated, pursue a system of jealousy & self interest, and distract the Union as much as they can. Genl. Gates would Supply Short's place in the council very well, and would act. He is now here. What will you do with the council? They are expensive, and not constantly nor often necessary: yet to drop them would be wrong. I think you had better require their attendance twice a year to examine the Executive department & see that it be going on rightly; advise on that subject the Governor or inform the legislature as they shall see occasion. Give them 50 guineas for each trip, fill up only 5 of the places, and let them be always subject to summons on great emergencies by the Governor, on which occasions their expences only should be paid. At an expence of 500 guineas you will thus preserve this member of the constitution always fit for use. Young & ambitious men will leave it & go into the assembly, but the elderly & able who have retired from the legislative feild as too turbulent will accept of the offices. Among other legislative subjects our distresses ask notice. I had been from home four months & had expended 1200 Dollars before I received one farthing. By the last post we received about seven weeks allowance. In the mean time some of us had had the mortification to have our horses turned out of the livery stable for want of money. There is really no standing this. The supply gives us no relief because it was mortgaged. We are trying to get something more effectual from the treasury, having sent an express to inform them of our predicament. I shall endeavour to place as much in the Philadelphia bank as will repay your kindness unless you should alter your mind & chuse to take it in the Virginia treasury. I have hunted out {Chatlux} journal & had a reading of it.(19) I had never so falsely estimated the character of a book. There are about six sentences of offensive bagatelles which are all of them publicly known, because having respected individual characters they were like carrion for the buzzard curiosity. All the rest of the book (and it is a 4to. of 186 pages) is either entertaining, or instructive & would be highly flattering to the Americans. He has visited all the principal feilds of battle, enquired minutely into the detail of the actions, & has given what are probably the best accounts extant of them. He often finds occasion to criticize & to deny the British accounts from an inspection of the ground. I think to write to him, recommend the expunging the few exceptionable passages & publication of the rest. I have had an opportunity   here of examining Bynkershoek's works. There are about a fourth part of them which you would like to have. They are the following tracts. Questiones juris publici--de lege Rhodië--de dominio maris--du Juge competent des Ambassadeurs, for this last if not the rest has been translated into French with notes by Barbeyrac.(20) I have had from Boinod & Gaillard a copy of Mussenbroeck's cours de Physique.(21) It is certainly the most comprehensive & most accurate body of Natl. Philosophy which has been ever published. I would recommend to you to get it, or I will get that and any other books you want from Boinod or elsewhere. I hope you have found access to my library. I beg you to make free use of it. Key, the steward is living there now & of course will be always in the way. Monroe is buying land almost adjoining me. Short will do the same. What would I not give you could fall into the circle. With such a society I could once more venture home & lay myself up for the residue of life, quitting all it's contentions which grow daily more & more insupportable. Think of it. To render it practicable only requires you to think it so. Life is of no value but as it brings us gratifications. Among the most valuable of these is rational society. It informs the mind, sweetens the temper, chears our spirits, and promotes health. There is a little farm of 140 as. adjoining me, & within two miles, all of good land, tho' old, with a small indifferent house on it, the whole worth not more than £250. Such a one might be a farm of experiment & support a little table & houshold. It is on the road to Orange & so much nearer than I am. It is convenient enough for supplementary supplies from thence. Once more think of it, and Adieu  ""

  Sir, Annapolis 20th Feby. 1784. The express, which I gave you to expect in my last, is not likely to proceed as soon as I expected: for the gout having seized upon two members of congress, knocks up the representation of Maryland & North Carolina. Consequently we have no congress and cannot act upon a report prepared by a committee, for the purposes aforesaid. In this exigency, six states being present, today, gave it as their advice to the president, to write a letter in his own name, to the executives of the delinquent states, stating certain facts descriptive of the alarming situation of congress, which letter I expect you will receive by this post.(1) I can assure you, sir, that it was proposed by several of the members as an article of the letter, that the absent states should be informed, that those present would think it their duty to retire to their own homes, rather than be a useless expence to the public, unless spedily attended by such additional representations as would enable them to do the public business. This paragraph, however, was over- ruled by a majority, who were unwilling to familiarise the idea of a dissolution of our federal government: but I mention it to shew the temper of mind that members are falling into, and the necessity there is for urging Mr. Bedford forward as soon as possible. Virginia, by a law lately transmitted to congress, has ceded the west- FEBRUARY 20, 1784  ern territory, on the terms proposed & agreed to by congress.(2) A committee is appointed to draw a proper deed of cession to be executed by the delegates of Virginia, as authorized by the law; but we have no congress to receive their report. It is shrewdly apprehended by some that this whole country may slip out of our hands if not spedily attended to. The presidents letter being full in the detail of many other important matters that require to be immediately acted upon by congress, I need not enumerate them here: but have thought this much necessary for the full explanation of the presidents letter, as well as of my last. With very great respect, I have the honr. to be, your Excellency most obt. Sert. James Tilton  ""

  Sir Annapolis Feby. 20. 1784. We have the honor to inclose to your Excellency the copy of a petition from some of the inhabitants of the Kentucky district, lately presented to Congress. It was read when seven States were on the floor and it seem'd to be their disposition to pay no attention to it.(1) Sometime afterwards we mov'd that it might be committed to us to be transmitted to your Excellency and this motion was disagreed to by only one State whose Delegates suggested they did it only upon the principle that the petition should be taken up and rejected by Congress.(2) In this state it still remains nor are we authoriz'd from any circumstance which hath appear'd to us to suppose that it will ever be acted on. We have to desire of your Excellency to lay this before the general assembly. We have the honor to be with great respect your Excellency's most obt. & humble servant, Th. Jefferson Arthur Lee  Jas. Monroe  ENCLOSURE [January 2, 1784] (3)  To his Excellency the President & Honourable delegates of the United States of America in Congress Assembled.  The memorial & petition of a number of Inhabitants of Kentuckey Settlement, westward of the Cumberland mountains on the waters emptying into the river Ohio, Humbly sheweth, FEBRUARY 20, 1784  That your memorialists have at a great expence & hazard removed themselves to this Country, (& some of us at the expence of our all) with a view & expectation of procuring a sufficiency of land for the support of themselves & families, on which they hoped to settle, & enjoy the remainder of their days in peace & happiness, but they are sorry to be under the disagreeable necessity to complain they are dis-appointed in their expectations. Your honors will please to observe that when the State of Virginia opened a land Office for the locating of land on the western waters, there was Commissioners appointed for certain districts in the western territory, to settle & adjust the claimants titles for services done, improvements made on waste unappropriated land in said Country, for which they were entitled to certain quantities of land; whose powers were limited for a certain time, but from unforeseen casualities, the great distance of the way, the Commissioners powers expired before many of us could attend to lay in our claims, & many that did attend for want of evidence in time to prove their services & improvements lost the just right; And for reasons unknown to your Memorialists when the Commissioner's powers by act of Assembly were prolonged in the other districts, the Commissioners of Kentuckey district were discontinued to the great loss of our just claims & rights, and others of us being unacquainted with the late law establishing a land of office, were in expectation of obtaining a reasonable settlement in waste unappropriated land as formerly, in frontier unsettled Countries, but to their great loss & surprize were disappointed, having sold our little property, the great unavoidable expence in moving such a great distance, the sudden depreciation of the bills of credit & the remoteness of our situation rendered it almost impracticable for us to procure land warrants in time to secure a small quantity of land any way tolerable to live on. We would further beg leave to observe that while we were struggling with all the difficulties, hardships & dangers of settling a remote new Country, under the disadvantage of a bloody cruel war, protecting and defending our families & all that was dear and near to us (and as might be said at our own expence) from a barbarous, savage enemy, numbers of monied Gentlemen in the settlement, who lived in security & affluence and no ways contributed towards the defence or settling of this Country, monopolized great part of the most valuable lands in their hands to the great discouragement & hindrance of the equitable settlement thereof. It is a well known truth that the riches & strength of a free Country does not consist in property being vested in a few Individuals, but the more general it is distributed, the more it promotes industry, population & frugality, & even morality. Altho', We with gratitude acknowledge, that several Gentlemen, Inhabitants of this settlement, of fortune & influence, who had engrossed   large quantities of land when this Country was invaded by the enemy, generously stepped forth in defence of their Country and some of them nobly fell in the Conflict, whose memory we honor and revere. That a number of your memorialists from the causes abovesaid and their having heretofore been constrained to live in forts & stations for their own safety & defence, and generally on land claimed by other persons, have spent the most of their little effects they brought with them, which has rendered them unable either to move away or purchase land at the advance price the monopolizers hold it; and now after our long struggle in defending the Country & the land they pretend to hold, at our own expence, with the great loss of blood & Treasure, be forced to give an exorbitant price, or rent the land we have been fighting for, or turn off, we complain of as a great hardship & grievance. We would further represent, that kind providence has been very bountiful to this remote inland Country in supplying it with a number of salt springs which we humbly conceive ought to be held sacred & for the use of the community in general, but we are sorry to say they are engrossed by Individuals and mostly non-residenters of this settlement, that they have exacted extravagant rents for the privilege of making salt, which has greatly enhanced the price of that most useful, necessary article. Your memorialists would further beg leave to observe, that from our local situation, Nature placed us at too great a distance from the State of Virginia to be governed by one legislature; the nature of our circumstances differ so materially that it is almost impossible for the legislature of Virginia at such a distance to frame such salutary, wholesome laws that might in all cases answer the weal & interest of this Country; that many salutary laws made for our ease and comfort, from our remote situation, either expires or losses their good intentions before we have timely notice thereof; that from our situation we cannot have that equitable representation we are entitled to; that residenters & Men that has families to take care of & provide for, let them be ever so well qualified, declines the arduous task to represent us in Assembly, unless they have private business of their own to induce them to attend, and be so long absent from their interest and families. That all the public business of this settlement is transacted & governed by the Legislature of Virginia, that most of the profitable Posts & Offices is held by Non-residenters & transacted by their deputies, that all grants & patents for land and other public Offices is transacted and done in Virginia, by which and other means all the little ready specie that can be collected is drained out of this settlement to the great damage & impoverishing thereof, that the salaries & fees of public Offices, levies & taxes raised, are all rated in tobacco which, from its fluctuating price, makes it very uncertain, and this Settlement as yet, raises no tobacco for exportation, it lays the Assessors & Collectors under great   difficulties to collect the levies & taxes, and leaves a door open for the public Offices to exact exorbitant fees &ca. Thus may it please your Honors, We once more make bold to lay before you a few of our many grievances, which we humbly conceive, either from inclination, or want of proper information cannot be so salutarily remedied but by them who has a feeling knowledge thereof. We therefore your humble Petitioners most earnestly pray that the Honorable Congress will condescend to take under consideration our many grievances & difficulties which we set forth and labor under; and lay off Kentuckey Settlement westward of the Cumberland Mountains in a free, Independent State [reserving to Congress the power & authority as population encreases, for ease and comfort of the Inhabitants, to subdivide the same], and receive us into the fOEderal Union, to enable us to enjoy the freedom and blessings of our fellow-Citizens. And We your petitioners on our part do promise and engage to support Civil Government & the FOEderal Union to the uttermost of our power and ability, which from the rapid emigration now taking place, we hope we shall with honor & reputation be able to perform. And grant us such further relief in the premises as to Congress in their Judgement & Wisdom shall think equitable & just; And Your Honor's Petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray. ""

Gentleman who hath presided in the State during the trying Scenes of the late war with so much reputation, is so indisposed as to be unable to attend the duties of his Station, and sincerely wish the returning Spring may so far restore him that he may be able to aid in the public counsels.  In one of my late Letters I requested some information from the Honble. the President relative to public affairs, should his indisposition render him unable to gratify me, I must beg the same favors from you, and shall thankfully acknowlege them. I find by a New Hampshire Paper that the Legislature have passed the impost Act.(3) Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland & Virginia have done the same--Conneticut is at present in too great a pet with the Commutation to comply, but possibly may in time agree to it. Rhode Island, if I can judge from the sentiments of its Delegates here, will be slow in this business; but I do not wholly dispair even of that  FEBRUARY 21, 1784  State; from the Carolinas and Georgia I have heard nothing on which I can ground an opinion.

12504,dg021289,1784,David Howell to Jonathan Arnold,"""David Howell to Jonathan Arnold
  Dear Sir. Annapolis February 21, 1784. I have been informed in a Letter from Mr. J. Brown of your return from Vermont,(1) and am not a little mortified that you have not taken so much notice of your old friend as to write a single line. I have no regular correspondence with any person in the State & am much at a loss for the politics of the day. I have written you three or four Letters since I have received one from you. Congress take no Philadelphia papers at present; & those sent in to us printed in this State are of little consequence. This must be my apology for not sending you papers enclosed--which you was so obliging as to do for me during your tour of duty. Indeed there is but little news stirring--and but little business done in Congress as you will see by our Journals, which are sent to the State regularly. My late Letters to the Gov. & Dep. Governor will have informed you of all material transactions--as well as communications from Europe. You cannot easily concieve the teedium of our present Situation. Had my education in youth--or did my present taste admit of my participating in the amusements of this place such as plays, Balls, Concerts, routs, hops, Fandangoes & fox hunting--or I may add did my finances admit of mixing with the bon ton--time might pass off agreeably; but four dollars a day, altho as much as I wish, or expect from the State at present, burdened as the people are with accumulated debts, will not admit of seeing much Company, as you well know. You will ask then how I spend my time? I have perused the Letters from Europe on our Files & some of the extracts are sent to the State. I sometimes read. Gov. Jefferson, who is here a Delegate from Virginia, and one of the best members I have ever seen in Congress, has a good Library of French books, & has been so good as to lend me. There are at present many great objects before Congress: but none of more importance, or which engages my attention more than that of the western Country. You well know the terms on which Congress have accepted that Country & to which Virginia has finally conformed  FEBRUARY 21, 1784  her cession. The delegates of that State have presented Congress with the form of a deed of cession--or quit-claim. They give up to Congress all their claim to lands lying northwest of Ohio & within the charter boundary of Virginia. On their part they say that they are bound by the act of their State to this expression--on our part it is objected against as extending their charter boundary; & indeed giving authenticity to their claims; &, in effect, amounting to a special guaranty to the lands South East of the Ohio, which Congress utterly rejected. This deed is referred to a Committee.  The petition from Kentucke has lately been taken up--and a motion made to refer it to the State of Virginia within whose jurisdiction the petitioners live. The motion was opposed & finally rejected. You will percieve that the object was to establish their jurisdiction over that Country by a side wind, as the phrase is. The reason of all this manoeuvering is because Colonel Morgan was expected, & is now actually arrived, here on the business of originating an action, in behalf of the Indiana Company against the ancient dominion. Connecticutt has obtained an order for a Continental Court to try the claims of the settlers on the Susquehannah against the State of Pennsylvania. Great & manifold is the wisdom of the Confederation--and in no provision more conspicuous than in the constitution of a FOEderal Court. The Western World opens an amazing prospect. As a national fund, in my opinion, it is equal to our debt. As a Source of future population & strength it is a guaranty to our Independence. As its Inhabitants will be mostly cultivators of the Soil, republicanism looks to them as its Guardians. When the States on the eastern Shore, or Atlantic shall have become populous, rich & luxurious & ready to yield their Liberties into the hands of a Tyrant--the Gods of the mountains will save us--for they will be stronger than the Gods of the Vallies. Astræa will take her flight from the top of the Alleghany when she leaves the new World. A Committee has been appointed to report a plan of government, &c, for the Western Country. The report is agreed to by the Committee--but has not yet been made to Congress.(2) It is proposed to divide the Country into fourteen new States in the following manner. There are to be three tiers of States. One on the Atlantic, one on the Mississippi & a middle tier. The middle tier is to be the smallest & to form a ballance betwixt the two more powerful ones. The Western tier of States is to be bounded eastwardly by a meridional line drawn through the lowest point of the rapids of the river Ohio--and the eastern tier is to be bounded westwardly by a miridional line drawn through the west cape of the mouth of the great Conawa from lake Erie to the north boundary of So. Carolina, where the middle tier of States ends & permits So. Carolina & Georgia to run west to the first mentioned meridional line as their Atlantic coast falls off west.  The new States are each of them to contain two degrees of latitude and what lies above the 47th degree is to be added to the State adjoining South. The district lying east of the meridian of Conawa & West of Pennsylvania is to make a State by itself. If you trace the aforegoing lines on a Map the whole Scheme will readily appear. The mode of government during the Infancy of these States has taken up much time & was largely debated at Princeton last Summer. On this head the Committee have agreed to report, in substance, as follows. As settlers will always readily know in which of the States they are, for the States are to be named as well as numbered, when a number of settlers shall have planted themselves in any particular State, either on their petition, or the order of Congress they are to hold a general meeting of all the free males & to chuse out of all the Constitutions of the present thirteen States, one Constitution & to adopt the laws of such State also, which are to be subject to alterations by their ordinary legislature. They are also in this first & general meeting to divide the State into Counties, or Towns, for the choice of their Legislature and their government is to be originated among them. From this period they are to be subject to pay a Quota of taxes by the same rule as the other States; & they are to have a setting member in Congress with a right of debating but not of voting. This is their first stage. After the settlers in any such State shall consist of Souls, the free males shall have a right to call a Convention & to form a Constitution for themselves, which is to be permanent, of the republican form & agreeable to the Spirit of the Confederation. This is the second Stage. After the Settlers in any such State shall consist of a number of souls equal to the least numerous of the thirteen original States, such State shall be admitted as a member in full of the fOEderal Union & vote as well as debate, on subscribing the Articles of Confederation. The Committee have also agreed to report that the new States be laid off under the following express stipulations or perpetual Covenants betwixt them & the present States. 1. They shall always remain within the U. States & be considered as part thereof. 2. They shall assume on themselves a proportional part of the national debt at the time--and be bound in due time to subscribe all the Articles of Confederation as they may then be & to become members of the fOEderal Union. 3. After the year eighteen hundred there shall be no slavery in any of sd States, nor involuntary servitude other than as punishment for crimes. 4. No citizen thereof shall hold any hereditary title & nor shall any person holding such title, or order, be capable of becoming a citizen of any such State without a previous renunciation thereof.  About the most eligible mode of disposing of these lands there are various opinions. It has been the custom of the Southern States to issue warrants from a land office. The person taking the warrant has to look for unlocated lands to cover with his warrant, of which he makes a return. In this way the good land is looked out & seized on first--and land of little value & in all shapes left in the hands of the public: But this, I am told soon rises in value & is bought by the holders of the adjacent good lands in their own defence. In the eastern States, as you well know, the custom has been to sell a township by bounds, or certain lots, taken flush, good & bad together, & to push out settlement in compact columns. The measures to be finally adopted on this head must be the result of mutual concessions: & what they will be remains quite uncertain. Whether one general land-office ought to be opened, or one in each State is a question undecided, There being different opinions among the members present. But the price of the land is the chief question after all. If the liberties of this Country are preserved it will, in my humble opinion, be done by paying & not by funding the national debt. I am therefore of opinion with those who are for making the most of what we have to carry to market. I find the public creditors are very apprehensive that Congress will set an high price on their lands. We are told of the immense tracts of land the particular States have to dispose of--& of the lands at the disposal of the British Crown adjoining their water boundary, which it will be their intrest not only to give away; but to hire people to settle on--in order to preserve their fur-trade. A Major General a few days ago told me that he did not think our lands would fetch us above an eighth of a Dollar per acre. I replied by asking if his Conscience would let him take eighty thousand acres of that land for his Commutation only, (for it would come to so much nearly) when no nation, not even the British, ever gave any General Officer more than a Colonels half-pay!  Some are of opinion that it would be politic to throw all our Western Country into a bank & sell it out as bank stock--the Stockholders to chuse a Company of directors & to make the most of their property. But in my opinion this would be of too great magnitude to be effected in this Country. It might be more practicable in an ancient & wealthy Country such as England, or France. Such was the Missisippi Scheme in France, which paid the public debts, tho it ruined Individuals. A motion has been referred to a Grand Committie for a requisition on the States to pay intrest on the public debt--another motion has also been referred to the same Committee for requisition for the expences of the current year.(3) The Comee have not yet reported but have agreed to require of the States--  The ballance of arrearage of intrest due the first of January 1783 after deducting the requisition of the 4th of Sept. 1782. Dollars Which ballance is 642,764 (4) Intrest arising & becoming due this year 1,603,877 Total requisition for intrest 2,246,641 For the expences of the current year 434,005  Total of both requisitions 2,680,646  The Committee has written to Mr. Morris to inform them how much out of the existing requisitions on the States, after satisfying all the remaining uses thereof, may be applied to the uses of the above requisitions in order to lessen them! (5) The States are to be called on in the most earnest manner to comply with all the requisitions heretofore made. These measures are thought indispensably necessary to be adopted for the support of public credit, while the States are deliberating on the measures recommended in the resolutions of April 18, 1783. It may be observed that the estimate for this year is formed on a supposition that the reductions, which have lately been reported by a Committee on the civil List, will be adopted--but no decisive step can be taken in any money matters 'till nine States shall be present & agree therein. This is an event, which we wait for with the greatest impatience. You will please to let Mr. John Brown see this Letter & inform him that I have conferred with the Massachusetts Gentlemen on the regulation of the weights of Coins--they discover a chearfulness in joining in some measures; but what those measures are to be we have not agreed. I propose soon to write him at large on the Subjects of his long & very entertaining Letter. You will readily excuse me for not enlarging as I cannot tell you any thing besides what you will class under the heads of conjectures & prophecies.

  Dear Bland, Annapolis Feby. 24th. 1784  Are you & our dear Mrs. Bland frozen, torpid, or thaw'd during this unaccountably rigorous season. We have been blocked up here for near three months, with very little intelligence from your parts. The same reasons have renderd Congress very thin & frequently six states only represented so that very little business has been done. The acceptance of the cession from Virginia was this day rejected by two States against six, but I suppose it will be accepted when the representation is fuller.(1) Mr. Jefferson has nominated Dr. Maclurg as Secretary for foreign Affairs; from which you will judge what is the turn of the Delegation, which I presume will vote for his nomination, & the old trick be played over again with respect to a friend of Yours. Mr. Dana & Mr. Clymer are the others in nomination. But I beleive there will be no election.(2) The Minister of France was here for a few days, & then returnd to Philadelphia; He means to return to France as soon as the season will permit. His Successor is not yet announcd. Marbois is admitted as Consul-general, & 8 Consuls & Vice Consuls are appointed to reside in the principal trading Cities of the U.S. Col. Harmar has been detaind at N. York by the season & an accident of the Packet running aground when She coud go out. We have not yet heard of his having saild & there is little probability of the Ratification reaching Paris in time for the stipulated. Whether the British will take any advantage of this accident is a doubt not a little disagreable. I hope you have not sufferd by the Thaw that we learn has occasiond so much mischief in James & other Rivers. If we can get the principal business finishd Congress will adjourn in May, leaving a Committee of the States. Whether I shall then set my face north or south I know not. If the latter perhaps I shall pay my respects to you & my homage to Mrs. Bland. The Ladies here are very gracious to us, they are sociable & pleasing, some of them too pleasing rather to let our hearts rest short of desires which they are not disposd to gratify.

  Sir, Annapolis 24th Feby. 1784. In my letter of the 15th Jany.(1) I informed your Excellency of the ratification of the definitive Treaty, and the mode adopted by Congress forwarding those dispatches to our Commissioners at Paris for exchange. The French packet in which Colo Harmer goes had not sailed on the 7th Inst., in attempting to go out of the hook some days before the quantity of ice was so great, she missed stays and got aground on Governors Island; she has since got off and ready to proceed to sea as soon as the wind and weather will permit. Lieut Colo Franks is also at N York he intends going in the Edward Capt Couper bound to London. Your[s] of the 8th Decemr. directed to the Delegation came to hand only this day owing to the irregularity of the Southern post which has been almost Stopp'd by the great falls of snow and the severity of the season. There has been no mail from No Carolina since 25th Decbr. I cannot at present inform in what manner the Continen- FEBRUARY 24, 1784  tal Money is to be destroyed. I am sorry we have so small a proportion of our quota in the Treasury. The attention of Congress has been called to that subject, by a remonstrance from the State of Massachusetts Bay, requesting Congress to fix the rate of Depreciation at which it shall be sunk. The Citizens of that State having in their hands a large proportion of it, over and above their quota, want it fixed at a small depreciation: the business is in the hands of a Committee who have not yet reported.(2) Of the many requisitions for mony, not one, as yet has been comply'd with by our State, nor any Steps taken for that purpose, which will greatly increase our debt in the Acct. with the United States, as I understand each State is charged with its proportion of the requisition and interest thereon from the time on which it ought to be paid. I hope the Genl. Assembly at their annual meeting will do every thing in their power to expedite the settlement of our Accts. with the United States, as by that means the exertions of No Carolina will be best shewn, And the little attention she has paid to the requisitions of Congress for money in some measure accounted for or at least palliated. The necessity of complying with the recommendations of Congress of the 18th of April 1783 is so evident, that cant think it will meet with any opposition from our Legislature, it certainly is a mode by which we can pay our quota of the debt much easier than in any other way. I think the money that is required exclusive of the 5 per Ct. had better be raised by a Tax seperate and distinct from our State Tax, and intirely appropriated for that purpose. Your Excellency will please send forward to the Delegation, as soon as it can be obtained an account of the number of the White and Black Inhabitants of the State, distinguishing the free men from the Slaves as we are of opinion, it will be a means of reducing the quota of the State, which we think is at present too high. I have the Honour to be, Your Excellency's Most Obt Hum. Servt., Richd. D. Spaight. ""

  Dear Sir Annapolis Feb. 29. 1784. Your favor of the 23d. inst. came safely by the last post. Your correspondent of Charlestown who informed you so long ago that an accomodation had taken place between the Russians and Turks was a better prophet than historian. The fact [...] than I beleive, but there are hopes it is so [...] information from our ministers on this [...] tells me he has it from one who has [...] that by the mediation of France and [...] great sacrifices by the Turks, [...] for being so weak and defenc[eless...]cations, tho' the officers [...] by the 20th. of Ja[...] long blocked up by the [...] in time. Yet as we had ratified in good time, and the delay has been produced by accidents not under our controul, it does not furnish a justifiable cause of refusing the exchange. A ninth state appeared yesterday. But eight of the nine being represented by two delegates each, all important questions will require not only an unanimity of states, but of members, for which we have no reason to hope. I very much apprehend we shall be unable to get through even those which seem indispensable. I think it will be prudent immediately to define the powers of a committee of the states,(1) that if we are left in the lurch again as we have been, there may be some power to place at the head of affairs till the states can be made sensible of the necessity of sending on full delegations. I expect we shall execute our deed of cession tomorrow.(2) The Western country, instructions for foreign treaties, and the annual estimates will then be brought forward, to try what we can do on them. I am in hopes therefore my next may tell you what we have done, and not merely what we have to do, which, such is the present barrenness of the  FEBRUARY 29, 1784  times, is really the most copious source of information at this time. Mr. Adams and Mr. Jay have some how or other got themselves over to London. Their reception was not a kind one by any means and they must have [...] at this faux pas, as their friends here have been. [...] with my materials after wishing you much [...] the esteem with which I am Dr Sir [Yo]ur Friend & servt., Th. Jefferson P.S. Since the writing the above we receive in[for]mation from Philadelphia of the arrival of an English vessel bringing papers which say that Ld. North and Mr. Fox carried their E. India bill triumphantly by of the voices through the house of commons, but lost it in the Lords, whereon they resigned and that Mr. Pitt with his friends would come in. The Prince of Wales it is said voted against the bill and was reprimanded by the king. Since writing the above also an appointment of some importance (Commissioner for the Indn. treaty) is conferred by Congress on Genl. Clarke, who is either set out or in the moment of setting out Westwardly. As it is essential he should receive this immediately and I think his father lives near you will you be so good as to send it to him with a desire if the General be set out, but yet within reasonable reach that he will send an express after him.(3)  P.P.S. The president sending an express to Genl. Clarke (4) before the post sets out I have opened the letter and taken out his. It gives me an opportunity of informing you that Congress this day received a letter from the Marqs. Fayette of Dec. 265 confirming the removal of North and Fox, that it was effected by a maneuvre of the King himself and that Pitt and E. Temple would come in, also that the Turks and Russians will be quiet for a while.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Feby. 1784 (1) Your favor of the 5 ulto.(2) did not reach me till a few days since from the difficulty the severity of the season hath created in passage of the rivers. I am particularly happy to receive it as it promises to me in the office wh. I hold the aid of yr. age, judgment & experience. I have paid great attention to your reasoning & think that in two instances viz, the peace establishment & the seat for the residence of Congress it is conclusive. If no European power had possessions on the continent I shod. suppose the idea of a standing army wod. never have been brot. upon the carpet. The indian incursions or trade as you observe wod. more regularly come within the cognizance of the State expos'd or to derive advantage, from it. But the possessions of these powers & particularly of G. B. is a matter of more serious import. The  FEBRUARY, 1784  impolicy of N. York hath already thrown a considerable body of people into Nova Scotia & Canada in tracts at present uninhabited is certainly capable of maintaining extensive settlements. Many European countries in a higher northern latitude are thickly setled, & the lands of Canada are perhaps richer than those of the Swiss cantons, Denmark, Sweden or Russia. These provinces are also well timber'd & at the same time that the inhabitants promise to be an hardy & robust race of men give them all the advantages from their situation of a nursery for sea men, dock yards for building ships & a share in our carrying business. The court of London hath turn'd its attention to the Indies & proposes to attempt such arrangements as may compensate to the nation the loss of America. But what can G. B. promise from the Indies wh. she doth not now possess? If Colonies are establishd upon the footing we lately stood & emigration is encouragd how long will they be connected with the parent country, & will not such establishments wh. take the Indies out of the hands of the company induce the necessity of standing armies & respectable fleets to prevent insurrections & turn the tide of commerce into the bosom of the parent country & will not this expence be thrown upon the State and as the climate suits a dispotic govt. & the genl. in command may be popular with his troops, is it not rational to suspect he will seek the sovereignty himself? If these questions cod. be answer'd in the negative I think it will be granted that the possession of India will only prove a commercial advantage. The inhabitants of these provinces will have but little attachmt. to the parent country & will personally be never brought to add to its number or encrease its strength in any European operation. While this trade & govt. are in the possession of a compy. the nation is free from the expence of these troops or fleets; considering therefore all the relative circumstances I think it a doubtful question whethir this change wod. be of publick advantage while most certainly it wod. prove very materially injurious to the crown. The crown now has the advantage of the sale occasionally of the renewal of the charter to the compy. & of this it wod. of course be deprivd. I think therefore the conclusion viz. that the monopoly of the trade & expence of the govt. will remain with the compy. & that any arrangement the Ct. of London may make with respect to that country will only tend to create dependants on the crown & increase its influence in the parliamt without effecting any material change in the constitution of India. View the prospects of B. as we will in the East & I cannot see how in any event any arrangements can turn to any great national advantage. Will the population of India encrease the numbers of B. citizens? Will any eastern arrangmt. encrease the fleet or add to the army but to guard itself? I am therefore of opinion that if the Ct. of London occasion they will be cautious how they interpose in the affrs. of the East. I am therefore of opn. that the Ct. of London will still turn her attention to this continent in every consideration she  MARCH 1, 1784  may have in view to add to or to increase her national strength. Passion or folly may sometimes govern her councils but in time she will observe her error & attempt to correct the fault. I think as national advantages are to be deriv'd from it she will turn her attention to these provinces & there is a kind of energy in the natives of that country wh. is not to be found in the peasantry of any, of the monarchies of Europe. When any of the Countries are overstock'd, in France or Spn. the overplus turn beggars in the street or starve, but the people of Engld. seek a dwelling in foreign climes & in distant countries. I suppose therefore these provinces will prove a drain to the surplus of Citizens in Brittn. What will be their policy with respect to these provinces & whither they will extend to them the freedom of the B. constitution or Nation I cannot pretend to say. Be this as it may will it not [be] a desirable circumstance to us to prevl. on them to keep few or no troops in Canada & will not this be the proper subject for a convention betwn. us? But if they will not acceed to it I still think with you that the defence of the country shod. be thrown on the militia. ""

  Th. J. to Mr. Short Annapolis Mar. 1. 1784.  I am sorry my letter (1) found you so much indisposed, and still more so that it should have added to your sufferings. But you must learn to bear these things by always calculating on the possibility of a cross as well as pyle and having a plan of reserve to turn to by way of comfort. I can yet add nothing more on the subject. Nine states appeared on the floor to-day. But eight of them are represented by two members only, so that in every important question, as not only an unanimity of states, but an unanimity of members also will be requisite to carry propositions, we must expect to carry none, and that our time will be spent in proposing regulations, hearing one another a week on each, put them to the vote, and see them fall because one or two or more members are against them. We shall immediately try what we can do with the Western country (the deed for which was executed and accepted this day), the foreign arrangement, peace establishment &c. I see no reason yet to doubt the opinion I formerly gave you that there would be no {Ministers} kept {abroad}.(2) You ask an explanation of the ænigma of the book, appendix, and index. For fear you should not understand the cypher, or catch it's key I added that ænigmatical paragraph in hopes it might explain a subject to you who had some hint of it and not to any other who had not. To cure the fever it gave you however I will now observe that the book was a {minister} the appendix a {secretary to the embassy} and the index a {secretary} to the {minister}. There will certainly be no {appendix} and I question if there be a {book}. Of course there can then be no {Index} to it. If there be no {appendix} would {you} be the {Index} to the {book} supposing there should be one. However I still think a {consul} or a {resident} on a {low salary} will be the {highest grade}. Not a word has ever dropt yet from {Monro[e]}. I thank you for your attentions to P. Carr. I approve of Liberty hall because you do, without knowing what or where it is. Will you inform me on this head? Not that I would detain Peter, for I hope you have sent him there, but that I may write to him, to the master or manager whichever is most proper.

  Sir, duplicate Annapolis 1st March 1784, Ten OClk PM  Within this half hour I heard of the Conveyance by which I have the honour to Transmit this Letter to Your Excellency and that the bearer will leave Town at an early hour in the Morning. I immediately waited on my Colleague at his lodgings to consult with him on the subject of a joint Letter.(1) Not finding him at home I am obliged to address you Separately, but as we are without any advices from Your Excellency Since our Express by Mr. Dove of 25th of January,(2) The Delegation have nothing to communicate that I cannot fully inform you of. From the date of our joint Letter by the express Congress have continued in a very inactive State and thro the Indisposition of Members and the extreme Severity of the Winter at some times for a Week together have not been able to assemble Seven States. That season of Inactivity is I hope now intirely over a Gentleman having this day arrived from New Hampshire (3) by which means that State is represented and Nine States being on the floor we are once more enabled to proceed with the Important business of the Union. New York, Delaware and Maryland are however Still unrepresented tho' the Latter had elected no less than Six Delegates and we are actually Seated in the Capital of the State.(4) We flatter ourselves however that when the Spring opens we shall be able to assemble the whole of those States and if Georgia Cou'd be goaded forward Might for the first time Since the Completing the Confederation be a full Assembly of the States an event most devoutly to be wished. I feel pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the United States in Congress Assembled have this day received a Deed from the State of Virginia Conveying the Lands beyond the Ohio.(5) This has been a business long pending in Congress. The Conditions on which the  MARCH 1, 1784  United States wou'd receive a Cession of the Claims of Virginia were framed while the Congress Sat at Prince Ton and sent down to the State of Virginia. And that State having fully Concurred in and accepted of such Conditions did at their late session of Assembly by a Law Authorize and empower their Delegates in Congress to Convey the Lands alluded to. This important business was perfected on this day. South Carolina was divided on this Vote. My Colleague having uniformly opposed the receiving of the Cession; tho' the Gentlemen lately our Colleagues (6) were I believe both decidedly of opinion with the Measure as likely to produce a Valuable fund for satisfying the Army and public Creditors. I am sorry to inform You that Colonels Harmer and Franks were prevented from sailing with the ratification of the Treaty till the 19th Ultimo,(7) so that 'tis impossible those instruments Can be in time for Exchange, however as the greatest good faith has been observed on our part and nought but the Act of God has prevented the ratification getting to Europe in Time. I trust no ill will result to the union from the delay. By advices from our Ministers late in November we can assure Your Excellency and the State that the Caisse d'escompte at Paris again goes on with payment and will doubtless survive the difficulties the Institution lately laboured under.(8) I am happy to have it in my power to inform Your Excellency that my Colleague is greatly mended in his health. We look with longing eyes and a painful anxiety for the arrival of Mr. Dove by whom we trust we shall be favoured with the fullest advices both public and private. The Season been uncommonly Severe here nor has the ice at all given Way as yet. The Cattle throughout this state have suffered greatly, 'tis a favourable report of the fact to say one half have perished--an exceeding short Crop of Corn and little or no fodder or Hay the last Summer from the long & excessive droughts that prevailed throughout this State and Virginia has occasioned this misfortune. I am with great Respect & regard, Sir, Your Excellency's most obliged & obedt Servt, Jacob Read ""

  Sir Annapolis Mar. 3. 1784. Mr Hardy's illness & Colo. Mercer's absence deranged the order in which the office of corresponding member was to pass; so that Mr. Lee exercised it for January, Colo. Monroe for Feb. and Mr. Hardy takes it for the present month. I mention this that my own correspondence as an individual may not at any time be mistaken as having passed the sanction of the delegation. On receiving the act of assembly for the Western cession,(1) our delegation agreed on the form of a deed; we then delivered to Congress a copy of the act, and the form of the deed we were ready to execute whenever they should think proper to declare they would accept it. They referred the act & deed to a committee, who reported the act of assembly to comport perfectly with the propositions of Congress and that the deed was proper in it's form, and that Congress ought to accept the same. On the question to agree to the Committee 8 states being present, Jersey was in the negative & S. Carolina & Pennsylva. divided (being represented each by (2) members). Of course there were 5 ayes only & the report fell. We determined on consultation that our proper duty was to be still, having declared we were ready to execute, we would leave it to them to come forward and tell us they were ready to accept. We medled not at all therefore, & shewed a perfect indifference. N. Hampshire came to town which made us 9 states. A member proposed that we should exe- MARCH 3, 1784  cute the deed and lay it on the table, which after what had been done by Congress would be final, urging the example of N. York which had executed their deed, laid it on the table, where it remained 18 months before Congress accepted it. We replied, no, if these lands are not offered for sale the ensuing spring, they will be taken from us all by adventurers. We will not therefore put it out of our power by the execution of a deed to sell them ourselves, if Congress will not. A member from Rhode island (2) then moved that Congress should accept. Another from Jersey (3) proposed as an amendment a proviso that it should not amount to an acknowlegement of our right. We told them we were not authorised to admit any conditions or provisoes, that their acceptance must be simple, absolute & unqualified or we could not execute. On the question there were 6 ayes, Jersey no, S. Carolina & Pennsylva. divided. The matter dropped & the house proceeded to other business. About an hour after the dissenting Pennsylvanian (4) asked & obtained leave to change his no, into aye. The vote then passed & we executed the deed. We have desired an exemplification of it under the seal of the states which we shall transmit you by the post if no safer opportunity occurs. This shews the wisdom of the assembly in not tacking any new conditions, which would certainly have defeated their accomodating intentions. We have just received from the Superintendant of finance a report of the paiments made and the arrears still due on the requisition of Octob. 30. 1781. for 8 millions of dollars.(5) This statement comes down to Jan. 1, 1784. paid. due Doll.

Harmer with the ratification of the Definitive treaty which was executed in Congress Jan. 14 got on board the French packet at N.   York on the 20th of Jan. Colo. Franks took his passage in another vessel a few days after. Neither sailed till the 17th of Feb., being blocked up by the ice.(6) They have certainly then not got to Paris to exchange them this day as had been stipulated. In right this can make no difference. We executed the ratification in time, and it's passage across the Atlantic was prevented by circumstances not under our controul. The accomodation of the Turks and Russians, leaving Europe in Peace and France of course at liberty, keeps us safe. This accomodation is said to have been effected by the interposition of France & Prussia. This does not come from our ministers, from whom we have had no late intelligence on this subject, but is told me by Monsr. Marbois who sais he had it from good information. We are still further insured against any ill effect from this accident if the news of the day be true. An English vessel, arrived at N. York, brings papers which say that Ld. North & Mr. Fox carried their E. India bill triumphantly by 2/3 of the voices through the house of commons, but lost it in the lords, whereon they resigned; and that Mr Pitt & his friends would be at the head of the administration. The Prince of Wales voted against the bill & received a reprimand from the king. So far the papers. The change would be fortunate for us, as Ld. North's hostility is notorious, and Pitt rather well disposed to us. The movements of the K. of Prussia to emancipate the navigation of the Vistula, and of the emperor to free that of the Scheld, do not I beleive threaten the peace of Europe. On the contrary they indicate that they have no great work on hand. This assertion then of the natural right of the inhabitants of the upper part of a river to an innocent passage through the country below is rather pleasing to us. It tends to establish a principle favourable to our right of navigating the Missisipi. We are now engaged in making an estimate of the expences of the current year. It appears that the Commissioners sent to the several states to settle their accounts add so unreasonable a proportion to the expences of the Finance department, that it is my opinion Congress will recall them after some not very distant day. I mention this that your Excellency may keep an eye over the progress of the state-settlement with Mr. Turner & push it unremittingly to avoid the being obliged to send the vouchers, accounts &c. to Philadelphia for such parts as shall not be completed before the recall. I have the honour to be with sentiments of very high respect & esteem Your Excellency's Most obedt. & most humble servt., Th. Jefferson ""

  Sir Annapolis 3d. March 1784.(1) It is disagreeable to us to inform your Excellency, that no Determination hath been yet taken with respect to the Memorial concerning the Brigantine Luzannah.(2) Nine States are now present, but so much important business had Accumilated, & is now necessary to be compleated without delay, that it will be impossible to bring any Matter, (which doth not relate to the United States at large) under consideration, & until those great National Objects are provided for; these we hope from the Dispatch, which hath already been given to public Matters, since Congress have been competent to the business of Nine States, will soon be compleated, so far as to Admit of matters, relating to the Individual States, to be considered. It will be our care to lose no time, in Obtaining the earliest decession on this Question, and in Transmitting the same to your Excellency. We are authorized to inform you, that on the first instant the Delegates from Virginia, executed & Deliver'd a Deed to the United States, Agreeable to an Act of that state, of all their Right and Title of said state, to the Lands North-westward of the River Ohio--and Congress are now employed, in making the necessary arrangements for a Treaty with the Indians, & purchase of Lands from them; have chose General Clark of Virginia, General Green of Rhode Island, Mr. Higginson of Massachusetts, Mr. Woolcot of Connecticut, & Colo. Butler of Pensylvania, Commissioners for that purpose.(3) It is proposed that as soon as the Treaty & purchase shall be compleated, to lay out that Western Territory into states, and to Open a Land Office, for the sale of some part--and the proceeds to be applied to the discharge of the public Debt. Congress have also under Consideration Instructions to their Ministers abroad for negotiating Treaties of Commerce with European Powers.

  My dear Sir Annapolis 4th March 1784 I have been prevented by Indisposition from answering your obliging Favour of Decr & Jany, as it is dated--perhaps I shall not be able to consider at this Time, with particular Attention the important Subjects of your Letter, but I will touch on them generally, after mentioning a Matter, in which I flatter myself You will consider your Services indispensible. You are appointed a Commissioner of Indian affairs,(1) to negotiate a Treaty of peace, & Cession of a large Tract of Territory, comprehended in that lately ceded by Virginia. I presume you have heard that that State closed with the propositions of Congress, in Consequence whereof her Delegates have this Week executed the Deed. Your Brother Commissioners are General Greene from Rhode Island, General Woolcot from Connecticut, Colo Butler from Pennya & General Clarke from Virginia; three of whom are to form a Quorum; & all former appointments are abolished. This is a great Acquisition, considering the Attempts strenuously urged to throw the Business into the Hands of the former Commissioners. I hope You will not defeat our Exertions, to have a fair & beneficial Treaty for the publick, by declining the Office; to which We shall annex a Salary of, I presume, not less than 6 nor more than 8 Dollars per Day (2)--the 10th of April is appointed for your first Meeting at N York. I am happy to find you approve of the conciliatory Measures that have been adopted for removing Jealousies, & establishing a Confidence between the Extremities of the Union. I have a long Time been aware of the extensive commercial System, individually pursued to extend Influence. This must be opposed in the same Way, that has been found expedient, with Respect to the first Bank--the Monopolies which would have ensued, will be prevented by forming new Banks, & the same must be done by forming an opposition in the mercantile Line. It will be no difficult Matter for Massachusetts to begin, & extend their System thro the Continent. Our adjournment to Annapolis has certainly had a good Effect: the Object of the Inhabitants here is altogether pleasure; business is no part of their System, & of Consequence, Congress are altogether free from external Influence. But I am of opinion, that the Decisions respecting two fOEderal Towns will be again agitated; & if they only exist in Idea, untill We have effectually opposed the despotic System so  MARCH 4, 1784  warmly pursued to destroy the Liberties of our Country, they will have answered a great, & political purpose. I am clearly convinced in my own Mind of the Rectitude of the Intentions of the Officers in general, respecting the Cincinnati. I have a great Opinion of those vertuous Men, & am very desirous to reward their Services. It is well known our Treasury, is, like those of most Nations after a War, much deranged; & the professed Design of that Institution, is to secure the payment of the publick Debt. Formed for such a purpose, the officers may by degrees be sensibly drawn into Measures; which they would now shudder at the thot of, & which I have no Doubt will be the result, unless, this political Monster is crushed in Embryo. It is well known that Despotic Governments, & every Subject thereof, have a natural Hatred to republican Governments & all who support them. This indeed may subside, in Cases of an accidental union of Interests, whilst the Exertions of both are necessary for obtaining their common Object; but when this is attained; the inherent natural Aversion will again operate & ought to be guarded against. By the best Information I have learnt, that the Change of Government in Sweden, was effected by the C____t d' V____s at P____s. He laid the plan there, & it was carried without the Loss of Blood. Is it not probable then, from the Information We have, \""that the plan of the Cincinnati, was communicated to our Commissioners in Europe, before they knew that it was on Foot in America, by some of the N____y of F____e,(3) and that notwithstanding the Attempts made to persuade our Commissioners of the Utility of the Measure, they disapproved therof;\"" I say is it not probable, from these & other Circumstances that this baneful Weed, is, as Burke expresses it, of an exotic Growth? but whether foreign or Domestic, let us trace its Consequences. G____ W____n, I am well informed, has to my great astonishment, written a Circular Letter,(4) directing a Meeting of the representative Officers, of the State Cincinnatis, in May next, at Philadelphia, which will be the first Meeting of the Cincinnati Congress--in Gods Name, may it be the last. The G____l in his last address, if I recollect right, to the Army urged them to use their Influence to increase the powers of Congress, or in other Words to alter the fOEderal Government. It is not improbable then that this will be an object of Deliberation with the cincinnati Congress. It cannot be denied, that if the Meeting thereof is permitted to pass unnoticed, they may agitate that or any other Subject, & that they cannot fail in carrying any continental Measure which they may undertake & conduct with prudence. No other precautions are necessary, than Gentleness & a little patience in the Beginning, & perseverance in the prosecution-- all which are habitual Accomplishments of military Characters. When any plan or object is agreed on in the Cincinnati Congress, it will of course be communicated to the Cincinnati Conventions in each state, & the Members thereof, who have been trained to   Subordination, without which they never could have attained such Reputation as they merit in their military profession, will undoubtedly consider themselves rather as an executive than a deliberative Body, & readily pledge themselves to carry the Decissions of their Congress into Effect, more especially as they honestly suppose the only object is to obtain payment of their arrearages & Commutation. The Convention being thus prepared with the Arrets of their Congress, will return to their Towns & Counties, & use their Influence with the Representatives & Senators of their Acquaintance to promote the Measure whether to increase the power of Congress, or for other objects in the Legislatures of the several States. If this Measure should not be successful, the Towns & Counties may be called together, & the influence of the Members of the State Cincinnati, which will not only extend to all the Soldiers of the late Army, but likewise to particular Friends & Acquaintance, may be exerted to produce Instructions to the Representatives & to accomplish the End proposed in the Legislature; & the same Influence, at the next Election of Members for the Legislature, may be & undoubtedly will be used (successfully in many Instances) to send the Members of the Cincinnati as Representatives or Senators to the General Assembly--in each State this Body should consist of a tenth part of those Members, whose object is fixed, & whose Exertions will be incessantly exerted to attain it, their Address, Ingenuity, perseverance, & prowess, will undoubtedly, if We consider the Manner of conducting Business in such Bodies, secure them Success. There may be some little Difficulty in the Beginning, but this will daily decrease; Solertia omnia vincit.(5) We have only reasoned on the presumption of a tenth part of the Members of the General Assemblies, being of the Cincinnati, but the probability is that the proportion will in a short Time be much greater, & the Influence of Consequence increased. The Assemblies being thus prepared, your Republican Congress will of course be soon filled with Members of the Cincinnati, having already five of this Order, & the fOEderal powers will be enlarged. Whatever is proposed in the Cincinnati Congress, under such Circumstances, will be immediately adopted by the republican Congress & ratified by the Legislatures; & then you may bid adieu, a lasting & final adieu, to republican principles. You would probably see the government of the united States first consisting of three Branches, under the humble Denominations of Governor General, Council & House, but with all the powers of King, Lords & Commons; & after a short Time you may be told that to support the Dignity of Government, it is necessary to take these Titles, & that no Disadvantage can result from the Measure, because it may be adopted without any additional Powers, or with such an addition as is of no great Consequence. Thus my Friend may We loose the advantages of a severe Conflict, which after an amazing expence of the Blood & Treasure of our Country, has so happily terminated in its indepen-  dence. If it be said that G____l W____n has given us too strong proofs of his patriotism, to admit of a Jealousy that he would permit such an Event; the Answer is easy & natural. It may be in his power to put such a Machine in Motion, but not to stop its progress. But admitting he could, is it certain that he would have such a Disposition? He is subject to Errors, as well as another person, & finding himself at the Head of a Society, which are attached by every Tye of Friendship to his person, & for a long Time been subject to his Nod; if he supposes the publick Interest may be promoted by a Change of Government, is it not probable that he will attempt it; & is not the undertaking such, that if once made, it must either terminate successfully or in his Ruin. Moreover, when a Crown is in View, who will answer for the patriotism of any Man? Who dare be responsible for it? If any person is so unwise as to offer himself a pledge, for the self denial of another to a Throne, or of a great Number of enterprizing Men to peerdoms, under such powerful Temptations, that person may be generous in his Disposition, but I will venture to pronounce him in point of Sagacity, as being unfit, & unqualified for a Statesman. It is well known, that altho a Monarch being in Alliance with a republick, if he has artful Ministers, may clog & embarrass the Measures thereof: but it is not so easy to carry points in a popular assembly as to defeat them. It is therefore for the Interest of a certain Court, in order to make America subserve their purposes, to effect a Change of Government; & I have not the least Doubt, that, if an Attempt should be made to accomplish this, not only Money, but Troops of a foreign power, commanded by officers thereof who are honored with the Title of Cincinnati, would be furnished, to assist in the accomplishment of a plan, so evidently calculated as it would appear to them, to promote the Happiness of America. What a Situation should We then be in? What Rivers of Blood would thus flow from the harmless Fountain of the Cincinnati? If it be said that all these Apprehensions, exist only in Imagination, I answer, that it is now in the power of America to prevent their having any other Existence; but can any person be sure that she will have this power long, if she suffers such a System, directly in the Face of the Confederation, to be formed & carryed on? Is it not clearly Imperium in Imperio, & will it not be the only Imperium soon? Was there ever a more open, & unconstitutional Measure than this Institution, pursued in any Government, since the use of the Term was known? Surely not; & I flatter myself, it will be soon annihilated. Besides the Dangerous Tendency pointed out, it is very extraordinary, that the military Gentlemen should be so vain as to suppose they have all the Merit of effecting the revolution. Very few of them were concerned in the early opposition to the Measures of the british Ministry, & the Opposers thereof risked more, or at least, as much, as any Citizens of America, whether civil or military. Indeed those Who have conducted the civil Departments have been pro-  scribed, whilst the Military Gentlemen were proferred pardons; & the Fatigues & Hardships of the first have been very great altho undoubtedly exceeded by those of the Camp. Again have the Militia no part of the Honor of this Revolution? I will venture to say, that without them We should have been inevitably, a conquered people, & that they would have defended this Country if the Army had been unfortunately cut off. Can it be supposed, that ten or fifteen thousand veterans would have defended the Country, & that 500,000 Militia would have resigned their Liberties? Surely not. If a Monarch looses his army he is undone, but the loss of a republican Army, generally produces Exertions that furnish double or treble the Number. Indeed, I should not have objected to the Army's having all the Honor of the Revolution, had they assumed it in a Manner not dangerous to the Liberties of America. To render their plan successful, the Men of Influence, are to be honored with the Dignity of Cincinnati for Life, thro'out the States, & thus the Cincinnati, are to be strengthened. But how extraordinary the Measure, that the Officers of the Army who derived their Honor from the only true fountain, the Great Council of the united States, should now become the fountain itself. This shews in some Degree What Effects may be expected from the ambitious principles that have given Birth to this Brat of Despotism. I shall not mention the Influence which the Body would further acquire, by a Connection with the Treasury, & the Officers of the great Departments of Congress; for the latter of which, military Gentlemen are Candidates, & shall only observe, that the most Effectual Mode of stopping the progress of the Cincinnati plan, will be, for the Towns to assemble on the Occasion & instruct their Representatives to discountenance it in the Legislature, & to publish their Resolves: at the same Time requesting the officers within their Districts, to disavow the Institution, or in Case of Refusal, to inform them, they cannot expect the Suffrages of their Countrymen, for the civil offices of Government in future.(6) We have nine States on the Floor of Congress, & Monday next is assigned for our foreign, which altogether relate to our commercial Concerns. We are very desirous of seeing Mr Dana, & shall be prepared to enquire into the Cause of his Return. The foreign Books & Files have been locked, untill within a Day or two, but are now under the Care of an under Secretary. To accomplish this I had a warm Conflict & put on the Journals a Motion, shewing the extraordinary Detention of those Documents. But am happy at any Rate to accomplish the purpose.(7) The Financier proposes to resign, he hopes next Month, & We shall propose agreable to Instructions to put the Treasury in Commission. The Committee for reducing the civil amongst other propositions have reported one to abolish the Office of assistant Financier.  Pray send me a particular Account of the Success of your Bank--Adieu my dear Sir, believg Me Yours sincerely, G.

But as I cannot enter upon all these points at once I must beg you will inform me, where I am to begin; & how Minute a detail will be agreeable to you--& perhaps some future letter may gratify your wishes. Our Situation here is tolerably agreeable, will be much more so, when the severity of the Season abates & we can take more exercise on Foot or horseback.

I sent you an a/c of 46/5 lawful pd for the Dinah which I presume you have stoppd. Pray inform me whether Robinson is to be charged with any Part, & what of the 28.0.4.

It will be also best not to mention any thing relative to Colo Johonnot.

I have not received any Letter from You since I left Massachusetts, except that above mentioned, so that if two were sent by the post, they must have been intercepted.

He soon left Town & I have neither heard from nor seen him since. As he expressed a Desire of paying the Note probably he will be here before I leave the place & make payment. If not, I wish to know whether You would have the Note left with one of my Collegues, or of your Delegates, who will probably continue on a Committee of the States, should Congress adjourn as they now propose in May next?

The Irish Volunteers are much discontented that no mention has been made of Ireland in the commercial treaty forming between England & America. They insist on the priviledge of concluding a seperate treaty of Commerce with us. How this will terminate, it is difficult to conjecture, but as their claims seem to enlarge in proportion to the concessions made by the Crown, I think we may conclude that they are ripe for a revolution. A letter from the Marquis Fayette dated the 26th Decbr. gives us information that Mr Fox & Lord North have resignd, and are succeeded by Mr Pitt & the Earl of Temple.

We received dispatches from Europe yesterday, by capt Barney. There is no news but in one from Dr. Franklin of Dec. 25. and another from the Marquis Fayette of Dec. 26. The Doctor tells us only of the movements of our ministers, that Mr. Laurence was about sailing from England for America, Mr. Adams about setting out from England for the Hague, and Mr. Jay at Bath. He gives a picture of the disposition of England towards us; he observes that tho' they have made peace with us, they are not reconciled to us nor to the loss of us. He calls to our attention the numerous royal progeny to be provided for, the military education giving to some of them, the ideas in England of distraction among ourselves, that the people here are already fatigued with their new governments, the possibility of circumstances arising on the Continent of Europe which might countenance the wishes of Gr. Britain to recover us, and from thence inculcates a useful lesson to cement the friendships we possess in Europe. The Marquis tells us the Turks & Russians will be kept apart for awhile, probably for another year, but that they must in the end come to decision. That Mr. Fox & Ld. North were both out of the ministry, & this by a maneuvre of the king's, who got them compromitted fairly with their E. India bill, & contrived to get it rejected in the Lords; that Mr. Pitt & E. Temple would come in. The Marquis himself will sail for America in the spring.

I was not in Congrass when the petition of Butler and others & the letter from the Governor of Connecticut were first read,(4) nor did I arrive untill the Committie to whom they had been referred had made report and Congrass was ready to Come to a decision. Upon first hearing the Business I did not like it and was dissposed to give it all the oposition in my power specially as I prceived by a part of governor Trumbull's letter that the State of Connecticut was not satisfied with the Judgement given and thire was some expressions which seemed to intimate that they wantd it set asside and a new trail granted. But as the Delegates of that State disavowed such intention and moved for excepunging that part of the report which referred to the exceptionable part of the letter and only insisted on the right of the petitioners, and as that right was founded on the articles of Confederation, I acquiesed and left my collegues who had heard the matter from the beginning to give the vote of the state, I was the easier induced to observe this Conduct as upon examining more attentively the articles of Confederation I was perswaded that the granting the prayer of the petitioners and ordreing the appointment of this Court was a Confirmation of the Judgement of the Court at Trenton which decided the jurisdiction, For it appeard to me that the Court to decide upon the private right of Soil Coud not be apointed nor have any right to sit or act unless it was taken for granted that the jurisdiction was previously and finally adjudged and Determined. I am sensible the appointment of this Court may be attended with inconvenies, But as it is founded on the articles of Confederation and a Constitutional law of the United States, they ought to be submitted to and I apprehend it would be very dangerous to liberty if those who have only the power of appointing a Court shoud assum an arbitrary right of Judgeing whether the suitors were intitled to the Benefit of the Court. This in my opinion only belongs to the Court and I am perswaded the Counicl employed by the Claimants under Pennsyvania will take Care that none but such as have a Clear right be admitted to the Benifit of the Court in question. I am glad to hear Mr Wilson is appointed a Delegate and that he means to serve. Thire are many matters now Comeing before Congrass which are of the greatest importance to the whole union as well as to evry individual State, I therefore sincerely wish if he is not already set out on his journey that he would hasten here as soon as possible and I am the more desirous of this as I should be glad of his ad-  vice before we take any step conformable to the instruction given and to have his assistance if the assembly shall Continue to think such steps necssarry.

  Sir, Annapolis March 12th, 1784. Agreeably to my expectations expressed in my last Letter, N. Hampshire, N. Jersey & Delaware have lately arrived: and ten States are now represented in Congress. N. York, Maryland & Georgia are the only delinquent States; & the two former of these are daily expected. An estimate for a new requisition on the States is prepared by a Grand Committee, & will be soon reported to Congress.(1) This requisition will provide for intrest on the domestic debt to the 1t day of the present year--on the Foreign debt, to the 1t day of the year 1785--for the expences of the civil List, &c. of the present year--& for Mr. Morris's anticipations & all arrearages of unfunded debts, as the phrase is--And will amount to about four & half millions Dollars. It is proposed to call for this Sum as part of the requisition of Nov. 2d, 1781, for 8 millions. This Sum being added to the payments made on that requisition Dec. 31, 1783 amounts to six millions Dollars, or three quarters thereof: So that all these purposes can be answered & two millions of that requisition, as well as the requisition of October 18, 1782, for two millions more remain untouched, & subject to future appropriation--and which if paid will answer the public demands 'till betwixt 1786 & 1787. I have the Satisfaction to enclose copy of the final acceptance of the Virginia cession of claim to Land North-west of the river Ohio on paper No. 1. The printed paper No. 2 contains a report of a Committee appointed to prepare a plan for the temporary government of the western territory.(2) As this is a Subject of great magnitude it might perhaps be useful to suffer copies of this report to be dispersed: & as it is not probable that it will be soon acted upon, there will be opportunity for your delegates to profit by the remarks & strictures of their friends. For my own part, I can say with great truth, that I wish to be informed of the sentiments of my friends; & to govern myself, in all material points, by the voice of my Constituents. That nothing might remain unattempted on the part of Congress to obtain further cessions of western claims; as well as to turn those already obtained to the best advantage I have thought it my duty to make the two following motions-- MARCH 12, 1784  1t. That a Committee be appointed to consider & report what further measures are proper on the part of Congress in order to obtain further cessions of claims to western territory. 2. That a Committee be appointed to devise & report the most eligible means of disposing of such part of the western country as may be obtained from the natives by the proposed Treaty--and the regulations for opening a Land-office. These Committees are appointed, but have not yet reported.(3) Five Commissioners, namely, General Greene of our State, General Clarke, of Virginia, General Butler of Pennsylvania, General Wolcot, of Connecticutt, & Mr. Stephen Higginson, late a delegate in Congress, of Massachusetts, are appointed to hold & conclude Treaties of peace with the Indians, under the instructions transmitted in my last Letter.(4) These Commissioners are to meet at N. York on the 10th of next month to form their arrangements & to proceed on the business as soon as possible.(5) Great reliance is made on General Greene, on the part especially of the circumscribed States, who are interested in obtaining large cessions of the Indians. I hope those who have influence with the General will use it to induce him to accept this appointment. It is honorable, if not lucrative: Many honorable Gentlemen were in competition for it. The Committee for reducing the civil List have reported a reduction of about 20,000 dollars per An[nu]m at present: & others to take place at a future day. This report has not been acted upon.(6) So many members of Congress (I am sorry to say it) have friends to serve, or expect appointments themselves in the civil List--as Ministers, Secretaries, Consuls or, vice-consuls abroad--or as Ministers, Secretaries, Collectors, Receivers, or Commissioners at home that it is a difficult thing to prevent augmenting the civil List, & next to impossible to reduce it. I say that this has been the case in former Congresses (I mean to guard against reflecting on the present) and it may be the case in future. I have never enjoyed a better State of health for so long a time in any period of my life than I have, through the divine blessings since I left home. Had the States met punctually at the time of adjournment to this place the public business might have been finished by this time. It is now going on very well; I hope Congress will adjourn by May at the farthest for the Summer season. Please to give my dutiful respects to the Hon. the General Assembly & assure them of my best endeavours to serve them. With the most perfect consideration I have the Honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient & very hble Servt. David Howell P.S. I have also enclosed a paper No. 3 containing extracts from Letters from Dr. Franklin; which I wish to have laid also before the Genl. Assembly.  ""

  Sir Annapolis 12th March 1784 Your Letter of the 21st of January to the Delegation was received ten or twelve days ago (1)--the ratification of the definitive Treaty was forwarded to you by the secretary of Congress.(2) Congress have not as yet passed any resolve or recommendation in consequence of our trade to the British West Indies, being prohibited, in other than British bottoms. I have not seen the Virginia Law, you mentiond, respecting the British trade;(3) the assembly of this state at their last session passed an act laying a duty of 5 per Cent over and above the duties paid by other nations, upon all British goods imported in British bottoms, and five shillings per Ton on all British shipping(4)--and have also authorised their delegates to Congress to agree to, and ratify an additional article or articles to the confederation, for vesting the united states in Congress assembled with sufficient power to regulate the trade of the united states; which shall be in force & binding on them as soon as the other States have ratified the same. On Saturday last arrived the Washington, Capt. Barney, from France, by her we recd. Letters from Doctor Franklin as late as the 25th December of which the following are extracts.(5) \""The affairs of Ireland are unsettled, the Parliament & Voluntiers at variance; the latter are uneasy, that in the late negotiation for a Treaty of Commerce between England and america, the British Ministry had made no mention of Ireland, and they seem to desire a seperate Treaty between america and that Kingdom.\"" \""With respect to the British Court, we should I think be constantly on our guard, and impress strongly on our minds, that tho', it has made peace with us, it is not in truth reconciled either to us, or the loss of us; but still flatters itself with hopes, that some change in the affairs of Europe, or some division among ourselves may afford them an opportunity of recovering their dominion, punishing those who have  MARCH 12, 1784  most offended, and securing our future dependence. It is easy to see by the general turn of the Ministerial newspapers; (light things indeed, as straws and feathers but like them they shew which way the wind blows,) and by the malignant improvements their Ministers make in all the foreign Courts of every little accident or dissention among us; the rest of a few soldiers in Philadelphia, the resolves of some Town-meetings, the reluctance to pay taxes &c &c all which are exagerated to represent our Governments as so many anarchies, of which the People themselves are weary, the Congress as having lost its influence being no longer respected; I say it is easy to see from this conduct, that they bear us no good-will, and that they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine. They have too a numerous royal progeny to provide for, some of whom are educated in the military line. In these circumstances we cannot be too careful to preserve the friendship we have acquired abroad and the union we have established at home, to secure our credit by a punctual discharge of our obligations of every kind, and our reputation by the wisdom of our Concils: since we know not how soon we may have a fresh occasion for friends, for credit & for reputation.\"" As I make no doubt but the attention of the General assembly to the restoration of the property of the refugees, in consequence of the 5th article of the definitive Treaty; I think it my duty to transmit to your Excellency Copies of two Letters which passed between our Commissioners & the British Commissioners previous to the signing of the provisional articles.(6) It plainly appears from them that the restoration of the property of refugees, or compensation for the same was never intended to be made by our Commissioners, nor expected by the British.

12539,dg021324,1784,Thomas Jefferson to George Washington,"""
 Thomas Jefferson to George Washington Dr. Sir Annapolis Mar. 15. 1784 Since my last nothing new has occurred. I suppose the crippled state of Congress is not new to you. We have only 9 states present, 8 of whom are represented by two members each, and of course, on all great questions not only an unanimity of states but of members is necessary, an unanimity which never can be obtained on a matter of any importance. The consequence is that we are wasting our time & labour in vain efforts to do business. Nothing less than the presence of 13 states represented by an odd number of delegates will enable us to get forward a single capital point. The deed for the cession of Western territory by Virginia was executed & accepted on the 1st instant.(1) I hope our country will of herself determine to cede still further to the meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway. Further she cannot govern; so far is necessary for her own well being. The reasons which call for this boundary (which will retain all the waters of the Kanhaway) are 1. that within that are our lead mines. 2. This river rising in N. Carola. traverses our whole latitude and offers to every part of it a channel for navigation & commerce to the Western country: but 3. it is a channel which can not be opened but at immense expence and with every facility which an absolute power over both shores will give. 4. This river & it's waters forms a band of good land passing along our whole frontier, and forming on it a barrier which will be strongly seated. 5. For 180 miles beyond these waters is a mountainous barren which can never be inhabited & will of course form a safe separation between us & any other state. 6. This tract of country lies more convenient to receive it's government from Virginia than from any other state. 7. It will preserve to us all the upper parts of Yohogany & Cheat rivers within which much will be to be done to open these which are the true doors to the Western commerce. The union of this navigation with that of the Patowmac is a subject on which I mentioned that I would take the liberty of writing to you. I am sure it's value and practicability are both well known to you. This is the moment however for seizing it if ever we mean to have it. All the world is becoming commercial. Was it practicable to keep our new empire separated from them we might indulge ourselves in speculating whether commerce contributes to the happiness of mankind. But we cannot separate ourselves from them. Our citizens have had too full a taste of the comforts furnished by the arts & manufactures to be debarred the use of them. We must then in our own defence endeavor to share as large a portion as we can of this modern source of wealth & power. That offered to us from the Western country is under a competition between the Hudson, the Patomac & the Missisipi itself. Down the last will pass all heavy commodities. But the navigation through the gulf of Mexico is so dangerous, & that up the Missisipi so difficult & tedious, that it is not probable that European merchandize will return through that channel. It is most likely that flour, lumber & other heavy articles will be floated on rafts which will be themselves an article of sale as well as  MARCH 15, 1784  their loading, the navigators returning by land or in light batteaux. There will therefore be a rivalship between the Hudson & Patowmac for the residue of the commerce of all the country Westward of L. Erie, on the waters of the lakes, of the Ohio & upper parts of the Missisipi. To go to N. York, that part of the trade which comes from the lakes or their waters must first be brought into L. Erie. So also must that which comes from the waters of the Missisipi, and of course must cross at some portage into the waters of the lakes. When it shall have entered L. Erie, it must coast along it's Southern shore on account of the number & excellence of it's harbours, the Northern, tho' shortest, having few harbours, & these unsafe. Having reached Cayahoga, to proceed on to N. York will be 970 miles from thence & five portages, whereas it is but 430 miles to Alexandria, if it turns into the Cayahoga & passes through that, Big beaver, Ohio, Yohogany (or Monongalia & Cheat) & Patowmac, & there are but two portages. For the trade of the Ohio or that which shall come into it from it's own waters or the Missisipi, it is nearer to Alexandria than to New York by 730 miles, and is interrupted by one portage only. Nature then has declared in favour of the Patowmac, and through that channel offers to pour into our lap the whole commerce of the Western world. But unfortunately the channel by the Hudson is already open & known in practice; ours is still to be opened. This is the moment in which the trade of the West will begin to get into motion and to take it's direction. It behoves us then to open our doors to it. I have lately pressed this subject on my friends in the General assembly, proposing to them to endeavor to have a tax laid which shall bring into a separate chest from five to ten thousand pounds a year, to be employed first in opening the upper waters of the Ohio & Patowmac, where a little money and time will do a great deal, leaving the great falls for the last part of the work. To remove the idea of partiality I have suggested the propriety & justice of continuing this fund till all the rivers shall be cleared successively. But a most powerful objection always arises to propositions of this kind. It is that public undertakings are carlessly managed and much money spent to little purpose. To obviate this objection is the purpose of my giving you the trouble of this discussion. You have retired from public life. You have weighed this determination & it would be impertinence in me to touch it. But would the superintendance of this work break in too much on the sweets of retirement & repose? If they would, I stop here. Your future time & wishes are sacred in my eye. If it would be only a dignified amusement to you, what a monument of your retirement would it be! It is one which would follow that of your public life and bespeak it the work of the same great hand. I am confident that would you either alone or jointly with any persons you think proper be willing to direct this business, it would remove the only objection the weight of which I apprehend.(2) Tho' the tax should not   come in till the fall, it's proceeds should be anticipated by borrowing from some other fund to enable the work to be begun this summer. When you view me as not owning, nor ever having a prospect of owning one inch of land on any water either of the Patowmac or Ohio, it will tend to apologize for the trouble I have given you of this long letter, by shewing that my zeal in this business is public & pure. The best atonement for the time I have occupied you will be not to add to it longer than while I assure you of the sincerity & esteem with which I have the honour to be Dr. Sir, Your most obedient & most humble servt, Th. Jefferson P.S. The hurry of time in my former letter prevented my thanking you for your polite and friendly invitation to Mount Vernon. I shall certainly pay my respects there to Mrs. Washington and yourself with great pleasure whenever it shall be in my power. ""

  Dr. Sir.

If Mr. Stone has been indisposed ever since his appointment, he is not without an excuse for remaining at home.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Mar. 16. 1784. I received yesterday by Mr. Maury your favor of Feb. 17.(1) That which you mention to have written by post a few days before is not yet come to hand.(2) I am induced to this quick reply to the former by an alarming paragraph in it, which is that {Mazzei}(3) is coming to Annapolis. I tremble at the idea. I know he will be worse to me than a return of my double quotidian head-ach. There is a resolution reported to Congress by a Committee that they will never appoint to the office of minister, chargé des affaires, consul, agent &c. (describing the foreign emploiments) any but natives. To this I think there will not be a dissenting vote: and it will be taken up among the first things.(4) Could you not, by making him acquainted with this divert him from coming here? A {consulate} is his object, in which he will assuredly fail. But his coming will be attended with evil. He is the violent enemy of {Franklin} having been some time at {Paris}. From my knolege of the man I am sure he  MARCH 16, 1784  will have emploied himself in collecting on the spot facts true or false to {impeach} him. You know there are people here who, on the first idea of this, will take him to their bosom and turn all Congress topsy turvy. For god's sake then save us from this confusion if you can. We have eight states only & 7 of these represented by two members. Delaware & S. Carolina we lost within these two days by the expiration of their powers. The other absent states are N. York, Maryland & Georgia. We have done nothing & can do nothing in this condition but waste our time, temper, & spirits in debating things for days or weeks & then losing them by the negative of one or two individuals. We have letters from Franklin & the Marq. Fayette of the 24th and 25th of Dec. They inform us that North & Fox are out, Pitt & Temple coming in, that whole nation extremely indisposed towards us, & as having not lost the idea of reannexing us, the Turks & Russians likely to be kept quiet another year, the Marquis coming to America this spring, Mr. Laurence then about sailing for America, Mr. Adams leaving England for the Hague, Mr. Jay at Bath but about returning to Paris. Our ratification tho' on board two different vessels at N. York in the hands of officers as early as the 20th of Jan. did not sail thence till the 17th of Feb. on account of the ice.(5) I will attend to your desire about the booksellers. I am considerably mended in my health & hope a favourable change in the weather which seems to be taking place will reestablish me. I wish you would keep a diary under the following heads or columns. 1. day of the month. 2. thermometer at sunrise. 3. barometer at sunrise. 6. thermom. at 4. P.M. 7. barometer at 4.

  Dear Sir(1) Annapolis Mar. 17. 1784. I wrote you about the 10th of Nov.(2) from Philada. by Colo. Bland who was going directly to Richmond. By him I sent you a thermometer. I hope you received it safely. I am anxious to hear whether you did and whether you have been able to make those trials with it to which the Queries in my letter asked answers. You will probably have heard that Fox and North are out of the British ministry. We learn this by letters from Dr. Franklin and the Marq. Fayette of Dec. 25. as also that Pitt and Temple are to be in the administration, that the disposition of that nation towards us is very hostile, and that the Turks and Russians are likely to keep the peace a year longer. We have executed to Congress a deed of cession for the Western country. The winter here has been severe beyond all memory. Congress has been so thin that little could be done. We are constantly tantalized with the expectation of new members. A full house would enable us to rise in 6 weeks and not meet again till November.

  D'r S'r,(1) Annapolis March 18th 1784. You cannot expect from me much Congressional News as the Time I have Spent here has given me but an Imperfect Idea of the Manner of doing Business which is much retarded by the Thinness of Representation; Maryland New York and Georgia are unrepresented and the Delegates from Delaware (tho' one of them had Just Arrivd) have been dismissed on Acct. of Some want of conformity in their Appointment to the fOEderal Articles. An Adjournment of Congress it is thought will take place in May (A Consummation devoutly to be wished for) But a full Representation is Essential to Expedite the important Business, the Transaction of which must necessarily precede that Period. The Severity of the Winter has Extended itself as far south as we have had any late Intelligence and here the Signs of returning Spring are yet Equivocal. The Road from Baltimore to this town is chiefly bounded by Pines, here and there the Ruins of Iron Works and of wornout Plantations intervening Annapolis is pleasantly situated on a bason which forms the Mouth of the River Severn. They Count about 300 houses some of them Superb and Magnificient with corresponding Gardens and Improvements. A waste space of some hundred Acres Unimployd(?) and Uncultivated bounded by Pines of short Growth Adjoins the Town. The whole View resembling An Asiatic picture, Excites not those pleasing Ideas which arise in the Mind of a more Northern Inhabitant from the view of a Country beautifyd by the hand of Industry. Most of the Gentlemen of Congress have been liberally Educated. Eight of us lodge in one house and our Time at home is Spent agreeably enough whilst the polite Attention of the Gentlemen of the Town Engages all our leisure hours in Visits and Amusements. The Players Exhibit twice a week and there is a Brilliant Assembly or Ball once a fortnight to which We have Standing Cards of Invitation. Our Legislature will no doubt be called together on the Requisition which Congress will make for our Quota of the Expences of the present Year an Estimate of which taken from the Report of the Grand Committee is enclosd: it is proposd, tho' not yet determind that one half of the Requisition may be paid in the several States by the Interest of loan office Certificates or Liquidated debts.(2) There will be a further Demand of Two Millions five hundred thousand Dollars for the Payment of those Certificates, issued from Sept. 77 to March 78 on which the U. S. are now paying an Interest of 8½ per Cent: the Com'ee Report that paying the Principal is the only Means of freeing us from the Exorbitant Interest, Exceeding that paid on other Certificates of the same Value More than Sixty thousand Dollars per  MARCH 18, 1784  Annum. Our Quota of this sum will be 138,930 Dollars which may be paid in Loan office Certificates Afforsd. reducd to Specie Value.(3) Capt. Barney is lately arrivd from L'Orient: but brings no very Interesting News Except what you will find in the public Papers. The Southern States Apprehend Serious Consequences from the Scarcity of Circulating Cash: Their British Creditors have bro't Suits. No Stay of Excution can be had, the Definitive treaty preventing the Intervention of the Legislature and Each Creditor Eager to make the first recovery. Public Securities may be bought in this State for one third and in Virginia for one fourth of their Value tho' these States have provided for Payment of the Interest Annualy. From the Inclosd Report (4) of the Com'ee tho Not Agreed to You may form Some Idea of what is Intended Respecting that Country Northwest of the Ohio for which Virginia has Executed a Deed to the U. S: since my Being in Congress more Liberal Cessions are urged and Expected both from her and the other States which if Granted will form an Ample fund for Discharge of the National Debt:(5) Five Commissioners are appointed to treat with the Indians: Vizt. Genl. Green Genl. Clark, Butler, Higginson and Wolcott. When that Business is over which probably will take great Part of the Summer A Land Office will be opened and that State in the Report calld Washington will be disposd of: What is Yet done or in Contemplation is not Sufficiently Established for Gentlemen who propose settling there to Confide in or take any Measures upon, And Mr. Worth will please to Accept this As An Apology for My Not writing to him. The Impost is not Agreed to by more than seven States. Connecticut has negativd the Measure by a large Majority and her Legislature yet grumbles about the Commutation. There seems to be a Radical Difference in Dispositions and OEconomical Views of the Northern and Southern States which, tho it cant be denied its use, yet greatly retards the dispatch of Business: Virginia has five Delegates here at three pounds a Day. No other State has more than two. The Permanent Residence of Congress is Yet Undetermind and likely to be so: A Com'ee will visit George Town in a few Days but with little Prospect of a Satisfactory Report: Our adjournment will be to Trenton to Meet in November.

Your excellency and the State may wish to be informed of the circumstances of the ratification of the definitive Treaty and the consequent recommendations which are sent to the states, and of such other important matters as are yet pending before Congress. From the papers which are forwarded by our Secretary you will learn that the definitive Treaty was not ratified before the 14th of January;(1) by a series of neglects or accidents it had long been coming to our hands, and some weeks afterwards elapsed before we had nine States present. The officers whom we sent in different Vessels with the ratification were both so long detained by the ice and bad weather, that we have reason to fear that they should not arrive in Paris before the 3d of March, the last day allowed for the exchange of ratifications. Apprehending that an accident of this sort might occur, and that other terms less palatable might be offered us in case the Treaty was lost by our latches [laches],(2) the most pressing measures were attempted to bring forward a full representation. The Journals for the 23d of December will explain some of the steps that were taken.(3) After waiting some days longer, I confess that I was one of those who would have submitted to the risque of ratifying by seven States rather than loose the Treaty. Our reasons are contained in the paper annexed No 1 (4) which was for some days the subject of debate; at length an officer whom we had dispatched for the purpose, brought Members enough to make nine states. Our opinion was, that the ratification by Seven states was good on behalf of the United States; and Great Britain who is not to judge of our Constitution must have received it as good, but we might have incured the displeasure and censure of our constituents on the supposition that we had violated the spirit of the confederation. We conceived however that on great & pressing occasions, the Man who is honored with the dearest concerns of his Country would ill deserve that honor if he was not willing to risque his political existence or even his temporal existence in order to preserve the happiness & Peace of his Country. With respect to the recommendations which are sent to the States in consequence of the Treaty, you will be pleased to observe that Congress had many reasons for defering them to this late hour. They have indeed been zealously pressed by the commander in chief of the British forces in america to make these recommendations immediately   after the preliminary articles came to hand, and it was alledged, that in the terms of the articles we were bound so to do. We alledged however that the period was not arrived at which the recommendation ought to go forth. We apprehended that some of the measures recommended might not be very acceptable to the States, and their refusing to comply might be explained by the British Court as a breach of Treaty; and while they had an army in the Country there was much reason to believe that they were watching for an excuse to recover part of what they lost by the Treaty. For these reasons we refered the recommendations to the accomplishment of the definitive and not the preliminary Treaty. In the mean while the British Troops have been withdrawn from the Country and the hour has arrived when we are in good faith bound to recommend. It will certainly be admitted that the spirit of violence which prevailed on the last year in some of the States had a great tendency to make strangers think ill of our Government, that spirit seems now to subside, and the laws have their due effect. You will observe that British Debts & the refugees are the two subjects of recommendation. The term real British subjects used in the 5th article was clearly understood by the British Ministers as well as by ours to mean neither Tories nor Loyalists; it is applicable to those who had never incured any blame, as they had never owed any duty to the states. That you may clearly understand what are the ideas & expectations of Congress on the subject of British Debts I must refer you to the annexed paper No. 2 (5) which is part of a representation made by our Ministers to the British Minister on the subject of forbearance and interest. Was a mercer to sell you a piece of cloath and on the next day imploy a thief to steal half of it from you, he would certainly come with a bad grace at the end of twelve months to demand payment for the whole piece, and 6 per Cent for his indulgence. The stipulations concerning refugees were the first that were attempted, and the last agreed on in the Treaty. The British Court at first demanded the General return of the refugees, and the restitution of all their property. The reply of our Ministers might be comprehended in a few words viz, that Congress neither had the power nor inclination to agree to Such terms. You will find some of their reasonings on this subject in the paper No 3.(6) After much time being spent, a proposition was made by our ministers to this import, viz. Tho the refugees could not be suffered to return, yet a faithful inventory should be taken of all the property which they had forfeited; a faithful inventory should also be taken of all the property belonging to Citizens of the United States, which had been destroyed or carried off by tories or other adherents to Great Britain. If the tories on settling the acct. had suffered the most, the balance should be paid them by the United States, but on the contrary, if our Citizens had suffered most the difference should be paid by the British Nation. The recommendation of Congress to the   several States to cause an account of their losses to be taken was put into the hands of the British Minister as a proff that we were collecting materials, that we might be ready to settle such acct. From that hour no further demands were made of the restitution of tory property and a long negotiation terminated as you have it in the 5th, 6th & 7th articles. The proposition I have refered to is annexed No 4.(7) Our Ministers in their joint Letter say \""It is much to be wished that the legislatures may not involve all the tories in banishment & ruin but that such discriminations may be made as to entitle their decessions to the approbation of disinterested Men.\""(8) It gives much pleasure to cool dispassionate observers to see that the Legislature of North Carolina has not gone into the banishment of that numerous class of misguided People who continued lurking in the State, though in the Eye of Justice they might have forfeited both property and life. Though there have been times in which it was necessary to cut off a limb in order to save the body politic, we are now happy in having at that period in which, to imitate the author of our being, offenders, who are not of the worst class, may be suffered to repent & return to their duty. On the last summer the Delegates received a Letter from H. E. McCulloh who seems to be fully persuaded that his estate will be restored to him. I believe we were quite as well persuaded that his estate will not be restored to him, however that may be the Letter is enclosed. In our Letter of the 26th of September we took the liberty to represent to Your Excellency the fatal mistake of many of our Merchants in pushing their vessels into British ports and the more fatal mistake of some of the States in opening their ports to the British vessels without waiting for advice or giving Congress time to negotiate a Treaty, which at that period Great Britain would have acceded to on very desirable terms. By these errors our trade is destroyed and experience has taught those merchants, so covetous of British connections that they were mistaken. Certainly experience keeps a dear School though we daily see people who will not learn in any other. By the annexed papers No. 5 (9) you will see what prospects we had of a favourable commerce before it was known in England that our ports were open to their vessels. By the papers No 6, seperate, you will observe that many of the States are now convinced that it is necessary to vest Congress with the power of protecting commerce by mercantile Treaties.(10) Great Britain has presumed that in the hour of peace the States would not support one another. On this supposition her proclamation was issued for cutting off our trade with the West Indies. The spirit that is now rising in the States will be apt to convince her that she has been mistaken, as on many former occasions, when she counted on our want of union. From the good sense of the Legislature of N Carolina & their uniform desire to support fOEderal measures, I am not to doubt what part they will take on this occasion.  Congress are now engaged in preparing instructions for their ministers abroad for negotiating Treaties with the several commercial powers in Europe with whom we have none at present. Virginia has compleated her Cession of territory to the United States, by which we may be enabled to pay of no small part of the national Debt. I have taken some pains, by comparing the most accurate Maps with the observations of Gentlemen who have been in the Western Countries, to estimate the quantity & value of the territory now belonging to the United States on the West of the Ohio. There are somewhat more than 186 millions of acres. Of this quantity 44 millions of acres are to the Northward of latitude 45°. This Country being neither very fertile nor well timbered will not for ages be of much use, except for hunting ground. Between the latitude 45° and 42 there are above 44 millions of acres. This Country is in general fertile & well timbered but the Indians will expect the exclusive use of it for a considerable time. Between the parallel of 42 degrees latitude & the river Ohio, extended between the state of Pensylvania & the river Mississippi there are about 85 millions of acres. In this Country the lands are extremely fertile and there is hardly any part of america so little broken by mountains. I presume that it may be sold at 25 Dollars for the hundred acres by which a debt of 20 millions may be paid off, after 5 millions of acres have been deducted, which is more than sufficient for paying our late army the lands due them. An object which holds out the prospect of sinking near half of our national debt certainly claims the most serious attention. In pursuance of this object the next thing to be attempted is a treaty with the Indians who are daily soliciting that we should enter into such treaty. We have reason to expect that they will yield us a considerable tract in consequence of the outrages they have committed during the late war, and we propose buying as much more as they can be prevailed on [to] sell. Congress are desirous of being ready to treat whenever the Summer approaches. In whatever light, from time and habit we may view a large Nation in debt, it is certainly a chain of slavery. It will constantly be found that \""the borrower is a servant to the lender\"" and those debts which are the necessary cause of taxation must prove the necessary source of grief. For these reasons I presume it is our duty to leave no honest measures unattempted by which we may pay of[f] the national debt. As the Citizens of our State have little foreign commerce, have little intercourse with Strangers and have not so many opportunities of receiving information concerning national & foreign occurrences as are presented to people in large commercial Cities, I have the rather thought it my duty to trouble you with so long a letter and to forward so many extracts. The State has an undoubted right to expect infor  mation from its servants, not only of what they have done, but of their general views and principles of conduct. And in cases where, like the present, it is necessary that the State should take a part, it is certainly our duty to furnish her with all necessary information that has been presented to us. As some of the Letters, to which I have refered, have treated the subject much better than I can pretend to do, I certainly should have given larger extracts, but you will readily believe that, considering the necessary attendance and duties of Congress, I have already written as much as may consist with regard to health. I fear that I have written more than will consist with your patience. I have the honor to be &ca, Hugh Williamson P.S. You observe that the business which now presses for dispatch is very important. No part of it can be done by less than nine states. During the whole winter we have not had nine states except for three or four Days; I had fully expected to return to the state by the first of April but as I see no prospect of being relieved at that time or before it, I conceive it will be a duty that I owe to the state and to the Union to continue until the adjournment for a vacation or at least while I am in the Delegation. As we now have a sufficient Congress for the dispatch of business It would be cruel to withdraw a State 'til the business is finished, & it might happen that by the absence of the representation of our State the most important national concerns would not only be postponed & defered for a considerable time, but some of the opportunities must he forever lost. I flatter myself that any national misfortune will never pass to the acct. of the Delegates from our State. Whether we have suffered any personal inconveniencies from our attendance during the last 12 months is a question that Mr Hawkins will be able to explain. If several Gentlemen had not shrank from such inconveniencies we should have had a larger representation for the last eight months and our business might now have been finished; by which means our finances would have been greatly improved and our national honor placed in a favourable point of light. It is now expected that Congress will be ready to adjourn by the end of May. The fOEderal year begins on the first Monday in November; wherefore we cannot adjourn over that period. It is expected from that time forward, while Heaven is pleased to give us peace, Congress will never have occasion to set except on the winter season. A committee, to consist of one Member from every State, is to set during the recess of Congress. If Mr Spaight should be continued in the Delegation, as he has not been long from home, I presume it will be convenient for him to be on the Committee; for though I have no claim to any other merrit than that of a fervent desire to serve the State accompanied by   the most steady attention to my duty, In hopes of serving them the more effectually, Yet I flatter myself, that I shall not be considered as ungrateful or inattentive to their interest when I express my wish of being at home the next summer. H.W. N.B. No. 7 Is an extract of the last Letter received from one of our Ministers,(11) and contains an indubitable truth which should be regarded with the most vigilent attention.(12) ""

  Sir, Annapolis March 23, 1784. I have not been able as yet to obtain a copy of the act of the Legislature of N. Jersey investing Congress with power to levy & collect a 5 per Cent Impost, &c. Their act for raising a revenue of 83,358 Dollars per annum for the space of 25 years has come to my hands & I have made sufficient extracts therefrom in the paper No. 1, to give an Idea of their plan.(1) I call it their plan because it is manifestly short of a compliance with that proposed by Congress on the 18th of April 1783, which requires \""The said last mentioned revenue to be collected by persons appointed as aforsd, but to be carried to the separate credit of the States within which they shall be collected,\"" whereas this N. Jersey revenue is to be collected by their County & Town collectors appointed by, & amenable only to, that State, & over whom Congress is to have no Controul. The State of N. Jersey hath gone the farthest towards a compliance with the views of Congress of any State I have yet heard of; yet their failure in this point will defeat all they have done according to the strict resolve of Congress which requires \""that none of the preceding resolutions shall take effect untill all of them shall be acceded to by every State.\"" Enclosed in paper No. 2 is a copy of an act of the State of N. Hampshire in[v]esting Congress with power to levy & collect a 5 per Cent Impost.(2) This act is formed on the groundwork of the Massachusetts  MARCH 23, 1784  act--there is one additional proviso--\""that in no case the forfeiture shall exceed the goods seized.\"" As to their proviso, saving a trial to their citizens according to the laws of that State it is undoubtedly void, being against the body of the act, which gives to the U.S. in Congress assembled power to make an ordinance for the collection of the revenue, which ordinance offenders are to be tried by: & how many more of their paper provisoes will be whittled away by the Gentlemen of the Law who will find a rich harvest in this measure, time will discover, if we are fated to live to see its execution. Since my last the time for which the delegates of Delaware were appointed has expired, whereby the Number is reduced to nine States: eight of which are represented by only two members each, so that any one out of sixteen members may put his veto on any measure which requires nine States. Arrangements are nearly concluded for the proposed Indian treaties, which will (if our sanguine hopes are not disappointed) be concluded the ensuing Summer & give us possession of a great tract of valuable Land. The Western Country is considered by the present Congress as a capital resource for the payment of our debts--the more it is explored the more it rises in our estimation. A Mr. Henry has lately been at this place, who has spent near twenty years among the Indians & explored a great part of that Country, having spent several winters, westward of Fort Cumberland & beyond the head of the Missisippi & seen rivers that pointed their way westward & probably run to the western shore of the Continent. He confirms the accounts of other adventurers as to the goodness of the Soil, & healthfulness of the Country; & his information has been of great use to the Committee appointed to report an Ordinance for the regulation of the Indian trade. Before Virginia had compleated her cession, a delegate from that State told me that the chief objection he had against making so large a cession was the same that I had against granting to Congress the Impost, Viz, that it would put into their hands & submit to their management too important a fund. This important fund is, however, actually in the hands of Congress, & what use they will make of it will soon be known. I am clearly of opinion that it is not safe to trust them with an Impost 'till, by a wise & prudent management of the western Country they shall have established their credit as a Body, & proved to the States that funds may be better trusted in their hands than in the hands of the particular States. No. 3, contains a continuation of the Journals of Congress down to the Beginning of the present month--how little has been done will be seen therein. Let those States & those Individuals, who have so grossly neglected their duty to the Union answer to the public for their conduct. It may be seen that the State I have the honor to represent stands wholly exculpated. MARCH 24, 1784  Please to present these papers to the Hon. the General Assembly: & to assure them that my best endeavours shall not be wanting to merit the esteeme & confidence with which they have been pleased to honor me.

  Dear Sir Annapolis 24th March, 1784  You are probaly informed that there is a Company in North Carolina called the Lebanon Company, who own 40 or 50 thousand a[cre]s of Land on the South side of Drummonds Lake or the great Dismal, I presume their Lands are bounded to the Northward by the Lands of the Virginia Company of which you are a member,(1) by the last Post I recived letters from some gentlemen who are of the Lebanon Company, proposing a Plan which they apprehend will not only tend to the improvement of all the Lands on Albemarle sound and greatly promote the Commerce of Virginia, they propose to dig a canal from the head of Pasquetank into the Lake in the dismal & thence into some navigable water which leads into Chesapeak Bay. The part of the Canal on the Carolina Side I presume may be 4 or 5 miles long on the Virginia side. You know best what length it may be. You are doubtless informed that the Lands in some of the Counties on Albemarle sound are the most fertile in North Carolina and that no Vessel can go to Sea from Albemarle sound, after passing through Pamplico sound with more than nine feet water, which is a prodigious tax on our Navigation. Could we get a safe navigation to Norfolk every article of our produce must rise at least 5 Pr Ct in its value. I need not say how much Norfolk would gain by our trade. An act passed at the last session of the Virginia Assembly for cuting a canal from Kemps Landing to the North Landing.(2) A river leads from the place last mentioned into Currituck sound in our state, but such a canal can be of very little use to us. The navigation from Albemarle sound into Virginia through Currituck is equal to an east India voyage, not quite so long but rather more troublesome, our people in general disclaim it. The proposed Canal would be partly in Virginia & partly in Carolina for which reason some gentlemen wish that the Company, ie the Canal company could be incorporated by Congress. They are not  MARCH 24, 1784  aware how incompetant our Powers are to such objects. I presume however that neither of the States would refuse a Charter of Incorporation, & if such an act should be passed by the two States in the form of a convention the proprietors would have all the security they could desire. Inclosed is one of the plans that was sent me from our state for executing the proposed Canal;(3) it is Not very explicit. Wishing as far as possible to [...] perpetual Servitudes in a free count[r]y, I have taken the liberty of Submiting the following Plan. 1. That the Canal Company be incorporated by the Legislatures of Virginia & N. Carolina by an act which shall be stated and considered as a Convention, not revocable unless by Mutual Consent. 2. That they be impower'd to receive from all vessels pasing through the Canal such a Toll as they may think proper to impose provided the annual amount does not exceed an interest of 8 Pr Ct on the money that shall be expended in finishing the Canal together with the contingent expences of repair & collecting the Tolls provided that the toll shall be uniformly imposed according to their Tonage & that vessels shall only pay toll in proportion to the distance which they pass in the Canal. 3. If it shall happen on any certain year that the Toll imposed does not amount to the annual Expences together with the proposed Interest of 8 Pr Ct It shall be permitted for the company to charge the ballance remaining on some future years. If the Legislatures of Virginia & N Carolina or either of them for the general advancement of Commerce shall repay into the hands of the Company the whole sum they have expended in diging and opening the Canal together with any arrearages that may be due of Interest or incidental expences and shall declare the Canal to be open & free forever, on these considerations; the Charter shall be disolved. Perhaps those conditions as they respect the company may not appear very liberal, but it is to be considered that the primary objects with every man who may engage in the Company will be the improvement of his private estate and serving the public by extending Navigation, with those views a man may be fully satisfyed with the Interest of 8 Pr Ct on all the money that he advances while it is Vested in the Canal. If the interest is moderate the public will the sooner be enable'd to redeem the Canal & the sooner it is made free the more perfectly does every man obtain the Chief objects of his enterprise. If you should agree with the gentlemen in our state to whom I have refered, in your Ideas concerning the Importance of such a Canal to the Commerce of both states, I am persuaded you will not fail to recommend it in such terms that the Company shall not fail in obtaining the necessary act of incorporation in the state of Virginia. In the mean while I should be extremly happy in receiving your observations on this subject,(4) that a Bill may be brought in with the advantages of such   improvement. It has been said that in rainey Seasons the Waters of Drummonds Lake flow into some of the Rivers that are in our State; from this it appears that there is no elevated ground in the way; but there may be drains of some value. If it was certain that the surface of the water in Drummonds Lake is not much above the Level of the waters in the adjacent rivers, when the Tides are up, ie if the difference is not above 3 or 4 feet the expence of the Canal must be inconsiderable, for Locks would not be required, unless perhaps one on the Virginia side, to prevent the water runing out on the chang. of the Tides, on the Carolina side where there are no tides the troubles would he less. I have the Honour to be with the utmost Conside[ratio]n, your Most Obedient Hble Servant, Hu Williamson Copy T Walker very bad papers ENCLOSURE Propositions respecting the canal are yet various Dessentions First for small boats &c only. Secondly for any vessels suited to our Rivers and Sounds, this tho exceed[ing]ly estensive, & involving great expense, appears to be practicable. Indeed I totally reprobate the former, for it might prove a final barr to the latter, which is alone competant to our use. Terms The undertakers would have the Terms of their patent privileges conditionally extended. First Government to run the risque of the final success, & repay the expenditures with 10 Pr Cent interest on a given time, but untill this payment be made the supreme controll of the canal, with the profits thereto in the mean time ariseing to be vested in the Company. Permanent funds will be expected. Secondly the supreme controll, & all the profits thereto arising, to be vested in the Company untill they shall have received the full sum of their expendatures with 10 Pr Ct interest thereon, in a replicate proportion, and in this case the Compy to be at all risque. In either case the Company to transact business under a common Seal &c and their accounts kept by sworn officers, to be the vouchers.  ""

The peace establishment, or rather measures for possessing the western Brittish Garrisons will next be entered on, & I hope opperate to the discharge of the retained troops from New Hampshire & Massachusetts, which are very expensive to those States: what methods will finally be adopted for guarding the public Stores, & keeping those western posts, I cannot conjecture, I hope they will be the least exceptionable, for I confess I do not like any thing which looks like a Military establishment in times of peace. Measures are likewise to be taken for the support of the public credit; a report of a grand Committee for this purpose is on the Table; it proposes calling on the States for three fourths of a former requisition for eight Millions Dolars including what hath already been paid thereon. This sum will satisfy the unfunded debts--the interest on the foreign & domestic debts up to the last of 1783 and the interest of the foreign debt up to the last day of 1784 and defray the expences of the current year; this report hath yet undergone no debate--these subjects being compleated with a few others of less importence. I think Congress will have a recess till the next Congressional year perhaps without leaving a Committee of the States. I suppose we must have some trouble before the adjour[n]ment about fOEderal towns & permanent residence possibly the Vote for two towns may be repealed, and Wilmington or Trenton agreed to. I wish any questions of this nature may not be as contentious as they have heretofore been. I am greatly obliged by your communications relative to public affairs in New Hampshire, and am happy to find a Constitution is formed, & sincerely wish it may be found in its opperation a good one.

  Dear Sir Annapolis March 26. 1784 I must first apologize for not sending you a copy of the constitutions before this by assuring you that the first inquiry I made on my arrival here was to obtain one & that soon as I procure one from Phila. for which purpose I have particularly instructed Mr. Murray I will transmit it. During the winter we have had so few States on the floor that we have been able to do but little of any consequence; but we have now present 9 States & expect in a few days to have 11, so that we shall engage in the business of the utmost consequence both foreign & domestic. We are much at a loss what can be done with respect to the negroes who were carried from N. York. How are we to take it up since we are possess'd of no kind of document to prove that any did in reality leave N. York? Is the State possess'd of such documents as will lay the foundation of an instruction to our ministers, for meerly to make the charge without proof will tend to incense the ct. of London without attaining anything on our part? How far our interest may have been neglected in the late negotiation & the consideration of compensation for our losses made subservient to other purposes is not now a subject of inquiry. The treaty supersedes every consideration of that kind. With respect to the negroes had not the Executive better send some gentn. of character to N. York to collect the necessary documents as a foundation for Congress to take up the matter? If we make this proposition here we shall most certainly meet with difficulty, they will say that as it is an affr. in wh. the State is particularly interested the State shod. bear the expence. We may however bring it on here & require that the States employ some person in N. York to ascertain what number were carried off; but is this a ground for the State to calculate on? There is another circumstance of material consequence wh. I think will force itself upon the attention of Congress. Our debt to the B. merchants I am well informd amounts to about 2,800,000 £. In the State we have only abt. 100,000 £ in circulation; how then shall we be able to pay it; & yet the courts by the treaty are open'd for the collection of them. The very nature of the affr. puts it out of our power to comply with that article. What then is the remedy? We must obtain delay at least in the payment till by continued frugality & a succession of crops we can pay it. And to obtain this delay it appears to me to be adviseable to enter into a negotiation with the court of London on that head. But then we must have something to offer as compensation for the delay. What there may be within the power of the State your Excellency can best determine, it however appears to me to be an affr of considerable consequence, worthy the attention of the Legislature in the first instance with whom it will rest to find compensation, as it very essentially involves the interest & the character of the State to comply with the treaty, & worthy the attention of Congress  MARCH 27, 1784  in the next, to whom it will belong to present the proposals of the State to the ct. of London. A committee have reported that treaties of amity & commerce be enterd into with Russia, Germany, Prussia, Hamburg, G. Brittn., Spn., Portugal, Genoa, Tuscany, Rome, Venice, Sardinia & the Ottoman Porte for its possessions in Europe and Asia. That these treaties be form'd on the most perfect ground of reciprocity of interest and mutual friendship. As yet, tho engag'd in it yesterday, the house came to no decision thereon. It is important to the southern States to whom the negotiation of these treaties are committed; for except the fishery & the fur-trade (the latter of wh. Mr. Jeffn. thinks if the Legislature take up the subject with wisdom & liberality wh. shod. govern their councils may be turn'd down the Potowk.) the Southern States, are as States, almost alone interested in it. Shall we then join three men all of whom are northern in their interest & connections in the negotiation of these treaties? Or if these men are alone to be employ'd in the most important concerns of America shod. we associate them together or seperate them?1 Nothing is as yet done in the affr. of Penobscot, the paper money nor bounties to the men by Massachusetts. I shall be happy to hear from Yr. Excellency when at leasure & with great respect & esteem am yr. very humble Servt, Jas. Monroe ""

  My dear Minister. Annapolis, March 27, 1784. Though I have nothing material yet I should accuse myself of ingratitude, if I did not thank you for the very polite attention you were pleased to pay me while in Philadelphia.(1) I feel myself under great obligations to you, and though it may not be in my power ever to make such acknowledgements as I wish, yet every service within the limits of my capacity whilst in this or any other place is devoted to you, and it will give me very singular pleasure to have the honour of your commands. Whenever anything occurs worth your notice here, be assured that I shall write you. I am with the Highest esteem, Your most Obdnt Servt, Charles DeWitt.  MARCH 27, 1784  MS not found; reprinted from Olde Ulster 5 (April 1909): 110. 1 DeWitt had just arrived in Annapolis and took his seat in Congress this day. During his stay in Philadelphia enroute to Maryland, DeWitt had written the following letter to his son Gerret on the 16th describing the city and his impression of Van Berckel. \""I now write you from a place the most magnificent that ever I saw and perhaps it may be ranked among the finest Cities in the World, the houses are elegant the streets spacious and notwithstanding four horses were necessary and even six before we reached this city, to drag us though the mud, we walk here without the least difficulty with clean shoes on pavements as clean as a house floor. I suspect my situation at Annapolis will not be so agreeable, however I am again informed here that there is a probability of returning soon from that place northward. \""I have this day dined with the Minister of France, the Chevalier (for so he is called) as well as his Secretary treated me with great politeness and civility. Tomorrow I am to wait on the Minister of the United Netherlands whom I saw this day in the street and was introduced to him by my old friend Gouverneur Morris, he appears to be as plain a Dutchman as I am, indeed I believe I rather exceeded him in dress, however you must know I am rather better dressed on this occasion than usual. \""As soon as an opportunity occurs I shall set out from this place for Baltimore, I brot with me several letters of introduction from New York Gentlemen to Gentlemen in this place, in consequence of which I have a great many invitations and am treated with great respect.\"" Olde Ulster, 5:84-85.

Writing to his wife for the first time after taking his seat in Congress the preceding day, the newly-married McHenry complained of the burden imposed by his attendance at Congress. \""In truth, I am no longer anxious to please my state, seeing it cannot be done without sacrificing too much of your company. It is time too that I should accommodate my leisure and industry to our prospects and circumstances. Neither of us can be happy under a long separation; nor can our interest be promoted by my sitting in Congress. My first object was to get you to Baltimore, to see you mistress of your house, and pleased in your new situation--but a strong hand restrains me where I am and delays that necessary event.(1) I fear my beloved that I shall not have it in my power to move from this place sooner than the first of May. It is a tedious period--but unless I do what I have censured others for doing I cannot make it shorter.\"" (2) MS not found; reprinted from Steiner, James McHenry, pp. 78-79. 1 For an explanation of the \""strong hand\"" that kept McHenry in Annapolis until the end of April, see McHenry to William Paca, March 15, 1784. 2 McHenry continued to write Peggy regularly while they were separated, but his letters contain little of public interest. Writing on April 1 he observed that he had dined \""at different houses every day this week\"" and that he had also \""been very busy in Congress.\"" Steiner, James McHenry, p. 79.

There are four or five Matters of importance that will require the attention of Congress before the adjournment which is expected to be in May.  Instructions to the Ministers in Europe to propose and conclude treaties with most of the Commercial States in Europe are now under consideration. A report of a Committee consisting of one Member from each State present has been made on ways & means for payment of the Interest in arrear on the foreign and domestic debts, and for the current expences of the present Year, which it appears may be done without making any New requisitions, but by application of part of the 8 Million dollars required by the resolution of Novr. 1781.(1) Another report is made respecting the reduction of the Civil List both as to the Number of Officers, and the Salaries of those that are to remain.(2) Five Commissioners have been appointed to Treat with the Northern and Middle Tribes of Indians and to obtain from them a release of their claim to a tract of territory Sufficient for one or more States North west of the Ohio, and west of Pensylvania. The Gentlemen appointed are Generals Clark, Wolcot and Green, a Col. Butler of Pensylvania and Mr. Steven Higgison of Boston; they are allowed Six & an half dollars per day for their Services and expences while employed in the Service. Some further Instructions to the Commissioners for Settling accounts are under consideration. These are the principal matters to be transacted before the adjournment. The answer to the Address of the Honble. House of Representatives of the State of Connecticut has been reported, and considered by paragraphs and amended as far as Congress thought proper, it only remains to take a question on the whole which has been delayed for Some time in order to have a full Congress.(3) Enclosed is a copy of the Answer to the Legislature of Massachusetts on the Same Subject (4)-- also extracts from Several of the last Letters from our Commissioners in Europe, Shewing in what light our repub[l]ican Governments are viewed there. I wish that we may cut off all occasion from those who desire Occasion to Speak evil of us, and injure the reputation [of] rising States. The letters contain No other i[n]formation of much importance. There is Some talk of leaving a Committee of the States when   Congress adjourn, but it has not yet been determined--if one Should be appointed it would not be convenient for me to Stay, and General Wadsworth Says that he Should not be willing to continue here after the rising of Congress. I dont learn that the people at Wyoming are likely to get any releif from the General Assembly of Pensylvania. Their Complaint against Paterson & others was referred to a Committee who reported that the law was open to them, and that it is not proper for the Legislature [to] interpose.

  Sir, Annapolis Mar. 30. 1784. Your very interesting Letter of the 17th Inst. with the Accounts Inclosed having been Committed to a grand Committee Consisting of a Member from each State on the floor of Congress--they have lost no time in deliberating on the Steps proper to be immediately taken by Congress for securing the public Credit & preventing the fatal Effects that must necessarily arise from a protest for Non-payment & return of your Bills from Holland especially shou'd the United States be found without funds for the Immediate repayment of the Amount of such Bills & the Charges accruing.(1) The Committee being of opinion that the subject is of too great Moment to admit of delay Conceive it is their duty to suppose for the present that the Bills are actually protested for Nonpayment & may shortly be returned and on that presumption to see what means Can be made Use of in this Country for satisfying the Holders on the arrival of the protests.  The first Sources that present themselves as likely to afford immediate Relief are the public Banks. That at Philadelphia having (As is understood here) very greatly increased its Subscriptions and others opening at Baltimore, New York & Boston on very Considerable Capitals, The Committee wish to know Your opinion on the probability of obtaining a Loan from them or any of them.  The Grand Committee relying on your wisdom & zeal for the public good Wish as soon as possible to be furnished with Your thoughts at large; On the Expediency of Attempting from the American Banks a loan of such sum as may be Necessary in Case of the Actual protest for Nonpayment of your Bills on Holland; On the premium to be offered for Obtaining such loan--And on the form & mode of issuing public Securities for the Same. MARCH 30, 1784  To give you as Clear an Idea of the Views of the Committee as possible for your assistance in forming the plan--it may be proper to inform you that the grand Committee think for the present that the Securities shoud be in Notes payable at proper periods and bearing an Interest of Six pr. Ct. (It may also be Necessary to give a premium to Induce the Loan, on the Quantum and Manner of Which we ask your advice). The Committee are of opinion that these Notes shall be paid out of the first Money Coming into the Treasury (unless a longer Credit can be gained.) In the Mean time they have it in Idea to advise Congress to press upon the States the Necessity of immediately taking the most Effectual Measures for supporting the Public Credit & averting threatened Evils that wou'd arise from a declared Bankruptcy.

  Sir, (Circular) Annapolis, 1 April 1784 The subject of this address claims the attention of your Excellency on the principle of the most urgent necessity.(1)  The State of our finances is such as to require the united efforts of Congress and of the several States for obtaining immediately a supply of money, to prevent the loss of public credit. When the Army were furlough'd, they had the promise of three months pay; and as there was not money in the Treasury, the superintendant of finance was under the necessity of issuing his notes to discharge this and other demands. The notes becoming due, part of them were redeemed with money supplied by the several states; but this being inadequate, the financier drew Bills on Holland for the deficiency. A considerable proportion of these drafts have been paid by loans obtained there, on the credit of the United States; but the letters from our Bankers to the superintendant of finance, inform that they had been under the necessity for the want of funds, to suffer so many of his Bills to be protested for non-acceptance, as with the damages on protest in case of non-payment will amount to the sum of 636,000 Dollars. We expect the return of these bills under a protest for non payment, and should there not be money in the treasury of the United States to discharge them, your excellency may easily conceive the deplorable consequences. Under such circumstances, Congress think it their duty to communicate the matter confidentially to the Supreme Executive of each State; and to request in the most pressing terms, their influence and exertion to furnish with all possible dispatch, on requisitions unsatisfied, their respective quotas of the sum mentioned, according to the apportionment herewith transmitted. I shall only add Sir, that Congress rely on your Wisdom, for accomplishing their views with as much dispatch as possible; and that the estimates and requisitions for the year, will be soon transmitted to your Excellency. I am with the greatest Respect & Esteem, Your Excellencys Obedient & humble Servt, Thomas Mifflin (2) APRIL 1, 1784  The Apportionment of the 636,000 Dollars is as follows  New Hampshire 22,348  Massachusets 95,157  Rhode Island 13,703  Connecticut 56,007  New York 54,375  New Jersey 35,344  Pennsylvania 87,000  Delaware 9,516  Maryland 60,003  Virginia 108,750  North Carolina 46,218  South Carolina 40,782  Georgia 6,797  636,000 Dollars RC(MiU-C: Miscellaneous Manuscripts).

  Dear Brother Annapolis 2d. April 1784  The prologomenon of your letter I shall pass over: only reminding you; that I have long since been stiled Hon.ble & feel no new importance, on my new appointment, or at the great deference & \""respect,\"" with which you would seem to \""approach\"" me, & I must beg you will prorogue any further flummery on this Head, but address me as standing on the same ground with other fellow \""Mortals.\""  You speak the language of nature in asking the Question, relative to the State of our Funds, & it does not require the Spirit of Divination, to propound your \""interestedness\"" in a discussion of this Subject. But I fear the \""reality\"" of our Debt, when Contrasted with the \""Reality\"" of our Means of payment, will not admit of a very favourable Prognosis; and that the \""Contents\"" of our Treasury, will strike you much in the light of my former letter; being only a \""Preface\"" & containing no \""Substance.\""  Those who know least of the powers of Congress, are generally the most sanguine on this Head. We have neither the power of Resolving money into existance; nor diving in to and drawing it forth; from the coffers of those who possess it. Like the Indian Sachems, indeed, we can consult, devise, & call for requisitions; but it rests with the Executives of the states alone, to give Efficacy to the Measures recommended--our most ostensible resource is that of an Impost upon foreign Importations. This would constitute no inconsiderable Revenue & tend greatly to alleviate Taxation in the ordinary way--Being founded on the most perfect Equality; a Tax, wholly voluntary & insensible; I cannot but be astonished at the opposition it meets with in the several states--only seven, of the thirteen Legislatures, have yet acceeded to the proposition; & were I to hazard a Conjecture, it would be that two or More, never will comply. Cut off from this Hope, I know not where we shall land. The Burthens of a people must be measured by their abilities to sustain the pressure: and when Taxes once become odious;  APRIL 2, 1784  I believe we shall find too little Energy in our republican governments, to Enforce a Collection of them. The Sale of our Western Lands may with good Management be made to lessen our public (domestic) debt considerably: but we cannot Avail ourselves even of this resource for a twelvemonth; or at least before we shall have setled a peace with the Indians, purchased their right of Soil & fixed Boundaries between them & us. Commissioners for this purpose have been appointed, & will we Expect hasten on & perfect this Buisness in the Course of the Ensuing Summer & Fall. Congress has Estimated that 4½ Millions of Dollars, will be wanted for the Current Expences of the Year 84 & for the Arrears of Interest due on Foreign & Domestic Loans, up to the 31st Decr. 84. A Requisition for this sum will shortly go out;(1) & I leave you to say, how far or how punctually it will be complied with. I confess I have my fears; but I am pursuaded the States must be stimulated to make the most Vigorous Exertions, or our National Credit, must be Anihilated. You will say, this is a dull picture & throws a dark Shade over your pay & Commutation--it is true, but indeed I cannot flatter you, without doing violence to my own sentiments: how far my Prognosis may be verified, time must determine but I assure you the Diagnosis is not unjustly drawn--and I should rather think Industry in the line of your Profession, will be the surest support. I inclose you a Schedule of the Expences which form the requisition, as estimated by Congress.  All Europe seems to have become Balloon Mad. Even Dr. Franklins Servant, has taken an aerial flight & not yet returned to Narrate his discoverys. If Monsieur Montgolfier could be so fortunate as to fall on a Method of giving them a Horizontal as well as Vertical Motion, I should have no objection to the Construction of a Congressional one, for the purpose of removing Congress, as you propose: but in the present improved state of these Machines, I fancy you will find few to Venture; least we should Explore a Region, where our Independance is not known, or Acknowledged. As I have already exceeded the limits of a fashionable or polite letter, I shall here drop the Curtain & leave the other parts of your letter to some future opurtunity.  I pray you will be as good as your word in calling to see Mrs. B. whose widowed State, requires more attention. Present my affectionate regards to Mr. Wm. Scott & family & all my other Friends.  Yours with much regard, Jno Beatty  P.S. You may read this Letter to Mr. Scott & I shd. be happy to hear from him. I inclose you a late Baltimore paper.   E N C L O S U R E Schedule That there will be wanting for Arrears of Interest & for the Interest and services of the present year (84) the followg. Sums.  The Civil Department 107,525.33 The Military Department 200,000.-- The Marine Department 30,000.-- Indian Purchases--Expences 60,000.-- Contingencys--Estimated at 60,000.-- 457,525. Debts contracted & still unpaid, for the Services of 1782 and 1783 & assumed to pay by Mr. Morris. 1,000,000 Foreign Debt.  1782. Decr. 31.

Interest on Dutch, Spanish and French Loans up to 31st Decr. 84 375,611 Domestic Debt. 1782. Decr. 31. Arrears of Interest due on Loan office Debt, Liquidated Debt & Army Debt 681,490  N. B. This is a Ball. of Interest due for the  year 82, after deducting the requisition of  Sepr. 4th, 1782 for 1,200,000 Dolls.  1783. Decr. 31.

By adding these sums together you will find our requisition of 4½ Millions, falls short of the Amount near a Milln. of Dolls. but it is better to leave some of the domestic Debt unpaid; than to call for More than can be raised & thereby frustrate the whole plan. I have taken this off in a hurry there may be some trivial Mistakes.(2) Yours,  J.B. ""

  Sir Annapolis. Apr. 2. 1784.  We have received no foreign intelligence through any authentic channel since the letter from Dr. Franklin of Dec. 25. an extract from which I formerly did myself the honour of inclosing you.(1) Through different ways however, such as to merit beleif, we have information that the utmost confusion prevails in the British government. The House of commons on the 16th of January came to a vote that the ministry (Mr. Pitt and his associates) neither possessed nor ought to possess the confidence of the nation. One account sais that on this Mr. Pitt resigned. Another that he had not resigned and that the doubt was whether the king would dissolve the parliament or part with his ministry. The error in the composition of that administration seems to have been the filling it from the house of lords, and taking in not enough of the men of interest and talents in the house of commons. Matters on the continent are quiet. The Emperor and Dutch have appointed commissioners to settle their difference. Whether his object was to have opened the Scheld, or whether the dispute arose about contested territory seems not very clear. I should have added to  APRIL 2, 1784  the above intelligence that the city of London were warm for Mr. Pitt and had addressed the King to continue his favor to him. Your letter from Mount Vernon came safely to hand.(2) We have eleven states in Congress; and are applying ourselves solely to the important subjects. I am not without hopes that we shall be able by the first of May to adjourn till November. Nothing could prevent it but the loss of votes sometimes by divisions of the states, 8 of the 11 being represented by two members only. Any three of sixteen individuals can still defeat our endeavors, and your knowlege of men will suggest to you the possibility of 3 dissenting voices out of 16 on any question. Mr. Mercer the corresponding member for the month will perhaps be able to supply any intelligence which may escape me. I have the honour to be with very great esteem & respect Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble servt, Th. Jefferson (3) ""

12575,dg021360,1784,William Ellery to Benjamin Huntington,"""William Ellery to Benjamin Huntington
  Sir, Annapolis April 3d. 1784. I am much obliged to you for your kind, your facetious, and polite letter of the 11th of January. I should have answered it before this time; but I had nothing to communicate worthy of your notice. Indeed my principal inducement now is to obtain another letter from and to ask a favour of you. From the acquaintance I have had with you I have some times flatter'd myself that there was a sort of congeniality in our souls; because I always delighted in your conversation, and I have found an easy humour in your letters which exactly suits my cast. Your description of the attendants upon the Lady Mayoress, the day Old Roger was chosen Lord Mayor of the City of New Haven, and the design of their visits diverted me hugely. I believe the election was not disagreeable to our old friend.1 He sucked his tooth, threw his thighs across each other when he heard the news, looked foolish, and was perswaded to sprinkle his commission with wine. The company, consisting of delegates from N. Hampshire, R. Island, Connecticut and N. Jersey, who all board together, indulged a merry vein on the occasion. When a person gives a treat with us, upon his being elected to a new office, we call it cutting or docking the colt's tail. This was mentioned, and naturally and punnicly bro't up a mare's tail, and a Mayor's tail, and that produced this anecdote from friend Roger. When his little son was told that his father was made a mayor, what says the boy and are they agoing to ride him? We made Yankey Hall roar with laughter,  APRIL 3, 1784  for so we call our dining room, as we did that at Princeton where Judge Huntingdon, and Squire Ben, and Col. Howell, and little i broke our bread and drank our wine in good humour together, excepting when Impost now and then sower'd our meals.  Pray Sir, to begin my question as honest, firm Wadsworth commonly dos, what advantages will the Town of N. Haven derive from being converted into a City? Mind me--I don't ask what benefits will result to the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council men, and the other city officers from that conversion. Nor do I ask, as if I doubted whether any advantages would flow from it; for I suppose some must have been foreseen, otherwise the change would not have been proposed and made; but really and truly for the sake of information; because I am advised that some gentlemen in Newport have in view to incorporate that town into a City. I wish, Sir, you would give me your sentiments on this subject as soon as may be convenient. And here I can make an easy transition to the favour hinted at in the first page of this Epistle. Be so kind, my good Sir, as to send a printed copy of the Charter of the City of New-Haven to William Channing Esqr. in Newport, if an opportunity should soon offer; or otherwise to your humble servant. I mean that my Newport friends, if it should be concluded to make a city of that town, should be able to avail themselves of as many charters as I can collect and transmit to them. Let me, Sir, ask another favour of you, which I did not think of when I sat down to write. I have a horse, bridle and saddle at my farm in Colchester in the possession of Jesse Billings, which horse &c I could wish to find at Mr. Moore's in Princeton when I shall be there in the beginning of May. Now, Sir, if you should hear of any middle-sized man (my horse is small) who is honest, and coming to the south-ward, and who would ride my said horse moderately, feed him generously on the road, and leave him with Mr. Moore, for the sake of five or six dollars, or nothing, the last would suit me best, I would be obliged to you if you would cause the horse &c to be deliver'd to such a man: provided always that the person shall set out so early as, by moderately riding, to reach the house of the said Moore by the fourth day of May next. If he should get there the 25th or 26th of April it would suit me; but sooner would injure my finances. To give you as little trouble as possible in this matter I shall enclose an order to Mr. Billings to deliver the horse &c to you or your order;(2) so that if you should meet with a person who would take the horse &c to Princeton you will only have to deliver the order to him. Perhaps Mr. Brown, who rides express for the Super-intendant of finance, may be willing to do it for the price mentioned; if he should it would be agreeable to me. He took that horse from Philad. to Colchester for me, the last winter. He asked ten dollars. It was too much. It may be afforded for five or six dolls. now.   Now for a little of politicks. N. Hampshire, Massa., R. Island, Connt., N. York, N. Jersey, Pennsylv., Maryland, Virginia, No. & So. Carol. are represented in Congress. Delaware was represented until lately, when it was resolved that they were disqualified on account of their having sat more than a twelvemonth after the time when they were elected. They were elected the Febry. before last for the year ensuing. We know nothing about Georgia. For the want of a sufficient number of States but little business has been done since I wrote to you; and when we have had nine States, which has been but seldom the case, that variety of opinions which must necessarily take place in a body so constituted as Congress is, has occasioned our progress to be slow indeed. Nothing is yet done with regard to the peace or military establishment. We have made some progress in the business of the Western territory. We have agreed to purchase of the Indians at the ensuing treaty land enough to make, I think, four States, and have appointed five Commissioners to treat with the Indians. They are Genl. Greene, Genl. Clark of Virginia, Genl. Wolcott of Litchfield in your State, Genl. Butler of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Higginson of Massachusetts, who was member of Congress when you was at Princeton. Perhaps another Commissioner may be chosen from N. York to please that State. We have great expectations from the W. territory. It is the opinion of every body, that, if it should be properly disposed of, it would nearly if not altogether discharge the national debt.  Nothing is concluded respecting the peace establishmt. I believe it will be thought necessary to establish a few temporary garrisons at some important posts; but no standing army will ever I trust be admitted. A report is brought in for the reduction of the civil list. It has been on the tapis; but we stumbled at the threshold. The office of chargé des affaires at the Court of Spain was to be discontinued.(3) We could not agree. It was postponed for a report upon foreign arrangements. We have got through the principal part of the last. We have agreed to treat with, I believe, all the powers of Europe on Commercial matters; but are not yet determined who shall be the Commissioners or Ministers. Some are for increasing the present number, some are for striking out one of them agreeably to his repeated requests, and on account of his old age.  When we shall have got through these matters I think we shall adjourn until the next Congressional year. There is a report of considerable magnitude before Congress which may take up some time. It is a requisition on the states to furnish within the present year such part of their deficiencies under the requisition of eight mills. as, with their payments to the close of the last year, will make up three fourths of their original quota thereof: And that these payments be appropriated to the services of the present year 1784. I must not go into the particulars of this report; because nothing   is decided upon it. A letter in answer to the House of Representatives of your State on the commutation has been repeatedly on the carpet; but Congress have not been able as yet to come to a determination.  Your Lower House did I find, by a great majority, refuse the impost at their last Session. Our State did not so much as look at the recommendation at their Session, and I think will never admit it. So. Carolina has not acceded to it; and I imagin some that have complied with it will before it is long repeal their acts. You know my sentiments on this subject. Thus, Sir, in great haste I have given you a hint of the State of Congressional business.  Last Sunday, mirabile dictu, divine service was performed, for the first time since Congress hath been here, by the Church parson of this City. We have appointed, some time ago, a Mr. Jones of Philadelphia chaplain;(4) but he has not as yet arrived here. I have not heard a sermon or a prayer since I have been here. I could have seen & heard plays acted in abundance if I had chosen it. Balls, Routs, and Stage-playing, and card playing are the great business and amusement of this polite City. As for religion ______ ______ ______. A little anecdote may serve, instead of a long tale, to give you some idea of the religious education in this city. One of our Landlord's little daughters was asked by her Mama last Lord's day whether she would go to Church. Yes Mama says she if you will give me a ticket. You know that those who go to plays must have tickets; otherwise they are not admitted.  Please to make my compliments to your lady, Judge Huntington and his lady, and to Mr. Rodman and his lady. If you think that any part of what I have talked to you about on this paper will give any information or diversion to the Judge you may communicate it to him.  I am your sincere friend and humble servant, Wm Ellery  [P.S.] Since I wrote the aforegoing,(5) the report upon foreign arrangements has received so many stabs, and has been mangled so abominably that I am afraid it will die of its wounds. New York is coming forward again with the affair of Vermont. An apprehension that some bills drawn on Amsterdam by the Super-intenddt. of finance has induced Congress to send a pressing requisition to the States for the immediate collection of money.(6) ""

I shall go in the Stage to New York & from thence by Water to Rhode Island Which I apprehend will be the most agreeable to me. I have now but one Horse & I shall sell him here. My best Horse took leave of me yesterday. I cannot learn what his Disorder was. Farewell Philadelphia forever. Farewell all Connection with public Life--I am inexpressibly disgusted with it. I will not promise never to be concerned any more in it--but I am certain If I know wherein my own Happiness consists I shall be unwise to the last Degree. I am neither flattered with my Abilities, nor my Success in the political World. I leave it without Regret--And it will part with me without a Sigh--even without an affectionate Adieu. Yet my earnest Wishes are for its Prosperity. You will not depart in the same Way. You are cursed more bitterly--you are carressed more sincerely. Few--very few are your Friends here in my Opinion. I fear there are too small a Number of Friends to your sentiments in America. Your Letter to the  APRIL 3, 1784  Committee of our State has been published here with the Names of the Subscribers.(2) The Assembly is setting here--And in Consequence of that Letter appointed a Committee it is said to Report on the Propriety of stopping farther Supplies to the Continent. The Letter aforesd, it is said, alarmed them, & that at the same Time they severely reprobate it, they agree that the Sentiments are Right.  Yesterday in a free Conversation with Genl. Armand respecting the Chevalier's leaving this Country, I asked him if he was not to return again--he answered no. But he looked a little consernd--And desired me not to mention it. He made very free Observations upon Marbois. He seems not to be pleased with his Conduct or Character--says he is a Pedant--And he has probably been against the Minister in Order to advance his own Interest. I told him very freely that we had a high Esteem for the Minister--should have been very happy to have had him continued here. But that we could not have the same Confidence in Marbois. That there would be Danger of his endeavoring to make Parties in Congress. That M____ had wrote very illiberally against the Interests of the United States with Respect to continuing the War, & with Respect to the Fisheries--he observed that it was for M____s Interest to have the War continued. That he was engaged in the Flour Trade with the french West Indies--And the longer he enjoyed a Kind of exclusive Priviledge, the more Money he would make. Is it possible that any Man, that any rational being should act from a Principle so infamous? The french here, generally, despise Marbois. They charge him with Haughtiness, Pride of Office, Pedantry, Ambition, &ca. Armand is about returning to Europe I meant that he should have my Sentiments to carry with him. This Conversation took place after Ar____d had taken a chearful Glass. He made this Observation himself; & therefore wish'd what he had mentioned might be confidential.  He farther observed that there was no meaning in the Words Gratitude & Friendship as applied to Nations that were & ought to be governed by what appeared to them to be their Interest. He appears to me to be a Man of no small Address. He has a quick Apprehension--& a pretty good Fund of Knowledge. He will be at Annapolis before this Letter reaches You.  I have had an Opportunity of conversing freely with the D____ M____r.(3) He has observed a very good Line of Conduct in my Opinion since he has been here--& I apprehend he will fall in, fully with the independant Americans. He is much opposed to intrigueing. He has a good Opinion of R____ M____ but says he has very bad Councillors about him. I found he meant G____ M____.(4) He has the same Sentiments of him that I have. I conversed with him freely upon the Cincinnati. His Situation he says is delicate: as he is sensible they pro-  pose to make him an honorary Member. If I have collected his Mind upon the Subject he disapproves of it as much as we do. He says he has had several Letters detained & one or two broke open. He resents it highly--and says if it happens again he will represent it to his Masters for their Instructions. I told him I was happy to find that he resented the Injury done him. I beg you not to show these Observations. He committed them to me confidentially & many more which I have not time to commit to paper as I leave this Place tomorrow early in the Morning.  Be pleased to make my affectionate Regards to Mr. Partridge. Tell him he has a Copy of a Letter, he received of me, which I lament very much, as it will not do for him to enclose it to me. I wish him to keep it till his Return or to commit it to your Care as I may probably see you before I shall him. I wish you sincerely all possible Happiness at the same Time I am sure it is not possible for you to enjoy much. Adieu.  N.B. your Draft for four hundred Dollrs. I delivered to Mr. Hodgdon.  Philadelphia Apl 4th. 1784. I have promised Mr. S. Wharton to write you respecting the Petition that G. Morgan presented to Congress as Agent for New Jersey in Behalf of his Citizens claiming a Tract of Country call'd Indiana.(5) He shew me the Act of N.J. constituting the sd. Morgan Agent &ca--& I must acknowledge that upon farther consideration I don't see how Congress can refuse to constitute a Court to hear & determine the Matter in Dispute. New Jersey appears for her Citizens. Has she not a Right by the Confederation to do it? I apprehend it is a clear Point. It will certainly come before you again and if N.J. takes it up as I am told they will--they have undoubtedly Grounds for Complaint. The Confederation mentions Boundaries, Jurisdiction, and any other Cause whatever. How can you then refuse a Settlement of this Dispute in the amicable Way pointed out by the Confederation. The States have divested themselves of the Power of Reprisals & Congress has this Power exclusively. If the Citizens of one State are injured by another State, or by the Citizens of another--I see no other Remedy but in the Way pointed out by the Confederation. I beleive when you consider the Matter carefully you will think with me--And that if New Jersey perseveres she cannot, without doing an Injury to the Confederation be denied the Right she has to demand a Court. The Words of the Confederation do not leave the Matter to the Option of Congress--but they shall do it.  ""

You must not believe more than one half what you hear. As to my change of principles which you have heard of, the poet would have helped you to account for that, where he establishes it as a Maxim, that  \""Manners change with times  Tenets with books & principles with climes.\""(1) Coming to the gay city of Annapolis where pleasure holds her court, is it to be conceived that I, old & experienced as I am, could be so bad a courtier as not to conform to her customs.

But notwithstanding all this I cannot lay aside old friendships and old attachments.  As to your old fashioned doctrine about personal Ubiquity I wonder how you could think of it or how you could venture to quote Old Allison's (2) logic to me, when you know that, under a signature the truth of which has been admitted by the most hardened tory, I have declared to all the world that there can be two places of permanent residence for the same body. Can that body boast more perfection in its species than I may? Where thus is the impossibility of my possessing at one and the same time two places or if you please two different spaces of permanent residence? And surely you will not deem that care superfluous, which is employed on the place where one is permanently to reside. Besides have you not pointedly proved the absurdity of the doctrine you rashly presumed to maintain in the beginning of your letter, by \""taking leave\"" before you got to the bottom of the next page \""to consider Mrs T and me as the component moieties of an Unit.\"" This is a leave I readily grant, a leave which you have a right to take, exercise and enjoy whenever you please according to the established doctrine of the purest church & best regulated states & this without  APRIL 5, 1784  impugning the dictates of common sense. As therefore it is possible that the component moieties of this Unit may sometimes find it convenient to occupy two spaces at one and the same time, I cannot think of abdicating the house at the corner of Spruce Street, which has for some time been a principal Object of my care.  Were I to part with one or other of the places of my permanent residence, such is my prejudice in favour of old attachments and so far from having laid them aside that I could notwithstanding my growing fondness for Annapolis, much easier part with that house.  I am, Dear Sir, Your sincere old friend & humble Servt  C. T. ""

  Dear Sir, Annapolis April 5th. 1784 By this time I hope your health has been materially benefitted by your voyage to Europe. Our latest Advices from London announce great violence & confusion arising from the contests between Pitt & Fox. In this Country we are more harmonious & composd. The cession of all the territory northwest of the Ohio, belonging to the Virginia, has been formally made by that State & accepted by Congress. Generals Clarke, Wolcot, Green, Butler & Mr. Higgenson are appointed to negociate a treaty & purchase from the Indians their claims, which will secure the settlements in that Country, & enable us to satisfy the demands of the Army, & sink the public debt by the sale of the Lands. A consummation devoutly to be wishd.  I expect, if there is any sense left in the english Nation, they will turn their attention to Lord Shelburne, who I believe is the only man capable of saving their Country from the ruin that threatens it from such Counsellors & Contests.

Colo. Dick & myself agree perfectly in Poloticks & religion; nor are we much discordant in Jocularity & pleasurable amusements--in truth we spend our leizure Hours very agreably & in our Conviviality often regret that circumstances have placed us so far from your Excelly. that we cannot flatter ourselves with the hope of enjoying your  APRIL 6, 1784  good Company, even thro the instrumentality of Monsieur Montgolfiers grand travelling aerial Machine, a Balloon.  Since Colo Dicks arrival,(2) the State can set down easier under the Loss of Mr. Stevens's assistance: Yet I could wish for his presence here; as I am persuaded it would add great respectability to the representation of New Jersey. He is a good man & deserves much of his Country. Should he not be able to Join us before the Middle of May;(3) it will perhaps be adviseable for him, not to come, as in all probability Congress will adjourn by the first of June for the remainder of the Year. This is an Event much to be desired; as it will tend to remove the Idea, entertained by many Jealous Minds; that Congress are assuming powers not warranted by the Confederation & attempting to render themselves a perpetual Body, having no recess. Added to this it will be a considerable saving to the U.S. & I am inclined to believe; the Members will more punctually attend in the succeeding Novr. & set down with greater alacrity & diligence to Business.  Having been Engaged these several days past, in preparing Instructions to our Ministers abroad, for negotiating Treatys of Amity & Commerce, with the several powers, who may be disposed to Treat with us; a question has Arisen; how many & who are necessary & proper to be commissioned for this purpose While some are of opinion that one, or more of the three already in Europe, ought to be recalled; others urge strenuously to add a Fourth thereto: I have as yet grounded no decission on this subject in my Mind; but would wish, that at the same time, we study public oeconomy; we should also carefully guard the public good. I am to request your Excellys Sentiments on this Head; but more particularly what Information you have, of Mr. Jays state of Health, or his wishes to return to America. While Dr. Franklins recall was under debate, it was suggested in the House; that a like indulgence might be plead in favr. of Mr. Jay, whose state of Health & wishes to retire, were equally Cogent with those of the Dr.; both of whose Letters in 83, express this desire in very strong terms. I have however so good an opinion of Mr. Jays Heart & Head (& withall youth being on his side) that if it is not wholly incompatible with his Health, domestic Concerns, or his wishes; I cannot assent to his being recalled. No doubt he has written to Your Excellcy on these points & if not improper, may I beg to be confidentially informed. I have laid Mr. Deare & Mr. Oldens Acct. before Congress, who have been pleased to make the necessary order for its payment.(4) I have nothing new or interesting to Inform you of. I take it for granted you have a detail of our proceedings: as the Secretary has orders to forward to the Executives of all the States the printed Journals of Congress, as fast as they can be prepared. Mr. Dick Joins me in respectfull Comps. to Your Excelly. & Family & I must beg you will present mine to Mr. Bell & family & to the Squire, whose wants I find are still Unsatisfied.

  Dear Sir Annapolis Apr. 6. 1784. I am obliged to you for your query as to the distance from New York to Cayahoga,(1) as it has occasioned my reexamination of that matter & detection of an error of 150 miles. The distances from New York to Niagara I collect from information as follows. from N. York to Albany 164 miles. Oneida 165  Oswego 171 Niagara 180  680  from Niagara to Cayahoga 140 this last distance I collect  820 by measuring on Hutchins's map & reducing that proportionably by the known distance from Niagara to Detroit which is 250 miles.  The Public papers confirm the resignation of Mr. Pitt & his friends. A ship arrrived here, & some others in Philadelphia have brought us a riddle without a key. They received their bounties & drawbacks on clearing out from London as they used to do while we were colonies without any public act authorising it being visible. The custom house officers tendered them, & they were not so rude as to refuse them. The prohibitory proclamation they say is eluded & connived at by government. We have 11 states in Congress & hope by the middle of May to adjourn to November. If any thing prevents this it will be the representation of 8 states of the 11 by 2 members each, who frequently dividing retard business extremely. The inclosed letter was put into my hands with a request to forward it to you.(2) This will be delivered you by Monsr. de Hogendorff, a relation of Mr. Van Berckel's.

  Dear Sir, Annapolis 8th April 1784.  I am extremely sorry to hear, of your bad success in Navigation during the Winter. I observed under the New-York head that Dennison had arrived there in a Brig which I suppose belonged to your Company, but have not heared any thing of the Vessel you mention to be missing--the severity of the winter, surpassed any thing I ever remember to have seen--the Accts. from the northward mention that the shipping have suffered very much on that coast. The letter you sent: to me for Doctor Middleton, I enclosed to him by the return of the same post, to Alexandria, requesting him to give me an Answer immediately & inform me if he would accept & pay Doctor Loomiss's draft on him.(1) Upon farther inquiry I found there was a private post, which went, within two miles of his fathers house, with whom he lived--least the letter I wrote him by Alexandria should not get to his hands soon I wrote to him by that post to the same purpose.  In consequence of my last letter he came to Town on Saturday last. I met him at the Tavern--he told me he had not recd. Doctor Loomiss's letter, which I sent to Alexandria, that my letter informed him of his having drawn a Bill upon him, but that he could not possibly Accept it, and become liable for the debt. He said the money was due from two Gentlemen, one of whom lived near, but was out of Cash, the other at some distance, & he did not know whither he could pay or not. He was then proceeding to tell me how the Debt was contracted; I told him it was foreign from the Subject, all I wanted was to  APRIL 8, 1784  know whether he would accept & pay the draft. He again told me would not Accept it & be liable for the Debt, but if he could collect the money he would pay it to me. He said he would go to Alexandria to get Docr. Loomiss's letter, would answer it & enclose it to me, to forward; it has not yet come to hand; I shall not seal this letter till Just before the post goes out that I may send his letter if it comes. I must now beg leave to call your attention to my situation which is truly distressing. I brought with me from Carolina in cash & indigo about 500 Dollars. My Expences have far exceeded that sum, of course I am very much behind hand in paying the different debts which I owe. To add to my mortification I recd. about three weeks ago from No. Carolina some paymasters bills which were in payment for two hundred bles of Tar, I had purchased & paid for before I came away, and were to have been shipped in October last, for Philadelphia for me; but Mr. Hawks seeing no prospect of the Tar being shipped to me agreed to sell it for these bills at 2/. less pr. ble than I gave for it. Two of the bills amounting to near ninety Dolls. I disposed of here for Cash, and inclosed the others to Mr. Barr to get the money for. The two I disposed of were sent back by the return of the post, for non Acceptance there being no money in the Treasury--having paid away the money I recd. for them, I found myself very much embarrassed, & was obliged to borrow the money to take them up. As I have not the least expectation of receiving any money for the bill on Doctor Middleton--I have no hopes of relief from my disagreeable situation (unless I get Cash for the paymasters bills) untill you forward me a Bill on Baltimore or Philadelphia, which I request you would do so as soon as possible, for the whole amt. if convenient, but at least for one half. The Members talk of adjourning Congress by the middle or end of May; at which time I expect to return home (unless the amt. I may receive from your Brother, to whom I have wrote on the subject, respecting some particulars, should be different from what I expect). I have at present no horses, they are scarce & high priced at this place. I wish to purchase them some time before I set of[f] for Carolina, indeed I find myself at a great loss for want of them at present, to take the necessary exercise. If I am obliged to buy them on an emergency, I shall not only be obliged [to] take any horses, but give a much higher price for them. I have not enclosed Doctor Loomiss's Draft on Doctor B. Middleton. I shall keep it till I hear from you, perhaps he may collect the money & pay it before Congress adjourn--however you will give me such directions as you may think proper. Present my Compliments to Mrs. Blount & Your Brother Tom, if at Washington. I am, Dear Sir, With Respect & Esteem, Your most Obt. Hum. Servt.  Richd. D. Spaight N.B. You will please give me an answer, as soon as possible.

  Sir Annapolis Apr. 9. 1784.  No authentic intelligence from Europe. Public papers as late as the 27th. of January state Mr. Pitt & his associates as still in office, but having a decided majority against them in the House of commons. The king seems well affected to them, & the city of London also. He probably would dissolve the commons in hopes of getting a new house under the influence of his ministry; but the commons have not made the annual grant of supplies as yet, & thus perplex the purposes of the king. Some captains of vessels who have come to this place & Philadelphia say they had the bounties & drawbacks paid them on clearing out from London without knowing by what authority; for no such order was public. A letter from Mr. Bingham, now in London, of late date is of a different complexion. He states the purpose of Gr. Britain to be that of adhering to the policy of the king's proclamation. He sais too that Spain has laid such duties as amount to a prohibition on all articles which we can send them & which they can get from any other quarter: that Portugal has absolutely prohibited our flour. If these be facts I suppose we shall have further information of them.  We are now 11 states present, 8 of whom are represented by 2 delegates only. We are laying our shoulders to three objects 1. Foreign treaties of amity & commerce. 2. the annual account & requisitions. 3. Western territory. I am not satisfied that Congress can give a decided vote on either of these propositions. The 1st was damped the other day by an important part of the subject being lost for want of an individual vote only. It will be tried again.1 The 2d is much canvassed. The report of the grand committee on that subject explains itself.(2) But every part of it requires nine votes. A question is made whether we  APRIL 9, 1784  ought to pay the interest now in arrears, or consolidate it into the principal & only pay interest in future annually. Some think it more just to pay what we can, & let that be applied to the interest from the beginning as far as it will go. What will be the vote of Congress I cannot say. The third subject, Western territory, requiring only 7 votes perhaps we may agree in that. In any event, we shall adjourn. If the important business shall have been previously settled, I shall be happier than I expect to be. If we cannot pass an effective vote, the states must be informed that it proceeds from the absence of some states, and a want of an effectual representation from others: I mean such a representation as will always give a vote positive or negative. Excuse this hasty communication which the unexpected arrival & sudden departure of the post obliges me to write in Congress while much called off by what is passing in it.

The Motion was referred to the Committee which was appointed to report the necessary arrangements &c.(1) The Committee reported among other things that the Troops now at West Point be employed for the purpose of Garrisoning the Frontier Posts. Whether the House will agree to is uncertain. We are very sensible that it would be exceeding disagreeable to our State to have our Posts Garrisoned by Troops chiefly Massachusetts.(2) We conceive that as matters are now Situated in Congress it would be improper to move for the Judgement of Congress what number of Troops are necessary for our State to keep up to Garrison our Posts, but we expect to be better able to determine what to do in that matter when the House have decided on the report of the Committee for Arrangements.  We have as yet made no motion in Congress respecting Vermont, (3) but have reason to believe from appearances that it is the determina- APRIL 9, 1784  tion of the Delegates in general not to do anything about that matter, expecting that in Time we shall be Obliged to consent that the New Hampshire Grants become a separate State.

I suppose such State will be divided into Townships of about ten Miles Square and each Township into a hundred rights but the mode is not yet fully settled. Requisitions will be made on the states for payment of the Interest due on Continental Securities up to the first of last January. It is hoped that the Continental Impost will take place for payment of the Interest after that time, a majority of the States have vested Congress with  APRIL 9, 1784  power to collect the Impost recommended by the resolution of the 18th of April last.  There is no remarkable news here. We have had a very severe Winter. The snow has been gone but a few days. I shall be glad to hear from you, Letters may be Sent without any expence of Postage. Please to present my compliments to Sister Gibbs.  I am with due regards Your humble Servant, Roger Sherman ""

  Dear sir Annapolis 9th April 1784  Your favour of 20th March came to hand by this days Post. I wrote you by the last that Mr Smith does not propose paying the Note,(1) giving for Reason that Mr Blount has accepted an Order on Banks or Hunter Banks & Co for Tobacco to the Amot. which order is not returned & that Banks has charged him with the Tobacco. I recd. nothing less than I expected on that Note, hence I was not disappointed. I think I have Cash Enough to serve me till the Time when I expect to return to the State and therefore would not wish that you should put yourself to the smallest Inconvenience in making Remittances. At any rate if I should have occasion for more mony and should give you Notice of the same, I hope you will not by any means send me any public Bills, or Bills on our Treasury. While in Public Office I do not wish to touch one of them lest, if mony is scarce in the Treasury, which is generally the Case, some Body should complain, if I was paid, that partiality was used. If I should chance to need any Mony I can borrow it in Philada & the Remittances can be made thither to repay it with sufficient Ease. The Time of my present Delegation expires within 5 Weeks or thereabouts viz on the 13th of May. If the State should honor me with another appointmt, It is not probable that I shall continue longer than to the End of May at which Time I expect that Congress will adjourn.  If you have vested any of my Cash or rather Paper in Rum to prevent depretiation I hope you will not leave the Accot. open to be at my Choice which I shall Take the Rum or the Mony. If you can afford to pay Mony to be paid at any Time in Philad. I certainly would prefer it. Therefore you may take the Rum or other Articles to your own Accot, on the Condition that you are not in danger of loosing by it. You will be pleased to make the Entry in your Books accordingly. Since my last  APRIL 10, 1784  we have not a single Syllable of News. I have the Honor to be with the utmost Regard, Dr. Sr., Your obedt. hble Servt., Hu Williamson  ""

  Dear Chancellor Annapolis April 10, 1784 I have waited ever since I left New York to find proper materials to write you a letter. You might reasonably expect that you would be one of the first among my Friends to receive a letter From me, yet that is not the case, I have filled several sheets of paper already to other friends, and this is the First to you. You must be sensible Sir that it is not because you are farther from my Heart, but my Head was so barren that I was ashamed to send a letter containing nothing, and such is the case yet, there is nothing worthy your notice that I can communicate. I am exceedingly diffident in Congress, there appear to be many wise men in this Body, though some dont appear to have the greater abilities that ever I saw.

  Sir, Annapolis Apl. 10th 1784  I have taken the liberty to draw upon you in favour of Mr. Joseph West,(1) now of Baltimore but formerly of our State, for one hundred dollars, which I trust will be punctually paid, as he hath been so kind as to advance me that sum and the credit of the Government is pledged for the payment of it.  As this bill will not be sufficient to pay my expenses and take me home I shall be obliged soon to draw for the whole of the grant made  APRIL 10, 1784  me the last session of Assembly; and I could wish that the Treasurer might be desired to retain money enough in his hands to satisfy my bills when they shall be presented. The holy scriptures say that the love of money is the root of all evil, or some thing like it. The want of it is, I know by experience, the cause of a multitude of evils.  Congress have before them, the affairs of Western territory, foreign arrangements, the civil list, and we may soon enter upon a peace or military establishment. A requisition also to furnish such part of the deficiency of the eight million requisition as, with the payments to the close of the last year, will make up 3/4 of the quotas on the several States, is on the tapis. Considerable progress hath been made in the first; the second has received some discussion; but opinions are so various that I am suspicious we shall not soon come to a decision. The civil list will I think be in some measure reduced; but it is exceedingly difficult to remove officers or lower salaries. It will be judged necessary, I believe, to establish for a time some troops at suitable posts in the Western territory, and to keep up a few men to guard our public stores, but no standing army. A majority of Congress are for the requisition; but as the report provides that the several legislatures may be admitted so to model the sums called for as that the one half being paid on actual money, the other may be discharged by procuring discounts of interests with our domestic creditors; only taking care that the collection of money shall proceed at least in equal pace with the operations of discount; and as the States to the southward of Pennsylvania have loaned but a small sum to the public, compared with the States to the northward; and as there is still a hankering after an impost I am afraid that nine States will not be persuaded to embrace the report in its present form. It is almost impossible to subdue prejudices, and destroy the influence of local attachments.  This requisition is alluded to in a late circular letter to the States (2) pressing them to an immediate collection of money to prevent the loss of credit which must attend the protest for non-payment of bills drawn on Holland by the Super-intendant of finance, which it seems had been protested for non-acceptance. I have my suspicions on this head. I don't believe that those bills will be protested for non-payment. However if that letter should stimulate some of the very delinquent States into exertion I should rejoice. Our State in my opinion has been always quite forward enough. Let more opulent, and more extensive States take the lead.  Our State will receive a resolution, before you will receive this letter, recommending to the several States to appoint their delegates to take their seats on the first Monday in November annually, agreeably to the fifth article of confederation.(3) This mode I hope will be adopted, as it will prevent great inconveniencies.   A standing Committee of qualifications is appointed, and the Delegates of Delaware have agreeably to a report of that Committee been deemed disqualified to hold their seats.(4) They were appointed, twelve months last February, for the ensuing year.  If Congress should not adjourn by the first Wednesday in May, our qualifications to sit beyond that time may be called in question, and perhaps our seats may be vacated;(5) altho' there is an act of the State which I conceive would justify our sitting until we shall be relieved. All the States, excepting Delaware & Georgia, are now represented in Congress, and it is expected that delegates from the first will soon be in Congress. I hope we shall be able to finish or put the most important business in train so that Congress may adjourn by the middle of May to the first Monday in November.  The minister of France a few days ago laid before Congress the extract of a letter written 24th Decr. 1783 to the Chevalier la Luzerne by the Count de Vergennes, of which the following is I believe a just translation.(6)  His Majesty hath decided in a manner irrevocable that the Port of L'Orient shall be free and that American navigators may actually consider it as such. The Edict of the King hath not however, been published; because the intention of his Majesty being to give to this establishment all possible extension, the regulations must after a mature examination be framed in such a manner that the advantages granted to the merchants of the United States may not essentially prejudice our commerce and the revenues of the State.  The merchants of the United States may equally enjoy the liberty to frequent the ports of Marseilles and of Dunkirk, and they shall partake like other nations of the franchises and privileges of these two places.  It is probable that France will give some indulgencies to our trade to their W. India islands. I am confident She will grant to our trade every privilege that is not incompatible with her views of naval aggrandizement. The report on foreign arrangements proposes commercial treaties with every power that is concerned with commerce.(7) If this report succeeds, Britain thereby and in consequence of measures which may be adopted by France, I imagin will be brot to see the error of her ways, and take up a more liberal line of commercial conduct. However this may be: By multiplying the avenues of trade, we shall always have some to report to if several of them should be obstructed.  Please to present my compliments to Mrs. Bowen and all friends. I am with great consideration, Your most hble servant, William Ellery ""

It was not my Idea or that of any Gentleman in the Delegation to introduce the complaint of Mr Cammel to the view of Congress, if justice to our Citizens could be obtained by any other means.(1) I am happy to be informed by your Excellency that the business is in a train that promises so amicable a conclusion.  Since the Arrival of the Washington we have received no official communications from Europe. A report prevails that the new Ministry have not been able to continue in office.  The opposition from Mr Fox has been so powerfull that a vote passd the House of Commons that Mr Pitt & his Associates did not possess the Confidence of the Nation. The King it is said was much embarrass'd whether to support the Ministry; he should not dissolve the parliment.  I observe from an Act of the Legislature of Pensylvania that the Month of June is fixed on for running the line between that state & Virga.(2) This is an event in which we are so deeply interested that I am sure your Excellency will excuse me for the enquiry I make; Who are the Commissioners on our part, and whether those who have been appointed will act. Should either of them decline it, I will take the liberty  APRIL 10, 1784  of recommending to the Executive Doctr. Williamson now in Congress from No Carolina.  His attachment to the interest of the Southern States may I think be rely'd on in every instance where they clash with the Middle & Eastern ones.

  Gentlemen Annapolis April 10th. 1784.  Having heretofore wrote divers Letters to his Excellency Benja. Harrison, but no reason existing that can induce me to suppose they have ever come to hand I can but imagine that some wickedly dispos'd Persons have intercepted all my correspondance, a practice become but too common by the relax'd morals of our people--to the great scandal of all government--I have therefore determin'd in order to deceive those villains, to open a new source of communication, which I hope will continue during the Month in which it is my duty to write official Letters, unsuspected & of course safe.(1) Enclos'd is a Report of a grand Committee on the requisitions for the current year, acted  APRIL 10, 1784  upon altho' not yet pass'd.(2) I coud wish for information on the statement mark'd A which is an apportionment of 1,200,000, to compleat the payment of Interest on Loan Office Certificates. Has any Tax ever been laid by the State of Virginia for its payment? If there has not been I cou'd wish to oppose the idea alltogether for 2 reasons. 1. The state must pay this Sum in Specie as she has not among her Citizens above 300,000 Dollars out of 11,000,000, & the Requisition on which this sum is call'd for is intended manifestly to enable the States to relieve their own Citizens. We will not allow any Complaints from them to reach Congress. 2dly. The Circumstances of our Citizens will not permit our paying up all the arrears of interest at this moment--& certainly whoever considers the history of the loan Office debt, will agree that if ever they get paid, they will have brought their Money to a good market.  I am also against the clause marked B. for two reasons. 1. We are to pay ourselves first & every deficiency is to be borne by Foreign Creditors--which woud be a breach of faith & in fact it is intended to make the Southern States pay all the Foreign Debt. 2dly. It will give the Northern States great facility, who have settled all the accts. of Individuals, with the Continent, the Southern States have not of course have no Contl. Securities & they must in fact give more than their proportion in Taxes being oblig'd to sell their property for specie to pay those Taxes, when the others are allow'd to sell for certificates.  A System for making Treaties in Europe is now before Congress and will possibly pass.(3) The Delegation will I believe give their assent if we are properly represented in the Commission.

  Dear Sir. Annapolis April 10. 1784.  I have just recd. your Excellencys private letter to me. I beg of you to write on the back of private letters that they are so, otherwise they may be consider'd as the property of the delegation & open'd by ei- APRIL 12, 1784  ther of the Gentn. in my absence. This however was not the case in this instance. A total change almost of the late delegation depriv'd us in the absence of Mr Mercer of a knowledge of what had been done on the subject of the Negroes & from the want of that knowledge I urg'd the propriety of sending some person to N. York to procure information. Comrs were appointed it is true & a list was kept of many who went but whether of all or not is doubtful. I suspect not. What had been done (for the books of the Comrs. are in their own possession in N York & the Secry knows nothing about it)1 as stated by Mr. Mercer, I intended writing had not you been previously inform'd. The number is very inferior to what were lost in five or six counties in our State altho' it contains those of all the States to the south. The great questions wh. I mention'd to you in a former letter are still before us, are of consequence to the fOEderal interest & must therefore have the preference to any wh. relate only to particular States. Besides I think it best not to take up this question untill we hear of the signature of the definitive treaty. I shall however most certainly pay great attention to this business & seize in conjunction with my colleagues the favorable moment to bring it on. I am particularly thankful for your communications to me on this & every other subject & can assure you that if I do not perform what shod. be done it will be more from ignorance than design.

  Dear Sir, Annapolis April 12, 1784  Your favors of Jany. 13th & 26th, are before me. I thank you for the information contained in them; & it shall be my endeavour to turn the same to public account. It gave me pleasure to learn that General Greene had spent a week in Providence & been suitably noticed by his old friends--too much attention can scarcely be paid to a character so meritorious.  The Minister of France, who stopped here the last week on his way to General Washingtons in Virginia, laid a note before Congress con- APRIL 12, 1784  taining information that his most Christian Majesty had finally established Port L'orient a free port; & resolved to admit the Americans to the freedom of Dunkirk & Marseilles in common with other nations.(1) The paper No. 1 contains copy of the act of N. Jersey adopting the 5 pr Cent Impost.(2) You will observe that 'till the measure shall be adopted by all the States they have declared all their ports--free.  The paper No. 2 contains copy of a report of a Committee of Congress on the Subject of an Ordinance for collecting the Impost recommended on the 3d of Feby. 1781.(3) The States are now generally astonished that they should ever have been led into such an error as to give Congress the vast & uncontroulable powers contained in this ordinance. Virginia, South Carolina & North-Carolina repealed their hasty grants, as did the lower house of Massachusetts--Georgia & Rhode Island never granted the request of Congress.  I have transmitted you the acts of seven States adopting the Impost recommended on the 18th day of April 1783. Should some more comply & bring the measure near to a crisis I expect that some States will repeal these acts as they did the former. Virginia, I am told is divided nearly into two equal parties on this measure; so that when one party gets the upper hand an Impost is granted, & when the other suceeds the grant is revoked; which will prevail in their next House is uncertain. State Imposts from 2 to 2½ pr Cent have generally taken place; & unless the meeting of the Cincinnati in Philadelphia next month strikes out some extraordinary political manoeuvres, I expect that the last impost will share the fate of the first.  The paper No. 3 contains copy of the report of a Committee of Congress on a military establishment in time of peace.(4) On this I need make no comment--unless it be to remark that as the Ordinance No. 2 shews you in what manner the Impost was to have been collected--so the military peace establishment No. 3 shews you to what use the money raised was to have been applied. I chose to put these two together, because it has long been observed that Imposts & excises in the hands of the Sovereign power & standing armies have grown up together & yielded mutual support to each other.  I have enclosed also in paper No. 4 copy of some notes on the establishment of a money mint & coinage for the U. States.(5) These notes were occasioned by a long Letter on the Subject from the Superintendant of Finance to Congress--copy of which I sent to Mr. John Brown when at Congress before; to which I beg leave to refer.(6) Nothing can be brought to a close on this business before the recess proposed.  By the printed paper No. 5 you will see that Pennsylvania has opened her land-office & receives of her citizens in payment--certificates of depreciation, Loan-office certificates, certificates for pay & commutation, Commissaries, quartermasters & Forage masters certificates &c, &c.7 This must not only give relief to her citizens who are  APRIL 13, 1784  public creditors but prove a great resource to the State: By such means the States which have such vast tracts of wild land to dispose of may buy up the public securities & eventually reduce their sister States to the condition of tributaries. These are the States too which so pertenaciously insist that the revenues to be derived from commerce should be thrown into common stock. Sure I am that if our State parts with its advantage in point of revenue from trade, it must soon succumb under its burdens & dwindle into insignificance.  I have sent you these papers to be laid before the Hon. the Genl. Assembly at their meeting in May. I pray you to present herewith my most dutiful respects & to assure them of my careful attention to their interests.  With perfect consideration, I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, your most obedient & very hble Servt, David Howell  P.S. Since writing the above the door-keeper has brought me the report on Paper No. 6, by which you will see that plans for a peace establishment are contracting to a less Scale as the prospect of a Continental Impost vanishes.(8) N.B. I pray you to excuse inaccuracies & bad writing. I have not time, thro' hurry of business, to copy at present--& I hate it, if I had.  ""

  My dear Son Gerret. Annapolis, Apr. 13, 1784.  I never felt more happy at any place than I do this day here, by the receipt of a pkg of letters from my dear family, which Mr. Eltinge has been so good as to convey to me in so direct a manner that they have  APRIL 13, 1784  been but fourteen days coming from your remote Northern clime [Kingston] which is abt 340 miles distant from this place. I have read them over and over, and kissed every one of them instead of the dear lips that have drop't the affectionate language contained in them. As I have not a single doubt remaining with me of your exertions as a young man of business, I shall not say anything on that subject, leaving it entirely to you and your uncle with the advice of my other children to do as you please; and therefore this letter will be only calculated to give you a little information which may gratify your curiosity. Sometimes I write a long letter to one, sometimes to another of my children for I consider the letters I write as addressed to all, and tho I love you I would not have you flatter yourself that I love you best, because this may be the longest letter that goes from me at this time. I sent a packet of letters from Philadelphia when on my way to this place, which I trust you have by this time received.1 I wrote a history to my dear Anna,(2) which I suppose will afford you some amusement. I am now going to give you an account of this place: Annapolis is a small city beautifully situated on the great Chesepeake Bay which affords a most grand prospect and is a striking evidence of the greatness of its Maker, there are many ordinary buildings and some very elegent ones; The State House in which Congress sits is the most superb, it is thought, in any of the United States. A place of little business and it is thought will never much increase. Baltimore is the flourishing town and very handsomely situated, Cousin Thomas DeWitt now keeps a Coffee House there, he and his little fat wife both look exceeding well, they treated me with great kindness and were extremely glad to see me.  I am now going on another subject: When I was in New York one day, being invited by Col. Lean to dine I was there introduced to a Mr. VanHogendorp, a young gentleman from Holland, but old in understanding, he is about your age. I saw no more of him 'till I came to Philadelphia where he visited me more than once at my lodgings, and we dined together at the Dutch Minister's who is related to him. He seems to be attached to me and I confess I love the youth to a very great degree; as well as my beloved Dutch Minister who treated me with more politeness than I could ever expect from such an exalted character. Mr. Hogandorp and I came in the same stage from Philadelphia to this place, and in our travels he never seemed to be better satisfied than in my company, by which I at last considered him almost as a child of my own. He has now gone to visit Genl Washington who lives about 50 miles from this place, when he returns his intention is to take a tour up the North River. APRIL 15, 1784  I have at his request given him introductory letters for Esopus, Albany and Schenectady.(3) He has only one to my family which is to your Br Jemmy Hasbrouck who must necessarily see him first at Kingston as he proposes in his return to visit you. I am satisfied you will be pleased with him. It is now 11 o'clock at night. Mr. Hogendorp tells me it will be about May when he goes up the River. He is of one of the first families in Holland and is greatly respected in this place and Philadelphia. He showed me his letter to Gen Washington from Mr. Franklin which recommended him highly.

  Annapolis 16th April 1784 I am this day, Madam, favoured with your Letter of the 19th of March, & embrace the earliest Oppertunity of informing You, that it is highly probable, Congress will make their Arrangements for negotiating commercial Treaties this Week.(1) The Subject has several Months been prepared for Deliberation, but this has been prevented by the Want of a full Representation; untill of late, there being eleven states on the Floor, the Matter has been much discussed. I think it not improbable, that the Report, which provides, that a Number of commercial Negotiations shall be set on Foot, under the joint Direction of Messrs Adams, Franklin & Jay, will be accepted; upon our consenting that Mr Jefferson of Virginia, who has an excellent character, & has been always on the most friendly Terms with Mr Adams, shall be added to the Commissioners. I cannot however Madam, give You the fullest Assurance on this head, as some States are opposed to augmenting the Number of the Ministers, & seem to insist on accepting the Resignation of Doctor Franklin, & on appointing Governor Jefferson to fill the Vacancy. This is a point I should be disposed to push, was it practicable; but as I know it is not, at the present Crisis, the Addition appears to me a desirable object, more especially, as Mr Jay will probably return. Under these circumstances, unless You have particular Reasons for wishing to take passage in Capt Callahan, it may be best to have every Thing in Readiness to embark on the shortest Notice, but not to engage positively to take a Cabin; lest, when the Ship is ready for the Sea, You should find the Measure inconvenient. If the Matter should be thus conducted, & You receive no further Information, You can proceed or not, as You may judge expedient; & should You determine in the Negative, You will probably not loose much Time, by taking Passage on the next Vessel, & will have an equal Chance for favorable Weather.(2) I am very unhappy to hear of the Death of Colo Quincey. He was [a] Gentleman for whom I had the greatest Respect, & I sincerely condole with the Ladies of his Family & with all his Friends. I have been somewhat explicit on the Subject of Your going to Europe, that You may give our Friend some Information by Callahan, should You not proceed in his Vessel, & that Mr Jay may be thus prevented, if possible, from returning. I would write a Line to Mr Adams with the greatest Pleasure, but I have a dozen Letters to answer by this  APRIL 16, 1784  post, & must defer the Matter untill I can give him more satisfactory Information. Inclosed is the Pamphlet You have mentioned.(3) Mr Jennings' two Publications4 are here but they exceed the Bulk admitted to be carryed by the post, under the Denomination of a packet.

 Thomas Jefferson to Benjamin Harrison Sir Annapolis Apr. 16. 1784. I wrote you by the last post (1) that some objections had been started in debate on the justice of that part of the national debt which consists in loan office certificates. The doubt was new to me. I had always considered this to be as honest a debt as any we owed: perhaps a more tender one in most cases, as being due to daughters, to younger children, to widows &c. It proved in event to be the doubt of only two or three individuals in Congress, every state, & every other individual establishing the demand when put to the vote. We have obtained a reduction of the general requisitions from about four millions & a half of dollars to about two & a half. The quota of Virginia stood at about 860,000; and now stands at about five hundred & sixty or seventy thousand dollars. (I mention round numbers, not having the exact sums in my possession at present.) I can assure you this was getting as low as could be proposed without professing a bankruptcy. I hope therefore our state, heavy as this demand is, will seriously encounter it. The report sent you2 will have informed you she is much in arrears. The idea of adjournment is at present for about the middle or end of May. We have no foreign intelligence. I have the honour to be with very great esteem, Your Excellency's Most obedt. humble servt.

  Dear Sir Annapolis April. 16. 1784. I received your favor of the 8th inst. by Colo. Harrison.(1) The subject of it is interesting, and, so far as you have stood connected with it, has been matter of anxiety to me: because whatever may be the ultimate fate of the institution of the Cincinnati, as in it's course it draws to it some degree of disapprobation, I have wished to see you stand on ground separated from it; and that the character which will be handed to future ages at the head of our revolution may in no instance be compromitted in subordinate altercations. The subject has been at the point of my pen in every letter I have written to you; but has been still restrained by a reflection that you had among your friends more able counsellors, and in yourself one abler than them all. Your letter has now rendered a duty what was before a desire, and I cannot better merit your confidence than by a full and free communication of facts and sentiments as far as they have come within my observation. When the army was about to be disbanded, and the officers to take final leave, perhaps never again to meet, it was natural for men who had accompanied each other through so many scenes of hardship, of difficulty and danger, who in a variety of instances must have been rendered mutually dear by those aids and good offices to which their situations had given occasion, it was natural I say for these to seize with fondness any propositions which promised to bring them together again at certain and regular periods. And this I take for granted was the origin and object of this institution: and I have no suspicion that they foresaw, much less intended those mischeifs which exist perhaps in the forebodings of politicians only. I doubt however whether in it's execution it would be found to answer the wishes of those who framed it, and to foster those friendships it was intended to preserve. The members would be brought together at their annual assemblies no longer to encounter a common enemy, but to encounter one another in debate and sentiment. Something I suppose is to be done at those meetings, and however unimportant, it will suffice to produce difference of opinion, contradiction and irritation. The way to make friends quarrel is to pit them in disputation under the public eye. An experience of near twenty years has taught me that few friendships stand this test; and that public assemblies where every one is free to speak and to act, are the most powerful looseners of the bands of private friendship. I think therefore that this institution would fail of it's principal object, the perpetuation of the personal friendships con- tracted thro' the war. The objections of those opposed to the institution shall be briefly sketched; you will readily fill them up. They urge that it is against the Confederation; against the letter of some of our constitutions; against  APRIL 16, 1784  the spirit of them all, that the foundation, on which all these are built, is the natural equality of man, the denial of every preeminence but that annexed to legal office, and particularly the denial of a preeminence by birth;--that however, in their present dispositions, citizens might decline accepting honorary instalments into the order, a time may come when a change of dispositions would render these flattering; when a well directed distribution of them might draw into the order all the men of talents, of office and wealth; and in this case would probably procure an ingraftment into the government; that in this they will be supported by their foreign members, and the wishes and influence of foreign courts; that experience has shewn that the hereditary branches of modern governments are the patrons of privilege and prerogative, and not of the natural rights of the people, whose oppressors they generally are; that besides these evils which are remote, others may take place more immediately; that a distinction is kept up between the civil and military which it is for the happiness of both to obliterate; that when the members assemble they will be proposing to do something, and what that something may be will depend on actual circumstances; that being an organized body, under habits of subordination, the first obstructions to enterprize will be already surmounted; that the moderation and virtue of a single character has probably prevented this revolution from being closed as most others have been by a subversion of that liberty it was intended to establish; that he is not immortal, and his successor or some one of his successors at the head of this institution may adopt a more mistaken road to glory. What are the sentiments of Congress on this subject, and what line they will pursue can only be stated conjecturally. Congress as a body, if left to themselves, will in my opinion say nothing on the subject. They may however be forced into a declaration by instructions from some of the states or by other incidents. Their sentiments, if forced from them, will be unfriendly to the institution. If permitted to pursue their own tract, they will check it by side blows whenever it comes in their way, and in competitions for office on equal or nearly equal ground will give silent preferences to those who are not of the fraternity. My reasons for thinking this are: 1. The grounds on which they lately declined the foreign order proposed to be conferred on some of our citizens.(2) 2. The fourth of the fundamental articles of constitution for the new states. I inclose you the report.(3) It has been considered by Congress, recommitted and reformed by a Committee according to the sentiments expressed on other parts of it, but the principle referred to having not been controverted at all, stands in this as in the original report. It is not yet confirmed by Congress. 3. Private conversations on this subject with the members. Since the receipt of your letter I have taken occasion to extend these; not indeed to the military   members, because being of the order delicacy forbade it; but to the others pretty generally; and among these I have found but one who is not opposed to the institution, and that with an anguish of mind, tho' covered under a guarded silence, which I have not seen produced by any circumstance before. I arrived at Philadelphia before the separation of the last Congress, and saw there and at Princeton some of it's members not now in delegation. Burke's peice happened to come out at that time which occasioned this institution to be the subject of conversation.(4) I found the same impression made on them which their successors have received. I hear from other quarters that it is disagreeable generally to such citizens as have attended to it, and therefore will probably be so to all when any circumstance shall present it to the notice of all. This Sir is as faithful an account of sentiments and facts as I am able to give you. You know the extent of the circle within which my observations are at present circumscribed; and can estimate how far, as forming a part of the general opinion, it may merit notice, or ought to influence your particular conduct. It remains now to pay obedience to that part of your letter which requests sentiments on the most eligible measures to be pursued by the society at their next meeting. I must be far from pretending to be a judge of what would in fact be the most eligible measures for the society. I can only give you the opinions of those with whom I have conversed, and who, as I have before observed, are unfriendly to it. They lead to these conclusions. 1. If the society proceeds according to it's institution, it will be better to make no applications to Congress on that subject, or on any other in their associated character. 2. If they should propose to modify it so as to render it unobjectionable, I think this would not be effected without such a modification as would amount almost to annihilation; for such would it be to part with it's inheritability, it's organisation and it's assemblies. 3. If they should be disposed to discontinue the whole it would remain with them to determine whether they would chuse it to be done by their own act only, or by a reference of the matter to Congress, which would infallibly produce a recommendation of total discontinuance.(5) You will be sensible, Sir, that these communications are without all reserve. I supposed such to be your wish, and mean them but as materials, with such others as you may collect, for your better judgment to work on. I consider the whole matter as between ourselves alone, having determined to take no active part in this or any thing else which may lead to altercation, or disturb that quiet and tranquillity of mind to which I consign the remaining portion of my life. I have been thrown back by events on a stage where I had never more thought to appear. It is but for a time however, and as a day labourer, free to withdraw or be withdrawn at will. While I remain I shall pursue in silence   the path of right; but in every situation public or private shall be gratified by all occasions of rendering you service and of convincing you there is no one to whom your reputation and happiness are dearer than to, Sir, Your most obedient & most humble servt,  Th. Jefferson (6) ""

I have the pleasure of receiving a line from you of the first inst and am very happy to learn that you enjoy the inestimable blessing of health, and notwithstanding my removal so far Southward in a climate new to many of us, and being rather shy of intermitting fevers, which we were told were frequent here,(2) I enjoy good health. The situation of this place has not the appearance of unhealthyness, it stands on good dry rising ground and near the Chesepeake Bay, but on the East shore which is about 10 miles accross we are told the land lies very low which subjects the inhabitants to intermittent fevers. We talk of adjourning Congress on the 26th of next month and appoint a Committee of States, if so we shall not stay here until very hot weather commences. I believe this winter has been severe throughout every part of the World where there is winter if we can give credit to the accounts we see in the public prints. I saw several places on the road, even in Maryland not a great distance from this place on my way here heeps of snow three or four feet deep, they inform me it has been in Maryland about 3 feet on a level.

  Sir Annapolis 19th April 1784 In requesting the Attention of Congress to the following Statement  APRIL 19, 1784  Portrait of Edward Hand  of my late situation as an officer in the Line of their Army I hope I shall not be charged with an improper Interference with the important business which is now before them. I have delayed this Application to the present time in expectation that the principal Reports on the Files would have been acted upon before any matters relative to Individuals, but as that has not been the case & as an Adjournment will probably take place in a Short time I am obliged in order to have my Accounts Setled; to state to Congress some claims which I believe are founded in Justice but which cannot be Allowed by the Pay-Master General (1) without their special direction. In the Years 1777-78 & 79 I was honored with separate Commands on the Frontiers of Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York as will appear by a resolution of Congress of the 10th April 1777 (2) and the Inclosed letters No. 1, 2, 3, & 4.(3)  These commands obliged me to incur very heavy Additional expences. By a review of my situation as late Adj't General, and of the Staff Appointments of the late Army, it will appear that I am the only Officer taken from the Line who has not had a compensation for Extra-Duty. My duties as Adjt. General were laborious and required such constant Attention that I seldom had in the Field or in Quarters one hour for amusement or relaxation--that appointment encreased my Military Family three fold & my Expences were in proportion without the smallest additional revenue. His appointment as Adj't. General gave General Gates the Rank & oemoluments of a Brigadr., to Colonel Reed & Colonel Pickering the rank of Colonel with the oemoluments of Brigadr. In addition to these advantages they were Annexed to the Family of the Commr. in Chief & of course had a great part of their expences defrayed by the public. Colonel Schammell to Whom I succeeded in the office of Adj't. Genl. was entitled to the pay & oemoluments of a Brigadr. Genl. when I was appointed adjutant general (which Appointment I was Solicited to Accept) I made no stipulation for an immediate Additional Allowance but trusted to the success of our Cause and to the Justice of Congress for the same pay & oemoluments which they in like cases should extend to Others. I therefore submit my Case to Congress with a firm reliance that they will be pleased to order the Pay-Master Genl. to give me credit for the pay & moluments of a General Officer Commanding in a Separate Department, during my Command on the Frontiers of Virginia, Pennsylvania & New York; and such an Allowance for my extra Services as Adjt. Genl. as to them shall appear just & reasonable. With much respect, I have the Honor to be, Your Excellys. most Obedt. & most humble Servt. Edwd. Hand   ""

  Dear Sir, Annapolis 19th April 1784. Your favor of 20 Ult. came to hand only this day. You observed that at the time of writing you must have had several Letters on their way to this place. I fear some have missed their way. I have acknowledged the rect of all that have come to my hands. I am glad to find that you approve of my conduct in transmitting the extracts from our Ministers Letters.(1) The State had a right to be acquainted with the sentiments of their Agents in Europe on a subject of so great national importance--and it is a flattering circumstance that you have had it in your power to hold up some lights to your neighbours. People so well disposed as the Inhabitants of N. England only want information. The Letter written by the delegates of Massachusetts which was published in Boston, has been taken into some of our papers this way. Had that Letter been laid before their Assembly at the time it was received by their Committee of Correspondence I cannot think that state would have granted an Impost to Congress: But this Letter was suppressed; & mutilated paragraphs (as I am told) of some hasty, procured Letters from our Ministers in Europe were offered to the House--& the measure was carried.(2) I cannot find words strong enough to express my indignation at the base means, the intrigue, the chicanery, the deceit, the circumvention, the fetches, the side winds, the bye blows, the ambushes, the stratagems, the manoeuverings, the desultory attacks, the regular approaches, the canting & snivelling as well as swearing & lying--in short the total prostitution of every power & faculty of body, mind & office to carry a point--which I need not name. I ent[i]rely approve of the proposal for raising the state impost. Had the proposal made last year by Massachusetts for a Convention of the eastern states taken place, state imposts on some uniform plan would have been adopted before now; but time & experience will re APRIL 19, 1784  duce to system measures adopted in conformity to confederation. The states will all find imposts necessary & common utility & convenience will finally induce a sufficient uniformity. The Sentiments of the delegates of Massachusetts are now published to the World. General Wadsworth of Connecticut, & Mr. Paine from New-York, two valuable men now in Congress are fully in principle against the 5 pr Cent. Impost & have given it as their decided & first opinion in Congress & out that that measure neither would, nor ought to be adopted; & that if universally adopted by the states & carried into effect, it would lay a foundation for the ruin of the Liberties of the U. States. Several other members are less sanguine than formerly; & I can assure you with great truth, as well as satisfaction that the present members of Congress are generally disposed to adopt oeconomy & good measures; but such is our State that three dissentients only can defeat any measure proposed. The voice & wishes of the people at large are however making their way into Congress, & I hope to see next November a sett of men in Congress equal to the worthies of 1775. Enclosed I send you a copy of the proceedings of Congress relative to an adjournment.(3) We have since found its good effects having gone through more business in a day than in a week preceding. We shall revive this motion the first convenient opportunity. I fear an adjournment will not be obtained without leaving a Committee of the states.

  Sir Annapolis 20th. of April 1784. I wish it were in my power to Give you an Agreeable Account of our debates in Congress--but very little has been done since the present Year Commenced. Permit me to Suggest the Utility of an impost for the use of our State if that Measure is not already Adopted.(1)  It remains a Matter of great doubt Whether all the States in the Union will come into the recommendation of April 1783. Even as so far as the impost. The States this way have agreed to a private impost, by which means they have raised very large sums--And it gives me no small pain to find so large a balance in the Public Account against New-Hampshire. I am Greatly at a loss to know how She can remit the amount, or even her proportion of the interest of the foreign debt. I think she cannot. The Southern Gentry prefer extravagance to Oeconomy and seem to take a pleasure in Granting monies which they cannot Command and were it not for the New-England Delegates, the Lord only knows to what lengths Congress would run. I conceive it therefore very much to our purpose to keep up a Representation. If a pritty full Delegation is on the Ground in Novr. annually it is supposed that the Necessary business of these States may be compleated in the Space of three Months and I think under this view  APRIL 21, 1784  some of our best hands may afford to come, and if they Snarl some times, at Others an Agreeable Amusement will take place. As to an adjournment it is not as yet agreed to & a Comtee. of the States are not appointed & until these Matters are Generally discuss'd I can give no Opinion.

But I am prevented most effectually by one of the delegation being taken suddenly ill, nor can I have the smallest expectation, from the nature of his complaint, of getting away till some time in the next week.(1) It may perhaps be the last of it; and the last of the week following (it will be necessary to stop a few days in Baltimore), I shall hope to be blessed with your presence in Philadelphia--On this plan then, the last day of April I shall leave this place and the last of the first week in May be with my beloved.(2) In the mean while, you will continue to address your letters to Annapolis; because if I am not here, I shall take them out at Baltimore.

He did not attend Congress Thursday through Saturday, April 22-24, but on Monday, the 26th, informed Peggy that he would take his seat that day. \""For some days past I have been troubled with a slight inflammation in the throat, but you will conclude by my going to Congress...that it is not very troublesome.\"" See ibid., p. 84; and JCC, 26:256-60, 264-65, 275, 279, 282, 291-96. 2 McHenry did indeed leave Annapolis the morning of April 30, for which see his letter of that date to his wife in Steiner, James McHenry, p. 85.

  [April 24, 1784] (1) The Underwritten Delegates for the State of New York have the honor, in obedience to an express instruction from the Legislature of the said State, to represent, that in compliance with an act of Congress, bearing date the twenty fourth day of September 1779 (2) (in which Act of Congress it is among other things declared, that disputes at present subsist between the States of Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire and New York on the one part, and the People of the District called the New-Hampshire grants on the other, which People deny the jurisdiction of each of the said States over the said District and each of the said States claim the said district against each other as well as against the said People, as appertaining in whole or in part to them respectively. Resolved, Unanimously, that it be and it hereby is earnestly recommended to the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay and New York forthwith to pass laws, expressly authorising Congress to hear and determine all differences between them, relative to their respective boundaries in the mode prescribed by the articles of Confederation, so that Congress may proceed thereon by the first day of February next at farthest; and further that the said States of Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire and New York do by express laws for that purpose, refer to the decision of Congress all differences or disputes relative to jurisdiction which they may respectively have with the People of the district aforesaid, so that Congress may proceed thereon on the said first day of February next; and also to authorise Congress to hear and determine all disputes subsisting between the grantees of the several States aforesaid with each other or with either of the said States respecting title to lands lying in the said District, to be heard and  APRIL 24, 1784  determined in the mode prescribed for such cases by the articles of Confederation aforesaid; and further to provide that no advantage be taken of the nonperformance of the conditions of any of the grants of the said lands, but that further reasonable time be allowed for fulfilling such conditions. Resolved, Unanimously, that Congress will and do hereby pledge their faith to carry into execution & support their decisions and determinations in the premises, in favour of whichsoever of the Parties, the same may be, to the end, that permanent concord and harmony may be established between them, and all cause of uneasiness be removed, and that Congress will on the said first day of February next proceed without delay, to hear and examine into the disputes and differences relative to jurisdiction aforesaid between the said three States respectively, or such of them as shall pass the laws before mentioned, on the one part, and the People of the District aforesaid, who claim to be a seperate Jurisdiction on the other, and after a full and fair hearing will decide and determine the same according to equity). The Legislature of the State of New York did, on the twenty first day of October 1779, pass a law entitled \""An Act to empower the Congress of the United States of America to determine all controversies relative to certain lands in the Counties of Cumberland, Gloucester, Charlotte and Albany, commonly called the New Hampshire Grants\""(3) by which said act or law, the State of New York did fully comply with the recommendation contained in the aforesaid (in part recited) act of Congress, as by comparing the said act or law of the State of New York with the said Act of Congress will appear. That on the nineteenth Day of September 1780,(4) all the parties concerned in the said Controversy (Massachusetts Bay excepted) being present, Congress did attend to the hearing of the said Controversy, but have not to this day decided the same. The Underwritten further represent, that the Inhabitants of the said District, have paid no regard to the act of Congress which inhibited the People of the said district, who deny the jurisdiction of all the aforesaid States, from granting lands or exercising any authority over those who profess themselves to be Citizens of or to owe allegiance to any or either of the said States, but in violation and contempt thereof have granted lands and exercised authority over those in the said district, who profess to owe and yield allegiance to the authority of the State of New York, to the utter ruin of many of the Citizens thereof. That the Inhabitants of the said district, have shewn the utmost contempt of the act of Congress of the fifth day of December 1782,(5) refusing to restore the Estates, which they had confiscated, belonging to Persons who refused to yield obedience to the laws of (the assumed State of) Vermont, although the said Persons professed to owe and   yield allegiance to the State of New York, and who were guilty of no other offence. The inhabitants of the said district have likewise refused to set at liberty those who were in confinement for like causes as aforesaid, unless upon large bonds for their good behaviour, and have actually taken up and confined in close Jail, divers of the Citizens of the State of New York, who had been banished by the authority of the assumed State of Vermont aforesaid and for the offence aforesaid and who returned to their Habitations in the district aforesaid, under the sanction of the last mentioned act of Congress. That the Inhabitants of the said district, under the name and stile of the State of Vermont, have in and during the course of the Winter now last past, actually raised Troops and levyed war upon and against the Citizens of the State of New York, in Cumberland County in the district aforesaid, where numbers were wounded, made prisoners of, and inhumanly loaded with Irons, and confined in close Jail; while others were driven from their habitations and obliged to fly into the neighbouring States; and for no other cause than the offence aforesaid. The Underwritten further represent, that the pretended Government of Vermont hath lately extended it's claim and granted lands far to the westward of any of the most westerly grants ever made by the Government of the late Colony of New Hampshire; and have actually seized the lands so granted, although the same have long since passed to the Citizens of the State of New York, under the Great-Seal, of the late Colony of New York. The Underwritten further represent, that the Legislature of the State of New York, to prevent the evils of civil discord, have besides a chearful compliance with the recommendation of Congress to submit the said Controversy to their final determination, made many liberal cessions in favour of those claimants, particularly a certain Act entitled \""An Act for quieting the minds of the Inhabitants in the Northwestern parts of this State\"" passed the fourteenth day of April 1782,6 by which said Act the lands granted by New Hampshire and by the pretended State of Vermont, were confirmed to the claimants; and even occupants, without right, were liberally provided for; and there was no exception or reserve, but in favor of the oldest Patents in question. The Underwritten further represent, that they are expressly instructed in the most pointed manner, to press Congress for a decision of this long protracted Controversy, not on consideration of public expediency, but consistently with the assurances of Congress, according to equity. That the State of New York complains of the most grievous injustice done them by Congress, by delaying the said decision, especially after a submission in compliance with the unanimous recommendations of   Congress, in full confidence that Congress would have kept their faith inviolate; and which in the most solemn manner they had pledged. That great danger and distress will arise, from the further procrastination of the said decision, as the leaders of the said District have raised troops and do now employ them to reduce other Inhabitants, resident in the said district and acknowledging themselves Citizens of and to owe allegiance to the State of New York, to submit to the said assumed Government of Vermont; and many of the Inhabitants of the said district, for professing to owe allegiance to the State of New York, are now in the most grievous state of distress, under close confinement, calling upon the State of New York for protection and redress; and that when every State ought to be in the full enjoyment of the blessing of peace, under the protection of the fOEderal Union, the State of New York alone, is on the point of experiencing the calamities of an internal War: but that if she must recur to force for the preservation of her lawful authority, the impartial World will pronounce, that none of the bloodshed or disorder which may ensue, can be imputed to the Legislature thereof, who appeal to the Journals of Congress for the rectitude, moderation and liberality of the measures they have invariably pursued, to produce an amicahle determination of the Controversy. That in order to afford another instance of the upright intentions of the Government of the State of New York, Congress be entreated to guarantee the concessions made on her part, by the said Act of the fourteenth day of April 1782. The Underwritten further represent, that the Legislature of the State of New York, conceive themselves to be urgently pressed, by the great duty of self preservation, to prepare without loss of time for the worst events, and however sincerely they are disposed to maintain the Union and to manifest an inviolable respect for Congress, yet if the decision which has so long, in vain been solicited, should not be pronounced within two Months, next after nine States shall be represented in Congress, subsequent to a representation of the State of New York, no further expectation can be entertaind of such decision, and the said State of New York with whatever deep regret will be compelled to consider herself as left to pursue her own Councils, destitute of the protection of the United States, to whose judgement they have chearfully submitted, and on whose justice they have hitherto relied. The Underwritten do therefore by this Public Act, which they pray may be received and filed among the Records of the United States, make known the just expectations and earnest request of the Legislature of the State of New-York, declaring their readiness to lay before such of the Members of Congress, as may be uninformed, satisfactory evidence of the Title of the State of New York, to all that part of the controverted District which lies on the West side of Connecticut River.

  Dear Colonel Annapolis 25th April 1784 I had the Pleasure of writing to You the 6th of March,(1) & of receiving, a few Days since, your Favour of the 3d Instant, by which it appears, that my Letter had not then come to Hand. The neglect of the Mr Smiths is a little surprizing. I shall write to them by the next post, & inform them of your Intentions; which so far as they rest with me shall be duely executed. Congress have now before them, the Estimates & Requisitions for this Year, by which they propose to abate for the present, half of the continental Tax of 8 Million called for in October 1781 & assessed in our state, I think, in 1782.(2) Also the whole of a two Million Tax made  APRIL 25, 1784  the 16th of Octr. 1782, & probably assessed the last Year. One quarter of the other half of the 8 Million, & one Million two hundred thousand Dollars called for the 4th & 10th of September 1782 are appropriated to pay the Interest of continental Loan Certificates & of other domestick Debts, to the latter End of the Year 1782: & the Holders must be content to wait 'till next Year for the Interest of the last & present Year. There is a Difficulty in this Business, that may possibly prevent its passing Congress, Vizt. a provision enabling the Loan Officer forthwith to issue Certificates of the Interest due to the Holders to the latter End of 1782, & also enabling the Legislature to receive such Certificates in part payment of the Taxes of the Continent for this Year.(3) The Order of Congress respecting the Certificates issued between the 1st of Sep 1777 & Mar 78, arose from a Consideration, that the Interest on such Certificates being payable on the nominal Sum, agreable to the plighted Faith of Congress, & that nominal Sum being much greater than the Specie Value estimated by the Scale of Depretiation, it was incumbent on Congress to pay off these Certificates to avoid as soon as possible the extra Interest which must be paid previous to a Discharge of the principal. I am sorry that You propose to sell your Farm, & hope your Intentions will be altered as soon as You can collect your Interest. I had some Tho'ts previous to the peace of being concerned in a purchase of this Kind, & had I continued my Views, You should most certainly have had the preference of any other person; but if on my Return I should enter again into Commerce it will require all the Interest I have, which is not in the Funds to form a Capital worthy of Attention. Indeed I am so wholly unacquainted with the farming Business that this Consideration is sufficient to prevent me at present from medling with it. I was very happy to hear of Miss Glovers Marriage, pray tell her, she has had Time eno' to try the new scene; & I want to know how she likes it, that upon her Judgment I may form my own. I am much concernd to hear of Mrs Gerry's Indisposition. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing her in about two Months from this Time in perfect Health, which will be better promoted in her Constitution, by Exercise & chearful Company than by Med'cine & Physicians. Pray Give my affectionate Regards to Mrs Gerry, Mr & Mrs Glover, Miss Betsey, & all our Friends in general & be assured I am yours sincerely, E Gerry  ""

  Dear Sir Annapolis Apr. 25. 1784. My last to you was of the 16th of March, as was the latest I have received from you. By the proposition to bound our country to the Westward I meant no more than the passing an act declaring that that should be our boundary from the moment the people of the Western country & Congress should agree to it. The act of Congress now inclosed to you (1) will shew you that they have agreed to it, because it extends not only to the territory ceded, but to be ceded, and shews how and when they shall be taken into the union. There is no body then to consult but the people to be severed. If you will make your act final as to yourselves so soon as those people shall have declared their assent in a certain manner to be pointed out by the act, the whole business is settled, for their assent will follow immediately. One of the conditions is that they pay their quota of the debts contracted. Of course no difliculty need arise on this head: as no quota has been fixed on us unalterably. The minuter circumstances of selling the ungranted lands will be provided in an ordinance already prepared but not reported.(2) You will observe two clauses struck out of the report, the 1st respecting hereditary honours, the 2d slavery. The 1st was done not from an approbation of such honours, but because it was thought an improper place to encounter them. The 2d was lost by an individual vote only. Ten states were present. The 4 Eastern states, N. York, Pennsva. were for the clause. Jersey would have been for it, but there were but two members, one of whom was sick in his chambers. South Carolina, Maryland & !Virginia! voted against it. N. Carolina was divided as would have been Virginia had not one of it's delegates been sick in bed.(3) The place at which Congress should meet in Nov. has been the subject of discussion lately. Alexandria, Philada. & Trenton were proposed. The first was negatived easily. Trenton had the 4 East. states, N.Y., N.J., and Pennsylva. We expect Georgia & Delaware shortly, in which case it will become possible that Philada. may be determined on. The question is put off to be considered with the establishment of a committee of the states, which to my astonishment would have been negatived when first proposed had not the question been staved off. Some of the states who were against the measure, I beleive because they had never reflected on the consequences of leaving a government without a head, seem to be come over.(4) Dr. Lee is appointed an Indian Commr. He is not present, but is known to have sought it, & of course will accept. This vacates his seat here. I wish Short could be sent in his room. It is a good school for our young statesmen. It gives them impressions friendly to the federal government instead of those adverse which too often take place in persons confined to the politics of their state. APRIL 25, 1784  I like the method you propose of settling at once with Maryland all matters relative to Patowmac.(5) To introduce this the more easily I have conversed with Mr. Stone (one of their delegates) on the subject & finding him of the same opinion have told him I would by letters bring the subject forward on our part. They will consider it therefore as originated by this conversation. {Mercer}(6) is {acting} a very {extraordinary part. He} is a {candidate} for the {secretaryship} of {foreign affairs} and tho' {he will not} get the {vote of one state}, I beleive {he expects} the {appointment. He} has been {endeavoring} to {defeat} all {foreign treaties} to force the {nations} of {Europe} to {send ministers} to {treat here} that {he} may have the {honor} of {fabricating} this {whole business}. Tho' {he could} not {change} the {vote} of {his state, he intrigued} with a {young fool} from {North Carolina} & an {old} one from {New York,(7) got} them to {divide} their {states} by {voting} in the {negative}, & there being but {eleven states present, one} of {which} was {known} before to be {divided} the {whole set} of {instructions} were {rejected}, tho {approved} by {twenty one} out of {twenty five members present}. The {whole business} has been in {the dust} for a {month} & whether it can be {resumed} & {passed depends} on the incertainty of {Delaware} or {Georgia coming} on. {Vanity} & {ambition seem} to be the {ruling passions} of this {young man} and as {his objects} are {impure}, so also are {his means. Intrigue} is a {principal one} on {particular occasions} as {party attachment} is in the {general. He takes} now about {one half} of the {time of Congress} to {himself} & in {conjunction} with {Read [and] Spaight obstruct business inconceivably}. The {last} is of {North Carolina} & no otherwise of {consequence than} as by {his vote he} can {divide his state}.(8) The more I have reflected on your proposition for printing the Revisal the more I have liked it. I am convinced too from late experiments it cannot be passed in the detail. One of the Eastern states had their laws revised and then attempted to pass them thro' their legislature, but they got so mangled that all consistence was destroyed & I beleive they dropped them altogether. Should this be printed I will ask you to send me half a dozen copies wherever I shall be. Would it not be well for Virginia to empower persons privately to buy up her quota of old Continental money. I would certainly advise this were I not afraid that the possession of her quota on such easy terms would tempt her to refuse justice to the other states on this matter. For surely there would be no justice in wiping off her part of this debt by so much smaller a contribution than the others. If she would avail herself of it only to sheild herself against injustice and to enable her from an high ground to declare & do what is right, I should much wish to see her adopt secret measures for the purchase. I think some other states will do this, & I fear with unjust views. You know that   many gentlemen of this state had money in the hands of merchants in England. I am well informed that these merchants have uniformly refused to pay them interest, saying the money was always ready if they would have called for it. This adds another to the many good reasons we had before against paying interest during the war. I inclose herewith the spectacles you desired, price 13 Dollars. I have as yet done nothing on your commission either general or particular for books, because I am in constant expectation of a short trip to Philadelphia & can so much better execute it on the spot. The money hitherto remitted us amounts to about 4 Dollars a day. The predicament in which this places us is well known to you. It is unconceivably mortifying. I expect daily to hear from the Treasurer. As soon as I do it will enable me to give some directions on the subject of your money. I have not heard lately from Mrs. House. Mrs. Trist got safely to Fort Pitt through much distress. Congress hope to adjourn by the last of May. The estimate & requisitions for the year, the arrangements for the land office, & Foreign treaties are subjects they will endeavor to complete. Vermont is pressed on them by N. York & a day declared beyond which they will await no interposition but assert their right of government.9 The Chevalr. Luzerne has taken his leave of us. He makes a tour to the lakes before he leaves the continent. Marbois acts as Chargé des affaires till the arrival of a successor. As it is certain that Congress will shortly adjourn, to meet again in Nov. it is desireable that the assembly should at as early a day as convenient appoint their delegates for the ensuing year, in order that such gentlemen as shall be continued, may receive notice of it while here, as this will enable them to take measures for their accomodation at the next meeting, determine them whether to send their baggage Northwardly or Southwardly &c.  Apr. 30. A London ship is arrived here which left that port the 25th of March. Pitt was still in place, supported by the King, Lords, & nation in general. The city of London enthusiastically in his favor. Still there was a majority of 12 in favor of Fox who was supported by the Prince of Wales. It was thought the parliament would be dissolved. Congress has determined to adjourn on the 3d of June to meet in November at Trenton. Adieu, Your's affectionately, Th. Jefferson ""

  My dear Mr Dana Annapolis 26th April 1784  By the last Post I was favoured with yours of the 3d,(1) & am very happy to be informed of your Indisposition; I hope however it will not be of long Duration. We propose to decide this Day the question of Adjournment. If it passes in the Affirmative, a Committee of the States will be appointed, & I shall urge the Election of Yourself, to represent Massachusetts. If the Adjournment should be negatived, Congress will probably continue sitting till the convening of a new Congress; so that in either Case, it will be necessary that You should loose no Time, in sitting off for Annapolis. The adjournment proposed, is intended to take place on the 3d of June next & to continue 'till the 30th of Octr next, the Saturday which immediately precedes the first Monday of November. I  APRIL 26, 1784  have not the least Doubt of succeeding in your Election Beforementioned, in case of adjourmt. That there had been extraordinary Conduct in the Department of foreign Affairs I had no doubt; but was never able from the Beginning of August last, 'till some Time in last Month to obtain Access to the foreign papers, & was then under the Necessity of adopting the Measures stated in the printed Journals of the 27th of Feby, (2) transmitted to the supreme Executive, & also the Legislature of Massachusetts, the Books & Files are now subject to the perusal of the Members, but the Cyphers are not to be found, necessary for coming at some of the most confidential Letters. I have desired Mr Remsen, under Secretary, to write to Mr Livingston, & the answer is daily expected; but for a young Republick, I think We have made a great progress in the Arts of Intrigue & Corruption. My Time is so engrossed in other important Matters, that I cannot find a Moment to examine the Books & papers mentioned, & have been ardently wishing to see You here, before I leave Congress. Being in daily Expectation of your Arrival, I engaged a Room for you in our Lodgings, which are by far the best in this Place; but You are not under the Necessity of taking it, unless it corresponds with your Convenience. Your Measures at the Court of Russia, so far as You have communicated them to Congress; have done you great Honor. Your opponents, who consist of only a few disguised partizans of the Aristocratic Circle, acknowledge this to be a Fact; indeed the Denial would injure their Reputation, & not yours. I am therefore from what has appeared, very sure, that what remains to be communicated, on Your Part will be acceptable to Congress, & very much so, to those You wish to support You. I have communicated your Regards as requested & the Gentlemen cordially return theirs. Being much in Haste, I can only add My Respects as heretofore, & assure You that I remain your affectionate Friend, E Gerry  4 oClock P.M. Congress have passed the Resolve for adjournment, & for leaving a Committee in the Recess.(3) The 3d of June is the period for adjourning, & the 30th of Octr for meeting.

  Sir Annapolis Apr. 26. 1784. It is always with reluctance that I trespass on the time of a person whose every moment I know to be usefully emploied. The subject however of the inclosed papers having heretofore occupied your attention and the report you made to Congress (1) being lost so that those who have attended the present year only cannot have the benefit of your then communications, I cannot withstand the desire of possessing your opinion on it. I was of a Committee in the year 1776 appointed to prepare something for Congress on the subject of coin.(2) They made a report, but subsequent events prevented it's being taken up. Finding on my coming to Congress last that the subject had been resumed and had passed through your hands I endeavored to get a sight of your report. Having however been delivered from one Committeeman to another till the whole of them had got out of place, the paper is not now to be found. The Secretary told me he would en- APRIL 26, 1784  deavour to recover it by writing to the former members of the Committee: but his endeavors having proved ineffectual and the session of Congress drawing to a close I thought it necessary that the business should be put into a train of preparation before they separate, that it may be ready for final discussion when they meet again. I have therefore thrown my own thoughts together on the inclosed paper,(3) with a design of asking your revisal of them & corrections before any proposition be made to Congress. A letter from Mr. Govr. Morris to Mr. Helmsley,(4) of which I got a sight, gave me the only sketch of your plan which I have been able to procure. The impatience of Congress to separate renders it necessary to propose this subject within a few days & of course to ask your thoughts on it as soon as possible. An insurmountable aversion to copying obliges me also to desire a return of the inclosed paper of which I retain no copy. Permit me, through you to return my thanks to Mrs. Morris for the kindnesses she is pleased to shew to my daughter in Philadelphia. The grateful terms in which the latter communicates them to me, make me hope she shews herself to Mrs. Morris properly sensible of them. The effect of these attentions on my mind can only be known to a parent, and to a parent whom events have so circumstanced. Be so good as to present my respectful compliments and good wishes to Mrs. Morris and to be yourself assured of the esteem and regard with which I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedt. & most humble servt,  Th.

 Connecticut Delegates to William Williams  Sir Annapolis 27th April 1784  Congress came to a resolution Yesterday, to Adjourn on the 3d day of June next, until the 30th day of October next, then to Meet at Trenton in the State of New Jersy. This day a report was agreed to for requisitions on the States for Supplies for paying the expences of the current year, and the Interest of the foreign debt to the close of this year, and of the domestic debt to the end of the year 1782 & part of the year 1783, to accomplish which, one half of the requisition of 8 Million dollars made the 30th of October 1781, including the payments already made thereon, will be Sufficient.(1) Congress have also Agreed upon regulations for laying off the Western territory into new  APRIL 27, 1784  states, with the mode of introducing civil government into them & Securing their Connection with the federal Union. They have made Several attempts to Answer the Letter of the Honorable House of Representatives of our State, but have not been able to agree on an answer. It was referred to a Committee who reported an answer which not being Agreable to the Minds of the House, was referred to another Committee, Consisting of Mr. Osgood, Mr. Arthur Lee and Mr. Ellery who reported an answer about two months ago, which was considered by Congress by paragraphs and amended & was laid by for a fuller House, in order to take a question on the whole, which was put the 22d of this month, and the yeas and nays called, and the question lost, the members in the negative voting on different principles. Enclosed is a Copy as amended, the resolve at the foot of the letter was reported by the Same committee, and is agreed to by Congress.(2) The Matter respecting crediting the State for payments to their line of the army up to the beginning of the year 1782, is now before a Grand Committee, consisting of one member from each State to whom an Act of the Legislature of the State of Connecticut with the enclosed motion thereon is referred. Congress have Agreed to appoint a Committee of the States to sit in the recess of Congress, it will be therefore necessary that another Delegate should come on as Soon as may be, as neither of us can conveniently Stay longer than till the time of the adjourn[m]ent of Congress. The principal matters of a public nature now before Congress to be acted upon this session, are the reduction of the Officers and Salaries of the Civil List. Military Guards for the frontier Posts. Instructions to our Ministers in Europe for forming Treaties.  Opening a Land Office for Sale of western territory. Some directions to Commissioners for settling public accounts. Apointing and Impowering a Committee of the States.

  Sir, Annapolis April 29th, 1784. A motion has been made for Congress to Declare the number of troops necessary for the State of New York to keep up for the purpose of garrisoning their Posts. It was referred to the Committee appointed to Consider of the measures Proper to be adopted in order to take poss[ess]ion of the frontier Posts, and I believe Congress will not Declare the number untill they have fixed the Said arangements for fear New York will garrison Niagara and Oswego.(1) I Could wish Sir to be informed whether our State is like to Raise troops to garrison them posts, so that if it was necessary we might Endeavour to protract the Determination of Congress upon the Subject of arangements in order to give an oportunity to our troops first to get Possession. It appears to me of the utmost importance to our State that Niagara and Oswego are garrisoned by our own troops as it appears to be the general Sense of the Delegates that the western Country ought to be Considered as belonging to the united States in Common. Application has been made to Congress for the arms, etc. It is Re- ferred to a Committee who I belive will not be hasty in Reporting nor Congress in Determining.(2) It is Said among the Delegates that it looks like a Declaration of war against Vermont. A motion has been made for the Restoration of the Bells belonging to the City of New York but as no act of Congress Can be found Re- APRIL 29, 1784  specting the taking of Said bells it is Supposed they were taken by the order of the Commisary of military Stores but as the Records are at Philadelphia no proof at Present Can be made. I belive that an act of Congress Could be obtained ordering the Commisary of military Stores to Deliver them to the order of the City Corporation but the united States will not pay the Expence of the transportation unless it Can be proved that they were Sent to Carlisle by the order of Congress which at present Cannot be Done. If an order is now obtained the Corporation must be at the Expence of the transportation, if it is Deferred untill the next meeting Perhaps Such Proof Can be made as would Subject the united States to Pay it. I Could wish to be informed which the Corporation would Prefer.(3) The Delegates of New York as agents in the Dispute Respecting the New Hampshire grants have Delivered a memorial to Congress Couched in terms Corresponding with the Spirit of their instructions. They at the Same time urged Congress that a number of Testimonials, (Especially those lately Sent under Cover from your Excellency) might be Read but were Refused.(4)  Upon the whole Sir it appears to me that there is not the least Prospect of any Protection or assistance from Congress and that it is high time for our State to tak the Same measures as though it was Sorounded with open and avowed Enemies.

  Sir, Annapolis 29th April 1784  During the last & present week Congress have agreed on two very important Resolutions; one of them is on the subject of Western territory. As our Clerks will be much hurried 'til the departure of the post, I have taken the liberty of enclosing you a rough copy of the resolve.(1) After the first report of the Committee had been corrected & argued in Congress it was recommitted. By the enclosed paper you will note the further corrections & additions made in Congress before the report was agreed to. In a few days I shall have the pleasure of forwarding some correct copies of it for yourself & Gentlemen of the Council. The President will forward You a Copy of the requisitions for the expences of the Year as agreed to Yesterday in Congress.(2) We are informed that some of the States, not knowing what the requisitions might be, but knowing that money surely would be wanted have  APRIL 29, 1784  already passed Laws for laying a considerable tax. The assemblies of some of the states are to sit very soon, the requisitions will come before them in course. The President is instructed to cause the Post Master at Petersburg to send an Express to Hillsborough with the hope that these requisitions may come under the notice of the General Assembly of our state during their present session,(3) for though we might express our hope that the assembly would set again in the autumn, we could not not speak of such an event as certain. Congress had under their consideration yesterday, the report of a Committee on the subject of a recommendation to the States to vest the United States in Congress with a power to restrain the commerce of foreign Nations for the purpose of putting our own trade on a respectable footing or of obtaining reciprocity in commerce.(4) It is proposed, \""That it be recommended to the several states to vest the United States in Congress assembled with the powers for the space of 15 Years of prohibiting any goods, wares or merchandize from being imported into any of the states or exported from them except in vessels belonging to & navigated by Citizens of the United States.\"" A resolve in those words would comprehend the amount of what seems to be desired by any of the states, but some Gentlemen are of the opinion that powers short of these are sufficient. Perhaps this may be true, but it is not probable that other restraints will be imposed than what may be found necessary. Some Gentlemen would not only restrain foreign powers from importing & would suffer them to export. Others desirous to encourage our own shipping & considering that our exports are much more bulky than our imports, would restrain those also from exporting our produce. If Great Britain for instance should be prevented from sending her vessels into our ports unless she acceed to a commercial treaty which should be honorable & equal it is presumed that she would soon agree to treat. While she has the present advantages & may carry on our trade without suffering us to look at one of her Islands, it is not probable that she will treat. We are now persuaded that the recommendations on the subject of commerce cannot overtake the present Session of our assembly. In this Case I submit it to your Excellencies consideration whether you will not recommend it to the General Assembly to pass a Law impowering their Delegates in Congress to acceed to the general regulation continued in the proposition I have quoted or to any similar regulations that may be agreed to by nine States in Congress assembled, and which regulations shall equally extend to every state in the Union. Great Britain has depended much on our want of power & if she was to see the states passing Laws by which we might be enabled to restrain her trade she would be apt to save us the trouble of imposing the restraint, by giving us mutual advantages.  If the general assembly shall have passed the Law for granting the 5 per Cent impost I hope you will cause it to be forwarded by the return of the express. South Carolina had perhaps six months ago passed an imperfect act for an impost but they have lately amended it to the full of what was required. We are given to understand that Rhode Island only stands out till she sees whether all the other States comply. I do not know what Georgia has done, all the other States except Connecticut passed the act. It is resolved that Congress shall adjourn on the 3d of June till the end of October, leaving a Committee of the states. The ordinance for opening the Land office, one for regulating the Indian Trade, For Securing the frontier posts & sundry other very difficult & perplexing Subjects are still on hand.

  Sir Annapolis 29th April 1784 You do me Justice in believing that I am in the number of those who count you a diligent and faithful Officer and are very desirous of giving you effectual Proofs of their Regard. There are at present Eleven states represented in Congress, for this Reason on the 15th Inst I call'd for the Report on your appointment. The Entry made in our Journal is thus.(1) On the Report of a Committee consisting of Messrs &c, to whom was referd the memorial of J Pierce Pay master Genl. Resolved that in settling the Accounts of Mr John Pierce the paymaster Genl he be allowed at the Rate of one hundred and fifty Dollars per month besides the Rations that are drawn by a Lieut Colonel. The Committee further reported that Mr Pierce be allowed in Consideration of his additional Services in settling the Accounts of the army at the Rate of One hundred Dlrs per month while employed in that service. On the Question to agree to this the Yeas & Nays being required by Mr. Read. (seven States against it)  APRIL 29, 1784  As soon as I heard some Gentlemen assert that Col. Palfrys Salary had been increased to what they calld the enormous Sum of 150 Dlrs because Mony was in fact depretiated I despaird of obtaining any thing more at present than the 150 Dlrs for you as pay Master. The only thing I feard was that a Proposal would be supported for lowering the salary of the Paymaster and then making an allowance for settling the Accots. This however was not pushed for, but another attempt was made full as dangerous, viz to amend the Resolve by adding \""in full for his services as Paymaster & for settling the Accots,\"" or words to this amot. Lest this amendment should be made I press'd for the Question and it was carry'd. I then proposed to postpone the Consideration of the remaining Part of the Report & as my Collegue had just withdrawn, the State having no vote, I went out not suspecting that the Subject would be pursued, but Mr Read, who told the House early in the Debate that he had been the Witness of your extraordinary fidelity in preventing numberless frauds that were attempted on the public, suffering his Zeal to outrun his Prudence, pursued the Question and required the Yeas & Nays. Though the Question for 100 Dlrs is lost it will be perfectly in order at any Time to bring it forward by a motion for granting 90 Dlrs or even 99 Dlrs but I am clearly of the Opinion that we had best let it sleep for some Time. The Vote for 150 Dlrs is fresh in gentlemen's Memory and they say that 250 Dlrs per month is more wages than any officer ought to receive. Some of them are a little chafed with the push that has lately been made for a very large allowance to Baron Stuben & allowing full Pay for the discharge of two or three Offices to Col. Menzies. The Business will not suffer by keeping, The salary for the first Commission is settled, I presume to your mind, and the other may better be settled hereafter with this View. I hope you will not desire that it be moved again till after the Recess. On the 16th an Attempt was made for granting Genl Hazen the Pay of a Brig Genl in the Line from the date of his Brevet Commission.(2) I had many weighty reasons for disliking this measure but happened not to stand alone for the majority were against it.

I also inclose a copy of the estimate & requisitions of the year as they passed Congress. This however you will shortly receive from the President officially.(2) Congress have determined that they will adjourn on the 3d of June to meet at Trenton in November. Virginia, Maryland & Pennsylvania gave each certain powers to Congress to enable them to counteract the British commercial measures. But these powers were all different. A recommendation is therefore now under consideration proposing to the states to give a uniform power for a given term of years which may enable Congress to make it the interest of every nation to enter into equal treaties with us.(3) This I think will be ready by the next post. The Chevalr. Luzerne has notified his leave to return home & that Monsr. de Marbois will act as ChargÄ des affairs till a successor arrives. We begin to hope that the bills of the financier threatened with protest have been taken up. The ground of our hope is the length of time elapsed without hearing of their ultimate protest. A vessel arrived here two days ago which left London the 25th of March. She brings papers to the 20th. Pitt was still in place, supported by the king, H. of Lords, the city of London, E. India company & the nation in general, who were sending addresses from all parts to the crown in his favor. The grocers' company having presented him with the freedom of their body & given him an entertainment the city was illuminated, and the windows of the opposition who would not illuminate were broken. Still the opposition retained a majority of 12 in the H. of commons who kept all the wheels of government suspended. It was in Mr. Pitt's power to secure himself at any time by admitting a coalition: but this would seem to shift him on the very ground which had shaken his adversaries. It was beleived the parliament would be dissolved. They had continued the king's power over our commerce six months longer.

  Sir, Annapolis 30th April 1784. By this post you will receive the requisitions for the Year transmitted to you by the secretary of Congress (1)--the last clause respecting facilities was carried by the Eastern & middle states, very much against my opinion, as I think it a very impolitic measure, and one that will operate very partially among the states. If we view it on the principles of general utility, we will find it will neither afford a competent payment to the public creditor of his interest, nor will it satisfy the foreign creditors that we mean to do justice by them. It affords little or no relief to our State in the payment of our quota of the requisition as our accounts against the Continent are not yet liquidated, but operates very much in favor of the Eastern States, whose proximity to Congress, possessing a more speculative disposition and paying a greater attention to their interest, than we have done, have got Continental securities for all monies loaned, services done, or articles impressed, while to the southward it has been made a state debt. Besides it is in direct contradiction to the former part of the report which says the money  APRIL 30, 1784  shall be appropriated to the different purposes for which it is wanted, according to the first statement, to wit, the current expences of the year, second to the payments of the debts due from the Superintendant of Finance for the Years 1782 & 1784--3d. to the payment of the Interest on the foreign debt, and lastly the interest on the domestic debt. But by the facilities one fourth of the requisition is anticipated by the discou[n]t of interest on the domestic debt, and any failure of payment of the remaining three fourths, must fall either on the current expences, or the interest on the foreign debt, which certainly should be paid in preference to any other. The journals being regularly transmitted to you by the secretary, as fast as they are printed, it is unnecessary for me to say anything on what has been done. The business which Congress have before them, in my opinion cannot be finished, by the time which they have fixed on for their adjournment, that is the 3d of June next. You will also receive a Resolution respecting Western territory.(2) The little states can't loose sight of that object; their size when compared to the larger ones appears so trifling, that it creates in them a degree of envy. And notwithstanding the United States have received more land from Virginia, that they will properly dispose of for these twenty or thirty Years to come, they are still clamorous for more--from what has been done with the Virginia session, I should be sorry to see any part of our State, at the disposal of Congress; and if ever do make a cession of the property of the soil, I hope they will retain the jurisdiction in their own Hands. Some days ago the New York Delegates, pursuant to instructions from that State, laid a Memorial before Congress requesting them to proceed to a decission of the dispute between that State, & the Inhabitants of the New Hampshire Grants, at the same time informing Congress that if nothing was done in it, within the space of two months, that they would take up arms to do themselves justice.(3) As the Eastern states have ever secretly encouraged the Vermonters, and opposed any thing being done in the affair by Congress, I expect they will now oppose every measure that may be attempted, and that in consequence of Congress not coming to any determination on the subject, the flames of civil war will be kindled in that Country in the course of four or five months.

  [April ? 1784] (1) Resolved that treaties of Amity & commerce with the European nations ought not to be refused on our part until those nations will send ministers to negotiate them within these states nor ought they to be delayed until they shall have previously been submitted to the several legislatures & received their approbation. 1. Because it is not to be expected that the nations of Europe, antient & established as they are, will cross the Atlantic to treat with us on our own ground; nor is there any fact or information existing within the knowlege of Congress which would authorize such an expectation. 2. Because a refusal to treat with them in Europe amounts to a refusal to treat with them at all, to the suppression of every effort for the admission of our citizens to their ports on an equal footing with those of other countries, to a continuance of the occlusion of the West Indian markets against the produce of these states; loses a crisis of favourable disposition in the European powers in general to enter into connections of amity & commerce with us; endangers the loss of a proferred treaty from the Emperor of Morocco, who has made us friendly advances, whose honour will be touched and resentment kindled by our declining to meet them, and whose power & connections may, in our present unarmed state, shut to us the ports of the Mediterranean, oblige us to send our commodities to them in foreign bottoms, or to seek them in our own, at the risk of consigning our citizens to perpetual slavery & chains. 3. Because the federal constitution does not require that treaties before their conclusion should be communicated to the thirteen legislatures and should receive all their several approbations, and such a delay in the present instance would be unseasonable & injurious to them, would protract the negotiations to a length indefinite both in time & expence; would leave our citizens in the mean time exposed to all the evils before stated, and would be more distressing to these states whose channels of commerce are yet to be opened, than to the nations constituting the other parties who may in the mean time pursue their antient & long established tracts, and might suffer opportunities finally to pass by which might never be recalled.

  Sir, Annapolis 1st May 1784. I was favoured with yours of the 11th April,(1) yesterday; for which I am much obliged. I am happy to find the legislature are turning their attention to a revenue from trade. Mr. Blanchard & myself were on the point of suggesting that measure to our State, as we conceived the sums necessary for the support of public credit, could not be raised in the usual mode of taxation, & found that similar steps had been adopted by all the comercial States. A recommendation is forwarded to the respective States with a view to counteract the police of Britain to injure our carrying trade, (2) I wish it may be complied with by the States, and convince Her that America is too wise to be sported with, and can act in such Union as to defeat entirely her injurous attempts. Your observation on the Journal is very just. During the winter little business has been compleated from the want of a representation; when barely seven States were present, a single dissenting Voice, from most of the States, prevented the completion of any matter for which that number was necessary, and the same fate frequently attended the business of nine States, when only that number attended; and besides, the enemy were not at our Gates to stimulate Union & dispatch. However, many matters difficult in their nature, & of great consequence in their effects, have been digested in Committees, which I hope will soon be finished, to the satisfaction of the public. It has also been a painful circumstance to the attending Members to be unable to proceed in necessary measures, & provide for the public exigencies, from the want of more States on the Floor. Congress have agreed to meet in November at Trenton in Jersey. A Grand Committee are now sitting on a Memorial from Massachusetts on the subjects of old Continental Money, an allowance for the Penobscott expedition, and for extra bounties for Soldiers. What will be the issue of this application remains uncertain. New York are likewise calling on Congress to decide the controversy of Vermont, this is in the hands of a Committee. The Quota of New Hampr. to the 8 Million dollars, we were sensible was too large,(3) & had been objected to by the State; this was at the same time, the case with most of the eastern States. The Delegates  MAY 1, 1784  from those States were desirous to have altered, but as Congress were not possessed of the returns necessary to fix the equal proportion, they judged an attempt to take up the matter on new grounds would be impracticable, and therefore consented to let the Quota stand and be credited at a future day. I am Sir with great respect and esteem your very humble Servant Abiel Foster. ""

  My dear Sir, Annapolis May 2d. 1784. I receiv'd the letters No. 2 & 3 Which you have done me the honor to write, your No. 1 is not yet come to hand; I am however pleas'd with those. I have written twice since my coming to this place. I cannot say much of the Vermont, the N. York Delegates have preferd a Memorial, a Copy of it goes to the Presidt. Weare, 'tis lengthy.(1) The assemblies of Massachusetts, & Connecticut have remonstrated to Congress on the Subject of the commutation, and desird leave to Settle with their own lines, & if the Matter could have been carried N.H. would have likewise applied, it is unlikely at present, that any alteration will take place. In a former letter I pointed the utility of a private impost and I expect that your Legislature has adopted the Measure. The postponing the Supplimentary revenue (for the present) may not be impolic. In the present requisitions, we have had great difficulty, to Obtain the discount of interest due on the loan Office & Lequidated debts. The states south of Maryland, have Advanced but little to the U S. Specific's they have & at their own price. I apprehend that there never will, or ever can be a compleat Settlemt. of the Continental Accots. and this Opinion prevails with the Members in General, and in this View of things, all future Advances to the U S should be chargd to Existing Requisitions, and I think that it may not be amiss to extend this hint to your friends.(2)  As to the Subject of foreign Treaties, I cannot now Say any thing agreeable, I am in hopes that something will finally be agreed to. The Cincinate is exceedingly reprobated.  MAY 3, 1784  I wish to avail myself your correspondence, the time of my Departure being uncertain. June 3d Congress is to Adjourn to meet at Trenton in Octr. a Comtee. to be left & remain I suppose at this place. Pray forward the enclos'd, & Give my Service, to all who enquire.

  Dear Yeates Annapolis 3d May 1784 I have your favr. of the 10th Ultimo before me--you make me very happy in informing me that my dear little John is likely to recover his indisposition & that the remr. of Your family & mine are well. I hope they continue so! Patton is as Stif as ever. I never pressed him nor shall I do it, the object is not worth it. The old fellow when it may be too late will perhaps come to. When I first spoke to him he seemed inclined to Sell for £40. I hoped to get it for less & offered him 100 Dollars. He promised to answer me in the evening. He did so, but it was that he would not sell unless he got the whole, both principle & Interest, & in this mind he still remains. I can't find an opertunity of returng. your Money. I hope you will be able to replace it from the Interest on my notes as I mentioned in my last. The Cursed Horses I cant part with, so says Mr. Burd. Congress have at length Determined to Adjourn on the 3d of next month to Meet at Trenton in Octr. I am much mistaken if they return to the South of Pennsylvania. A Committee of the States will Sit in the recess of Congress. Since our Adjournment we have passed the inclosed Act for the temporary Government of the Western territory,(1) the hard names are left out but it is otherwise so much scratched & interlined, that I apprehend you can Scarcely read it. I say Interlined because the Marginal notes are to be taken in. We have also call'd on the States for money to pay the Interest on the foreign Debt to the End of 1784 & the Domestic to the End of 1783, with the Current expences of this Year. We have also recommended to the States to vest a power in Congress to regulate Commerce generally. Genl. Green & a Mr. Higginson of Massachusetts who were appointed Indian Commissioners have declined serving. Genl. Clarke of Virginia is at Kentucky--& probably cant Serve. Genl. Schuyler, Genl. Lincoln & Mr. A. Lee, have been lately added. Lee will serve, we don't know what the others will do. MAY 3, 1784  I beg my duty, love, & Compliments to all with you, Adieu Dr. Yeates, Yrs.

12650,dg021435,1784,Thomas Jefferson to Francis Hopkinson,"""Thomas Jefferson to Francis Hopkinson
  Dear Sir Annapolis May. 3. 1784. Not being learned in the laws of Pennsylvania I am incertain what will be the event if a prosecution of Scandalum magnatum should be instituted against Claypole for publishing in his gazette of Apr. 27 as an act of Congress a paper which certainly was no act of theirs,(1) and which contained a principle or two not quite within the level of their politics. I mean a pretended act for dividing the Western country into states and fixing the principles on which their governments should be erected, two of which as this forgery pretends were an exclusion of hereditary honours, and an abolition of slavery. When the true act shall be published you will find no such pettyfogging ideas in it. In the scheme for disposing of the soil an happy opportunity offers of introducing into general use the geometrical mile, in such a manner as that it cannot possibly fail of forcing it's way on the people. However this bearing some relation to astronomy and to science in general, which certainly have nothing to do with legislation, I doubt whether it can be carried through. Were it to prevail it would lay the foundation of a very dangerous proposition; that is, to subdivide this geometrical mile into 10 furlongs, each of these into 10 chains, each of these into 10 paces, differing very little from the British furlong, chain, and fathom, but I hope it will be foreseen that should we introduce so heterodox a facility as the decimal arithmetic, we should all of us soon forget how to cypher. I have hopes that the same care to preserve an athletic strength of calculation, will not permit us to lose the pound as a money unit, and it's subdivisions into 20ths. 240ths. and 960ths. as  MAY 3, 1784  now generally practised. Certain innovators have been wishing to banish all this cunning learning, to adopt the dollar for our Unit, to divide that into 10ths. 100ths. &c.(2) and to have a gold coin of the value of 10 dollars, a silver coin of the value of a dollar, another of the value of 1/10 of a dollar or the Spanish Bit, and a copper one equal to 1/100 of a dollar, and of course very near the value of a New York penny. Intermediate silver coins are also proposed for convenience, towit the half dollar or 510, the Pistereen .2 and the half bit .05. Thus in a sum of money expressed in these figures 34.72 every figure expresses the number of peices of the several coins which will pay off the sum, to wit 3 golden peices, 4 Units, 7 bits and 2 coppers. This is surely an age of innovation, and America the focus of it! When I am about to ask a favour, I generally ask myself a question first: viz. would I do as much in a similar situation? Having gone thro' this ceremony with myself I have given myself authority to ask you to negotiate for me the two bills inclosed. One of them is on Mr. Morris paiable at 10 days sight. The Intendant of the treasury of this place tells me he would always consider it as a convenience to give money here for so much to be paid into the treasury of the States at Philadelphia. If therefore it would not contravene Mr. Morris's arrangements of this business the most convenient remittance of this money to me would be either his bill on the Intendant here, or a receipt of the bill now inclosed purporting that he will answer my draughts to that amount. The other bill on Wilcocks, I would be glad to have discounted in the bank, and the money paid to the Continental treasury and replaced by Mr. Morris's order on the Intendant here. But if they cannot be remitted in this convenient way, I must trouble you to send the money by some safe person coming to this place or to Baltimore. Mr. Curson at Baltimore will receive and remit to me any thing of that kind lodged with him for me. I am to thank you for the spectacles the receipt of which I beleive I have not before acknoleged. I am with sincere esteem Dr. Sir Your friend & servt,  Th Jefferson P.S. Should you resort to the remitment of the money, it will be more conveniently done in bank notes which pass as well here as cash. In whatever way it is done, I shall be glad to have 100 Dollars of it placed in the bank where it will be ready for Mrs. Hopkinson's call.(3) Reprinted from Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 7:205-6. 1 On April 27 David C. Claypoole, publisher of the Pennsylvania Packet, had inexplicably printed as an official act of Congress the March 1 preliminary resolutions drafted by a committee chaired by Jefferson under the heading: \""The following are the Resolutions of Congress respecting the formation of ten new States. The Committee, consisting of Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Chace, and Mr. Howel, appointed to prepare a Plan for the temporary government of the Western Territory, have agreed to the following resolu-  tions.\"" Although Congress had issued this report as a separate broadside for the use of its members, the plan had been heavily revised by the time it was resubmitted March 22 when another broadside was issued. It underwent even further revision during the long debate in Congress which adopted the final version on April 23, four days before the appearance of Claypoole's publication. See JCC, 26:118- 20, 246-47, 248-52, 255-60, 274-79, 27:719, 721; and Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 6:594. 2 For the proposal of a decimal system of coinage by Jefferson himself, see Jefferson to Robert Morris, April 26, 1784. 3 For Hopkinson's handling of these transactions, see Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 7:245.

This he did that he might not trouble Congress with a memorial. His Case was as follows. He was a Lieut. in a Regiment of which David Furman was Colonel.(1) It was as he represents one of 14 Regts which were ordered by Congress to be raised in 1777. He was in actual service and at Germantown during the Action there. The Regimt. he says was never fully officered; no Paymaster was appointed and what pay he ever recd came through the Hands of his Captain, Saml. Earle. He says there is some mony due him arrears of Pay. To whom is he to apply for the settlemt of his Account, and what previous Steps is he to take on that Subject? I will thank you for an Answer to this Question. Since I wrote the within, viz on this morning, there was laid before Congress by the Superintendant of finance a very curious and somewhat interesting Correspondence between you and Genl. Hazen.(2) The Journals will shew that an attempt made a fortnight ago to get for that Officer the Pay of a Brigr. faild and that though I do not often call the Yeas and Nays I requested them on that Occasion.(3) The Correspondence is committed & I observe that I am Chairman, as Committees are chosen by Ballot. I have seldom seen a greater coincidence of votes than happened on this occasion. I have noted this circumstance, because though in itself trifling it will help you to estimate the general Sentiments of Congress concerning the Parties. For it has happened that I have within the last 3 weeks taken occasion to call up the attention of Congress by some very pointed Remarks on the general Traits both of your Character and of that of the other Party.

Having waited thus long in the vain hope of procuring a private and confidential conveyance for the papers you left in my care,(1) I am obliged at length to trust them to the post, lest a longer detention of them should prove inconvenient. I hope they will pass safely. The desire of establishing a correspondence, which I am sure will be useful to me, induces me to consider as an invitation to it on your part the letter you were so kind as to address to me.(2) The sentiments therein expressed are much too partial, and I am sure had your time permitted you to have ranged a little more thro' these states, you would have found many others whom they would have better fitted. I am particularly sorry that the route you had marked out for yourself did not permit me to introduce to you some of my own country who would have justly merited your praises. Your observation on the situation of my mind is not without foundation: yet I had hoped it was unperceived, as the agreeable conversations into which you led me, often induced a temporary inattention to those events which have produced that gloom you remarked. I have been happy and cheerful. I have had many causes of gratitude to heaven, but I have also experienced it's rigours. I have known what it is to lose every species of connection which is dear to the human heart: friends, brethren, parents, children--retired, as I thought myself, to dedicate the residue of life to contemplation and domestic happiness, I have been again thrown by events on the world without an object on which I can place value. From those which are distant I am excluded by reason and reflection. The sun of life having with me already passed his meridian, with you he is ascending, and I sincerely participate of your rising prospects. Your thirst after knowlege, your capacity to acquire it, your dispositions to apply it to the good of  MAY 4, 1784  mankind, with the ardent spirits of youth necessary to support a man against the impediments opposed to him, give your country much to hope from the continuance of your life. I shall take particular pleasure in administering to your information all future occurrences within my reach which may be worthy of your attention. As an earnest of this you will be pleased to accept the inclosed papers in the form in which they have ultimately passed Congress.(3) To enable me to continue these communications you must be so good as to favour me with your address. On your part you will oblige me by a detail from time to time of those occurrences in Europe either political or literary which may be worthy of note, adding to them such informations relative to yourself as the interest I feel in your happiness will always render grateful to me.

  Dear Sir Annapolis 4th May 1784 I received your Letter of the 19th of April, yesterday with Mr. Loomis's papers. Shall attend to his affair when I return to Philadelphia. I am obliged to you for the Information contained in the close of your letter respecting the Politics of our State. The States who have agreed to the impost recommended by Congress, are N. Hamshire, Massachusetts, N. Jersy, Pensylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. These have fully complied. We have not heard what New York and North Carolina have done in the late sessions of their Legislatures, but their delegates say that there is no reason to doubt but that they have complied with the requisition, Georgia we find by the News Papers have lately appointed delegates, but they have not arrived in Congress, and we are not informed what that State has done respecting the impost. R. Island Delegates think their State will be the last that agrees to it, but that the last requisition is less exceptionable than the former. It appears to me that a general impost will  MAY 4, 1784  be the best way for raising a revenue for the Interest of the National Debt--tho, I never wish to have the power in Congress to raise money extended beyond what may be necessary for the present debt, but never to raise any for current expences. I am not able to furnish you with the journals of Congress for the last year the volume is not compleated. I understand by the Secretary that he has Sent to Governor Trumbull all that have been printed. General Wadsworth & I in our late joint Letter gave you an account of the principal Matters done & expected to be done by Congress this Session,(1) all the States except Delaware and Georgia are now represented. It is not likely that Congress will agree to any Answer to the Address on commutation--the members are divided as to the Stile and tone in which it should be answered, some were for transmiting a Copy of the answer given to Massachusetts, or make an answer Nearly like it. Others thought it would be best only to State what had been done and leave it to the House to make the inferrences, as was done in the draught reported by the last Committee of which we transmitted a copy, that would have been agreed to, if the question had been put without the Yeas and Nays, as several members told me they would have voted for it, in that case who now voted in the negative.(2) I dont find any Member that thinks that the commutation can be rescinded, or avoided without a violation of public faith, a Majority approve of the Measure. I hope the western territory will sink a considerable part of the National debt, it is proposed to apply it only to the principal. You will see the Plan for establishing New States, and the requisitions for payment of arrears of Interest and the current expences, and a recommendation to the States, lately passed for opposing the System adopted by great Britain respecting Commerce, in the printed journals that will be transmitted to the Governor. I Sent Some extracts to the Governor from the Letters of our Ministers in Europe for his information and to be communicated to the General Assembly. I hope none of them will be published in the News Papers. As Some things of that kind have been very improperly done in a Neighbouring State, Congress has lately laid an injunction to taking or publishing extracts from Such Letters without express permission.(3) The act of the General Assembly of our State respecting allowance for Coast Guards &c is now before a Grand Committee not reported on.(4) We have not laid the Act for making a Cession of western territory before Congress. They have renewed the requisition to the States for that purpose--and we Shall offer a Cession a few days hence. I hope Sir that you or one of the other delegates will come forward to attend the Committee of the States to be left in the recess of Congress. I am Sir with the most perfect respect and esteem Your humble Servant, Roger Sherman.  MAY 5, 1784  ""

  My dear Sir Annapolis 5th May 1784  It gives me great Pleasure to learn by your Favour of the 4th of Feby,(1) which came to Hand a few Days since, that You had safely arrived, as the Severity of the Winter here, made your Friends apprehend that your Passage to London would be dangerous. I am much obliged to you for forwarding my Letters to Mr Adams & Mr Jay, & have been fully impressed with their disagreable Situation. How it happened that the Instructions were sent without a Commission I know not (2)--this being a meer Form for carrying the others into Effect, should I think have been prepared by the Secretary, officially, & layed before Congress: & if he neglected it, the president most certainly, should have communicated the Matter to Congress before he forwarded the Instructions,(3) as he must have known that without the one, the others were useless. I suppose the Fact to be, that neither the one nor the other of these Gentlemen were favorable to two of our Ministers, to whom the Union are so much indebted for an honorable Peace. We have now before Congress a Report which takes up the Matter on very extensive principles, & not only authorizes the Ministers to negotiate & sign the Treaties, but to extend their negotiations to all the powers which have made advances for this purpose. The Report has been debated & the Question put, but miscarried by the Negative of a single Member, & is now delayed in Consequence of the Demand of an addition of two Ministers from the southern States to Messrs. Adams, Franklin & Jay.(4) Congress I think will consent to one, & this will be Mr. Jefferson; but some of the States insist on a previous acceptance of the Resignation of Doctor Franklins Commission, for the Reasons he has offered, his Advanced Years &c, but there are not seven States I think which will vote for this Measure. Perhaps six would agree to it. I trust that neither Mr Adams nor Mr Jay will think of returning untill this Matter is brot to an issue, which must be soon, nor untill the negotiations of the Treaties, in Consequence of the new Instructions, if adopted, shall be compleate. Pray communicate this & inform them, I have deferred writing in order to give them full Information on the Subject. MAY 5, 1784  Congress have resolved to adjourn the 3d of next month to meet at Trenton the 30th of October next, for the Dispatch of publick Business & in the Interim to leave a Committee of the States for the Conduct of such Matters as shall be assigned to them. We have passed two Resolutions recommending to the States an addition to the Power of Congress respecting Commerce.(5) We have also passed the Requisition for this Year, a Copy of which I inclose:(6) & are taking Measures for making the back Lands a Sinking Fund.  A Report was made on your Application for a Certificate,(7) & having brot on the Matter I found that it was considered by some Members as an Interference in a personal Dispute, & that the Question could not be carried, but would probably be negatived by the Yeas & Nays ; for which Reason, it is dropped. The particulars I may communicate at our next Interview. Pray give my best Respects to Mr Adams, & Mr Jay & be assured dear Sir I am yours sincerely. E.

12656,dg021441,1784,New Hampshire Delegates to Meshech Weare,"""
 New Hampshire Delegates to Meshech Weare  Sir, Annapolis 5th May 1784  We were honrd with yours of the 9th Ulmo. and had previously forwarded to your Excellency, and to the Gentlemen imediately concerned, the necessary information with Respect to the subject of it, since which, no oppertunity has occurred for obtaining a more explicit determination. We have the honr. to enclose a resolution pressing the payment of the one half a former requisition of eight Million Dollars, including the payments already made thereon.(1) The reasons for this call are so minutely stated in the Report itself, that we need say little on that subject. We shall therefore, only observe, that it seemed absolutely neces- MAY 5, 1784  sary to make such provision as might retrieve the expiring credit of the United States, and inspire foreign and domestic creditors with confidence in the plighted faith of the public. And after the most mature deliberation the mode adopted in the report appeared the most eligible, and indeed the only one practicable. In the monthly Journal forwarded by this Post your Excellency will observe an Act of Congress passed the twenty third Ult. relative to the western Territory.(2) It has been in contemplation to render these Lands productive for the purpose of discharging the engagments to the Officers & Soldiers, and defraying other debts contracted in the late War. Another report is before Congress for opening a land Office to enable the Officers & Soldiers to locate their claims, and selling the remainder for public securities.(3) We flatter ourselves these Lands will prove a considerable resource for sinking the National debt, and, if rightly conducted, liten the burthens of our fellow-citizens on account of Taxes as well as give relief to the creditors of the United States. This extensive property vesting in the United States and (so far as depends on the Virginia cession) under an express stipulation to lay it off into new and separate States created much dificulty in arranging the mode of temporary & permanent Goverments as well as the manner of admitting those States into the Union when they shall be of sufficient maturity to be entitled to that privilege; and we expect equal dificulties will arise in the dispositions for disposing of this property, but hope however it will be so adjusted as to give satisfaction to the States, & render it as productive as possible. A Report will also be forwarded recommending to the State to vest Congress with such powers for the regulation of Trade as are deemed necessary to counteract the attempt of Great Britain to engross the carrying trade:(4) This we conceive necessary to be complied with, as a means to convince foreign Nations, that America can act in concert in guarding her Trade, as well as in defending her liberties, and to prevent our trade from being sported with and sacrificed to European policy. The recommendation we think to be so guarded that no ill consequences are to be apprehended from adopting that measure. The old dispute respecting Vermont is once more bro't before Congress. The delegates from New York have lately presented a Memorial on that subject. We enclose the Copy.(5) It is referred to a Committee which has not yet reported: the sense of the Legislature, or Executive of the State we have the honr. to represent, on this matter, would have been very agreeable to us before we were called on to act, but that we cannot hope to receive should it be taken up before the adjournment, which we think will take place at the furthest, on the third of June next.  We beg leave to mention, that several of the States which have agreed to the Impost have not proceeded so far as to grant the other funds proposed: whither it would be best for New Hampshire imediately to fix, and grant these additional funds, we submit to the consideration of the legislature. A Committee consisting of a Member from each State have now under consideration a Memorial from Massachusetts for allowances for old Money, the Penobscott expedition, and extra bounties to Soldiers. New Hampshire is interested equally in the Continental Money & extra bounties as Massachusetts; but from present appearences we have not the most sanguine hopes, that anything satisfactory will be agreed to, on this application. The adjournment of Congress, to meet at Trenton on the last of October next, we expect will take place on the third day of June next, Agreeable to a Resolution impowering the President for that purpose: A Committee of the States will be left sitting in the recess. We have the honr. to be, your Excellencys most Obedient Servts. Abiel Foster Jona. Blanchard  ""

  Dear General Annapolis May 7. 1784. I received by the last post your favour of the 27th Ult.(1) and am obliged for the communications therein. The ferment on the subject of your society (2) seems just becoming general. They write us from Virginia that it works high there, and that the division is precisely into civil and military. We will not presume to send foreign news from Annapolis to Philadelphia. Congress expect to adjourn on the 3d of June. They have passed the estimate and requisitions for the year, and some recommendations to the states to vest Congress with so much power over their commerce as will enable them to retaliate on any nation who may wish to grasp it on unequal terms; and to enable them if it should be found expedient to pass something like the British navigation act. You saw in the public papers a report of a committee, erroneously said to be an act of Congress, for dividing the Western country into new states.(3) That report was recommitted, the paragraph of names struck off, the principles of government somewhat varied and the act then passed. Foreign treaties of commerce occupy us at present. I am not yet fixed as to the time of my coming to Philadelphia, tho' think it will be not long first.

  Sir Annapolis May 7. 1784. The duty of correspondence for the Month being devolved on me, and no authentic intelligence from abroad having been received, I have it in my power to communicate to you only what we get through the channel of the public papers. The inclosed (1) will present to you some of the late debates of the H. of Commons, their addresses to the king and his answers. These seem to exclude the prospect of accomodation. In my last I inclosed you a copy of the estimate and requisi- MAY 7, 1787  tions for the year, and the act for the division of the Western country as they had ultimately passed Congress. Since that, the resolutions have been passed which have been forwarded to you by the President recommending to the legislatures to invest Congress with certain powers in some cases of commerce.(2) The principles on which treaties of commerce are to be formed with foreign powers, occupy the attention of Congress at this time.(3) There will then remain for discussion before their adjournment 1. the opening of their land office; 2. Indian affairs; 3. the Western posts; 4. a proposed arrangement of the treasury on the resignation of Mr. Morris which is expected; and 5. a definition of the powers of the Committee of the States. In your favour of the 23d of Apr.(4) you ask at what rate the Loan-office debt is to be discharged? The resolutions of June 28. 1780 which fix the rate of depreciation, declare that the principal of the loans shall be discharged in Spanish dollars according to those rates.(5) We have had information of the adoption of the impost by every state except Georgia, N. Carolina, New York, Connecticut and Rhodeisland. From the three first there is no reason to apprehend any opposition. Connecticut declares itself opposed unless the Commutation can be separated from it. The firmness of Congress on this head will exclude her from every hope of that, and I am informed it is probably she will yeild that point and adopt the measure. I have frequently heard the gentleman of Rhodeisland, (6) to whom the opposition of that state has been generally imputed, declare that Rhodeisland would never come into the measure of the impost as long as any other state would hold off; that if every other acceded however, she would not solely oppose the will of the whole union, but in that case would yeild. The probability therefore is that the measure will get through all the legislatures in the course of this summer. The letter to Mr. Barclay shall be taken care of. I have the honor to be with much respect & esteem your Excellency's Most obedt. & most humble servt., Th. Jefferson Reprinted from Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 7:225-26. 1 Not identified. 2 See Jefferson to Harrison, April 30, 1784. 3 See JCC, 26:342-48, 349-50, 352-56. Jefferson later elaborated on these debates regarding the \""principles\"" on which commercial treaties should be negotiated in the following July 31, 1785, letter to John Adams. Words printed in italics in this extract were written in cipher. \""When the 1st. article of our instructions of May 7. 1784. was under debate in Congress, it was proposed that neither party should make the other pay in their ports greater duties than they paid in the ports of the other. One objection to this was it's impracticability, another that it would put it out of our power to lay such duties on alien importation as might encourage importation by natives. Some members much attached to English policy thought such a distinction should actually be established. Some thought the power to do it should be reserved in case any peculiar circumstances should call for it, tho under the present or perhaps any probable circumstances they did not think it would be good policy ever to exercise it. The footing  MAY 7, 1784  gentis amicissimi was therefore adopted as you see in the instruction....I remember that when we were digesting the general form of our treaty this proposition to put foreigners and natives on the same footing was considered: and we were all three (Dr. F.) as well as you and myself in favor of it. We finally however did not admit it partly from the objection you mention, but more still on account of our instructions. But tho' the English proclamation had appeared in America at the time of framing these instructions I think it's effect as to alien duties had not yet been experienced and therefore was not attended to. If it had been noted in the debate I am sure that the annihilation of our whale trade would have been thought too great a price to pay for the reservation of a barren power which a majority of the members did not propose ever to exercise tho they were willing to retain it.\"" See Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 8:332-33. 4 See ibid., 7:114. 5 See JCC, 17:567-69. 6 That is, David Howell.

Instructions for Negociating Treaties of Commerce with most of the Commercial Nations in Europe were agreed to Yesterday; and Mr. Jefferson was appointed to be joined in Commission with Mr. Adams & Doctr Franklin for Negociating the Treaties.(2) We are informed by a Letter from Doctr. Franklin dated the beginning of March last that Mr Jay intended soon to return home, Whereupon he was appointed Secretary of foreign affairs.(3) The Letter was short & does not contain much information, the ratification of the  MAY 8, 1784  definitive treaty had not been received, tho' the time for exchanging it was elapsed, which the Doctr. Supposes will not Occasion any difficulty. The Salaries of our Ministers at foreign Courts were reduced yesterday 2111 dollars below what they were before Stated;(4) the Commissions now to be given them are to continue in force not exceeding two years. Further reductions are proposed to be made of the expence of the civil list, as your Excellency may observe by a report, brought on to the printed Journals by Yeas & Nays.(5) There are before Congress to be acted Upon this Session, several Matters of a public Nature of considerable importance, the principal which we recollect are the following, An Ordinance for Ascertaining the mode of locating and disposing of lands in the Western territory. Another for putting the office of Finance into Commission. A report for Garrisoning the western Posts. Directions for Settling accounts, appointing & Impowering a Committee of the States.  Treating with the Southern Indians &c.  There are also several matters under the consideration of Committees--Such as the Sinking the old continental Bills of Credit--Allowances to be made to the particular States for expence of Militia &c for their own defence--doing Justice to those States who have raised more than their quotas of the continental troops actually kept up as to bounties &c--Penobscot Expedition--Application of New York to decide on the Case of Vermont. Application of Pennsylvania to revoke the order for appointing a Court on the Petition of Zebulun Butler and others. Alledging that the Petitioners have no Grant under Connecticut & therefore do not come within the provision of the article of Confederation.(6) A Petition from Zebulun Butler & others to be quieted in their possessions until their right shall be determined.(7) The two last referred to the Same Committee, viz. Mr Jefferson, Mr. Ellery and Mr. Williamson. Mr. John Franklin from Wyoming is now here,(8) by his account the settlers there under Connecticut are under very distressed circumstances, from the destruction of their property by the flood--and the oppression and violences of the claimers of their Lands under Pensylvania, & of the armed forces kept up there by that State, without permission of Congress contrary to the articles of Confederation. We Submit to your Excellency's consideration whether it is not expedient that a representation of their Case should be made by the State of Connecticut, both to congress and the Supreme executive of Pennsylvania. If the executive can't reach those troops they certainly might Govern them, and punish them for the lawless violences committed against the citizens of the State. It is probable that the appointment of a court to try the right of those Settlers to the Soil, will be postponed till the next session of Congress at Trenton.  We are with great esteem and regard, Your Excellency's humble Servants. Roger Sherman James Wadsworth  ""

  Sir, Annapolis May 8, 1784. ....I enclose a Resolution in favor of Doctor Schuyler, and a report of the Grand Committee, Stating the sums necessary to be paid for arrears of Interest and Services, to which Congress have agreed.(1) I suppose you will receive the Resolutions respecting the Bells from Mr. Paine.(2)... Congress having Resolved to Adjourn on the 3d of June next to Trentown and to appoint a Committee to sit in the recess thereof, it may perhaps be thought unnecessary for the Delegates at Home to come, but this is not the case. General McDougall has promised in the most positive terms to be here by the First of June. I shall therefore propose in Congress that he be appointed the Member of the Committee, from our State. I proposed it to Mr. Paine the other Day, on which he replied that he did not believe that General McDougall would come. From this and other circumstances it appears to me that it would suit him to stay, but I hope not. I shall write General McDougall by the next Post and put him in mind of his positive promise to me in New York, which I expect he will perform.

12673,dg021458,1784,Thomas Jefferson to James Madison,"""Thomas Jefferson to James Madison
  Dear Sir Annapolis May 8. 1784. I will now take up the several enquiries contained in your letter of Apr. 25 which came to hand yesterday.(1) 'Will it not be good policy to suspend further treaties of commerce till measures shall have taken place in America, which may correct the idea in Europe of impotency in the federal government in matters of commerce?' Congress think such measures requisite, and have accordingly recommended them as you will perceive by my last.(2) In the meantime they seem to think that our commerce is got & getting into vital agonies by our exclusion from the West Indies, by late embarrasments in Spain & Portugal, and by the dangers of the Mediterranean trade. These you observe form the aggregate of our valuable markets. They think that the presumption of one or two countries should not be a reason for suspending treaties with all countries: and that the prospect of effect from their recommendations on commerce will perhaps drive on the treaties. The present favourable disposition of the piratical states on the Barbary coast has been repeatedly urged by our ministers as a circumstance which may be transient and should therefore be seised to open the Mediterranean to us. 'Has Virginia been seconded &c. in her proposition for arming Congress with powers to frustrate the unfriendly regulations of Great Britain?' Pennsylvania and Maryland offered much larger powers. Those of Virginia might have been defeated by the British king repealing his proclamation one day & renewing it the next. Yet the powers and plans from all these states were different: and it was visible they would authorize no single measure. Therefore Congress recommended a uniform measure. 'Is the impost gaining or losing ground?' Gaining, most certainly. Georgia, North Carolina, New York, Connecticut & Rhode island are yet to pass it. The three first are supposed to be willing to do it. Connecticut has held off merely to try whether Congress would not rescind the commutation. Finding a firmness on this point it is said &  MAY 8, 1784  beleived that at their next session they will come into it. Howell has often told me that R. I. will not accede to it as long as any other state holds off: but when every other shall have adopted it, she will. 'Does the settlement of the public accounts make any comfortable progress?' They are going on, but slowly I beleive. However they go on, and of course approach their term. 'Has any resolution been taken by Congress touching the old Continental currency?' That question has been debated by a grand Committee upwards of a month. They yesterday came to the inclosed resolution.(3) It was decided by only 6 votes against 5. I think it will gain strength in the House. The Southern and middle states I beleive are for it, & I think one or two of the Eastern may perhaps come over. Yet there is far from being a certainty of this. 'Has ______ forborne to take any step in favor of ______ ?'(4) Their object was certainly not the same with ours. Yet they have not openly set their faces against us. They have one delegate, honest & disinterested, who certainly will in no case do it.(5) 'Whether the war ceased in March or April?' I think no decision has taken place on that subject in our court of Appeals. Our ministers write that it is no question on that side the water but that it ended in March. The produce of our slave tax being nearly equal to the Continental requisitions, can you not get it appropriated to that purpose, and have it all paid in money?(6) Virginia must do something more than she has done to maintain any degree of respect in the Union & to make it bearable to any man of feeling to represent her in Congress. The public necessities call distressingly for aid, and very ruinous circumstances proceed from the inattention of the states to furnish supplies in money. S. Carolina is the foremost state in supplies notwithstanding her distresses. Whence does this proceed? From a difference of spirit solely; from a pride of character; from a rejection of the unmanly supineness which permits personal inconveniency to absorb every other sentiment. There is no man who has not some vice or folly the starving of which would not pay his taxes. I am now to take my leave of the justlings of states and to repair to a feild where the divisions will be fewer but on a larger scale. Congress yesterday joined me to Mr. Adams & Dr. Franklin on the foreign commercial negotiations. I shall pursue there the line I have pursued here, convinced that it can never be the interest of any party to do what is unjust, or to ask what is unequal. Mr. Jay was to sail for America this month. His health has obliged him to return to try his native air. He is appointed Sec. for Foreign affairs. I pray you to continue to favor me with your correspondence. At the close of every session of assembly a state of the general measures & dispositions, as well as of the subordinate politics of parties or indi-  viduals will be entertaining and useful. During recesses other objects will furnish matter sufficient for communication. On my part I shall certainly maintain the correspondence. If moreover you can at any time enable me to serve you by the execution of any particular commission I shall agree that my sincerity may be judged by the readiness with which I shall execute it. In the purchase of books, pamphlets &c. old & curious, or new & useful I shall ever keep you in my eye. Whether I shall procure for you the books you have before desired at Philadelphia or Paris shall be decided according to circumstances when I get to Philadelphia, from which place I will write to you. I have a tender legacy to leave you on my departure. I will not say it is the son of my sister, tho her worth would justify my resting it on that ground; but it is the son of my friend, the dearest friend I knew, who, had fate reversed our lots, would have been a father to my children.(7) He is a boy of fine dispositions, and sound masculine talents. I was his preceptor myself as long as I staid at home, & when I came away I placed him with Mr. Maury. On his breaking up his school I desired Mr. Short to dispose of him, but Mr. Short I expect will go with me to Europe. I have no body then but you to whose direction I could consign him with unlimited confidence. He is nearly master of the Latin, and has read some Greek. I beleive he is about 14 years of age. I would wish him to be employed till 16 in completing himself in latin, Greek, French, Italian & Anglosaxon. At that age I mean him to go to the college. I have written to my sister of the application I make to you & she will be very happy to have your advice executed. My steward Mr. Key will furnish money to his tutors &c. on your order. There is a younger one, just now in his Latin rudiments. If I did not fear to overcharge you I would request you to recommend the best school for him. He is about 10 years old, and of course ceteris paribus, of any two schools, that nearest his mother would be most agreeable. You will readily understand I am speaking of the sons of Mr. Carr. I think Colo. Monroe will be of the Committee of the states. He wishes a correspondence with you; and I suppose his situation will render him an useful one to you. The scrupulousness of his honor will (8) make you safe in the most confidential communications, a better man cannot be. I think your two loans to me amounted to 503 Dollars. I paid for the first pair of spectacles 13 Doll. & shall pay the same for the 2d unless they should be returned. I now inclose you an order on the Treasurer for 407 Dollars (9) which will leave in my hand a balance of 68 Dollars due to you which is about the sum you desired. May 11. Many considerations have determined me to go on to Boston & take shipping from thence. This was a conclusion of yesterday. All my letters dated previous to that will state me as purposing to sail from N. York. I leave this place to-day; expect to stay in Philadelphia till the 25th and to be at Boston about the 3d of June. MAY 9, 1784  I am with the sincerest esteem, Dr. Sir, Your affectionate friend & servt., Th. Jefferson ""

  Sir, Annapolis 10th May 1784  It was not from the want of Inclination but of Time that I have not paid a more early attention to your several favour's. To that by Col Morgan I should have reply'd simply by saying that on whatever side Justice may lye the Interference of Congress in such Case appears absolutely impossible.(1) Before your Memorial came to Hand or about that Time Mr Thomson found the original & the Report.(2) I have not calld for it because I thought a true regard to your Interest would not justify such a measure. In fact with the present Disposition of a Majority of the states on the subject of Salary I conceive it impossible to obtain a Vote for the Continuance of the allowance of 4 Dlrs beyond the time when Congress pass'd the Resolve which operated as a Reduction. But I am persuaded that if the Question should be brot. forward a motion  MAY 10, 1784  would be made & carry'd for striking off both the Geographers, Officers which a considerable Part of Congress do not suppose to exist at this Hour. You may have seen in the Hands of some public Officers in Philad' the Resolves of Congress lately pass'd for dividing the western Country into states; there is now on its Passage an Ordinance for opening the Land Office. It is proposed that a surveyor Genl or a Register, having the same duties, shall be appointed in each of the States. This will be a permanent and a good Office. There are several Candidates for those offices; your friends count on putting you into one of the first. If a push should be made by Rivals well supported it will be much more easy to remove you from the present Office into the other than to put a Man into office who is absolutely out of it. On this View of the Subject, informed as I am of the general Ideas of the states on the Subject of Salaries I thought that your true Interest would be promoted by suffering the Question to rest. There is now before Congress an application from Mr. DeWidt the other Geographer supported by Genl Washington.(3) Mr DeWidt requests to know whether it is the wish of Congress that he be discharged. And expresses his wish that he may be appointed Surveyor Genl in a new State which may be laid off. This application is committed & is in my Hands as one of the Committee. We cannot with consistence report that one of the Geographers should be discharged as a useless Officer while the other is retaind, nor can we say that one of them should continue to receive 4 Dlrs while the other takes only 2, & we certainly cannot with propriety insist on Mr DeWidts taking more than he thinks is due. Viewing the subject in Every Point of Light I shall not call for the Report on your Memorial unless you shall inform me of your wish to have a determination. I have recd. Pleasure & Information from your Publication respecting the southern Port of Louisiana.(4) However true it may be that the U S may, when they shall desire so to do, take Possession of N Orleans & the Mississipi I wish that no such Idea had been committed to Print especially by an Officer of the United States. There are many things very true which in political Prudence should not be affirmed, lest they should be supposed to mean more than is really meant, or to excite suspicions that there existed some Intention to convert the theorem into a Problem. In preparing the Ordinance now pending before Congress for opening a Land Office & surveying the Western vacant Lands some Mathematical & Geometrical Questions occur'd. The Committee had not access to some Books which they wished to see. I wish to know how many miles & feet were found to be in a Degree of Latitude according to the measurement made by Mason & Dixon in the Delaware State, for I think they made one. I wish also to know the precise Translation of a Taise into a British foot, in Order to know how many Miles & feet were found to be in a Degree in France, Norway & South Amer-  ica. Our friend Dr Ewing5 who has made out the computations can answer you those several Questions immediately. I should have written to him on the Subject but as he pays no more attention to Letters which he receives than prime ministers usually do to Pasquinades and refuses to give Proof even of his acquaintance with the Art of writing I have attempted in this circuitous manner to obtain the Information refer'd to.

  Dear Sir, Annapolis May 11th. 1784  I cannot let this opportunity, though, from Mr. Jefferson's hurry, a transitory one, pass; without writing you a line. The arrangement of our foreign affairs which makes Mr Jay Secretary here, & joins Mr. Jefferson with you, must I think be pleasing to you, as they both have a friendship for you & are men of ability. It was my wish that the negociations might be carried on at the Hague or in London. But it is tender ground to tread on, & Paris I suppose, though for many reasons the most improper, will be the place. From the Accounts we have here, I judge that Pitt & his friends will maintain their places against Fox & North; & I suppose you will find them most disposd to treat upon large, wise, & liberal principles. I therefore wish they may continue in place. Our Treasury is as low & the prospect of raising it by taxes, as unpromising as possible. Either the present Superintendant must continue in with powers calculated solely to convert every thing to the emolument of himself & his Creatures; or if a reform is made, he & his immoral Assistant1 have malignity enough to endeavor to ruin where they can no longer plunder. However there is now a plan before Congress for reforming the department, by putting it into Commission & prohibiting the Commissioners from being engaged in trade or commerce; which I hope will take place. The only adequate fund I can conceive for the payment of our debts, are our western Lands; the cession of which being at length adjusted, if we can secure a large purchase from the Indian Nations, with whom a treaty is soon to be held for that purpose, we may sink so much of our domestic debt, by selling lands for Certificates as will render the remainder very light. It is the importance of this object that has induced me to think of accepting a place among the Commissioners. The negociation will  MAY 11, 1784  not be so illustrious, (but not less substantially benificial) as those of Europe. Congress is at present well disposd, & their deliberations have been much less under the controul of M. Marbois & the Financier since they left Philadelphia. Much industry will therefore be usd to make them return thither, But I think without success. The adjournment which is fixt for the 3d of next month, will end my congressional character, not being eligible another year under the confederation. The next year I mean to devote to a tour in the western Country, down the Ohio & Missisippi to New Orleans & from thence to Georgia & the Carolinas. After that I shall sit myself down in some retird place, the world forgetting, by the world forgot. I wish you every success in your negociations, & a happy return, to where no one will be more welcome, your own Country. Farewell A. Lee ""

  My dear Sir, Annapolis 13th May 1784 To answer your agreable Favour of the 26th of April, I take a post Sheet, but May not be able to fill it, from the Want of Time. Nothing has yet transpired with Respect to the Cincinnati, but I rely much on G W____n's (1) determination communicated to a Friend as he passed thro this Place, for the Abolition of the Institution. Mr. Jay in a Letter which I received from him dated the 19th of Feby., says \""some of our best friends think the Order of Cincinnatus will eventually divide us into two mighty Factions--the permission of the K____g of F____e for his officers to be of that order was asked, but the like Compliment was not paid to her own Sovereign. The King has consented without having requested the Opinion of Congress on the Subject that I can learn.\"" (2) I observe likewise that the Officers of the first Rank in France are subscribing liberally to establish a Fund for the Society, intending undoubtedly to apply the Money to the purposes of Force or Intrigue, in pursuit of their Object. The total Abolition of this Institution must at all Events be effected, or We may bid a final adeiu to every pretension of Freemen. Unfortunately for a certain European Power, the Constitution of the US is such, that it cannot be the Sport of foreign politicians & statesmen. If a Majority of one Congress, should at great Pains & Expence be induced to swerve from their Duty, as some suspect has been lately too much the Case, the next Members cannot be influenced in Time, so as to prevent an opposition to the Measures of their predecessors, & besides, there is such a continual Change in the Course of six or twelve Months, that a System of Influence is impracticable. To remedy this Inconvenience, our Friends find a Change necessary in the Constitution, & as I endeavoured formerly to shew have created this political Wolf & presented it in Sheeps Cloathing, & to recommend the harmless Creature they have christned it with the venerable Name of Cincinnatus. Should it  MAY 13, 1784  be suffered to exist in its present Form, the constitutional Congress must be soon suspended by the military one: & an Existence in any Form, will furnish an intriguing Court with a fixed order of Men to carry on operations against our Constitution. Let us suppose the Members of the Cincinnati without Funds, Titles, Badges, or hereditary Descents, & only permitted to have innocent Meetings in the States & in a continental Congress once or twice a year. Will they not be instantly an object for intriguing Courts to establish thereby an Influence, to Accomplish the purposes mentioned, or any other that may endanger the Liberties of America? May not Money be well applied in securing the Influence first of the military Congress, & afterwards of the leading Members in the military Conventions, to produce a Change, an overthrow of our Constitution? Would not these pursuits be dressed in the most amiable Garbs of publick Virtue, patriotism, a Love of good Government, & aversion to the Anarchy of fOEderal republican Governments? & whilst there is an order of firm, persevering, able, & influential Men, systematically embodied to pursue their object, will it not be effected against the most vigorous pursuits of a few, when the first may be rewarded for their Services & supported by all the Scriblers & Tools of a foreign Court in Europe & America, Whilst the last must carry on an opposition at the risque of sacrificing their Interest, Friendships, & even Reputation? I say Reputation, for We have already seen the Artifices used to ruin the fairest Characters, because they would not Submit to be political prostitutes. But I shall say no more at present on the Subject, altho I have expressed but a little of what I have tho't on the Occasion: excepting this, that the Conduct of those who supported H (3) ought to be publickly mentioned on every occasion, that the Criminality of the Measure may by publick Habits follow it as naturally as the Shadow does the Substance. We Yesterday made Choice of Colo Humphrys, formerly an aid to G Washg. to be Secretary to the Commission.(4) I had some Thots. of Mr C____m____l but, his Connections with the Doctor induced me to drop the Intention. Young Franklin was warmly supported, but We carried the Election, I think fortunately against him. The Commissioners are instructed jointly to negotiate on general principles, & to sign the Treaties, reserving to Congress the Ratification. Had We consented to have had the projects sent to Congress, they would probably be so altered as to be rejected when returned to Europe; & the plan of a certain Court to keep our Commerce in her own Hands, would be promoted. The Treaties are to be for ten & not by any Means to exceed fifteen years, excepting those with the Emperor of Morocco & the other barbary powers. Governor Reed, in a Letter of the 11th of March informs me \""that the people in power there (he was then in London) stimulated by the W India planters & Merchants seem in-  clined to relax the late prohibition of commercial Intercourse with the W India Islands by admitting Vessels of 80 tons Burthen & under to an Entry & sale. I am says he, assured a proclamation to this Effect will issue in a few Days.\""  We have appointed G Lincoln in your Room to be a Commissioner to negotiate with the Indians.(5) Mr Osgood I propose for the Treasury, should our Report succeed to put it in Commission--the Ordnance has had one reading, & I have great Hopes, it will obtain a favorable Reception.(6) The Journals of the last Year are not yet printed. I will endeavour to procure you a sett when finished. I think the Complexion of Congress is good; I most ardently wish to see Mr Dana, & intend him for a Member of the Committee of the States. I am much obliged to you for your offers of Service, but expecting to see you soon shall not have need of commercial Assistance, or any other respectg my private Concerns.

  Sir Annapolis May 13th. 1784. We do ourselves the honor of transmitting to yr. Excellency, a Copy of the Journals of Congress, which will compleat the one already sent you by the Secretary as far as printed--from these it will appear that  MAY 13, 1784  Congress has resolv'd to adjourn on the 3d of June ensuing, to meet at Trenton in Jersey, on the 30th of October next, & to the different Questions which this measure gave rise to, we referr your Excellency as they will give you a just idea of the progress of this business. It may be well however here to observe that the Votes in Congress as they stand at present, are unfavorable to a Southern situation & untill the admission of Western States into the Union, we apprehend it will be found impracticable to retain that Body, any length of time, southward of the middle State--and it may be proper also to suggest, that shoud Congress continue in their present unsettled state, & the Southern & Middle States remain dependant on the Eastern States, for the removal of Congress alternately to Jersey & Maryland, it may at times be productive of concessions in favor of the northern Members of this confOEderacy on other very important points & indeed give them an unequal weight in the scale--add to this, that it will have one most pernicious influence, the rendering Members of Congress much more sollicitous about where they sit, than what they do.(1) Whether every exertion we can make will so far advance the national business as to admit of an adjournment at the time propos'd, with propriety, may be well doubted. To remedy any inconveniences that might arise from an untimely recess it is propos'd to leave a Committee of the States, but the powers they are to possess remain still undefin'd. On the 7th instant, Congress agreed to a Plan for forming Commercial Treaties, with the Maratime Powers of Europe & those of Africa bordering on the Mediterranean. To a measure ardently sollicited by the mercantile part of America & warmly espous'd by a large majority of Congress, we did not choose to with-hold our assent. We judged it more advisable to render the instructions to our Ministers as conformable as circumstances woud permit to the Desire of the State express'd to us in the Act of the Legislature of the 23d of May 1783,(2) and to suspend the final decision on the measure, untill Mr. Jefferson had been join'd in the Commission for these negociations to Mr. Adams & Doctor Franklin. It was an object with us, in order to tender the Commission, as agreable as possible to the southern States to have Mr. Jefferson placed in the room of Mr. Jay, who at his own request returns to America & who was at the same time appointed Minister of the United States for Foreign Affairs. The uncommon talents of this Gentleman, & the experience he has no doubt gaind in foreign Politics, will render his services in this Department momentous, at a period when our Negociations with Europe are like to become so complicated. We coud not, but in a great measure attribute the caution of the Legislature, in the Act before alluded to, to the obvious inequality in the Representation of these States in Europe, and altho' the integrity of the former Commissioners, was as unquestionable as the liberality   of their Sentiments, yet their want of information with respect to the true Commercial Interests of the Southern States, must have remain'd an insurmountable obstacle with us, to the commission of such extensive Powers of clogging our Commerce to a Delegation wholly from Northern States. Shou'd this have been the motive, which influenc'd the Legislature, we flatter ourselves that their objection will have been remov'd by the appointment of Mr. Jefferson--and that the present European Commission will be as satisfactory to the State of Virginia as it appears to be to Congress. In this hope & when we reflect on what essential benefits the Union may derive from his Talents & exertions in an employment as arduous in its execution, as it will be important in its effects, we feel ourselves in a great measure compensated for the public loss of a very able, & our private loss of a very amiable Colleague.  We woud suggest the Utility of collecting memorials from the principal trading Houses of Virginia, on the present State of our Foreign Commerce. An intelligent merchant employ'd in the direct exchange with Europe, might furnish useful hints to the ablest negociator. His accounts of sales in Foreign Countries together with his remarks on the inconveniences & impositions he was in the several instances subjected to, woud throw light on the particular Stipulations, which it will no doubt be the policy of the United States to preferr, to the loose, vague & general terms adopted in the Treaties heretofore made. Any information on this subject, which the Executive woud transmit to the Delegates, woud be by them instantly forwarded to our Commissioners in Europe. The Plan for the purchase of the Western Territory ceded to the United States, having been digested, a meeting of the Commissioners, appointed to negociate with the Indians, was directed to be held in New York. Thither but two of them repair'd & three having refused to accept of their appointments, Congress went into the nomination of others to supply their places.(3) Before this the Express sent in pursuit of General Clarke had return'd, without seeing him, so that but little hopes remain'd of his attending the Treaty, accordingly, we thought it best to nominate our Colleague, the Honorable Mr. Lee, who had previously consented to undertake the business. He was appointed, together with General Lincoln, but before he cou'd leave Congress, the two Commissioners at New York, after waiting some time without being able to form a board, had seperated, to meet again in the Month of August. The Statement of the Expenditures of Public Monies, from the Office of Finance, Mr. Morris informs he had delay'd furnishing, not having yet relinquish'd hopes of being able to quit that Department at a very early period, to which it was his wish to make up his Accounts at   one time. Whenever it is receiv'd we shall transmit it to Yr Excellency to lay before the Legislature. By a Letter from Doctr. Franklin dated Passy Mar. 9th. we are inform'd that the time limited for the exchange of the ratifications of the Definitive Treaty had expir'd before the Letters explanatory of the delay on our part, arriv'd. But still no difficulty on that head was expected. Mr. Adams was at that time in Holland. Mr. Jay had return'd to France, but was to embark with his family for America, in April. The Doctor adds that the general sentiment of Europe had become of late very favorable for America. With the utmost respect, We have the honor to be, Yr. Excellency's Most obedient & very humble Servants, S. Hardy John F. Mercer Arthur Lee except the paragraph  marked by a line. ""

I have also the pleasure to inform your excellency that Colo.

Attention hath also been paid to the interests of the southern States upon the infringment of the article of the treaty with G. Brittain respecting the negroes in their removal from N. York. We hope that the conduct of that court upon this occasion will be so conformable to the principles of justice & good faith as to remove all cause of umbrage from these States. A late letter from Dr. Franklin informs us that the unfavorable impressions entertain'd sometime since in Europe of these States, arising from the retreat of Congress from Phila., are remov'd & that the govt. of each State & of the union are held now in higher estimation.(2) Your Excellency hath already receiv'd a copy of the requisitions on the States for supplies, appropriated as stated in those requisitions to the expences of the civil govt. & the discharge of the interest due upon the foreign & domestic debt. I am persuaded the State will derive advantage from that part which admits of the payment of 1/4 in facilities. Whatever liquidated claims the State hath against the U.

  My Dr Brother Annapolis [May] 17th 1784  I did not flatter you before, when I stated the National Debt, & the Exertions, that would be necessary, to pay even the Annual Interest1--a conviction of the Inability, as well as disinclination of the States to pay, their Quota's of a Sum, that would Comprehend the whole con- MAY 17, 1784  tained in that Estimate, & knowing that requisitions not complied with, wd not only hold up our National poverty in very strong Colours, but wd argue also the want of Energy in our Executive Departments; were reasons of such weight with Congress, that they have determined to call only for two thirds of the Sum they had first in Contemplation. I inclose you their Act, as amended & agreed to finally (2)--an attentive perusal of this Statement & the Demand in consequence of it, will give you a more adequate Idea of the State of our Finances than is practicable for me to do in the short compass of a letter. I wd only observe that the Interest for the year 84 is not included in this Estimate, & the Sum called for provided it is punctually paid; will Embrace but little of the interest that became due in the Course of the last year--because a preference is to be given in payment according to the order in which they are arranged in that Statement. It may be a Question with some, why the whole of the Interest accruing on the Foreign Debt is to be discharged, when so partial a payment is made to our Domestic Creditors. To this it is answered, that in order to establish our Credit at home, it is necessary we should scrupulously observe our contracts abroad--that our pleas of inability, (not to say disinclination to pay Taxes); will be considered by them, rather as proceeding from a dishonest principle; than any real want, that exists in these states, of the Means whereby to furnish the Treasury, with a sum equal to the demands, that they have against it. But our argument which has more weight in my Mind is this--that those states who have the inclination may & will no doubt make more vigorous Exertions in favr of their own citizens & since Specie will not be wanted, facilities may be made use of, which at the same time that it renders complete satisfaction to the Creditor of the public, will not impoverish the states; by sending large sums of Money abroad--N. Jersey has adopted this Idea and is now paying her Citisens a year interest in Bills or Certificates, which are redeemable every year in Specie within the States.(3) This places the Burthen on those who ought to bear it; I mean those who have neither loaned their Monies, nor rendered personal services to the public. But I have one more word to say on this Subject & I have done. As I glanced my Eye over your letter I fnd this sentence \""I wish the states may be able to pay the Interest on My Arrearages & Commutation\"" (amounting to some thing more than £200). Now when I compare this with the former part of your letter, where you speak of \""the want of Sufficient Authority in Congress\""--\""The Sacredness of public Engagements\""--\""the Necessity of private Interest being subservient to public good,\"" \""the retrograde Motion of public Spirit\"" & \""the great Danger our Celebrated Republic is in,\"" I am at a loss to account, how so narrow and contracted an Idea, could have crept into your Mind--while declaiming with more than Roman patriotism, on the \""Amazing declension of public Virtue,\"" a spirit of Interestedness appears & you cherish a Sentiment which but the Moment before you had rejected as ignoble and derogatory of the   Principles on which a free republic shd be founded. You could have adduced no no stronger proof--of the Justness of the remarks your letter contains. Forgive this Freedom. I mean only to banter you--it is no More than what we are all actuated with; altho it meets our greatest disapprobation--'tis grafted in our Natures, nor can we divest ourselves of it. There is no proposition more true, than that Interest binds Nations as well as Individuals. 'tis the Secret Spring & Motive of all our Actions. I am glad you have been so kind as to visit Mrs. B. I hope to see her by the tenth of next Month; when we shall be made particularly happy in your Company, for a length of Days, should you be able to spare as much time from your Business. My Comps to Mr Scott. His reply was not unexpected; as he has before given me hints as to the rotundity of my Hand writing--avoid Neshaminy Politics. Detraction often reverberates with two fold force, to the fountain from whence it spread & is always a Mark of a weak & little Mind. Congress have not recinded the resolution, of building two Federal Towns--it is however so absurd and anti-republican a proposition, that I am confident it never will be carried into Effect. I cannot advise you, on the Subject of the Gratuity Lands in Virginia. Perhaps it wd be prudent as the Good Book recommends, to Count up the Cost, before you proceed to the Structure of the Building. The Idea of trying it by a FOEderal Court is altogether New, nor am I able to say how far the Consideration will warrant a proceedure of this Nature. You will as usual, inclose your letters to Archy--who will forward them to me, whether here or at Princeton. I must beg your pardon for this long letter but hope that in future you will claim no Ballance, in the Epistolary Line, against me. My Comps to all enquiring Friends. Yours with much regard, Jno Beatty. MS not found; reprinted from PMHB 44 (1920): 245-48. 1 See Beatty to Reading Beatty, April 2, 1784. 2 For this April 27-28 \""Act,\"" see JCC, 26:301-9, 311-14.

  Sir Annapolis 17th May 1784 I must beg leave thro Your Excelly to call the attention of Congress  MAY 17, 1784  & to request their Decission on two points which are stated as difficulties by the Comptroller & which have hitherto obstructed the closing finally of my Acct. in the late Department in which I acted. That the Act of Congress of the 21st May 1778 which recites \""That the Necessary Contingent Charges of Executing the Office of Comy. Genl. of Prisoners be allowed over & above the present pay\""(1) is not Explicit as to travelling charges, & it is therefore doubtfull in his Mind, whether these were intended to be provided for in that resolution. To this I have replied, 1st. That the Letters of Colo. Johnston, upon whose application this Act was forwarded, express by points to this source of Expences which the Nature of the office unavoidably led to & for which it was his wishes he should be indemnified. And 2dly. that if the resolution Means any thing at all it must be that of Travelling charges, as those are the only Contingencys, that does or can accrue in the Execution of the office. I persuade myself therefore, Congress had this in View, in passing that resolution, and really meant, that all Necessary reasonable travelling charges shd. be borne. 2d. That as my resignation (which was on the 31st March 1780) preceeded the Act of Congress of the 10th April 1780 \""for making good to the line of the army the Deficiency of their original pay, occasioned by the Depreciation of the proper Currency\""; this act will not apply to my Case & that he is doubtfull, whether any subsequent resolution will authorize him to allow me more than the Nominal pay in Continental Expenses. To this I have objected & answered--That this act of Congress being designed solely to operate in favr. of the line of the Army & to the Exclusion of the officers of the staff, can be no direction whatsoever in the present case; as not extending to any Officer in my situation--That being at the Head of a Department; I drew Monies, on public Accounts for which I was to render a satisfactory detail--That I have at no time drew any pay, nor applied any Monies to that use, & of consequence cannot on that case be liable to any Depreciation: And that reason & Justice requires, I shd. be settled within like Manner, with all other officers who have been Entrusted with public Monies, Viz. charged only with such sums, for which they cannot show reasonable & proper disbursements in the Execution of the duties of their several officers. Perhaps it may be improper to add, That I have Documents to show, I have rendered Vouchers & satisfactorily accounted for all the Monies I have drawn from the Treasury of the U.S. as well in specie as in Continental Currency, Except 10 March of the latter, as was Necessarily Expended in travelling charges and Subsistance while in the Army the whole Amount of which does but barely Exceed the pay I am intitled to receive, even in the Nominal Money. As I never can believe it was the Intent of Congress to fix my Salary in paper Currency, when the day I entered on the Duties of the Office it was five & when I retired from it Sixty for one; I confide fully in the Justice & Warden of that Honorable Body, over which Your Excelly   presides & have only further to request, they will decide on my claims previous to their adjournment.(2) With Sentiments of respect & Esteem I have the Honor to be, Your Excellys most obed.

  Sir Anapolis May 19th 1784 The Honorable Mr Osgood, who lately returned home will give your Excellency full information on public affairs in Congress to the time of his leaving it since which the Committee, consisting of a number [member] from each State have reported an Ordinance for put MAY 19, 1784  ting the Treasury into Commission: the same Committee have also made reports for calling in the old money, paying the expence of the Penobscot expedition, and also the contracts made by Colo Hatch in our State for ox-teams: none of these reports have been finally passed upon; and it is impossible to foresee what will be done upon them, but with respect to the most important of them, I have little more reason to hope that it may be accepted than this, that it was made by a large Committee. Nothing however, in the power of your Delegates, will be omitted, to accomplish the wishes of the General assembly on these subjects. The substance of the report relative to Colo. Hatch's contract for teams, is, that the Financier ascertain the sums due thereon,(1) and refer it to the State for payment, who are to charge the sums paid to the requisitions for the next year. But if this report is accepted, I am apprehensive, that the business will not be settled at so early a period, as the necessities of the Contractors require. As your Delegates expected in a few days to write more fully to the honble. assembly on these subjects, it is unnecessary for me to add any thing more at present. I expect that Congress will adjourn on the 3d of June; and I hope some Gentlemen will come forward from the State, to take a seat in the Committee of the States. Mr Gerry informs me that it is necessary for him, as it is also for me, to return home on the adjournment. I have enclosed some late Journals of Congress, which may not have reached you before from the Secretary. I am Sir with the greatest esteem, Your Excellency's most obt & huml Servant, George Partridge PS Mr Gerry is now gone on a Committee to view and report what spot on the banks of the Potomac is the most proper for building a fOEderal town upon;(2) but I expect him to return within two or three days.(3) ""

  Dear Sir, Annapolis May 19. 1784 The papers are found about which I wrote you in my last.(1) I wish there had been found at the same time a concillating temper and a disposition to do the business of the continent and promote the general interests of the U S. Unless a different spirit prevail from what has of late appeared there is reason to apprehend a dissolution of the Confederacy. The claim of Massachusetts on the state of N.York seems to have awakened a jealousy in the latter which may be attended with serious consequences. And there seems to be too little disposition in the other states to obviate or prevent them. Little causes often produce great effects. I know it is in itself a trivial matter in what place the states assemble, and Yet I cannot forbear thinking that the removal from Philada & the unsettled state of Congress has had an unhappy effect & given rise to measures which have sapped the foundation of mutual confidence. Business has been at a full stand for some days past. On Thursday last the comee on qualifications reported on the credentials of Rhodeisland & gave their Opinion that the time for which they were elected is expired. Next day the report was taken up & debated. And on Saturday the vote was taken when 4 S[tates] agreed to the report of the comee, 3 were divided & 2 in the negative. This took up two days. On Monday a question was started whether considering the circumstances of the case & the state of the votes the members from Rhodeisland had a right to a seat. They attended and claimed a right to sit & vote until 7 states agreed that their time was expired. This consumed another day and the question was left undecided. Yesterday the members attending and one of them rising to speak he was called to order & the question was moved & put. Is the Member in order to speak or vote in Congress? 7 states including the vote of R I were in the affirmative. But here again another question was moved Whether the vote of R I could be taken: And on this the remainder of the day was spent without coming to a decision.(2) The members of N C whose time expired on the 13 had withdrawn & were absent the two first days. But receiving new credentials on Saturday they took their seats on Monday (3) & took a share in the debates which were conducted with a good deal of warmth on both sides the question. The Del. for N C have recd. advice that a bill is preparing to grant the impost & additional quota called for by the Act of April 1783. It is said that the legislature are disposed to make a cession of Western claims. This seems favourable to the Union. I wish the states would send forward men of enlarged Minds & conciliating tempers, that matters might not be precip[it]ated & that time might be given  MAY 20, 1784  for consolidating & strengthening the Confederacy. That it may be lasting is the ardent wish of, Dear Sir, Your affectionate, Cha Thomson ""

  Dear Sir Annapolis May 20. 1784. I have recd. Mr. Hopkinson's letter enclosing from the office of finance a bill containing 506 dolrs. which I will negotiate agreeably to your desire, pay the Intendant the sum you owe him & transmit the balance. The committee, of which I am a member, appointed to view the country around Georgeton under the Princ'ton engag'ment sit out this morning upon that business.(1) I think with you that it will be proper to effect this business before the adjournment & no time may better be spar'd than the present. For four or 5 days past the qualification of the Delegates from R. I. hath been the only subject before us.(2) The motion respecting them was from Mr. Read. This brought forward the report of the committee [which] was agnst. them & conformable to the principle establishd in the case of Delaware. Upon the question shall the resolution stand? 4 States voted in the affirmative, 2 in the Negative & 3 were divided. Of course it was enter'd in the journals that it was lost. The question then was are they under this vote delegates? On the side of those in the negative the arguments  MAY 20, 1784  are--if 7 states were on the floor represented generally by but two members & the question was, shall a delegation retain its seat, or any particular member, the time of service having actually expir'd, the vote of one member only wod. keep him in Congress. 2. That the question is not, shall they be turn'd out? It is not an ordinary legislative act, but a judicial one & the confideration the law & to be applied to the case in question. It is a question of right, does it or not exist? If it does what number of States are necessary to confirm it. That in all judicial the decisions the majority of at least the siting members is necessary to establish any right. In most or indeed all a majority of the commission. That here it is more essentially necessary, that the majority of the U.S. in Congress assembled are competent only to the inferior duties of govt., that 9 States are necessary to the most important acts. That a scrupulous attention to the object & principles of the confederation wod. perhaps require that the number necessary to govern the States shod. concur in the opinion of the validity of their respective credentials, but that neither the policy of the confederation nor any principle of govt. will admit that the consent of less than 7 States shall be necessary. That in this case there is not only a minority of the U.S. in Congress assembled in their favor but a minority of those present. On the other side it was argued 1. that having their seats 7 States are necessary to turn them out; that the power of excluding delegations from their character & office shod. not be committed to a less number. That if the question was shall a delegation be admitted under indisputable credentials from his State, the number present being as before stated, & only one member voted against it, it wod. be negativ'd. That this wod. be a dangerous engine in the hands of party-men--that the resolution of the committee agnst. them was negativ'd & of course they remain members. I submit to you the reasons on both sides as they occur to me at present but perhaps I do not recollect the whole for being just ready to mount our horses, I have not time to be so particular as I cod. wish. Give me yr opinion upon this affr. I have negotiated the affr. of the bill, pd. the Intendant £7.10s. & inclose you the balance except three dollrs. wh. he gave me in money & wh.

  My dear Son Gerrit: Annapolis, May 21, 1784. I feel exceeding happy this day on receiving letters from all my dear children, expecially when I learn from them that you all enjoy the great blessing of health, and when I am happy to inform you that I have ever since I left you enjoyed good health, even in this Southern climate. Can you think that I lie down without the least disturbance of mind and sleep sweetly every night like a little child, when you are acquainted with the many anxieties in which I generally am involved, I am astonished at it myself at times. But I have endeavored to divest myself of all those cares that I may be the better enabled to devote my whole time to the public whose servant I am at present, and I wish to be faithful however incompetent for the important purposes for which I was sent here. MAY 21, 1784  I am happy to learn that you are so well reconciled to business. I hope this trial will have such an effect on you as to make you in love with industry and business. I have an higher opinion of industry and business now than ever before, occasioned by my stay in this place, this school of idleness and dissipation. Never did my eyes behold a set of people so totally devoted to pleasure, dress and extravagance of almost every kind as the Marylanders. The best part of this week they have spent in horseracing it is their annual week for that purpose, and also at plays which have been I believe acted every evening of this week, and I am told there is one this evening that may last till one o'clock in the morning which will bring them to Sunday. I have myself attended a Tragedy with some Gentlemen of Congress. On Wednesday last I took a walk after adjournment of Congress to the Common where they have their races, I saw one heat and then left the plain where there were some hundreds of idle spectators, 'round about and in Booths where liquors of all kinds were sold, fooling away precious time. I then bent my walk toward the banks of the great Chesepeake Bay (you must know before you arrive there that great work of Omnipotence opens to your view) when approaching thither a train of serious and solemn thoughts crowded into my mind, which is always the case when I view the great bay, the contemplation thereof affords me such pleasures as all the horseracing are incapable of, and I left affected that such numbers were killing time by wholesale, but as soon as I return from my lonely walk into this little City this school of idleness, the frailties of human nature are apt to vail these pleasing reflections. I must however say that the people are exceeding kind, and their morals in other respects are not worse if so bad as our Northern folks. In this little town is a play house pretty elegantly finished on the inside, and also a Ball house, both these buildings are of brick, but I find no Church, they have however a Minister who officiates at present in the State House which is elegant. My letter is long enough, I suppose I shall set out from this place in about a fortnight, some visits and business in Philadelphia will detain me there I suppose for a week, and in New York it may be that I shall be obliged to stay a fortnight, if I am not mistaken, this will bring me home near July, I trust all to my children, and above all I have committed all my cares and concerns to Him whose goodness has conducted me through the darkest scenes of my life. This I believe will be all the letters I shall write, and I suppose the last from this place before I leave it. I am my dear Son, Your ever affect and most loving father, Charles DeWitt.

  Dear Sir Annapolis 21st. May 1784. Enclosed you will receive a Cypher which Colo Monroe requested me to transmit you.(1) He together with Mr Lee & Mr Gerry sat out yesterday to Georgetown. We thought it expedient that the Committee should proceed in order to turn the view of the Continent to that place as the spot where Congress may perhaps ultimately fix.(2) Since your departure we have done nothing. Congress have been involved in a scene of Confusion greater than you can conceive. The Committee of Qualifications reported that the time of the Delegates of Rhode Island had expired. To this report five states assented, two dissented & three were divided. A question then arose whether as the report was not agreed to by seven states, those Gent. were deprived of their seats--Or whether when the right of a Member to sit was questioned it did not req[uire] seven states to establish that right. It has produced great diversity of sentiment, & more altercation than I have ever seen either in Congress or any other place--so that I begin seriously to apprehend we shall be forced to adjourn & confess to the World that the division of our Councils has prevented the adoption of those measures which the interest of the Union so loudly call'd for at our hands.

That Event is fixed for the 3rd June, perhaps we may put it off to the 15th. I presume the state does not expect nor wish that I should continue on the Committee during the Recess of Congress. I propose therefore to return to N Carolina soon after Congress shall adjourn. I fear that I shall be short of mony. I wish you could make it convenient  MAY 22, 1784  to lodge 3 or 400 Dlrs in the Hands of Miles Hillbourne of Philada. for my Use. Though it should not arrive before I set out, if I have occasion to borrow the mony I can give him conditional Orders to repay it. Should I fall into the Hands of those Jews, paying as both Mr Nash & Mr Hawkins did for some Time an Interest of 5 Per Cent Every month, the sooner I can pay the Debt the better. My Expences have lately been more than I had counted on. The Payment of the Note due by Smith would have established my Independence for the season, but of that Mony there is not the most distant Hope.(1) By a Vessel just arrived from England reports are recd. that after the Parliamt of England had been dissolved on the new Elections Mr Pitts Party were very successful and that Mr Fox was in danger of losing his Election for Westminster.

From Clermont,(1) where you undoubtedly enjoy more happiness than a Delegate in Congress. Our whole time has been spent in doing very little. We have destroyed this Week past in debates on the Rhode Island Delegation, which was reported by the Committee of Qualifications to be expired, but no more than Four States agreed in Opinion with the Committee.(2) This occasioned great Heats, insomuch that appearances indicated open Violence in the House, by a Young Virginian and one of the Rhode Island Gent.(3) Whether their Ardor will be cooled down by Monday is to me yet uncertain. The Committee on the Vermont affair have met this day for the second time, but cannot even conjecture what will be the result of their deliberation. I believe however a report of some sort will be made, but a final decision, I have no reason to expect, if I may be allowed to Judge from the completion of many Members of Congress. Could you think Dear Sir that amidst all the greatness in which I am involved, that I should forget my Friends; surely if you had recollected  MAY 22, 1784  that I had for some years past been \""surrounded with the Wise and Great\"" such a thought could not have arisen in your Mind, I love my Friends more than high places, the latter is become insipid to me, and more so, since I have had the High Honor of treading on the dirty floor of Congress. However I believe it is my duty to be content, and therefore it gives me no great pain that I am thus confined. I have written to you some days agoe, when I enclosed an extract of a letter of Mr. Franklin advising that Mr. Jay would sail for America in April last, which I trust you have received.

I hope there may be no occasion in future.  As it is acting the part of a friend to endeavour to please and as I suppose you would be gratified by a Short Detail of the Complexion of affairs in Congress, I will venture trespasing upon your patience by giving a Sketch. MAY 24, 1784  I Expected in Congress to find Justice Sit enthroned Supported by all the vertues, Judge then how great was my Disappointment when I found Cabaling, Selfishness and Injustice Reign almost perpetually and in place of that good order and Decency which ought to preside in all public bodies Especially in that august one, tumult and Disorder prevail Even to the Degree of Challenging in the house.  The Southern Nabob's behave as thoug they viewed themselves a Superior order of animals when Compared with those of the other end of the Confederacy. This Sir you know Dos not agree with the great Spiritt of the Northern Gentry and unless a new Disposition takes place Some important matters must either be left undone or they will be Il1 done. Scarce any business of importance has been Done in the house for about ten Days upon the account that the Right of the Delegates from Rhode Island to Set in the house was Called in Question and the house being Divided in opinion those who were for Expelling the Rhode Island members Declared that they would attend to no business while they Sat in the house. The Southern members were opposed to having the Loan Office Certificates inserted in the general Statement as any part of the national Debt Declaring that it was unjust for the Southern States to pay any part thereof and prevailed so far as to have that Debt Struck out of the general Statement but a few Days after the other Side of the house prevailed and had it inserted. Various motions have been made on the part of the Delegates of New York to get Congress to Declare the number of troops which our State may keep up for the purpose of garrisoning their frontier posts and the utmost Chicanery was used in the house to prevent Such motions being made and when it Could be no longer evaded the motion was Committed to the Committee for arrangements for the frontier posts and though we have Called upon that Committee to Report Cannot yet obtain it and it appears to me evident that Congress are unwilling that we should garrison Oswego and Niagara as I believe the Design is for Congress to garrison these two posts and that Massachusets intend to Cede a part of that Country to the united States Reserving the rest for them selves and I have Rieson to believe that it was with this view that a few Days ago Congress appeared almost Determined to order the Massachusets troops which are now at West Point to march in order to garrison these posts as soon as they should be evacuated by the British troops and the Chagrin was very visible when Congress were tould plainly that New York would not Suffer the Massachusets troops to march into that Country.(1)  A Spirited memorial is presented to Congress (agreable to our instructions) Respecting the New Hampshire grants.(2) It is Committed the Committe have been Called upon to Report but as yet have not   done it. It is a Question with me whether there is a Single State that would be for Deciding in favour of New York at the same time it is Doubtful whether nine States will be for Declaring Vermont a Seperate State. This may look like a paradox but it would exceed the bounds of a letter and perhaps of your patience for me to undertake fully to Explain it. According to the Present appearance the New Hampshire grants will one Day be acknowledged a Seperate State if so the sooner the better for New York, as they are Dayly increasing in numbers and Extending their encroachments and may in a few years get so strong as to Dictate their own boundaries. It appears to me that New York had better either Raise the power of the State and Crush them immediately or Else Consent that Congress Shall Declare them a Seperate State and take them into the federal union, but it is time to Close or I Shall trespas upon your Patience.

For several Years past the Society of Sciences at Haarlem have offered Rewards to the Inventor of the best machine for deepening Canals & improving the navigation of their Country, in which the Water is generally too shallow. As we suffer in North Carolina under the same Inconvenience I wrote some months ago for an Account of the best Improvement that had lately been communicated to the Society, of which I chance to be a Member. Two of the inclosed Papers relate to the Machine concerning which I had enquired, the other Two respect machines by the same Artist.(1) The Capstern to which one of them refers is by this time pretty well known. The inclined Wheel for draining low ground, by lifting up the Water, can hardly be needed in Pensylvania unless, probably, for watering flat meadows near the side of a River. The Machine for cleansing Canals, Rivers & Ports may in my Opinion be usefully employ'd in some of the Slips in Philada. and there may be many other Purposes to which it can be apply'd. The Inventors, the Messrs. Eckhardt are certainly possess'd of a very mechanical  MAY 24, 1784  Portrait of Hugh Willaimson MAY 25, 1784  Genius. They have lately set up a Manufacture in Paper Tapestry or Hangings from 2 @ 40 stivers Per Ell, upon an entire new Model. Whether the society might wish to see those Gentlemen in America, a Place to which they are said to have no aversion, It is very probable that the public would be profited by introducing both their Mills. Having no prospect of Patents in America doubtless they would consent to send Models.

Today we resume (I am inform'd) the consideration of the western posts. What will be the result is incertain. {New York} I hear will put restraint on every measure till she attains the object of her memorial or statement handed in before you left us.(4) Other {states} will be perhaps for doing nothing & some {persons} who cannot perhaps attain what they wish may attempt to mar the whole. We have now only 8 days before the adjournment so that the prospect of effecting these & other objects before us is unfavourable.

I understood the whole was for yo[ur]self & transmitted it to you in bank bills except 3 or 4 dolrs. for wh. I cd. not procure a bill. By yr. letter I am inclin'd to suspect I have been mistaken & that I shall have given the balance to Mr Hardy, but this or any other mistake you will please to rectify give me the necessary information & let me do it. I shall go instantly upon the business of yr. other commands, ford. if not yet gone yr. instructions &c. & will attempt giving you powers to negotiate with F[rance] if you have them not, but I suppos'd you had, for so I think it was reported & I do not recollect that it was negativ'd.(5) It is certainly necessary something shd. be done respecting the restraint on tobo. in France, to extricate it from the monopoly of the farmers Genl., contrary in my opinion to the spirit of the treaty. But I am not sufficiently inform'd on this subject to take it up & wish yr. advice. The cypher I find is imperfect. I have only us'd it for the present purpose. It appears to me only to want one to write by & in that case we may remedy the inconvenience in private. Otherwise I will make a new one and forwd. it by Mr. Lucerne or some other gentleman of distinction. I shall write you constantly as well before you quit the continent as after.

The several Corps of the Army being disbanded, and, of course, all the American Officers being upon one general footing. Congress could not consent to your request without giving cause of Complaint to many of them; and more particularly to those Officers of the line of Pennsylvania, whose Commissions as Majors and of an older date than your own; and without counteracting their determination to grant no more Commissions.  Some foreigners have been indulged with promotions after the Army was disbanded; but as they were returning to their Country, this indulgence could, at that time, have no effect against the rights of the American Officers; the Commissions under which they had served being of dates prior to yours. I am very happy in assuring you, that congress were perfectly satisfied with the very honorable testimonials which were produced of your merit and Services, and which from the best information they are convinced were well deserved; I beg you to believe, that no man has a more favorable opinion of those Services and more esteem for you, than, Your Friend & obed Servt, Thomas Mifflin  President of Congress  ""

  [May 29, 1784] (1)  The Committee consisting of Mr Read, Mr Sherman, Mr Ellery, Mr Hardy and Mr Partridge to whom was referred the representation of the Delegates from the State of New York respecting the New Hampshire Grants (2) made in pursuance of Express Instructions from the Legislature of the said State with sundry Affidavits and papers accompanying the Same  Report that they have carefully examined into the papers referred to them, and in order to make themselves fully acquainted with the Subject on which the representation is founded have also examined into the files and proceedings of Congress relative to the District called the New Hampshire Grants which they find has been depending before Congress in a Variety of Situation[s] from the 30th June 1777. Your Committee find that the United States in Congress assembled on the 7th day of August 1781 By an act Reciting that \""Whereas the States of New Hampshire and New York have submitted to Congress &ca (proceedings at large Mutatis Mutandis) (3)  Your Committee find that in pursuance of the said recited Act on the 8th day of the said Month of August 1781 a Committee was accordingly appointed who afterwards had a Conference with Jonas Fay, Ira Allen and Bezaleel Woodward Agents appointed by Authority of the people Inhabiting the said Territory called the New Hampshire Grants to repair to Congress & to propose & receive from them Terms of an Union with the United States.(4)  Your Committee find that the said Committee so as aforesaid appointed having made their report, Congress on the 20th day of August 1781 took the same into Consideration & thereupon Came to the following resolution--\""It being &c (5)  Whereby it is Contended a Virtual acknowledgement was made of the Independency of the district Commonly called the New Hampshire Grants now Claiming to be the State of Vermont. It further appears to your Committee that the representative body of the people residing in the said District did by their proceedings from the 16th to the 19 day of October 1781 reject the said resolution & preliminary propositions Contained in the Act of the 20th August 1781,(6) But that Afterwards, to wit on the 22nd day of February 1782, the said resolution of the 20th August 1781 being Unaltered & Unrepealed the Representative body aforesaid Entered into the following resolution, Vizt, \""That the West bank &ca--(7) By which last recited act it is insisted the people of the said District have fully Complied with the Stipulation made & required of them in the resolution of the 20th of August 1781 as preliminary to a recognition of their Sovereignty & Independence & Admission into the fed- MAY 29, 1784  eral Union of these States & that the Conditional promise & Engagement of Congress of such recognition & admission is thereby become absolute and think it their Indispensable duty to report to Congress. Your Committee find that Notwithstanding the last recited resolution of the Body Stiling itself the general assembly of the State of Vermont and the said recited resolution of the 20th of August 1781, The people inhabiting the said District have proceeded to grant and Individuals to possess themselves of Land far without the lines in the said Resolves & Resolutions Mentioned and also of Islands upon the lakes Clearly without such district. Your Committee are of Opinion that tis of the last Importance to the peace of the Union that Congress shoud immediately decide on the Question of the Independancy of the said district Claiming to be the State of Vermont. That if upon such decision the Sovereignty and Independance of the said district shoud be Acceeded to it will be proper to Appoint a Committee to prepare a Contract & plan of Admission & to Stipulate the Terms on which the same district shall be admitted into the federal Union in which plan shall be Introduced all the grounds & principles of the plan of Government lately to wit on 23rd April last prepared for the Western Territory (8) when the Same shall be purchased of Indian Inhabitants & laid out into Independant States in so far as the same can in any way apply to the said District as having already assumed a permanent form of Government. Your Committee are of Opinion that Congress will not relinquish the Guarantee Contained in the resolutions of the 7th of August 1781 and that it be immediately & Indispensably required of the Inhabitants of the said district to surcease from Trespassing beyond the bounds Contained in the said act of Congress of the 20th August 1781. Your Committee are further of Opinion that if on the decision of the question relative to the Sovereignty & Independence of the said District Claiming to be a separate state as aforesaid the U S in Congress Assembled shall decide against such Claim. That in such Case it will be proper for Congress immediately to proceed to appoint a federal Court pursuant to the Article of the Act of Confederation & perpetual Union to decide the right of Jurisdiction & Soil between the several States claiming the same and that Congress are bound as well by the said Articles of Confederation as by their Act of the 24th day of Sept 1779 (9) to Carry into execution & support such decision & determination in favour of Which lower of the parties the same may be to the end that permanent Concord & harmony may be established between them & all Cause of Uneasiness be removed. And Whereas it Manifestly appears to your Committee that repeated Outrages have been Committed by the people Inhabiting the said dis- MAY 31, 1784  trict who Claim to act as a sovereign & Independent State on those who profess allegiance to the state of New York, and that they have actually proceeded to raise Troops & to make War on & otherwise to harrass & distress the Inhabitants of Cumberland County in direct Contravention of the resolutions of the United States in Congress of 24th of September 1779, 2 June 1780 and of the 5th of Decr 1782,(10) Your Committee are of Opinion that a Copy of the several resolves last Mentioned be forwarded to Thos Chittenden Esqr of Bennington in the District aforesaid to be Communicated to the people and that they be required to desist from further outrages.

  Annapolis 31st May 1784  To the United States in Congress Assembled, The Memorial of Edward Hand late a Major General & formerly Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Foot in the Army of the United States very respectfully Sheweth. MAY 31, 1784  That in consequence of a resolution of Congress of the 12th June 1776 he recd. by his Agent, Mr. James Milligan, 9000 Dollars to purchase an Uniform for the regiment he then had the Honor to Command, as appears by Mr. Milligan's letter dated 9th August 1776. That, a quantity of Clothing purchased with that money was recd., and distributed to the regiment as appears by Mr. Milligan's letter of the 22d August 1776, and the regiml. Quarter-Masters Certificate Annexed  That, Ten Cases, and Ten Bundles, containing a large and general Assortment of valuable Articles of Clothing &ca. purchased with the same money, and intended for his said regiment, were about the latter end of October 1776 forwarded From Philadelphia to Fort Lee on the Hudson as appears by letters from Mr. Milligan, and his Clerk, Mr. James Heron's, dated October 29 & 31st 1776 and the General Invoice dated 30th of the same month. That those Ten Cases and ten Bundles unfortunately fell into the hands of the Enemy as appears by a letter from Mr. Heron dated 27th Decr. 1776, one from Mr. Milligan of 4th June 1777, and the Certificate of Clement Biddle Esqr. who was acting as Quarter Master General at the time the said Clothing was lost. Your Memorialist flatters himself, that the papers herein before referred to, shew clearly that he did every thing in his power to comply with the intention of the resolution of Congress of the 12 June 1776 in favour of his then Regiment--that in the Choice of an Agent to transact the business, he had in view the good of the Regimt. & that of the service in general (the different important offices which Mr. Milligan has since held, sufficiently evinceing the sense Congress entertain of his Integrity & Abilities). That the loss of the said clothing, arose from Accidents incident to War, which he could not foresee or guard against. He therefore humbly entreats that, Congress may be pleased to order the Comptroller of the Treasury to pass to the credit of his said late Regiment, the amount of the sums paid for the Clothing so lost, with the necessary expences incurred in purchasing & transporting the same, and your Memorialist will pray &ca.(1) Edwd.

  Dear Sir, Annapolis 31 May 1784. Your Letter respecting Mr. Greens accounts came duly to hand. The subject will be laid before Congress. I cannot undertake to predict their decision--but I pray you to inform Col. Flagg that altho I have obtained a report of a Committee that his accounts should be settled by Mr. Chinn, I have not been able to get that report agreed to in Congress.(1) It seems to be adopted as a rule that accounts are to be settled in the line of the department in which they were contracted. An Ordinance for putting the department of Finance into Commission passed in Congress the 28th Instant, a copy whereof is enclosed on paper No. 1. (2) Altho' this object has been steadily pursued by some for a considerable time, there is reason to believe that we should have finally failed of obtaining it, had it not occurred to others as the only remaining expedient of regaining the confidence of the States & obtaining the long expected funds. Should funds be obtained by this means--the board of treasury be abolished, & Congress revert to their former opinion that the funds should be under \""the controul of a single Will\"" what would you think of the manoeuvre?  On the 29th Instant Congress passed sundry resolutions defining & establishing the powers to be exercised by a Committee of the States--a copy of which is enclosed on paper No. 2. (3) I freely confess I consented to appoint a Committee only with a view to obtain a recess. If they do no good, their powers are too much restricted to admit of their doing much hurt. Mr. Ellery is chosen a member of this Committee for our State; in consequence whereof I have requested him to stay 'till the sense of the General Assembly could be communicated to him on the Subject--what he will determine finally is with himself. As Congress has made the concurrence of nine voices necessary in every act there is ample Security against the Committees sitting in Philadelphia--unless infatuated. I have enclosed on paper No. 3 the act of the Legislature of Pennsylvania granting to Congress the power of levying & collecting an Impost of 5 per Cent. on Imposts, &c.(4) This act is complete as to the impost; but very deficient on the supplementary funds--only containing in the 7th Section a general & vague promise to raise & levy on the persons & estates of the Inhabitants of the State their proportion thereof in such manner as the Legislature may direct--to the full amount of the assumption they were & are holden by the the 8th of the Articles of the Confederation. If they meant to comply, why did not they point out spe- MAY 31, 1784  cific adequate funds & appropriate them & make the collectors thereof amenable to & removable by the U. States in Congress alone? It must be clear to every person who reads their act that they neither have complied, nor intended to comply with this part, & which is the principal part of the System recommended. A correspondent in So. Carolina has lately enclosed to me the So. Carolina Gazette of April 22d containing the act of that State in pursuance of the recommendations of Congress of April 18, 1783.(5) I have thought proper to enclose this to you that it may be laid before the Assembly. If I remember rightly this makes the 8th Act on this Subject which has come to my hands & which I have transmitted to the State. Congress have received no information of the compliance of any of the other five, Viz., No. Carolina, Georgia, N. York, Connecticutt & Rhode Island. It is worthy of notice that only two or three States have passed acts respecting the supplementary funds, which came in lieu of the land-tax, capitation & excise originally proposed by Mr. Morris, & which he has always contended for, as necessary to accompany the impost & equalize the operation of his System on the various kinds of interest taxable in the U. States. Of this opinion Congress seems also to have been when they passed the recommendations of April 18, 1783. For they expressly say \""That none of the preceding resolutions shall take effect until all of them shall be acceded to by every State, after which unanimous accession, however they shall be considered as forming a mutual compact among all the States, &c.\""(6) I find that the supplementary funds are very unpopular this way. The Lords of extensive Soil are more ready to mortgage to Congress a twentieth part of what enters their ports than an hundredth part of what goes off from their plantations: But will the commercial States suffer the Impost to be carried into effect before the supplementary funds are granted? Can the U. States in Congress suffer it without a violation of their faith pledged in the above, in part recited, resolution?  The very unequal operation of such a partial arrangement must be obvious. You will observe that in the requisition of the last month, the foreign interest has preference (and with good reason too) to the domestic interest. Suppose then an impost only granted & appropriated in preference as it would & ought to be to the payment of foreign interest & to commence its operation. Let me instance in our State. Large Sum[s] of money would be drawn from us to the common treasury, whereby we should be exhausted of our resources at the same time that a ballance might be due to us on a just settlement--But this ballance is to come out of the supplementary funds, which the States to pay the ballance having refused to grant would in fact have an annual choice whether they will pay by making requisitions on themselves or not. The disposition discovered lately by some States in Congress to discriminate betwixt the foreign debt & the domestic debt--the striking out two years interest of the domestic debt from   the report of the grand Committee which reported the requisition for this year & other occurrences convince me that the States which are large public creditors are viewed by the others with a jealous & watchful eye & of the necessity of preventing any severance of the different kinds of debts in the provision for payment. The Commutation, the L. O. certificates & every other Species of domestic debts are viewed by different persons as objectionable; & it is perhaps unfortunate for us that all the particular States are not equally interested in the fair & honest payment of our domestic debt: Yet while it is blended with our foreign debt the assent of nine States in Congress is necessary annually to provide for the latter the former is secure--quite otherwise might it be if the revenues of an Impost in the hands of Congress was mortgaged to pay our foreign interest & the payment of our domestic interest depended on the annual assent of nine States in Congress to a requisition which would be afterwards to be complied with by thirteen States, from the greater part of which a large ballance would be to be drawn in favor of the others. On the whole it appears to me that the general interest & harmony, if not the very existence of the Union depends on our preserving the only constitutional mode of annual requisitions on the several States for all the supplies of the year, notwithstanding this has been called,(7) & infinite pains have been taken to make the people believe it to be, \""a futile measure.\"" I hope & trust that the time is near at hand when the sanguine pursuit of newfangled and (to use the moder[n] phrase) balloon Schemes of financiering will be abandoned; & doubt not but a chearful compliance with the requisitions of Congress & the reestablishment of public credit will be the happy consequence. I have the pleasure to inform you that notwithstanding every opposition from those who wish to fix the public attention only to the funds recommended on the 19 April 1783, the business of the western territory is in a good train. I entertain a full expectation that Congress will be able to open a land-office for the sale of one, or two States by next Christmas. There is also good news from No. Carolina. That State has made us a cession. No official account has yet come to hand, but a delegate of that State told me a few days ago that his friend had written him that the State had ceded to Congress a large tract, said to be near eight millions of acres. An official account is daily expected.(8) Georgia has not sent forward any delegates to Congress tho' it is reported that the Cincinnati of that State were represented at their late general meeting in Philada. There is no account of their even having in contemplation to cede any claims to Congress. It is said that they are very busy in Land jobbing, & that none of their principal men dare leave the State time enough to come to Congress for fear of being out manoeuvered--but will the Union suffer the small number of Inhabitants in that State to engross & divide among themselves that vast tract of most excellent Soil lying betwixt them & the Missisippi?   And will the commercial States also admit them to an equal participation in the revenue of an Impost?  I hope you will approve of the facilities introduced in payment of part of the requisition for this year. Hic labor, hoc opus. This was perseveringly opposed by the Superintendent of Finance--and finally acceded to by some only of his supporters, and that with great reluctance & after a most warm & doubtful contest. Time & experience will now decide who has been in the right. The charm of remitting all payment to Philada is now broken, & I hope that Vortex will no longer swallow down the Treasures of other States. The reports for abolishing the office of Continental receiver in the several States--for reducing the civil list--& for sending troops to defend our western lands have not yet been acted upon, as more than a week was thrown away in attempting to vacate the Seats of the delegates of R. Island. A continuation of the journals, which I intend to enclose will give you a view, as I expect, of the rise, progress & termination of the inquisitorial process against us. This affair so intimately concerns the State that I pray you to lay it before the Assembly for their consideration. If their honor has been touched in the person of their delegates I hope they will not forget their Sovereignty or be wanting in respect to themselves. If their delegates have committed the State, let them be censured. Since the determination of this affair we have had the pleasure of giving the vote of the State for the Ordinance for putting the office of Finance into commission, & of seeing that Ordinance carried by that vote. As this is probably the last official Letter I may write I must beg you to accept my thanks for the attention shewn to me in your correspondence & to assure the State that it will not be in the power of any future Scenes I may pass through in life to obliterate from my mind the grateful sense I entertain of the singular honor conferred on me by three successive elections to the important station I hold in their service. I am, &c. David Howell P.S. Next Thursday the 3d of June Congress will adjourn & leave the Committee sitting. I propose to go up the Bay to the head of Elks by water & then take the stage to Philada where I must stay two or three days to obtain settlement of some accounts. I propose also to stay a few days in the Jersies with my relations & to take passage from N. York for R. Island. As the time of setting my face northward approaches I feel an increasing anxiety to see my family & friends. Blessed be God I have as yet been favored with perfect health notwithstanding we have had some very hot days & the suns rays are daily approaching towards a perpendicular direction. I never enjoyed in any period of my life a better State of health than since I left home. I have not been sick a single day. I have not even had one bad cold, or any   indisposition to prevent me from attending Congress a single day. I was indeed absent two or three stormy days in the winter, when I was pretty certain there would not be an House. But never have been out of the House when any business of consequence has been under consideration during the whole time since I took my seat last July. Few members, I believe, can give a better account of themselves. The principal gentlemen of this place are removing to their Country Seats. The Horse races were attended here the week before last & are all over as are also the Ball, routs, hops, fandangos & plays. I assure you there has been a merry winter in this place, according, at least, to accounts, for I have seen but little of their diversions. I did not even look out at the Horse-races altho they were to be seen from the windows in the back-room of the Stadt-House--nor have I attended a single play altho the Theatre has been open twice a week the chief of the winter & the play-House adjoins the House where I lodge. I have attended several Balls & been honored with sufficient attention from the principal people in the place. Pray inform Mr. John Brown that as no treaty has yet been entred into with the Emperor of Morocco, or the Barbary powers Congress have issued nothing as yet in the nature of Mediterranean passes. The report on our motion for a pass for Captn. Sheldon has not been taken up--nor can any thing be obtained in time to be of use to him.(9) I pray you to apologise to the Assembly, or to the Clerk at least for the bad writing & inaccuracy of my Letters--they have been written generally in haste & never copied--that is a business I never was fond of.

  Dear Sir Annapolis June 1. 1784 I have been favor'd with yours of the 25 by the last post with its enclosures & will pay due attention to the contents.(1) Two points have been effected since my last, the puting the office of finance into com- JUNE 1, 1784  mission & establishment of the committee of the States & appointmt. of the members.(2) Each State nominated its own member & Congress confirmd the preference. The committee consists of Mr. Blanchard, Dana, Ellery, Sherman, DeWit, Dick, Hand, Chase, Hardy, Spaight & Read; for the States not represented on the floor any member who produces credentials may take his seat. The members also may relieve each other at pleasure. These resolutions were introduc'd by {Mercer}(3) & supported by {Read} by wh. the appointment, if this rule continues (longer than the present Congress or rather committee) is taken out of the hands of Congress & vested in the delegation of each State & of course given it to whomever the chance of a popular vote may place at the head of a delegation, for those who pay a delicate attention to the sense of the State must take that sense from such evidence as appears to them. The powers of the committee are {confined} so that no {injury} can be effected. {Sherman} & {Dana} will necessarily {govern} it. {Read} & {Spaight} will be together. {Hardy} will perhaps be of the same society & as the part they will {act} will perhaps be rather an intemperate one, {they} will have no {weight} themselves and throw the indifferent {states} into the other scale. I shall sit out a day or two after the adjournment for Virga. & propose if possible to effect the purchase of the land from Marks & if necessary will go to Albemarle. I intend also to put in execution the plan I had in view of visiting the western country if no difficulties arise upon my arrival in Virga. You will please direct yr. letters for me to Fredericksburg thro' whomever you think proper here. I shall hurry Mr. Short on if he comes by Annapolis but suspect he hath pass'd by Ba[l]timore before this. I shall write you by the next post after the adjournmt. of Congress & give you information of our ultimate proceedings. The western posts are still before us & will probably receive their final ar- rangmt. tomorrow.

  Sir, Annapolis June 4, 1784. I take this oppertunity to acquaint your Excellency that Congress adjourned last night at near eleven oClock in C--f--sion. Mr. Paine will some days hence be with you, Who will give every necessary information. I am appointed one of the Committee of the States, but I shall not stay many Days after Mr. Paines departure, expecting that Genl. McDougall or some other Delegate will take my place. I hope the Legislature have taken every precaution respecting the W. Territory. I believe Sir a Plan is formed and perhaps wrought into System to take that Country from us. Massachusets Delegates have put in a petition Yesterday From the Legislature of that state setting forth that New York is possessed of a part of their Land and requested a Court agreeably to the Confederation for a Decision &c &c.(1) I shall bring with me a Copy thereof, but my fears are not so great from this quarter than from a quarter which I do not know how to name, I shall postpone it to a future Day.(2) The whole world seems to look on that W. Country with a wishful eye and I fear they will go farther to obtain it than is consistant with the peace of the Union, I hope, however, that New York will collect all its wisdom and take such a decided and spirited step as may counteract every unlawful attempt on the State. I do not even trust Congress, I may be suspicious, but I believe it will be well to be on guard. I am, Sir, Your Excellency's Most Obdnt Sernt, Charles DeWitt.

  Dear Sir: Annapolis, June 4, 1784. On the appointment for Commissioner for the Treasury Board, a proposition was made to me by the Eastern Delegates to put you in nomination, to which I very readily acceeded, being sensible that this was the only way to succeed in the appointment of a New Yorker. Yesterday the ballots were taken, and yourself, Mr. Ellsworth of Connecticut and Mr. Temple (1) of Maryland were chosen. I hope it will be agreeable for you to serve in the Department, it is not expected that this board will proceed to any business until the Superintendent of finance has settled his accounts and made a formal resignation of his office which it is thought will take place this fall, I have no time to give you all the particulars, the salary of each Commissioner is $2500 pr annum. I shall bring with me every material thereto, which will soon be as Congress last night adjourned to meet at Trenton, N. J. on the 30th October next, and tho' I am appointed one of the Committee of the States yet I believe the Committee will adjourn for some time, which will give me an opportunity of drinking in the sweet Northern air before many days at home.

12724,dg021509,1784,to the Massachusetts Assembly,"""to the Massachusetts Assembly
  Gentlemen Annapolis 4th of June 1784 We have been honored by the Legislature, with their Instructions & Letters of the 28th of October, the 18th of February, 23d of March, & 27th of May last, officially transmitted by his Excellency the Governor, and upon the Receipt thereof, We have embraced the earliest Oppertunities of communicating them to Congress, & have used our unremitted Endeavors to obtain an early & favorable Decision: but the Issue in many Respects, is not equal to our Expectations. JUNE 4, 1784  The Instructions of the 28th of October, refer Us to the Remonstrance of the Legislature of the same Date, which was transmitted by the Governor to Congress, & by them committed on the 26th of January.(1) The Members of the Committee, after frequent Applications on our part to report, informed Congress on the 8th of April, that the Subject of the Remonstrance was so important, that it required the Consideration of a Grand Committee, which was accordingly appointed. Thus at the Moment We expected a Report, We were mortified to find, that a considerable Time had been lost in preparing this Business. The Remonstrance enquires first. Why 190,000 Dollars should be charged to the national Debt, when a Sum designed for the same purpose, still remains in France, unaccounted for? Congress having issued (see paper No 21) Orders to the Superintendant of Finance on this Subject,(2) & received his Answer with sundry Papers inclosed, Copies of them, so far as they relate to this Matter, are contained in the Papers No 1 to 7 inclusively. Secondly. Why 687,828 Dollars should be charged to the national Debt,(3) when the Requisition upon each State for the same purpose still continues? In Answer to this, We beg Leave to refer the Legislature to the paragraph mar[ked] A in Paper No 8, by which it will appear, that both the abovementioned Sums, are when furnished agreably to the late Requisition, to be deducted from the Estimate of the national Debt. Thirdly. Why the Pay of the Army should be carried to the national Debt, when the eight Million Dollars called for by Congress in 1782 exceeded the whole Expences of that Year? In answer to this, We have applied for a Statement of the Expenditures of all the Money received by the Financier upon that Requisition for the Information of the Legislature, as hereafter mentioned: and the Requisition of the present Year, marked No 9,(4) containing a new appropria[tion] of Part, & a Suspension of the Collection of the Residue of the 8 Million Dollars, will We presume be satisfactory on this Head. Fourthly. Whether the Estimate of the two Million Dollars for the Deficiency of the Year 1783, was made on the Supposition of the Wars continuing, & Whether there is any propriety in its being charged to the national Debt? This is fully answered by the paragraph B in the Requisition No 9: for We think there can be no propriety (after the proceedings of Congress in that Requisition) in calling for the other Moiety of the eight Million or for the two Million Dollars, without producing Estimates, which always ought to, & probably will preceed all future Requisitions. Fifthly. What Sum is comprized under the Term Contingencies in the Financiers Account received by the State? This will be answered agreably to the Resolution marked C in No 8.  The Reports of the Grand Committee on the Penobscot Expedition, & on the extant Bills of the old Emissions, are contained in the said Paper No 8.(5) The first marked E was passed nemine con, in the Committee; & the last marked F was passed by six States in the Committee, Massachusetts being one of the five that voted against it. Indeed We think the first paragraph of it, which is intended to annul the Resolution of Congress of March 1780, so far as it authorizes the States to charge the Money brot in to be sunk pursuant to that Resolve, at 40 for 1, to be highly inconsistent with good Faith & Justice, & to require the serious Attention of the Legislature. The Pressure of important Business previous to the Adjour[n]ment put it out of our Power to obtain a Decision of Congress on either of those Reports, or to obtain one from the Grand Committe on the Subject of Bounties--indeed they had this Matter long under their Consideration & appeared to be in Favour of the Proposition contained in No 10, but disinclined to No 11 & 12. Having thus stated the proceedings of Congress on the Remonstrance of the Legislature, We again recur to their Instructions of October 28th, which pointed to the Abolition of the Office of Superintendant of Finance. This was an Object very desirable, but difficult to attain. It is however happily accomplished so far, as that the SuperIntendant of Finance is to be superceded by a Board of Treasury on or before the 10th of November next, as will appear by the Ordnance No 13;(6) No 14 containing the Appointment of the Commissioners.(7) Another object of the honble Legislature in those Instructions, was to prevent the Expenditure of any Part of the publick Money for purposes different from those to w[hich] it was particularly appropriated. To enable the Legislature to ascertain whether the Appropriations have been punctually complyed with, We obtained the Resolution beforementioned marked C in No 8, & have applied to the Committee of the States for the Copies of the Statement & Expenditures therein mentioned,(8) to be transmitted to the Legislature as soon as the Super Intendant of Finance, shall render them, agreably to his Intentions signified to Congress. A third object of the Instructions, was to obtain the earliest Information from Time to Time, of the proceedings of Congress. To accomplish this, the Journals are constantly printed, & the Secretary informs us, they are regularly transmitted, so that We presume, no one thing has been transacted of a publick Nature in Congress, without an early Communication thereof to the Legislature. In Consequence of the Removals of Congress, the Journals of the last Year are only printed to some Time in September last & part of those Journals being printed in Philadelphia, & part of them here, both shall be forwarded when finished.  The Letter of the 18th of February respecting Ox Teams We think requires no other Answer than the Resolution of Congress marked D in No 15:(9) & We flatter ourselves that their proceedings in No 16 & 17 will accomplish the Ends proposed by the Legislature in their Instructions of the 18th of March, respecting Vouchers lost & Obstructions in settling the publick Accounts.(10) The Letter of the 27 of May, We received a few Hours before the adjournment of Congress on the 3d Instant, And pressed as they were with a Variety of Concerns, We prevailed on them to consider the Petition of the Legislature & to issue the Notification thereon, contained in No 18, the Receipt of which it will be necessary to acknowledge to the Secretary of Congress.(11) Having particularly noticed the Communications received from the Honble Legislature, We have further to inform them, that the Resolution in No 19 contains the Discharge of all the Troops retained in Service after the Conclusion of the War except 80 Men for guarding publick Stores.(12) We endeavored to obtain an Act for exonerating the States of New Hamshire & Massachusetts from the extra Expence incurred by those States in Consequence of the Detention of part of their Lines after the 3d of November last; but notwithstanding the Justice of the Demand was generally admitted, Congress could not be prevailed on to comply with it, unless We would consent to a peace Establishment. This was repeatedly & strenuously urged, but being principled against it, We in Conjunction with the other N England States gave it a vigorous Opposition for the following, amongst other Reasons. First. We conceived that the Confederation had not expressly given to Congress such powers, & therefore they could not exercise them, consistently with the 2d Article of the fOEderal Constitution. Secondly. We were clearly of opinion, that when the Confederation was ratified, the Legislature had no Intention to grant to Congress, the Power of raising a standing Army in Time of Peace: more especially as the same Construction which will enable Congress to raise a few Men for a short period may extend their Powers indefinitely, both as to the Number of Men & Term of Inlistment. Thirdly. We veiwed the Measure as being altogether unnecessary, because the United States being remote from Nations which have standing Armies, may by design[ating] the Militia, the constitutional, & only safe Defence of republican Governments, save the grievous Expence of a formidable peace Establishment, which would inevitably ensue, if once a precedent for exercising so dangerous a power by Congress should be admitted. Fourthly. We were fully persuaded, even If it was necessary that Congress, for guarding Posts & Magazines in Time of Peace should have a Power to raise a few Troops, they ought to be limited by an express Ar-  ticle of the Confederation. When all the proceedings on this Subject which will be soon printed & transmitted in the Journals are seen, We trust the honble Legislature will express their Sense, either directly to Congress, or by Instructions to their Delegates. We are happy to inform the Legislature that every Attempt for raising Troops by Requisitions has been thus far defeated, & that in Lieu thereof Congress have adopted the Measures contained in No 20.(13) We submit to the Legislature the Expediency of renewing their Applications to Congress, on the Penobscot Expedition, the Redemption of the extant Bills of the old Emissions, the equitable adjustment of the Bounties allowed for raising Men thro the War, & the Extra Expence incurred by the State in Consequence of the Detention of part of their Line after the Discharge of the Army in general in November; last. Mr Partridge, who has fully concurred with us in our proceedings stated in this Letter, would have signed it, had he not been prevented by leaving Annapolis this Morning, to return to Massachusetts. We have the Honor to be, Gentlemen, with perfect Respect, for the Honble Legislature & Yourselves your most humble serts.(14) E Gerry  Fra Dana ""

  Sir, Annapolis June 4th. 1784. Yesterday Evening the President of Congress in conformity to the act of the 26th of April pronounced Congress to be adjourned untill the 3rd of November next then to meet at Trentown. As we have ever doubted the Constitutional propriety of this Measure, and the right of Congress to invest their President with a power which the Confederation seems to have reserved to the body, we opposed it originally.(1) And when the period arrived at which the Act was to be carryed into execution we declined giving a Constitutional sanction to the removal. It was not thought expedient to change the vote of the 26, & for the seven States who originally voted for the President to adjourn Congress; again to adjourn themselves. The reason of this may be discovered by a reference to the Journals. The right of Rhode Island to sit & vote in Congress after the 7th of May had but two States in its favour, whilst five States were decided against it. We had not only objected to their Continuance under such Circumstances to sit in Congress, but had actually entered a protest on the Journals.(2) Without their vote an adjournment at this day to Trentown could not be procured. And the former vote empowering the President although made at a time when the Credentials of Rhode Island were indisputable we considered as illegal & void. On this subject we beg leave to add some further Observations. Early this Year it was considered by Congress as an indispensable duty to examine the rights of Members to Seats under their Credentials and the Confederation. Accordingly a Committee of Qualifications had been long since appointed, & in consequence of their report a Delegation from Dellaware were adjudged unauthorized to sit, and retired from Congress.(3) A question of a similar Nature arose on the Credentials of the Members from Rhode Island, and though two States only were in favour of their right, they persevered to continue in Congress & to act as Members. We were therefore reduced to the alternative either of impeding the public business at a Moment rendered critical from a variety of important Subjects which lay before Congress & the short interval which was to precede the time fixed for adjournment, or of continuing to act with Men whose seats we considered in some Measure usurped, and whose votes we thought it our duty to object to as vitious. Under this embarrasment the Measure which presented itself to us as most expedient was to enter our protest against  JUNE 5, 1784  Acts the validity of which, the states might hereafter be inclined to question being carryed by their votes. This was accordingly done in the name of the Delagations of Virginia & South Carolina.(4) Our Colleagues Mr Lee & Mr Monroe were at this time absent as will appear by the Yeas & Nays on page 228. In Consequence of the determination that began to appear among the Southern States to fix in Phila. the Committee proceeded to Georgetown & have examined the place. Thus an idea we thought buried for some time has again revived, we shall seize every favourable occasion to cherish it. Congress have determined to arrange anew their department of Finance & entrust the discharge of the powers which have been exercised by Mr Morriss to a board of Commissioners consisting of three persons. The opposition to the present Administration had become so serious as much to impede the public good, & as we apprehended the Change would be agreeable to the state we gave our assent to the Measure.(5) The Report for raising Troops for the Western frontier is lost, & we have been compelled to adopt the alternative of calling for Militia from the neighbouring states.(6) With every sentiment of respect, We have the honour to be, Your Excellency's Mo Obedt humble Servants, S. Hardy John F Mercer  ""

  Sir Annapolis June 6th. 1784. Since my last, Congress passd an Act directing the Commanding Officer to discharge the Troops now in Service, except 25 at Fort Pit &  JUNE 6, 1784  55 to Guard the Stores at West point and by a Subsequent Act recommended to the States of Connecticut, New-York, New Jersey & Pensylvania as most conveniently situated to furnish forth with from their Melitia 700 Men to serve for twelve Months unless sooner discharged, for taking possessn. of the Frontier Posts.(1) The Delegates of Massa. and New-Hampr. endeavourd to Obtain a Vote to Exonorate those States from the Extra bounties paid to those Men, and notwithstanding the Justice of the demand was Admitted, yet unless they would consent to a Peace Establishment and a Requisition on the States for men, they could not carry it.(2) I think however that the Charge should be insisted on. The Department of Finance is put into Commission and a board of Treasury Established. Money matters I apprehend should be Attended to. Great power being Lodg'd in the hands of one Man, may prove a Dangerous Engine and nothing but necessity will Justify the Measure. I hope it will meet the Approbation of your honble. Legislature. The Delegates of Massachusetts have lately prefer'd a Petition to Congress from the Legislature of that Common Wealth praying that a federal Court might be appointed to decide their Claim to Lands likewise Claimd by the State of New York.

12729,dg021514,1784,Hugh Williamson to James Duane,"""
 Hugh Williamson to James Duane Dear Sir Annapolis 8th June 1784  It is not to be supposed that a man who has assisted so long and to so much effect as yourself in the great Council of the Nation can be indifferent to the Progress of Business in your absence. From the Journals you will learn what is and what is not done--The Reason why, in many Cases you are to guess at. In one or two Instances I will try to cast some Light on the Question viz Why certain things were not done! The affairs of your State have been very interesting. Massachusets has I think fortunately, at length come out with her claim on your western Country. I say fortunately, because the sooner it is determined the sooner Peace will be restored and I have understood that you courted and did not shun nor fear such Enquiry. Had it been made years ago I believe Congress would have been saved from much perplexity during the last Weeks of our late session.(1) New York appeard jealous of the Massachusets Troops taking Possession of the frontier Posts viz Niagara & Oswego, lest they should hold them per force. And under these circumstances our Journals are sufficiently covered with yeas & nays. You know that some Troops have long been kept in service with the view of taking Possession of the Posts which the British held in the Jurisdiction of the U.S. New York has asked for Leave to raise Troops @ 500 men. You know that a Peace establishmt in the Eastern States is an unpleasing Business. We could not easily obtain a Vote for any Troops in Peace. In the mean while N York presses that we should say how many she is to keep. The Business of the union was not determined, how many are the US to keep? In this state of the Question the New York Delegates refuse to agree to the US raising a single man till we shall say how many is their state to raise. Others thinking that the Case of 13 was full as important as that of one refused to consider the Demand of N York till the other Question was determined. If the Eastern states really intended any thing unfair, they think worse of continental Troops than I do, For I cannot allow my self to believe that our Troops will ever make themselves the Tools of a State. The Result is--the U S are not to raise any continental Troops--New York has no Permission to raise any except That militia are to be raised of which Part are to be raised in N York. You may guess whether the Business was much forwarded by the assembly of N York telling us that they should raise Troops though the assent of Congress was refused.(2) The affair of Vermont has been pushed as usual. The Eastern states some of them are solicitors for those Insurgents. If Vermont must be independent, which I fear cannot be prevented I wish to see at least two southern states formed at the same Time.(3) I think the middle & southern states will ever be the supporters of  JUNE 9, 1784  FOEderal measures & I do not wish to see a Phalanx of 5 dead Votes against us on every interesting Question till we are enabled to preserve the Balance. The Time has been, I hope it will return when the southern States shall support or be supported by N York on Federal Questions. If you do not agree with us in your way of thinking perhaps we may follow you, for sudden & strange changes of this kind are often observed. There was a Time when a Delegate from N York would not have refused to make a Present to the Emperor of Morocco in order \""meanly to truckle & buy Peace\"" preferring constant war with those Pirates. Nor would he have shund commercial Treaties lest by commerce our republicanism should be injured, as we might become too rich. And I am rather of the Opinion that the Vermonteers have been viewed by former delegates in a different Light from that in which they are now viewed. The Journals of Congress are now printed up to the 26th May--& in 2 or 3 weeks I presume they will be printed up to the Recess. I presume they are regularly forwarded to the Gov & beg you would take the Trouble to look over the Transactions on the last 3 or 4 Weeks. Unless I am greatly mistaken you will discover from the Journals that some of us have had a very difficult Part, in attempting to shun injuring the Union or offending individuals.

  Gentlemen (No. 1.) Annapolis June 11th. 1784. In our joint Letter of the 5th inst.(1) sent by Mr. Magner your express, we forgot to mention that the bills which had been drawn by the Super Intendant of Finance upon Holland, for the payment of three months wages of the army when discharged, to the amount, if I mistake not, of Four Hundred Thousand Dollrs. and which had been protested for non-acceptance, will be paid when due. Mr. Adams in his letter of the 9th of last March writes thus to Congress. \""I have at last with a great deal of difficulty, and at a dear rate, obtained money to save Mr. Morris's bills which are payable this Month, from going back. Messrs. Willink and Compy. will transmit the Contract for the ratification of Congress. It is much to be lamented that we are obliged to agree to so high Terms; but there was absolutely no other alternative but this, or protesting the Bills.\""(2) The Contract has not come to hand, so that we are yet ignorant of the Terms upon which Mr. Adams has obtained the money. It is to be presumed however that the United States have saved some Money by this Contract which they wou'd have been obliged to pay if those bills, as was expected, had been protested for non-payment. When the Contract arrives I will forward a Copy of it, if I shou'd remain here. It will have a happy effect upon the interests of the Union, if the several Legislatures require their Delegates in Congress to keep them informed of what passes there not of a real secret nature, especially of all Money matters. An apprehension that their proceedings will be carefully reviewed by those bodies, will introduce into Congress more circumspection, more prudence, and OEconomy; and will serve to establish them in the full confidence of the whole Union. May I be permitted to suggest therefore whether it wou'd not be expedient that a Committee shou'd be appointed by the Legislature at the commencement of every Session, to examine the public letters of their Delegates, whether written to the Legislature or the Governour, and also the journals of Congress as they shall be transmitted, and to make report upon any matter which they shall find in either, requiring the attention of the Legislature. The Committee of the States met on the 4th inst. eleven States being represented therein: but as the Delegates from Rhode-Island, from Connecticut, from New-York, and from Pennsylvania, were determined to return home the next day, and nine States were requisite to  JUNE 11, 1784  any Act of the Committee of the States, except that of adjourning from day to day, they adjourned themselves to the 26th inst., then to meet at this place, after choosing their Chairman, and passing two or three Acts of little consequence. Being apprehensive that we shall not make up a Committee of the States at the time of adjournment, or near it, I propose to wait here eight or ten days after it; and if no Committee shou'd be made up then, to return home. Besides that this Climate is very injurious to my present state of health, it appears to me that my residence after that time, unless there shou'd be a certain prospect of soon making up a Committee of the States, wou'd subject the State to a very needless expence. Shou'd the time admit of it, I shou'd be happy to receive the directions of the Legislature on this point; to which I shall most certainly conform myself, unless my health shou'd prevent my doing it. Before I set off as proposed above, I shall endeavour to procure an adjournment of the Committee of the States by as many members as may then be present, to Trenton in the begining of Septr.; where they will be ready with the public Records, to meet Congress on the day they shall open their Session there. Such an adjournment must necessarily take place a considerable time previous to that event. I am, Gentlemen, with great Respect for the honorable Legislature and yourselves, Your most obedient & most humble Servant, Fra. Dana ""

But so great was their solicitude to rise that this with several other things of some Consequence are referr'd to their next Meeting.(1) I enclose you a Copy of the Report as agreed on by the Committee; which will give you an idea of what was intended & what would most probably have taken effect, had Congress proceeded to act on it.

 Samuel Hardy to Charles Thomson Dear sir, Annapolis 11th. June 1784. On the return of the President from Mount Vernon he appeared  JUNE 11, 1784  much distressed, that one of the letters directed to him in his Absence should have been opened. The Contents he observed were of a very private nature & wholly improper for any eye but his own. I informed him that on glancing over one Paragraph I discovered it was not of a public Nature & laid it aside And that I presumed you knew no more of the Contents than myself. But this Circumstance having once happened, it is probable may frequently occur during the Adjournment. It must be disagreeable to the President, & is equally so to myself. In order therefore to avoid it in future I should esteem it a favour if you could arrange the Affair in such a Manner with the Post Master general that letters directed to Thomas Miflin although as President should in the first instance be sent to him, who if he finds them to be of a public nature will transmit them to this place. But letters endorsed by any of the Officers of Government, or directed to the President of Congress only, being evidently public may be sent on as usual.

12735,dg021520,1784,James Monroe to Benjamin Harrison,"""
 James Monroe to Benjamin Harrison Sir, King George June 11, 1784. I receiv'd your Excellency's favor of the 28th ultimo before I left Annapolis, but the close application it was necessary for us to pay to the important affairs before Congress, for several days privious to the adjournment, so engag'd my time and attention as to constrain me to defer answering it untill my arrival here. Mr. Hardy and Mr. Mercer will necessarily transmit to you their proceedings, in the absence of Mr. Lee and myself upon the committee at Georgeton, respecting the right of the delegation of Rhode Island to retain their seats in Congress under their late credentials. It will therefore be unnecessary for me to add any thing to their communications upon that subject.(1) It being the desire of the gentlemen to the Eastward and particularly those of Massachusetts, that the committee should proceed under their instructions at Princeton, to view the country around the falls of the Potowmack, to report a suitable place for erecting a foederal town for the reception of Congress. As the continuance of that engagment might be advantageous to the State, if not in bringing the Congress alternately to that position, in turning to it the attention of the States rearing to the westward, we made it a point to perform all those duties which depended upon us. Our report was in favor of the heights near  JUNE 11, 1784  Georgeton on the Maryland shore, as they possess'd, in our opinion, in a greater degree, the advantages of an healthy situation, security from danger in time of war, and a better prospect of the water and country around. The report remains in the possession of Congress but hath not been acted on.(2) The Superintendant of finance having inform'd Congress that he sho'd close his accounts and resign his office in the course of the summer, and as these events would take place during the recess of Congress, it was thought proper to make such arrangments as might anticipate any inconvenience arising therefrom. Accordingly a board of treasury, consisting of three commissioners, was establish'd, with powers supersedeing the duties of that office and to commence when it should terminate. The gentlemen appointed to it are Mr. Jenefer of Maryland, Mr. Denning of N. York and Mr. Ellsworth of Connecticut.(3) The contest between the State of N. York and the people of Vermont hath been again referr'd to the consideration of Congress, and their decision thereon more particularly urg'd by the former.(4) She further requird permission to raise troops, as she stated, for the purpose of taking possession of the western posts within her bounds, necessary for the protection of her frontiers and encouragment of the fur-trade. These were points of great delicacy and importance, and upon which Congress could not well come to any decision. The claim of the people of Vermont to Independence was referr'd to a committee who reported in their favor, but Congress declin'd taking it up.(5) N. Hamshire and Massachusetts have claims upon that territory, which if decided in their favor, they will probably cede to the people. The cause of those people becomes therefore in that degree the cause of these States, and any measures taken by Congress which tend to discountenance their right, or to give support to the State of N. York, will proportionally affect the claims of these States, and in whatever direction these measures may operate, whether by force or otherwise, might perhaps rivet them more firmly in their interest, remove further from view all consideration of right, and more deeply embroil the affairs of the foederal government. The question of right appears to me to be the first point to be decided, and this must be either in N. York, N. Hamshire, Massachussetts or the people themselves. If in either of those States, the mode of ascertaining it, is pointed out by the confideration, but if in the people themselves, the States now involv'd in the contest are of course withdrawn from it. It remains then only a point to be determin'd whether they shall, or shall not, be admitted into membership in the foederal alliance. The part it hath appear'd to me politick for Congress to act, and upon this principle my conduct hath been form'd, hath been, to keep the foederal name and arm out of the contest, neither to countenance the claims of the people of Vermont, nor to give by indirect means aid to the State of N. York. I have acted thus in a confidence that by leaving   them to themselves, the right of Jurisdiction and soil wo'd ultimately be sought for of Congress, by the parties and determin'd in a constitutional manner, since an appeal would be more readily made to the body who evinc'd by their temperance and calm deliberation, that they were not a party in the contest; or that if this should not be the case, the present was not the proper crisis for Congress to interfere in. By this line of conduct I have thought we sho'd better conciliate contending parties, establish right, and preserve the dignity of the States. In this opinion I was confirm'd the day we adjourn'd by the application of the State of Massachusetts for a foederal court, to decide the point in contest between that State and the State of N. York. A report was accordingly immediately brought in, in favor of the petition, and the 2d Monday in Novr. appointed for the parties to meet by their lawful agents at Trenton.(6) The protection of the States, either on their eastern or western frontiers, was consider'd as a foederal duty and of course nothing was done to authorize the State of N. York to assume that business to itself. The taking possession of the western posts, for sometime before the adjournment, engag'd the attention of Congress, but a difficulty arose with respect to the force which sho'd be employ'd in it. The troops retain'd in service by the late commander in chief were of the New Hamshire and Massachussetts lines, rais'd during the war for higher pay than had been allow'd by Congress, wh. extra-pay had been defray'd by sd. States, but from the time that the others had been disbanded and so long as they sho'd be retain'd in service, they claim'd to be exonerated from the burden. The expedience of having them in readiness to enter the forts as soon as evacuated by the troops of his Britan'k Majesty, and of presenting in that country to the view of the Indians, a force sufficient to countenance the presence and facilitate the negotiations of the commissioners, for the tract of country they are instructed to purchase, urg'd in a pressing manner a decision upon that point. The term for which these troops were rais'd did not expire in part till next Jany. and the remainder till May, so that Congress upon their meeting at Trenton might take up the subject and provide for their relief. Under these circumstances it was made a condition on the one side, that if they were employ'd others sho'd be immediately raisd to supply their places, and if it be acceded to, it was requir'd on the other, that it be by recommendation and not requisition. Upon this difficulty Congress hung suspended for a considerable time, and the imployment of these troops had become, in the course of debate, so involv'd with the raising of others, that they co'd not be seperated, and as they co'd not be applied to this purpose, they were of course disbanded. This left us only one alternative, that of recommending it to the States of Connecticut, N. York, Jersey and Pensylva. to raise from their militia 700 men, to serve for the term of one year, to be employ'd upon this service, and  JUNE 13, 1784  upon this contingence do the taking possession of the western posts and the purchase of the right of soil from the Indians depend, for untill a respectable force is sent into that country, the commissioners inform us, it will be unnecessary to commence a treaty.(7) I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency that by a letter from Dr. Franklin, we are assur'd that altho the ratification of the definitive treaty, had not arrivd in time for exchange with the Brit'h Minister, agreably to the time specified in the treaty, yet we have no difficulty to apprehend from that circumstance. Upon his request to Mr. Hartley to apply to his court for authority to hold a convention to prolong the term he receiv'd for answer, that it was unnecessary, since it was the intention of both parties to ratify and the delay had proceeded from the severity of the winter alone on the part of these States.(8) We are also inform'd by Mr. Adams that the bills drawn by Mr. Morris upon Merchants at the Hague, the payment of which had been delay'd for some time and had given great uneasiness to Congress, were at length accepted.(9) As Mr. Hardy whom we left on the committee of the States will no doubt transmit to you a copy of the powers with which the committee are invested, as well as of the mode of their appointment I shall add nothing upon that subject. I have the honor to be with great respect and esteem yr. Excellency's most obt. and very humble servt. Jas. Monroe ""

The Petition of your people to be quieted in their possessions was referred to a committee,(2) who reported that they ought not to be disturbed in their possession until a decision of the Cause--and that the appointment of the Court should be postponed 'till the first Monday in November next, when Congress will sit at Trenton. This report was given in the last day of the session,(3) and there was not time to act upon it--but the Committee of the States can pass upon it if the parties desire it. I think it would give a better chance to both parties to put it off till Novr. and would give the Pensylvania Assembly one opportunity more to consider of Measures for quieting the controversy without a trial. But if a Court should be now appointed tis probable they would allow a reasonable time for the parties to prepare for trial.

  My dear Mr Adams Philadelphia 16th June 1784 Here I am after a six Month Session at Annapolis, on my Way to Massachusetts, & altho my Opposition to the same System in America, which You have opposed in Europe, has perhaps rendered me equally obnoxious here to the aristocratic Party, yet I assure You the Pleasure resulting from a Reflection on the Measures adopted by Congress, overballances every trifling Consideration of the Loss of Friendships, which being for the most part ostensible, are generally applied as Incentives to our Rewards of Servility, Baseness & Treachery, but rarely if ever of Fidelity, Honor or Patriotism. Your Colleague Mr Jefferson will deliver You the Arrangements of Congress for commercial Negotiations, & I flatter myself You will find in him an able, faithful, & impartial Minister. On You & him We place our Reliance, & if You can preserve the Confidence & Friendship of each other, I am sure your Services will merit the highest approbation of your Country. We have had great Difficulty in compleating this Business, & once had a negative put on the whole, but at length succeeded even to Unanimity: except in the point which I shall presently mention. I believe nothing but our Session at Annapolis could have accomplished these Measures, for the Anti American System was to have no more commercial Treaties; to amuse the commercial Interest by issuing Commissions & giving Instructions to our Ministers to form projects of such Treaties, to be reversed & altered by Congress, & then, to make such alterations as the other contracting Parties never could agree to; by which Means our Trade would have been confined to one or two Nations & have been generally in an unsettled, confused, & unprofitable state, but now  JUNE 16, 1784  our Ministers having not only Power to project, but to sign the Treaties, & to extend them to almost every Nation in Europe. I think our Commerce must soon flourish in an extraordinary Manner, & that We shall have every Market abroad bidding on each other for our produce & underselling each other to put off their own Commodities. Great Pains were taken to continue Mr F____n (1) in office by appointing him Secretary to the Commission; but this was opposed openly on this principle, that the D____r was not only a near relation to the other, but also his best Friend & patron, having written to Congress Letters expressing a Desire that he might even be appointed Minister for Sweden; that it was well known You & the Doctor were not on the most friendly Terms; that the Friendship between him & his nephew would naturally induce the latter to watch every Word & Movement of yours, to view them with a Jealous Eye, & to make such Representations or Misrepresentations as would increase the Uneasiness & have a Tendency to interrupt, if not to defeat the negotiations; & that no such Inconvenience could probably result from the Appointment of the other Gentlemen in Nomination. These Arguments finally prevailed & Colo Humphreys was elected. I think Your Friend the D____r, when he finds that You are at the Head of the Commission, that his G____d Son has not only no Prospect of promotion, but has been actually superseded, & that the Treaties which he himself began to negotiate are now in the Department of the three Commissioners, I say, I think he will have no Reason to Suppose that his Conduct is much approved. Indeed We have not been reserved in Congress with respect to the Doctor, having declared in so many Words, that so far advanced in Years & so tractable is he, as that it has become a matter of Indifference to Us, whether We employ him or the C____t de V____s to negotiate our Concerns at the C____t of V____s____.(2) We have left a Committee of the States at Annapolis, & Mr Dana is the Delegate from Massachusetts. I have desired him to send the Journals of the last Session when printed, which I suppose will be the Case, the beginning of the next Month. This Measure, & the Information You will receive from Mr Jefferson, renders it unnecessary to enter into a Detail of the publick proceedings of Congress. With Respect to the affairs in general of the U States, they are somewhat embarrassed, as it is reasonable to Suppose, after such a long & Expensive War in the Bowells of the Country; the public accounts, & the publick Debt are the greatest Objects of attention. It is necessary to liquidate the first in Order to do justice to the States as well as to Individuals, & Commissioners are appointed for each State to accomplish this purpose. Indeed they have been obstructed for some Time past, in Consequence of the Occurrence of Cases not provided for by any Resolutions of Congress, that the Matter has been taken up & such Measures have been adopted as I hope will answer the Purpose. JUNE 17, 1784  As to the Debt, the Arrangements of the Treasury Department under the Super Intendance of a single Person has been such an Object of Jealousy & Distrust, as to prevent the Success of Measures for funding the Debt; but after the 10th of Novr next the powers of the Financier are to be executed by a Board of Treasury consisting of Mr Jennifer formerly a Member of Congress from Maryland, Mr Elsworth of Connecticut & Mr Denning of N York: & I flatter myself that the States will take the necessary Steps for funding the Debt: but We have a great prospect of sinking a considerable part of it by the Western Territory, as soon as a Negotiation can take place with the Indians, (for which purpose Commissioners are now appointed) & the Land Office can be opened. A great Alteration must necessarily take Place from the establishment of Funds, in the Confidence of our Creditors both at Home & abroad; & whilst the payment of the Interest will be thus facilitated, & the Debt be constantly reducing by the Sale of Lands, the Burthen of Tax will I hope become still lighter every Day, by the Increase of our Fishery & Agriculture (which have been greatly diminished by the War) & also by the Increase of the Advantages of Commerce, When You shall [have] formed the Treaties--by these We have the prospect of obtaining so much more for our produce & giving so much less for Articles imported, that the Ballance of Trade, which being now against Us drains the Continent of Specie, will be then in Favour & render Money plenty, & the Collection of Taxes of Consequence more easy. You will find by the Journals that Upon the petition of Massachusetts a Day is assigned by Congress for the Institution of a fOEderal Court to determine the Claims of that State to the Territory claimed also by N York, within the Charter Boundaries of the State first mentioned. I can only add my warmest Wishes that You may have a happy Interview with Mrs Adams & such of your Family as may embark with her for Europe, & that with them You may enjoy Health & Happiness & return to Your Friends in America.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 18. 1784 On the 16 I had the pleasure of receiving your letter of 7 April (1) and am extremely obliged by the attention you have paid to my letter in favour of Mr. I. Norris. I am sensible on what slight grounds such recommendations are too often given and how much trouble they often occasion to men in public character. But I had a long and intimate acquaintance with his family, which held a very respectable rank in this state. And I thought I saw in this young man many amiable qualities which properly improved might render him, as his fortune is consid- JUNE 18, 1784  erable, a useful member of society. He had the misfortune to lose his father and uncle who was his guardian & who would have been a skilful guide to him, at an early age; and therefore has suffered in his education. I wished him to have spent a few years more in visiting his own country before he went abroad, but found his inclination too strong to be resisted. I most heartily wish and fondly hope that by your advice he may be enabled to make the choice of Hercules. Should a contrary disposition unfortunately prevail I wish you to use your influence to induce him to return home as speedily as possible. I have the pleasure to inform you that on the 7th of May Congress elected you Secretary for foreign affairs.(2) I do not know how you will be pleased with the appointment, but this I am sure of that your country stands in need of your abilities in that Office. I feel sensibly that it is not only time but highly necessary for us to think and act like a sovereign as well as a free people. And I wish this sentiment were more deeply impressed on the members of every state in the Union. The opportunities you will have of corresponding not only with the executives but with the several legislatures, in discharging the duties of your Office, will I trust greatly contribute to raise & promote this Spirit. And this is a reason why I wish you were here to enter on the business. On the same day that you were elected to the Office for foreign affairs, Congress appointed Mr Jefferson in addition to Mr J Adams and Mr Franklin for the purpose of negotiating commercial treaties with the powers of Europe. Mrs. T. joins in Compliments to Mrs. Jay. We most heartily wish you a prosperous voyage & happy return to your native country. With sincere respect and esteem, I am, Dear Sir, Yours affectionately, Cha Thomson ""

 Charles Thomson to Thomas Jefferson Dear Sir Philadelphia June 18. 1784. I flattered myself with the hopes of seeing you on my return to Philadelphia, but found you had set out for Boston with a view to embark at that place. I have therefore sent by a conveyance directly for France three Commissions for negotiating, if necessary, additional treaties of Commerce with France, the United Netherlands and Sweden, and a duplicate of the Instructions. The affair of Longchamps is still undecided.(1) When the matter was first brought before Congress, he had absconded and it was supposed  JUNE 18, 1784  had fled to some other state. Upon this Congress passed an Act recommending it to the several states to issue a proclamation and offer a reward of five hundred dollars for apprehending him so that he might be brought to justice. Before this could take effect he was apprehended and confined in prison but soon after admitted to bail. As his going at large gave offence he was delivered up by his bail & again confined. But having applied for a writ of habeas corpus he was brought before Justice Bryan and on his return found means to escape from the Officer who had him in custody. However he was again taken in a few days and is now confined and to take his trial on the 24 of this Month. As I purpose to attend the trial, I shall be able to give you a more particular account of the result. On the 3d of June Congress was adjourned agreeably to the act of 26 April to meet at Trenton on the 30th October. Previous to the adjournment they appointed a committee of the states and defined their powers. On the 4 June the Committee met and elected Mr Hardy chairman. I took the opportunity of mentioning to the comee. the necessity I was under to return to Philadelphia and expressed a wish that I might be indulged with leave to remain there unless something should occur to render my attendance on them necessary. This they readily and unanimously granted, which was the more satisfactory as they could not obtain the vote of nine states for their meeting at Philadelphia. They then adjourned to meet again at Annapolis on the 26 instant. I had some doubts of their being able to form a Committee, but as delegates from Georgia are come on and Delaware it is said will attend I fancy they will have a quorum on the 28 and have great hopes they will be so tired of their situation in Annapolis, that they will be induced to remove to the Northward. I wish Congress were settled. This mode of rambling is neither consistent with dignity nor convenience. But I find we must go the common round of nations before us and learn wisdom from our own experience. With great respect, I am, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble servt., Chas Thomson P.S. I take the liberty of enclosing a letter to Mr. Jay.(2) Should he have left France before this reaches you you will be so kind as to return it or forward it to him. I must beg leave to recommend to your friendly Notice and Attention Mr Isaac Norris, a near relation of Mrs. Thomson. As he is a young man of an amiable disposition & considerable fortune, I am anxious he should return as uncorrupted as he went, which I fear will not be the case with some of our young men. Mr Jay was so obliging as to take him under his protection. And I shall esteem it as a particular favour if you will by your advice and countenance direct his pursuits so that he may avoid the temptations that will be thrown in his way and become a useful member of Society.

  Sir Philadelphia 24th June 1784 We arrived in this place the 12 Inst. and found Congress had adjournd untill October, and the Committe of the States until the 26th Inst. Of course we are deprived of the Means of procuring Information from the fountain Head. We hear Congress recommend that each State keep up such a representation that there will be no possibility of a Vote being lost and that the recommendation has already been forwarded to each State. They Still expect the States will grant the Five per Ct. impost. Pennsylvania & Jersey have undertaken to pay of the Interest due on Loan Office Certificates that have been in the possession of their own Citizens at least twelve Months prior to the passing of the Act and no others, not attending to what office the Certificates were Issued from--Jersey to pay of the Interest Issued Thirty Thousand Pounds at the same time layd a Tax of Forty Thousand Pounds. The paper is received in Taxes but no Tender in Law. JUNE 24, 1784  We are of opinion from the different conversations we had with persons here and the observations we have made that it would be exceedingly politic in Georgia to pass an Act to prohibit the export of Live Oak from the State. The reasons are so obvious that we think it unnecessary to enlarge.

 Samuel Hardy to Benjamin Harrison Sir. Annapolis 24th. June [17]84. I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency that a letter from Doctr Franklin of the 31st of March last announces the Arrival of Colo Harmar with the ratification of the definitive treaty.(1) The exchange had not then taken place; but as the failure on our part arose from a concurrence of Circumstances not to be avoided; our Ministers seem to apprehend no difficulty from its not arriving within the time stipulated. The last dispatches give us no information of the commercial system which Great Britain will probably adopt. It is presumable that their Attention for some time past has been so engrosed by the elections which have taken place in Consequence of the dissolution of Parliment that most other business has slept. And after they are over as a considerable time must elapse before the Complexion of the new house is studied, & an Administration formed any opinion at present of the Measures they will pursue can be founded only on Conjecture. It is said that the elections have been much in favour of Government; if this is the case I think it probable that Lord Shelburn & Pitt will be at the head of the Administration & that we may expect some liberal regulations respecting their trade with Amerrica. But however desirable such an event may be, or however well founded the expectation; our situation would be unfortunate indeed if we relyed for it on the Caprice of a British Minister. My hope I confess is placed only in the Wisdom & firmness of our own Councils. And should European Commercial restrictions have had a tendency to produce something like a system of Counteraction on our part, & to raise a national spirit in our  JUNE 24, 1784  country I shall forever esteem them blessings. It begins to be time for us to act like a Sovereign as well as a free people & by a temperate & steady self respect, to command that of other Nations. Under this impression I contemplate with a satisfaction not to be expressed, the foundation which I think the Legislature have laid this session for strengthening the fOEderal Union & making us respectable abroad-- For to this & this only do I look for the preservation of that freedom which we have been fortunate enough to establish. I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency that Mr Adams has sent over the sketch of a treaty proposed by the King of Prussia to the Ministers of Amerrica.(2) And that Baron Hemmelin has arrived at Philadelphia from his Swedish Majesty with letters of Credence which he is at liberty to use, provided the United states send a Minister to that Court.(3) Nor can I close my communications without mentioning to your Excellency a subject which you may perhaps think worthy the Attention of the Legislature. You have I doubt not heard of the Assault which was made some time since on the person of Mr Marbois by a Frenchman of the name of Longchamps. A Complaint was made to Congress of the violation of the law of nations, & they immediately passed a resolution directing the Executives of the different states to issue their proclamations for apprehending the Offender.(4) He was taken & committed to the Goal of Phila, & before this time has had his trial though the result I have not yet heard. By a private letter which I have received, I have every reason to believe that the French & Dutch Ministers are much dissatisfyed that Congress did not recommend it to the states in the most pointed terms to pass laws correspondent with those in Europe for the security of foreign Ministers, & the protection of their persons, Houses & families from violence & insult. The Minister of France has before this taken his departure for Europe by the permission of his Sovereign--And Mr Vanberkel & Mr Marbois I am informed threaten to leave the state of Pensylvania unless the decision on Longchamps Case should give them full satisfaction. Should you think this Communication worthy the ear of the Legislature; and should they anticipate the recommendation of Congress & the wishes of a Court which I confess I look up to with great respect; I shall esteem myself fortunate in having made it. But should it not be the Case I view it as a Subject of some Moment, & under that impression it becomes my duty to transmit it to your Excellency. With every sentiment of respect, I have the honour to be, Your Excellencys Most Obedient serv, S Hardy  ""

  My worthy Friend, Annapolis June 28th, 1784 I write you at this time not because I have any thing important to communicate to you but that you may know I have not, and be persuaded that I have not forgotten you. The day of the adjournment of the Committee of the States having arrived,(1) we met accordingly, i.e. for New Hampshire, Mr. Blanchard  Massachusetts Dana  Pennsylvania Hand  Virginia Hardy  So. Carolina Read  but there not being a sufficient number to proceed to business the Committee adjourned to 11 o'clock this day, then present as above, & for Maryland Mr. Chase. The Committee then adjourned to 11 o'clock tomorrow, when, it is said Delaware, No. Carolina, Georgia will be represented. In which case we shall have a quorum for business. The first we shall take up will probably be the appointment of a federal court upon the claims of the citizens of Connecticut & of Pennsylvania. Mr. Wilson has already arrived upon that business. By the way, he informs me that Longchamps has been convicted of the notable infraction &c but no sentence had been passed when he left Philadelphia. It seems their judges, bar and all agreed in opinion, that the Laws of Nations applicable to the subject are to be considered as the Law of the Land. Of this I yet have my doubts. It seems also that upon this ground, the culprit has been demanded as a subject of H.M.C.M.(2) to be sent to France. It might be adviseable for our Legislatures to pass declaratory Laws touching the extent or adoption of the Law of Nations relative to the infractions of the immunities of Ambassadors and other Public Ministers, & other matters, agreeably to the recommendations of Congress of the 23rd of Nov. 1781.(3) Recommendations of this sort tho important in themselves, are too often laid aside by the Legislatures, till they are forgotten; and if they are brought up into remembrance, it is by the happenings of cases, for which remedies were intended by Congress and ought in their nature to have been provided previously. To prevent evils of this kind, as well as to procure certain benefits to the Union; I have presumed in my letter of the 11th inst. to the Gen. Assembly, to submit to their consideration \""Whether it would not be expedient that a Committee should be appointed by the Legislature at the commencement of every session, to examine the public letters of their Delegates whether written to the Legisla- JUNE 28, 1874  ture or the Gov. and also the Journals of Congress as they shall be transmitted, and to make a report upon any matter which they shall find in either, requiring the attention of the Legislature.\"" By such a measure the affairs of the Union would be regularly brot under the consideration of the Legislature, and in due season. They would acquire a habit of attending to them; and besides, congress would save themselves the trouble, and avoid the shameful necessity into which they are often driven, of reiterating their recommendations to the several legislatures. The journals of Congress are not yet printed up to the day of their adjournment. When they shall be, I will forward yours. Adieu my dear Sir, Yours &c, &c, Dana  P.S. Yours of the 22nd inst is just received and shall be duly noticed by the time your rambling is finished. You have done right. A few more of those Fops of foreign education will do us much harm, if we are not vigilant over them. The table conversation marks an unpardonable want of delicacy. ""

  Sir, Edenton 5th July 1784 On the third of June Congress adjourned leaving a Committee of the States to set during the recess. My Collegue was desirous of being on the Committee, and I had many reasons for wishing to visit the state. Enclosed are two sheets of the Journals which I believe by some accident had not been forwar[d]ed. The Journals on the third of June were printed up to the 26th May, by this time I presume they are finished. From them you will learn that Congress have left some things undone which I presume the bulk of Mankind will think ought to have been done. You will find that some of the Eastern States would not admit that Congress are authorised in time of Peace to raise any troops for any purpose whatever while some of us would not on any account suffer this power to be called in question.(1) You will also find in such haste were the eastern Members to adjourn, that they have taken no measures for making peace with the southern Indians, though a plan for negotiating with those Indians was reported & ready to be passed upon.(2) I have not seen the act for making a cession of Western Territory, but am told to my surprize that no provision is made for passing the Indian expeditions to the Credit of the State in its account with the united States. When the State reconsiders this subject and finds that no attention has been paid to the Southern Indians, and little done for securing the Western frontier, I presume they will at least suspend certain conditions on the Cession. They are certainly too wise to give the power of negotiating good terms out of their own hands. JULY 5, 1784  Several very extraordinary claims have lately been made by the eastern States. Massachusetts claims to be paid for the privateering Ponobscot expedition on which they lost 20 or 30 ships. Connecticut claims to be allowed for defending Greenwich, Grotton & New London. New Hampshire and Massachusets claim to be paid for extra bounties which they gave to troops enlisted towards the end of the War. Some of them received 100 dollars Pr annum above the usual pay. A grand Committee has reported on all these subjects, but Congress has not passed on the report, for several members, of which number I was, disliked the report throughout.(3) For myself I wished to consult with Gentlemen in the state, who are well acquainted with the condition of our accounts and extent of our claims. These being cases in which the nation is not already bound I think we may, and should consult the particular interest of our State. I would readily indulge those frugal & watchful States provided North Carolina can gain by such indulgence. By some future conveyance I shall state my particular objections to the report of the Committee, and hope to be favored with Your sentiments on the sundry Resolutions. As some Millions of Dollars are involved in the issue, it should not be passed over lightly. Are you not possessed of muster rolls or other materials from which we may discover what number of militia of this State have been in service at different periods from the beginning of the revolution. The length of their several tours of duty and the Command under which they served. If other States have raised more Continental troops, perhaps we shall fully balance the acct. by militia in Continental service. Are there any Letters from General Washington, General Gates, or any other Continental officer, calling for militia to defend the eastern part of this State, on the invasions of Philips & Arnold in 1781 by which the troops under the command of General Gregory at the Nor'west may be passed to Continental acct. As General Gates was at Hillsborough and the Executive Committee there in October 1780 when an account of the first invasion came to hand, I presume he may have proposed the turning out of the Militia in the Eastern quarter. Are there any orders or requisitions under which the state Regiment or the troops who served seperate from General Greene's army viz near Wilmington or Halifax may be charged to the United States. If we have a right to charge any or all of those tours of duty we shall not accept the credit as a matter of favour else we must consider whether we can negotiate for them to advantage. An extract from all the Letters from different Continental officers to the Executive of the State from the beginning of the revolution requiring troops of any kind would be of great use to the Delegates. Can such extracts be obtained? The plan for laying off & settling the Western territory you will find on the Journals.(4) It has not been agreed to in Congress; but is put on the Journals that the public may consider of it before the next meet-  ing. This being our sheet anchor is to be carefully managed. I think the plan proposed will prevent innumerable frauds, and enable us to save millions. The general object is to oblige the surveyors to account for the land by parallels of dotts & meridians. However as I happen to have suggested the plan to the Committee, it is more than probable that I may have parental prejudices in its favour. It has at least the merit of being original. I am informed that it is the desire of the State that three of the Delegates chosen shall attend together in Congress. Circumstanced as matters are, several interesting questions depending, to which I have already given some degree of attention, perhaps my services may be as acceptable, and as useful to the State on the next Winter as those of a member perfectly new though his abilities are otherwise greater. On this supposition, and with the utmost desire of discharging the full of my duty to the State, I propose to attend Congress from the first of November till the time when the delegation expires. It may happen that the Committee will be obliged to convene Congress before the time to which they stand adjourned. In such case I propose instantly to attend. I have the honor to be &c, Hugh Williamson (5) ""

  My Dear Sally,(1) Annapolis July 7th, 1784. I cant employ this Leisure hour in the Morning more Agreeably than by informing You of my safe Arrival in this place. Tho' I was four days on the Way, Yet my Journey was attended with as much Pleasure as I had Reason to Expect in so warm a Season. I din'd with Mr. Trenchard on that day we parted, and soon after pass'd over the River without waiting the return of the Boat from Wilmington. Tho' Penton had inform'd me that the Stage would not set out before the next Morning, Yet I found they had alter'd their time and left New Castle a few hours before my Arrival. Mr. Bedford politely offer'd  JULY 7, 1784  to take me to Wilmington in his Carriage to see Mr. Vining, who had said He intended to Accompany me to Annapolis. But hearing that Mr. Vining was at Dover, I spent the Evening Chatting with the Governor and some other Gentlemen of the Town, and next Morning left New Castle in a Chair with a Boy to bring it back, and Arriv'd at the Head of Elk about Eleven. A Passage from thence by Water would have been most Agreeable, But as there was not any Vessel going immediately to Annapolis, I was left to amuse myself the remaining part of the day with my own thoughts--which, I own, were a little serious on being three days out and not thirty Miles from home. But Early in the Evening I was reliev'd by the Arrival of three Gentlenmen from New York in the Stage with whom having spent the Evening agreeably, and next Morning set off. Arrivd safe at Baltimore that Night. I Expected to have seen my Brother next Morning, but was rous'd from my Bed by a Messenger who inform'd me the Stage Boat had set off, But that I might overtake it by walking to Fells point--this I did, and was fortunate enough to call the Boat back which had left the Wharf about an hundred Yards. The Wind being ahead we sail'd all the day and about Nine at Night got into Annapolis a distance of 30 Miles. Eight Gentlemen had Conven'd waiting my Arrival to make a Committee.(2) Tho' here but two days I have been Invited to three Dinners, have Eat four, and din'd with two hundred Gentlemen--On Monday with the Society of the Cincinati and the Governor of this State, and Yesterday with the Citizens of Annapolis at a pleasant Point over a Water, about three hundred Yards from the Town Under a Shade of Native Oaks, Walnuts, and Chestnuts we were regaled with a fish feast. I declin'd Going to the Governors Ball last Evening, these Amusements being too much for one day. There was the Ladies field for Exhibition, the Company at the two preceding Entertainments consisting wholly of Gentlemen. The Committee are Quarter'd in two houses Except Mr. Chace who lives in town. Mr. Dana (who has been our Ambassador in Spain and Russia) from Boston, Mr. Blanchard, (my former Housemate) from New Hampshire, General Hand from Pennsylvania and Myself (all in the Married Row) Lodge at Mrs. Brices--four other Gentlemen of the Com'ee being Batchelors dine together in their own Stile. We keep up a good Correspondence and were to have din'd with them Yesterday, But the Citizens Invitation to the whole Com'ee prevented. I have not Experienced any of the Effects of heat so much here as on those few warm days we had at Salem in the last of June. The High Situation of the Town and a Breeze from the Water once a Day, makes the Weather As Yet very Supportable. I have little to Communicate Except such trivial Matters as above, but as I know it will be Agreeable, will write frequently if only to repeat the Assurances of that Sincere Affection with which I am Yours, Saml.

 Francis Dana to the Massachusetts Assembly Gentlemen Annapolis July 15th. 1784. Contrary to my expectations expressed in my last, we obtained a representation of Nine States in the Committee of the States, on the fifth inst; but since that time no addition has been made to it. The States represented are New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The assent of all now present, being nece- JULY 15, 1784  ssary to pass any Act, except that of adjourning from day to day, it cannot be expected that business of much consequence can be transacted in the Committee. The Gentleman who represents New-Hampshire, will leave the Committee the beginning of next month, without waiting to be releaved, which will disenable us to proceed to business, unless some other State shoud be representd. And as my health will not permit me without great injury, to remain here longer, I propose to return with him. If it shou'd be thought proper to keep up our representation in the Committee, I wish another member might come on to supply my place. After so long an absence from my Country, nothing but a hope that I might be serviceable in the arrangement of our foreign affairs, induced me to accept the honourable Trust of a Delegate in Congress. These Acts of the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina were yesterday laid before the Committee, by the Delegate of that State, viz.(1) the Impost Act, and an Act for granting to the United States in Congress assembled, a tax of Six pence Currency on every hundred Acres of Land, one shilling & six pence upon every poll, & the same upon every hundred pounds value of Town Lotts with their improvements, for the purpose of discharging the sum of One hundred & Nine Thousand & Six Dollrs. being the proportion assigned that State of what is called the supplementary Revenue. \""An Act for authorising the United States in Congress assembled, to regulate the Trade of this State with foreign Nations.\"" \""An Act vesting certain powers therein mentioned in the United States in Congress assembled.\"" These two last Acts being short ones, I shall enclose copies of them. \""An Act to empower the Delegates of this State in Congress, to assent to a repeal of part of the Eighth Article of Confederation &c, and to subscribe and ratify the Alteration proposed in the recommendation of Congress of the 18th of April 1783 in place thereof, as part of the said Instrument of Union.\""  The Impost Act, the Supplementary Revenue Act, the Act for regulating Trade &c, and the Act agreeing to the proposed change in the Eighth Article of the Confederation, relative to the rule of ascertaining the proportions to be supplied by the States respectively to the common Treasury, do all of them conform exactly to the recommendations of Congress.

  Annapolis [ca. July 15, 1784.] (1) You will plainly perceive (My Dear old Friend of Six Months standing) before You have made much progress in reading this Scripture, that my Chief Design in Beginning, was that I might have an Opportunity of Concluding with that common (tho in this Case sincere) profession of that Esteem and Regard with which I am Your friend and humble Servant. P.S. Looking over a Letter from one of our ablest Ministers abroad I find that to his Communication containing five or six sheets he subjoins a postscript: is it not then equally proper and agreeable to Etiquette that I shoud annex one to mine. And now that I am fairly into the postscript and Consequently emancipated from the strict Rules of Letter writing, what consideration ought to prevent me from expending all my Ink and filling this blank sheet? Certain I am when You begin You cannot desist from reading, but will continue expecting some Material Communication. Read on and You should be gratified if there is any such thing in my Intellectual Repository--the first Manuscript Copy has it--in any Corner of my Intellectual Repository. But in what part of this postscript it will be inserted is as much unknown to me as to You, for who can say to his Ideas Go or Come or to his Pen Express this or that, with any Reasonable prospect of obedience?...and beg leave to remind You of the many Instances You have seen of Words striving for precedance in the Mouths of our ablest Speakers and labouring for Vent when You coud not determine their Right of Primogeniture unless You had after the Example of the  JULY 15, 1784  Femi[ni]ne Sage in the Case of (?) Esau Versus Jacob. Sainte Ecriture page (but I believe the book is not paged and I hope You have more Grace than to dispute the Authority on Account of so small a defect) tied a thread round one of them, and when you had done so were the Words worth all that Pains. Unless they had been deliverd with more propriety and Energy they might as well have staid in the Belly of the Speaker or in whatever other Part he keeps his Magazine of words and Ideas. Where this is the Learned are not agreed. But that Ideas are not generated and Cloathed in the same place you will readily agree when You recollect how many nervous and Manly Ideas You have seen advance in homely garb--resembling the rudy healthy progeny of the Laborious rustick whilst others trickd up in all the pomposity of altisonant words scarcely able to support themselves under their finery may be likend to the half begotten Children of the luxurious great, defective in Stamina; enervated, unmeaning, uninteresting--there are no more words to that Effect Just now ready--upon review of the above Reasons they prove the direct contrary position Vizt: that Ideas and words are quartered in the same place. For how probable is it that like Militia sleeping in a Barrack being called out on a sudden alarm Each Idea snatches the garb of words next to him and so comes to the parade a Great Idea in a mean suit and Vice Versa. Pray Sir how do you do after reading all that and if you dont like it how will you be able to support Yourself under the pressure of what I shall write on this subject Vizt on postscripts for that was what I began on and a Copious one it is. All writings which have appeared in this world naturally fall into these two grand Divisions of Ante and post--and the Quantum by which the latter exceeds the former is only determinable by--by the same Rule by which Divines determine that long agitated Question whether the Eternity past or that to come is the longest. We have one End of Each given--tho' this will not enable to determine by the rule of three there are who can determine an affair quickly if you give one end--I have not wrote any thing these two Minutes--my station at this Northwest Window of the Congress Room is not favourable to such a strict adherence to this Important Subject as it Merits.

That Young Lady with the Crimson [...] and that with the Green, [...] another blast and [...] the colour of her Garters walk this Windy Day on purpose to distract my attention.

It is not usual to Conclude a P.S. with Compliments far removed from the sweet Enjoyments of Domestic Life.

  My Worthy Friend Annapolis July 20th. 1784(1) If I mistake not, I have already answered your last favour of the 22d of last Month, from Philadelphia. I will however touch upon some parts which I do not recollect to have particularly noticed in my Answer. I agree you have attacked my position \""that out of politicks you are out of your element\"" with your wonted ingenuity, and shall be thoroughly satisfied if you keep out of them for a short time with a view of entering bona fide into the holy state of matrimony. There are many duties incumbent upon us in this life, perfectly consistent with each other; but unless you can settle it in your own mind, that a  JULY 20, 1784  proper attention to the woman of your choice, will not require of you a renunciation of your political career: I must urge it upon you to remain as you are. For without flattery, my friend, I know of no one in our State, whose experience and abilities have better fitted him to assist in the deliberation & guidance of our great national concerns. And it appears there never was a moment which called louder for the attention of such characters to them. This is the period when fatal precedents must be guarded against. Our federal Constitution is in its infancy, and there seems to be, in many places, a rage for mending or rather marring it. I do not here allude to any amendment proposed by Congress, such as changing the rule for apportioning the general Expence upon the several States, or even the vesting Congress with a power to regulate our Trade with foreign Countries, so far as is at present in view. You well enough know to what characters & opinions I do allude. To be short upon this point, I find, our State have again honoured us with their suffrages as their Delegates, and as my private affairs, after so long an absence, indispensably require my attention to prevent their running into absolute confusion, I shall feel myself fully justified in declining the choice for the next Congress; and I shall do it without any concern for our Interests, or those of the Union in general, if you give your attendance in Congress. Remember the important matters which have been affected of late, by your personal exertions and perseverance, and which, I verily believe, wou'd not otherwise have been obtained. I know your feelings must have been frequently very sensibly touched by that sort of barbarous opposition you have met with; but have you not almost constantly born it down, & carried your points? And what grateful sensations and reflections hath success brought along with it! I renew my charge to you then, persevere. I had no intention of giving any observations of my own upon the protest, but I wished some might be made upon it by others more able. We have made up a table of N.H., M., NJ & P____(2) and I believe it hath been productive of some good: but where some persons are totally disinclined to do business, and are fatigued at the very sight of it, whose assistance is besides indispensably necessary, for we have yet only Nine States on the floor, every thing must be at a stand. From such causes we have hitherto done very little business. Yet the burthen of this is so great, that some will insist upon adjourning every Saturday, for the benefit of their health, and because they have not been accustomed to do business on that day; and, I will add, nor on any other day. Vexed at the attempt, last Saturday, I called for the Yeas & nays upon the question; but it was carried against me.(3) The barreness of our Journal makes me ashamed. I will soon quit a place where public business can not be done, & retire home to do my private business. This I shall do the beginning of next month.  Although I can't entertain you with any of our doings, yet it may be acceptable to you to learn that N. Carolina has granted the Impost, the supplementary Revenues acceeded to the proposed alteration in the 8th article of the Confederation, directed the time of service of the Delegates to commence agreeably to that, vested Congress with a Power to regulate Trade with foreign Nations, and finally ceded all the Territory they claimed West of the Apalachian or Allegany Mountain lying between that their Northern and Southern boundary, and the Mississippi. All this, I think, is well done. South Carolina has granted the Impost, but not the Supplementary Revenue; nor the power to regulate Trade with foreign Nations, but only with the West Indies: this last is an act of some standing, & was intended as a retaliation for the Royal Proclamation. Virginia has granted the Impost, and vested Congress with a power to regulate Trade with foreign Nations, hath acceeded to the proposed alteration of the 8th article of the Confederation. All these Acts, excepting the Virginia Impost Act, have lately been laid before the Committee of the States, by their respective Delegates. We have just heard that Rhode Island has rejected the Impost Bill, by a very great Majority. I think this not to their honour. But what can be done with such a People? Must our whole system be overthrown by their ______? Fill up this blank according to their demerits. This day we have received a letter from Mr Marbois acquainting us, that upon the application of some of our Merchants, his Majesty had permitted their vessels on their way to the Indies, to stop at the Islands of France and of Bourbon to refresh &c.(4) Not a word yet of the famous Culprit,(5) except that he has been convicted. I propose in my way home, to visit the Dutch Minister; and shall be ready to return the visit of Mr. Charge d'Affaires if he shou'd think proper to make me one. I have already spoken of the adjournment of last Saturday. Monday, & this day, we adjourned for want of numbers. Georgia being absent at the call of the House, yesterday, and Virginia, & Georgia today. Thus have we lost three days through meer indolence or inattention. July 23d. 1784. Your letter of the 12th from Providence has just come to hand. I feel vexed & grieved at the doings of the Genl. Assembly of that State. I wish Gentlemen in public Life, wou'd learn to controle their resentments & to be guarded in public measures by a cool judgment. Let us not dispair yet however of carrying the present system into effect. It is too important to the Union to be suddenly abandonned. What can be substituted in its place? It must be tried on again, when some Mens passions shall have subsided. We have not yet had any addition to our representation. I shall quit the ground in company with Mr. Blanchard towards the begining of next month, and shall hope for the pleasure of seeing you chez nous as soon after my return as may suit your convenience. You will doubtless have occa-  sion to go to Boston, and you must take a little Circuit to Cambridge. In the mean time I am most sincerely Yours &c ""

 James Monroe to Thomas Jefferson Dear Sir King George. July. 20. 1784. By Mr. Short I have the pleasure to forward you a more complete cypher in which we will correspond in future.(1) He will find you I hope safely arriv'd in Paris & recover'd from the fatigues of your voyage, & situated with Miss Patsy agreeably to your wish. In my letters from Annapolis I inform'd you of the latter proceedings of Congress & as I address'd them to Boston hope you recd. them. Mr. Madison, whom I saw lately at Richmond, will give you the proceedings of the Assembly: three important objects have I find employ'd their attention, the enlarging the powers of Congress, regulation of the commerce of the State, & the recommendations of Congress under the treaty. Their resolutions in the first instance I enclos'd to you for Boston. In the 2d, they have establish'd a port on each river, to wh. they have restricted the vessels of foreign nations, in the reception & unlading of their cargoes. They have defer'd the commenc'mt. of the operation of this law to the expiration of two years in the expectation that the craft necessary for the river carriage will be prepar'd by that time, so that from the commenc'mt. it may effect no injury to the people. But this I think a visionary hope. Those who otherwise wd. turn their attention to this object will think it too incertain an event to calculate on, & the operation of the law will find not a single vessel prepar'd to supply the exigency it will require. From this circumstance I fear a repeal will be attempted; I hope however it will fail & that this is only a step to a more wise & mature system of policy. If so many ports are admitted will the objects of the State be attain'd, or on the contrary will they not serve as subsidiary to Baltimore & the other towns on the continent who aim at our trade? Will it not be an exertion to promote their interest by collecting the produce of the State to particular ports, & thereby throw it more particularly into the vortex of Baltimore, since the operation of each town will be confin'd to the river on wh. it is plac'd? It appears to me unwise to attempt erecting more than one great town at a time since they will fail altogether while the exertion is bey[on]d the means necessary to effect it. You will inform me under  JULY 20, 1784  the treaties which subsist what regulations we may make that will at least make the advantages arising from our intercourse with those nations reciprocal. If Spn., for instance, takes off her duties or makes them lighter on any produce of these States, than the other powers with whom we are or may be connected, they refusing us such priviledges, can we & is it consistent with the usage of nations to give her reciprocal advantages here, the treaties between us & each power being, as that with France, on the principle of the right of the \""most favd. nation.\"" I make the enquiry more for information of the usage of nations than from any difficulty abt. the usual import of the words. Hath there been any investigation at the instance of any nation, that you can find, of the extent of the sense of these words & of the obligations enter'd into under this form? Is our tobo. restrain'd in its sale in the first instance to the farmers genl. alone, & if this is the case is it not contrary to the spirit of the treaty? Shd. not our ministers be instructed to attempt its removal? You will be so kind as give me every information upon these subjects you think necessary, for perhaps my enquiries may not extend to every object upon wh. I shd. be inform'd. I beg of you also to turn my attention to those other great objects to which in yr. opinion it shd. be applied, for a variety of points may arise to you when you look back on our country, in wh. our policy may [no] doubt be much improv'd. The laws prohibiting the executions for recovry. of Brith. debts are still in force. An address or something of that nature is made to Congress upon that subject, desiring their sense of the propriety of keeping them in force until satisfaction is made for the removal of the negroes from N. York. Of this however Mr. Short will give you further information. The day after tomorrow I sit out upon the rout thro the western country. I have chang'd the direction & shall commence for the westward upon the No. river, by Albany &ca. I shall pass through the lakes, visit the posts, & come down to the Ohio & thence home. This rout will necessarily take me all the time during the recess of Congress, of course I shall not be able to attend the committee of the States agreeably to engagment made between my colleagues, & to accommodate wh. generally, a resolution pass'd authorizing such relief to each other. The first act of the committee was to adjourn to the 26 since wh. I believe they have not met. Mr. Short will inform you of the result of Colo. Harvie's negotiation for me with Marks for his land. My failure in this instance will not abate my desire to effect a settlement in that county, it will still form one of my capital objects & will put it in execution as soon as possible. I had hopes of recieving a copy of yr. answer to the queries of Mr. Marbois but suspect you fail'd in obtaining yr. desire in Phila.(2) Will you effect it in Paris upon terms agreeable to yr. wishes? I shall certainly be in Trenton on the 30th of October. In the trip I shall take I may perhaps acquire a better knowledge of the posts wh. we shd. occupy, the cause of the delay of the evacuation of the Brith. troops, the temper of the   Indians towd. us, as well as of the soil, waters & in genl. the natural view of the country. Captn. Denny whom we saw at Annapolis accompanies me. I am sensible of the fatigue I shall undergo but am resolv'd to sustain it. I am with my best wishes for yr. health yr. affectionate friend & servant, Jas. Monroe ""

The Delegate of South Carolina hath also laid before the Committee, an Act of that State, granting the Impost; and also \""An Act to authorise the United States in Congress assembled, to regulate Trade from the British West Indies.(2) This last Act has already been published in our News Papers. It was intended as a retaliation for the Royal Proclamation restricting, or rather cutting off our commerce with their West-India Islands. That State hath not yet passed any Act vesting Congress with the Power of regulating Trade generally with all foreign Nations; nor have they granted the Supplementary Revenue. Virginia long since granted the Impost, but they also have not granted the Supplementary Revenue. Their Delegate hath lately laid before the Committee, an Act vesting Congress with the general power of regulating Trade with all foreign Nations: a copy of which is enclosed. And \""An Act authorising the Delegates representing this State in Congress, to subscribe and ratify an Alteration of the eighth article of Confederation &c.\"" They have also passed the Resolutions of which you have copies enclosed.(3) I also enclose a copy of a letter from the ChargÄ d'Affaires of France to the Chairman of the Committee of the States, relating to the opening the ports of the Islands of France and of Bourbon,(4) to American Vessels passing to or from the Indies; to which I have subjoined a Translation of it.

The facts it states relative to the proceedings of Congress, and the State of New-York, I take to be true, and of course the expectation of Neutrality it expresses, to be founded in Justice. I trust however things will not proceed to the last extremity. The whole matter wou'd probably have been settled before this day, in a manner similar to that reported by a Committee of Congress (See printed Journals of this year page 296. &c) (6) if a Jealousy had not prevailed in some of the Southern States, that the admission of Vermont into the Confederacy, wou'd give an additional and an undue influence in the great Council of the Union, to the New-England States.

He has not recd. the intelligence officially, but it may be depended on. I have enclosed a copy of his Letter.(1) I formerly mentioned to you that the situation of our Indian affairs in the Northern & middle department were by no means agreeable.

None of the States have as yet ordered them to be raised, their assemblies are called to Deliberate on the Measure, if they should ever comply with the recommendation, I dont  JULY 23, 1784  think the troops can be raised, arranged &c before the Season for holding a treaty would elapse.

We have recd. Letters from Colo. Harmer & Lieut. Colonel Franks, giving us an acct. of their arrival, the former in France, the latter in England.

I recollect perfectly, it was an Object which the delegates of New York had much at heart, that, in the final adjustment of Accounts for the supplies or contributions of the states respectively towards the common expences in the course of the war, equitable allowances should be made in favour of those states which had suffered more than others by the calamities of war, and parts of which had been at different times in possession of the enemy. And therefore they  JULY 23, 1784  made several attempts to obtain a resolution that Congress would, in the application of the rule prescribed by the 8 Article of the Confederation as declared by the resolution of the 17 Feby. 1783, make such abatements in favour of such states as from a full consideration of circumstances should appear to them just and equitable for the time the said parts of such states had been in the possession of the enemy or for the peculiar calamities they might have suffered.(1) But they failed in all their attempts and motions to effect this, previous to the 18 April 1783. And this was the principal reason that induced Mr Hamilton to give his negative to the act which passed that day.(2) It seems however to me that on a subsequent day they obtained the recommendation you mention, but for want of the journal I cannot point out the time.(3) With great respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Most Obedt and Most humble Servt, Cha Thomson ""

  Sir, Philadelphia July 28. 1784 I had the honor to receive yesterday a letter from Doct Franklin, which announces the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty. Although the letter is private, yet the first paragraph being of a public nature and containing sentiments which ought to be deeply impressed on the mind of every citizen of the United States and more especially those who have any share in the administration of government I think it my duty to lay it before the Committee of the states. It is in the words following.(1) \""Passy. May 13. 1784. Yesterday evening Mr Hartley met with Mr Jay and myself when the ratifications of the definitive treaty were exchanged. I send a copy of the english ratification to the President. Thus the great and hazardous interprize we have been engaged in, is, God be praised, happily compleated: an event I hardly expected I should live to see. A few years of peace well improved will restore and encrease our strength. But our future safety will depend on our Union and our virtue. Britain will be long watching for advantages to recover what she has lost. If we do not convince the world that we are a nation to be depended on for fidelity in treaties; if we appear negligent in paying our debts and ungrateful to those who have served & befriended us, our reputation and all the strength it is capable of procuring will be lost and fresh attacks upon us will be encouraged and promoted by better prospects of success. Let us therefore beware of being lulled into a dangerous security and of being enervated & empoverished by luxury, of being weakened by internal contentions and divisions; of being shamefully extravagant in contracting private debts, while we are backward in discharging honourably those of the public, of neglect in Militia exercises and discipline and in providing stores of arms and munition of war to be ready on occasion. For all these are circumstances that give confidence to enemies and diffidence to friends. And the expences required to prevent a war are much lighter than those that will, if not prevented, be absolutely necessary to maintain it.\"" JULY 28, 1784  There is another paragraph that respects himself which I also beg leave to lay before the honble Committee as follows, though it is in part answered by the late Instructions. \""I am long kept in suspence without being able to learn the purpose of Congress respecting my request of recal and that of some employment for my secretary W. Temple Franklin. If I am kept here another winter and as much weakened by it as by the last I may as well resolve to spend the remainder of my days here; for I shall hardly be able to bear the fatigue of the voyage in returning. But I can make no preparations either for going conveniently or staying comfortably here, nor take any steps towards making some other provision for my grandson till I know what I am to expect.\""  Though I have no letters from Mr Jay yet I am well informed that he arrived safe at New York with his family last Saturday in the Cowpar from London.(2) I have written to him to give him information of his Appointment to the Office for foreign Affairs.

  Sir Annapolis July 30th 1784. I have received your letter of the 17th June acquainting me of my re-election by the Genl. Court to serve as a Delegate from the Commonwealth, in the United States in Congress assembled, for one Year from the first Monday in Novr. next, on the 16th inst. Tho' fully sensible of the honour they have again done me, yet it is probable I may find myself under the necessity of declining that office, having been so long seperated from my private affairs. On my return home I shall be better able to judge in this matter. Your's of the 2d inst. reached me on the 16th also. By this I learn that the Genl. Assembly have been pleased to elect me together with  JULY 30, 1784  Messrs. Sullivan & Lowell Comrs. to support the claim of our Commonwealth to Lands lying west of Hudson's River, against the claim of New York.(1) As I am a stranger to this business, & shall have no time to make myself Master of it by the time fixed for its decission, I must absolutely decline accepting a Trust upon the execution of which so great an Interest of our State is depending. You will be pleased to signify this to the honorable the Genl. Assembly: or if they are not sitting to the Governour & Council. It may not be amiss to inform the other Commissioners of it also. Your letter of the 12th inst. came to hand by this day's Post, enclosing Resolutions of the Genl. Assembly approving the Conduct of their Delegates in Congress, in opposing a Military Peace-Establishment. The approbation of that honorable Body, of our conduct in a matter new, and of so high importance to the welfare & liberties of our Country, as that was deemed by their Delegates, cannot but be exceedingly gratifying to them. The particulars of this business will be better learned from the printed copies of the Journals of Congress, (which have been sent on) and the principles upon which we acted may be seen in the motion we made relative to it, and which is inserted in page 235.(2) I have the pleasure to inform you, & beg you to communicate it immediately to the Govr. and Council, that the Committee of the States have this day received his British Majesty's Ratification of the Definitive Treaty of Peace between the United States of America, and himself, bearing date the 9th of last April; and which was exchanged for that of the United States on the 12th of May following at Passy. Thus the last hand is put to that great and glorious Work. The Ratification will be soon published by order of the Committee of the States.(3) I have the honour to be Sir, with much Esteem, Your most obedient humble Servant, Fra Dana P.S. As the post does not allow me to take a Copy of this letter, I wish you wou'd make out one before it goes out of your hands & deliver it to me on my return home.

  Sir, Annapolis August 3d. 1784  The inclosed Copy of a Letter which I transmit you by order of the United States in Committee of the States Assembled will shew pretty clearly the state of Indian Affairs in the Western frontier of the United States and point the exertions of your Excellency and the Legislature to such measures as may be proper and necessary on the part of Virginia to arrest the danger to the community apprehended by General Muhlenberg the Writer.(1) Congress previous to their adjournment appointed Commissioners, gave the necessary instructions and made other arrangements requi- AUGUST 3, 1784  site on their part for forming a general Treaty of peace with the Indians as far Southward as the Cherokees. But if persons under grants from Virginia are permitted to enter upon and settle the Lands westward of the Ohio before the Treaty is compleat and a line of property ascertained between the Indians Villages and hunting grounds and the United States, it seems impossible to avoid an immediate War with those people. The paragraph of General Muhlenberg's Letter respecting \""The Gentlemen who received the Illinois Grant of 150,000 Acres &c.\"" appears to point to the Land reserved by the State of Virginia out of the Territory Ceded to the United States as a gratuity for General George Rogers Clarke his Officers and Men. It never was the Idea of Congress that such grant should be located on possession of the Land taken till the general arrangements necessary for concluding a peace and fixing a boundary between the United States and the Indian Nations should have been carried into effect and the public tranquility established. Should an Indian War be brought on in consequence of the steps taken by the Grantees of the Land just mentioned, the Cession of Virginia now relied on as a principal fund for redeeming the public securities of the United States, would prove an expence and disadvantage to the Union rather than a source from which any pecuniary assistance could be drawn. The Committee of the States therefore rely that effectual steps will be immediately taken by the State of Virginia to prevent any settlements being made on Lands not clearly within the former line of property between the State of Virginia and the Indians--and to suppress any such as may have been made until the measures now carrying into effect for obtaining a general Treaty can have their full operation--also that every possible means be used to prevent a rupture with the Indians bordering on the State of Virginia.

We Wish that the Comtee. had consented to a constitutional Adjournment but as they would not, to tarry here for no purpose thro' the hot & unwholesom season we can't think of it and we are perswaded that our States do not desire it.

Nothing new with respect to Wyoming, & for fear that Govr. Chittendens letter shd. do hurt, Mr. Dana thinks to omit it, for it seems to look as if War was held up.(4) ""

  Sir Annapolis 13th August 1784. When I seriously reflect on the critical Situation we are in with respect to our Indian neighbours, and the many Evils that may arise, if the treaty with them already too long delayed should in its commencement, be Embarrassed by obsticles which the Commissioners may not of themselves be able to remove, & consider the little prospect there is of their receiving the least additional support or assistance, I cant help being somewhat alarmed. Congress aware that inconveniencies of this nature might arise, invested the Committee of the States, with power to obviate them. The Commissioners at the moment they are about to proceed on a business of so much importance to the United States in General, & the State of Pennsylvania in particular, find their powers inadequate to the task, point out the difficulties which now present themselves, and request the interposition of the Committee of the States to remove them--but unfortunately (in my opinion) their application is not deemed a matter of serious concern.(1) ""

  My Dear Sir, Annapolis 13th August 1784  I wrote you by last Friday's post (1) and expected before this day to have been on my Journey to Philadelphia, but had no other impediment intervened the reduced State of my Cavalry wou'd have prevented. I had not heard from my Colleague (2) and was exceedingly loth to break up the Committee by withdrawing myself. The New Englanders had given Notice that they wou'd certainly leave the Committee about the middle of the present month and as I was aware they intended if possible to charge the Dissolution of the Committee to the Southern States, I made a Virtue of Necessity and determined to prevent this Effort of their Malignity and to out-stay them. I in fact have done so. AUGUST 13, 1784  Mr. Bankson will have to ask your advice on a new & Extraordinary Case and I take the Liberty of stating it in the present Letter and the grounds of the Opinion I in Concurrence with Ten others gave him. The Committee did no business all the last Week owing to the necessary absence of Mr. Chase & the non Attendance of Mr McHenry who had previous & sufficient notice but did not appear.(3) Monday Mr Chase returned & we had a Committee. You will observe by the Copies of the Journal which I suppose is regularly sent you that the Eastern Delegates had made Two long Special Motions for an Adjournment on which the Yeas & Nays were taken.(4) Myself & Spaight Concurred on those questions as thinking it most Reputable to the Committee & beneficial for the Union to adjourn on plausible Grounds rather than to suffer the dissolution of the Committee in any other way. The Gentlemen opposing the adjournment thought it necessary to bring their reasons on the Journal and accordingly on Monday Genl Hand made a Motion which was seconded by Mr Spaight.(5) After it was read from the Chair & the Yeas & Nays required by Mr Hand, Mr Dana threw out the threat of leaving the room as a means whereby he wou'd defeat the Motion. A short debate ensued but what Dana's Idea of dignity prevented his doing did not find any difficulty in the Mind of his man Friday.(6) He accordingly left the room abruptly--being sent for he declined coming, & on Tuesday Answered the Messenger that he was Engaged. On Wednesday neither himself nor Dana attended. On Wednesday Evening half after 6 OClk I saw them set Sail for the head of the Bay. Mr Dick went silently off with the other Two. Thus we are rendered Useless & impotent. The Question for your decision is, how is the Entry to be made?  We contend the Entry ought to be made according to the Truth of the Fact. Dana was opposed to this in which Dick Joined him. But the other Six were fully of opinion that the Motion being before the House & the Yeas & Nays required Coud not be gotten over or kept off the Journal but by an Adjournment & that the Contemptuous Conduct of Mr Blanchard shou'd appear as the reason the Yeas & Nays were not taken But that the Motion must stand on the Journal--You must decide.(7) I had some thought of advertizing the fugitives. What think you of the Inclosed advertizement? In the Course of the Week ensuing I shall certainly see you. Farewell & believe me to be with the the greatest sincerity Sir, Your Most Obliged & Most Obedient Humble Servant, Jacob Read P.S. I believe we shall write a Circular Letter to the States not represented informing them of the situation of the Committee & Calling   on them to send forward a Member to meet those now attending at Philadelphia to which place we shall advise the papers to be immediately Carried.

  Sir, Annapolis 13th August 1784 This days post brought me your favour of the 11th,(1) which I have the pleasure of Answering from Annapolis--having been prevented leaving Maryland by a Variety of occurrencies in the last Week. I think however I shall at all events get away in the Course of the Next Week & probably so early as to Compleat my Journey to Philadelphia. I thank you for your Opinions, they Concur perfectly with my own sentiments on those subjects and I am sorry to add there is too much truth in your Observation on the Management of our Affairs. Let the Blame fall where it ought, on those Whose attachment to state Views, state Interests & state prejudices is so great as to render them eternally opposed to every Measure that Can be divised for the public good. The evil is not however as yet intirely incurable. I hope & trust the next Congress will be more Wise & be able to avert the Mischiefs that appear to Me to threaten the Union. If that Cannot be done We must look about & see if some More Efficient form of Government Cannot be divised. I have long entertained my doubts of the Present form even if the States were all disposed to be honest, & am sorry to say such a Conclusion wou'd however be against premises. I will determine nothing rashly, & hope for the best. My most strenuous endeavours shall not be wanting to secure the peace & Stability of the federal Union & the Government as long as it is possible but I own I shall not hesitate to join in Attempting another When I see from experience that we have instituted is not adequate to the purposes for which it was ordained. Congress either Has too little, or too much power. To be respected they must be enabled to enforce an Obedience to their Ordinance--else why the Farce of Enacting What no state is bound to Execute. If this is denied Congress is I think an Unnecessary & Useless Burden & shoud not hold from the Individual states a great Many powers, which they Cant exercise & had better be remitted to the Individual Sovereignties. Of this more at another time. I ask your Excellencies pardon for so long trespassing on Your patience at this time without treating the subject more Copiously & Conclusively. Col Hy. Laurens is arrived at New York in 7 Weeks from London & brings advices that the King & Ministry of great Britain are very favourably disposed towards the U S & wish to have a liberal Commercial treaty. The Marquis de la Fayettee came to Philadelphia on the 9th Inst. Advices from our Ministers abroad by his hands were by him delivered to Mr. Mifflin at New York & are not yet come to hand. What think You of the State of New York undertaking to hold a treaty of its own Authority with the Six Nations in defiance of our Re- AUGUST 13, 1784  solves and the Clause of the Confederation restricting the Individual states? (2) The Governor is actually now at Albany for the purpose--such a Step will render all our Endeavours abortive & be Attended with worse Consequences With respect to the Indians than almost any other that state Cou'd take--tis said to be under an Express Law of the state. If this Conduct is to be pursued our Commissioners are rendered useless. As long as the savages believe there are distinct, Independent & perhaps Jealous powers to treat with them they will Certainly avail themselves of the Circumstance Much to the disadvantage of the Union. New York has taken no steps with regard to the Troops required for Garrisoning the N Western frontier.

12831,dg021616,1784,Charles Thomson to Benjamin Franklin,"""
 Charles Thomson to Benjamin Franklin My dear friend, Philadelphia August 13. 1784  The renewal of our ancient correspondence and the receipt of your letters excited those sensations, which real friends feel on meeting unexpectedly after a long separation. As Mr Jefferson, who I hope is by this time safe arrived will explain matters to you and make you fully acquainted with the state of our affairs I shall no longer conceal from you the circumstance of the Omission of the signature of the letter of the 5 Jany last,(1) which procured me the favour of hearing from you. The letter was to have been signed by the President. As the vessel was on the point of sailing and the captain only waiting for the dispatch, I copied the letter in Congress and delivered it to the President, who sealed it in a hurry without putting his name to it. So that my letters to you are all private, and this will explain why they generally contain \""nothing of public Affairs.\"" I am sensible you must, for a considerable time past, have been greatly at a loss for want of official communications. And though I often wished to give you some yet I forbore, for reasons, which if ever I am so happy as to have a personal interview I can assign and which I am persuaded you will deem satisfactory. But this Inconvenience will be obviated, if Mr Jay who with his family is arrived at New York and who as I mentioned to you in a former letter, is appointed Secretary for foreign Affairs, accepts that Office, as I hope he will: Though I must confess my hope is founded more on my wishes than on any solid reason. I have written and informed him of his appointment & urged his acceptance, but have not yet received his answer. Col Harmar who arrived with the Marquis de la Fayette after a fine passage of 35 days delivered me on the eighth your letter of the 14 June with a copy of that of the 13 May, the original of which I  AUGUST 13, 1784  had received before, announcing the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty of peace. On this happy completion of our hazardous enterprize I most sincerely congratulate you. It is an event, which I have devoutly wished and yet I cannot but say, the prospect of it has often excited many uneasy apprehensions. From the first appeal to arms, through the whole contest, I never had a doubt of the issue; but I was afraid it would come upon us before we had acquired national principles, habits and sentiments, which would enable us to improve it to advantage and to act becoming our station and dignity. I need not mention to you who know so well the peculiar circumstances of America at the commencement of this revolution. The several colonies were distinct and separate governments, each jealous of another and kept apart by local interests and prejudices. Being wholly dependent on Great Britain they were secluded from all negotiations with foreign courts and almost from all intercourse with foreign Nations. Having never been much taxed, nor for any length of time, they had no funds, whereon to ground public credit. Those who know the diffculty which old established nations experience in their attempts to introduce new arrangements either in government, police or finance, will readily conceive what we have had to encounter; more especially when it is considered, that the ancient governments being dissolved, the people were thrown into a state of nature, that property being equally divided and the feudal system unknown in this country, there were no individuals to whom the people were accustomed to look up and who could influence their conduct or Opinions. And even when new governments were adopted, the ideas of liberty which prevailed threw the whole power into the hands of the people And the rotation which took place in the legislatures and executives of the several states afforded little Opportunity of acquiring National sentiments. Notwithstanding all this we have made considerable progress in the short period of eight years; the time elapsed since we became a Nation; and I am happy to think that the people every day become more and more impressed with the necessity of honorably paying our debts, supporting public credit and establishing a national character. And though Rhodeisland still holds out and refuses her assent to the impost of 5 per cent, yet as all the other states have agreed to the measure I have strong hopes that she may be induced to come into it, or that some means will be devised to overcome the obstacle which her refusal throws in the way. In like manner I am persuaded the people of these states will quickly find it to be their interest as well as of absolute necessity to be faithful in the observance of treaties and to avoid internal contentions and divisions. There is no doubt but Britain will watch for advantages, if not to recover what she has lost, at least to be revenged for what she has suffered; and that every thing will be attempted and every artifice used, which Malice can suggest, to break our connection with France and to sow dissensions among the states. The easy access which foreigners have to these states and the ready reception they meet with afford   favourable opportunities of putting their Arts in practice. And it is worthy of Observation, that it is strangers lately come among us, whom we know nothing of, joined with Men, who, to say the least of them, were lukewarm in our cause and of doubtful Characters, who are now most active in sowing jealousies of France, from an affected regard for our liberty and a zeal to preserve this country from foreign influence. I think it therefore highly necessary both for France And America to be on their guard and not suffer themselves to be duped by the arts of their common enemy. The atrocious and unprovoked outrage lately committed in this city by one Longchamps a vagabond frenchman seems to carry strong marks of a premeditated design to embroil us with France:(2) And what makes this still more probable is the palliating account given of this affair in a paper newly set up here, as if for the purpose, entitled \""Courier de l'Amerique,\"" and which is conducted by Boinod and Gaillard, two strangers, who came to this place last fall about the same time as Longchamps. The complexion of this paper evidences a marked inveteracy against France and a strong desire to excite fears and jealousies or at least to give an unfavourable impression of her. I am glad to find that the zeal of the Authors has hurried them into so palpable a manifestation of their design and that suspicions are already raised which I trust will guard against the influence of the poison they mean to convey. I send you the Courier de l'Amerique as far as published and some other papers of the day. I also enclose the copies of some originals, which will explain the circumstances of the outrage committed by Longchamps and the measures taken by Government in Consequence thereof.(3) I must inform you that the judges have not yet given an Answer to the last letter of the President. The question \""Whether Longchamps can be legally delivered up by the Council according to the claim made by the late Minister of France\"" was publickly argued by lawyers before the Judges, who still have it under advisement. In the mean while Longchamps is confined in prison and the matter is laid before the legislature, who have now under consideration a bill, which I have no doubt they will pass for effectually securing the rights and immunities of public Ministers and punishing the violators of them. It may not be amiss to acquaint you that from his own shewing it appears that Longchamps had been an Officer in the french service; that in 1775 he came to America and went to our camp then before Boston, where he was cordially received; that after being in our camp and about head quarters for some weeks he took the advantage of a pass given for the purpose of going into the country, to slip into Boston, which we were beseiging; that he wanted permission of genl Gage to come again into our camp; But for some reason that does not appear it was not granted; That in our camp he passed by the name of   Longchamps and in Boston by that of Blutiere. In short from many circumstances, there is reason to suspect that at that time he either was or wished to be employed as a spy of the british general. Whether his late crime is the effect of sudden passion or the result of some premeditated design may possibly in time be manifested. There is a circumstance in the Conduct of Longchamps not mentioned in any of the papers, which it may not be improper to inform you of. On the 17 he committed the first insult. On the 18 he went to a justice of the peace and took an Oath of allegiance to the state, after which he perpetrated the outrage of the 19th. His views in taking the oath have been variously interpreted, some imagining that he meant thereby to secure himself from the french laws and from the power and resentment of the Consul; others that his design was by becoming a citizen to involve the state in his crime and interest the populace in his favour. But whatever might have been his views, even the lawyers who undertook his defence laid little stress upon it in their pleadings And the Bench seemed to be decidedly of opinion that the oath he had taken was of no effect and that he was only to be considered in the light of an alien stranger. The Commissions which Mr Jefferson carried with him and which I hope you have received befor this will not only inform you of the purpose of Congress respecting your request of recal, but enable you to satisfy the Danish Minister and to proceed on commercial treaties with Great Britain and other powers. I wish I were able to give you any pleasing expectations with respect to some employment for your secretary W.T.F.,(4) against whose conduct or abilities while in public service I have never heard the least objection. On the contrary I have always heard them well spoken of. But to me it appears that it will be injuring your grandson to delay making some other provision for him in hopes of an employment from Congress and of this I am persuaded you are already convinced by the appointment of Col Humphreys. And yet I have seen such changes in the conduct of public affairs occasioned by the change of Men entrusted with the direction of them, that there is always room left for hope. But he who has other means of support is less affected by a disappointment in meeting with public employ and if his country stands in need of his services and calls upon him to fill any office, he seems to confer rather than to receive an obligation by accepting it. I have taken some steps but they have hitherto been fruitless to find out Philip Hearn. Upon Enquiry I learn that capt. Holland came to this country in 1775 and was employed as adjutant to a regiment; that in 1776 he was promoted to the rank of a captain in the Delaware and was killed in the battle of Germantown in 1777; that he had married a   daughter of Parson Ross of the Delaware State by whom he left issue and that his widow & children enjoy a pension from the Assembly of that state agreeably to a recommendation of Congress. I need not mention with what marks of cordiality and Affection the Marquis de la Fayette, who came to this place last Monday, was received by all ranks of people. His Stay was but short as he was anxious to see general Washington. He left town this Morning and expects to return in three or four weeks. Mr. Laurens is arrived at New York, but not yet come forward. I intended to have troubled Mr Jefferson with a line by this opportunity, but my letter to you has insensibly become so long, that I shall not have time. You will please to make my respectful compliments to him and Mr Adams. I thank you for the notice you have taken of Mr Isaac Norris. From what I hear I am afraid he is too fond of the company of \""Moines crasseux.\"" Is there no way of reclaiming the son of our common and worthy friend?  With sincere affection and esteem, I am, Dear Sir, Your old and constant friend, Cha Thomson P.S.

 Jonathan Blanchard to Elbridge Gerry My dear Sir New York. Augt. 17th 1784. I have now the pleasure of addressing a line from this City, where I arriv'd the last evening. Mr. Dana tarrd. at Phila. to settle his Acct. but I expect his Arrival tomorrow. Mr. D. went to Mr. R. M.--he receiv'd him very coolly, at wch. Mr. D. was not in the least degree sorry. I am perswaded that the Financier will Anticipate every money matter in his power. He pays no money as I can hear, & issues notes upon all Occasions. Perhaps the Settlement of his Accounts will be postpond with those of the Marine & Comercial Comtees. We (the Comtee.) have not heard any thing of Settlemt. since you left Congress. I hope you will not Censure us for leaving Annapolis. We tarrd. until the 11th, in a disagreeable Situation enough, at no time more  AUGUST 17, 1784  than Nine States, & of Course one Voice put a Stop to any debate. Mr. Dana introduced a Motion for an adjournmt. to Trenton 2d Monday in Sepr. N.H., M., New-Jersey, N.C. & So. Carolina were in favour of it. The Other states were agt. it, Mr. Dana & myself told the Comtee. that we were unwilling to tarry, being under necessity of returning to our States & nothing to do in the Comtee.--the week before last no representation from Maryland, & no Quoram. Monday last week Hand introduced a Scandalous Motion, Spaight seconded it--Mr. Dana rose after the reading from the Chair, & with great Spirit observed, that the Motion was Cruel & Barbarous and by no Means Such Treatment as the Mover had experienced from New-Hampr. & Massa.--the Design was to cast an Odium on Mr. Dana & myself for leaving the Comtee. Hand rose to reply to Mr. Dana, & I took my hat & Cane & left the room. Soon after I got to Mrs. Brices the Deputy Secy. came to me, with a Message from the Chairman, to know if I were about returning. I observd. that I was writing a Public letter & could not. Read then rose & hallowed, so that he might be heard thro' Town, & insisted that the Motion shd. be put on the Journal. Mr. Dana insisted that it shd. not, & told the Secy. to put it on at his peril, and so the Matter rests. We were under no Concern from our States & could move our amendmts or to Strike out, but I supposed the Shortest way would be to put a Stop to it directly. Hand, Chase, Read, Hardy, Spaight & Houston treated us Scandalously. Mr. Dana & I wished for a Constitutional Adjournment, & treated them with Great decency to procure it, but all to no purpose. Mr. Dana said, he could not tarry, & would not, & if the Comtee. refused to Adjourn when they could, they must answer for the consequences. Mr. Dick came of[f] with us, & latterly has behaved pritty well, there remains no prospect of a Comtee. again. Such Men are unfit to Govern this Country. When we came to Phila. we acqu[ainted] Thompson with the Matter, he said he shd. Order the papers to Trenton. Mr. Dana's health is improv'd & mine is Good, but the heat intense. We hope soon to see our Connections & Friends & few more so than a Mr. Gerry. I enclose a paper. Pray accept my best wishes for a Continuance of your health, being in great hast, My dear Sr, Your Most Obt. Servt, J. Blanchard ""

  Sir Annapolis 19th August 1784. My last covering several Accounts & other Papers for the Information of your Excellency & the Inspection of the Legislature was trans- AUGUST 19, 1784  mitted by Post to Philadelphia to be forwarded by Captn. Strong who was expected to sail the 3d Instant for Charleston. As I cannot at present lay my hand on the draft of that Letter am unable to ascertain the date with precision.(1) But I trust it has before this day reached your hand. The Papers enclosed were I think of some Importance & worthy the attentive Consideration of the Legislature of South Carolina. Nothing material occurred 'till the 9th Instant, when a very extraordinary & unexpected dispersion of the Committee of the states took place--which I think it my indispensible duty to communicate exactly as it happened. I will make no other Comment than that if the Legislatures of the Eastern States do not send Men to Public Councils possessed of more Liberality & less self Will, our Connexion will always prove a disagreeable one & may sooner than expected have a Period. The Facts to which I would call your Attention are these. On Monday the 9th of August Instant, the Committee of the States being assembled, present Mr. Blanchard from New Hampshire, Mr. Dana from Massachusetts Bay, Mr. Dick from New Jersey, Mr. Hand from Pennsylvania, Mr. Chase from Maryland, Mr. Hardy from Virginia, Mr. Spaight from North Carolina, Mr. Read from South Carolina, and Mr. Houstoun from Georgia, a Motion was made by Mr. Hand seconded by Mr. Spaight, on which the Yeas & Nays were required by Mr. Hand. After a short debate in which Mr. Dana discovered great Warmth & before the question was put, Mr. Blanchard left the Room of the Committee of the States, whereby he in fact dissolved the Committee, there remaining only eight Members a Number inadequate to any Vote or Business. The Clerk being sent for him by the Members he declined coming to the Committee. On Tuesday the 10th Instant he was again sent for by eight Members then assembled, but the Messenger reported that Mr. Blanchard said he was engaged. On Wednesday the 11th neither Mr. Dana nor Mr. Blanchard attended the Committee, tho' they remained all day in Town, and about half past Six O Clock in the Evening they together with Mr. Dick of New Jersey left Annapolis. By this intemperate Proceeding of the Honourable Members, the United States are at a very critical Season exposed to all the Dangers that may result from the Want of a federal Head or an Authority competent to call Congress together in any Emergency at an earlier Period than that to which they stand adjourned. I take Leave further to observe that it will appear from the Journals of the Committee of the States, Copies of which will soon be forwarded to your Excellency by the Secretary of Congress, that the Honorable Mr. Dana & Mr. Blanchard had been producing by two long Motions on which they required the Yeas & Nays, a Variety of Reasons  AUGUST 20, 1784  for the immediate Adjournment of the Committee of the States to Trenton.(2) Without attempting to falsify or combat such Reasons, Two of the Members of the Committee, vizt, Mr. Spaight of North Carolina & myself concurred in the proposed Adjournment as a preferable Step and more consistent with the Dignity of the Committee & Character of the United States than a Dissolution of the Committee in any other Way, especially as those Honorable Members had at several Times declared their determined Resolution of leaving the Committee, to the Appointment of which the four Eastern States had ever been opposed, about the Middle of the present Month, on their private Affairs. Your Excellency & the Legislature will readily conceive that the Motion before mentioned & which produced so immediate & unfortunate a dissolution was prepared by the Gentlemen against the Adjournment, & calculated to hold up the Reasons for the Committee of the States continuing to sit, & also to call for a Representation from the States not on the Floor of the Committee & as a Justification of their Conduct in dissenting from the proposed Adjournment. Had the Honorable Gentleman permitted the Question to be taken, the Truth of the Reasons & the Opinion of the Committee wou'd have been more authentically known, but at present I think myself authorized to declare they wou'd have had at least six affirmative Votes. But as this wou'd have defeated the Views of Mr. Dana whose Wish it was to throw all the Blame of the Dispersion of the Committee on the Southern States with their single Negative only on his Proposition for an Adjournment, the unmanly & intemperate Step above mentioned was suggested by him & implicitly obeyed by Mr. Blanchard. I have the Pleasure to enclose You a Copy of Doctor Franklin's Letter accompanying the Ratification of the Definitive Treaty on the Part of his Britannic Majesty & also a Copy of the Ratification (3)--& am with the greatest Respect & Regard, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient and Most humble Servt.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Aug 22. 1784 I have received your favour of the 2d in which you seem to think hard of your not receiving an Answer to your letter on C's affair.(1) I thought by this time your experience had taught you, that there are mysteries in government which little folks are not to be permitted to pry into, and which are only to be communicated to such as are deeply skilled in what the Wise King James used to call Kingcraft. You complain that you are as much out of the world at Carlisle as you were at Annapolis; And that you hear nothing of what is doing in this city: And then you follow your complaints with suppositions, queries and fears, which it would fill a quire of paper to answer and remove. However in brief, the Assembly have passed an Act for raising the number of troops called for: The Council have appointed Harmar who is returned from France, lieut. col to command them. Lee and Butler are gone to New-York. But in what forwardness the treaty is, or  AUGUST 22, 1784  whether we shall have any this fall, I cannot tell you. And now for your fears I must leave Time, which is a sovereign disposer or revealer of Events to confirm or remove them. I wonder your queries did not proceed to the Council of Censors. Perhaps you imagined they were going on in the usual way and not doing any thing worth a particular enquery. If you did, you are very much mistaken. They lately appointed a committee to enquire \""whether the Constitution has been preserved inviolate in every part and whether the legislative and executive branches of government have performed their duty as guardians of the people or assumed to themselves or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the Constitution.\""(2) The committee consisted of Messrs. Bryan, Potter, Read, Smilie, McLene and Finley who have gone into a strict review of the proceedings of the legislative branch and have from their acts and journals quoted near a hundred violations of the Constitution and bill of Rights, among which are \""The Act for erecting Dickinson College at Carlisle\"" and a resolve of 9 Sept 1778 \""that Council place chains across Chesnut Street (a public Highway) in Philadelphia city whilst Congress &c be sitting, to prevent the passing of carriages.\"" But the Committee are careful to apprize the reader that the violations they have quoted do not comprehend all that were committed. For in several places and under several heads they expressly quote them \""Examples from a multitude.\"" Let us then suppose, which is not an unreasonable supposition, that the multitude from whence they are taken compared with the examples selected is as a hundred to one, the whole amount of violations of or deviations from the constitution committed in the course of seven years would he at least eight or nine thousand. What a hopeful set of legislatures! But the Committee have not stopped here. Finding the Constitution not very clearly expressed they have condescended like grammarians to write glosses upon it and in their great wisdom have determined that a certain expression in the 20th Section \""ought to be considered as introduced by way of parenthesis,\"" and in the plenitude of their power have hedged it in from the rest of the section by two crooked strokes ( ). They have also restored a comma, in the 22d section, which they say \""candor must allow to be omitted.\"" But it would be exceeding all bounds of a letter to attempt a minute investigation of the report or to give specimens of the profundity of wisdom, depth of judgment, candor and political knowledge therein displayed or of the precision & elegance with which it is expressed. Suffice it to inform you that it is printed by Francis Bailey at Yorick's head and advertised to be sold for a shilling. A rare pennyworth! that it is now under the consideration of the Council and debated with open doors. As I was reading the next paragraph of your letter Echo seemed to stand by and make the following responses. \""How do you feel on   being so long out of Congress? Echo, Out of Congress! Are you not like a fish out of water? Echo, Much better! Dont you wish to be in Congress even at Annapolis? Echo, Hiss! Dont you long for a fat Turky? Echo, Rat turky! Fine fish! Echo, Pish!\"" But I put a stop to her foolish impertinencies that I might relieve you from your apprehensions of shakings & tremblings informing you that your presence will not be necessary at the ancient city on the 1st Septr. Mr Dana, Mr Blanchard and Mr Dick left the Comee on the 11th of this Month & went home. The remaining Members, not being capable to do any business and not having the smallest hope that a number of delegates sufficient to proceed to business could be assembled before the time appointed for the meeting of Congress, have agreed to separate and have advised the removal of the papers & records to this city. So that I expect Mr Bankson will be here with the papers in the course of this week or the next at farthest. Mr Dana & Mr Blanchard honored me with a visit as they passed through this town. Mr D expressed to Mrs T great complaints of the heat of the city and apprehensions of danger from robbers & assassins in walking from my house to his lodgings after twilight. She sends her compliments and hopes that will not deter you from taking this in your way when you go to Trenton. I am, Dear Sir, Your sincere friend & humble Serv,  Cha Thomson ""

Strong on the 2d Instant--and beg your acceptance of my Thanks for the public Prints accompanying that dispatch. My Letter of the 19th Ulto. which (not having met an earlier Conveyance) will I hope come safe to hand by the present Conveyance, informs You of the Temporary dispersion of the Committee of the States & the Manner in which it happened. The remaining Members of the Committee continued to sit for near a Fortnight at Annapolis, but not having the Power to do any public Act & being without a  SEPTEMBER 4, 1784  Hope of again collecting at that Place a sufficient Quorum of the States to proceed to Business, it was thought more prudent to use the Opportunity of this Recess to remove the Papers & Records of Congress from Annapolis to this City, 'till proper Offices are prepared for their Reception at Trenton. Measures were also taken to assemble the Delegates from the States not represented on the Floor of the Committee, in order to form the Committee of the States at Philadelphia;(1) and I entertain a sanguine Hope that that Body will soon be in a State to act. I left Annapolis on the 22d Ulto. & arrived in this City on the 25th to attend the public Business, should the States enable us to proceed with the important Matters committed to us by the United States & that have come under our Cognizance since the Adjournment of Congress. The Arrival of Mr Bull gave me great Pleasure as I assure your Excelly. my constant Attendance on Congress & the Committee of the states for so long a Time has rendered a Short Relaxation from Business extremely necessary to my Health, which is much impaired by so sedentary a Life. Mr. Pinckney having been constantly indisposed since his Arrival in this State and obliged to go to the Eastward for his Recovery, was not able to take my seat in the Committee or to give me any Relief: and Colo. Laurens who landed from England in the Beginning of August found an Impropriety in his doing so 'till he had reported himself to Congress, in whose service he was for so long a Time & who may have Enquiries to make of him on the subject of his late Mission. As Mr Bull has consented to attend the Committee, I purpose in a day or two setting out for Rhode Island, as well for the re-establishment of my Health as to pay a visit to my Mother, whose infirm Health rendered it necessary for her to pass the summer in a more Northern Climate than South Carolina. I shall however return by the Middle of October & be in Readiness to attend the Congress at the Time of their Meeting pursuant to Adjournment. I hear with great Pleasure that the late Heats & Mobs in Charleston have entirely subsided & that the state throughout is in perfect Harmony & Tranquillity.(2) Those Riots were infinitely exaggerated & eagerly catched at by designing Persons in this Quarter who used them to shew that we were unequal to the Government of ourselves, restless & discontented under our own Laws. And as the Delegation was entirely uninformed of the rise & progress of that disgraceful Business, I was placed in an exceedingly awkward & disagreeable situation when Enquiries were made on that subject. I fear these Occurrences will be used to our great disadvantage on the other side the Atlantic. As I find the present Legislature is not expected again to meet, I do not at present forward some Communications intended for their   Information; and as I hope to be at Home by Christmass I may probably in Person report some Matters of which the State ought to be fully informed.

  Sir Philadelphia 9th Septr. 1784. My last was dated at this Place the fourth day of the present Month & forwarded by the Brigantine Charleston packet, Captn. Allibone--since which Nothing very material has occurred. I do not lose sight of the Hope that we shall be able to assemble a Committee of the States at this Place in the Course of Ten days or a Fortnight. Indeed I own to your Excellency that I am exceedingly sanguine in this Business, especially when I consider the disadvantageous Point of View the United States must appear in, in the Eyes of Europe. The Observation naturally occurs to every American that has the Welfare & Grandeur of his Country at all at Heart--but my Feelings are particularly wounded when I hear it in the Mouth of every Foreigner with whom I converse. The Marquis de la Fayette who is the steady Friend of this Country & has done much to serve it, laments the dispersion of the Committee of the States in Terms expressive of the deepest Concern. He thinks no step since the Peace will more deeply wound our Interests in the Courts of Europe. What do those Men deserve who thus suffer private Engagements or perhaps mere Caprice to endanger the Peace & Glory of their Country!  On perusing some late dispatches from our Ministers I thought the Letters whereof I enclose Copies sufficiently interesting to deserve to be laid before your Excellency & the Legislature & have therefore submitted them.(1) They furnish an additional Evidence of the ill Blood entertained against us by The Court of Great Britain & our critical situation & shew You what Trifles they can catch at as Cause of dispute. How much on our Guard then ought we to be, & how attentive to the supporting & rendering firm our internal Governments, as well as our National Credit, every reasoning Mind will readily conceive. I have been delayed here a week longer than I expected by the Fever & Ague which has given me a severe Shake, but as I am at length clear of it shall proceed for Rhode Island in a day or two.

I am told from good Authority that General Haldimand denies having received Orders to surrender the Posts held by the Troops of his Britannic Majesty within the Boundaries of the United States, but as the dispatches from Colo. Hull the Officer sent by Order of Congress to Quebec on that Business did not come to Hand till after the Committee of the States were broken up, I have not been able to see the Contents of the Public Letters on that Subject.(2) This Conduct of the British Court & their General is extraordinary & has an exceeding ill Aspect.

A desire that the State of Virginia might shew her respect for the ConfOEderal Government (if it is not a prostitution of the name of Government to apply it  SEPTEMBER 23, 1784  to such a vagabond, strolling, contemptible Crew as Congress) will induce me to spin out a Couple of Weeks here--but I have no hopes of a Committee & as this place has no longer any charms for me, at that period I shall move southwardly, at least as far as Annapolis. I spent 8 Days there; in my passage here in the midst of the Sick--all those whom you & I regard are out of town or confin'd with the Ague & fever--The enclos'd was entrusted to me by the Mother of a very sick family indeed.

Come to Trenton & if the present System won't do, some other ought. We are both sliding into our respective States where we may be usefull in putting in to execution any plan previously formed.

At the request of the States met I have this day written to the states unrepresented urging them to send on each a delegate as speedily as possible; as it is conceived to be of great importance to the Confederacy that the Comee. should assemble. Whatever little politicians may think, time will evince that it is of no small consequence to save appearances with foreign nations, & not to suffer the federal government to become invisible. A government without a visible head must appear a strange phenomenon to European politicians & will I fear lead them to form no very favourable opinion of our Stability, wisdom or Union.

 Hugh Williamson to Alexander Martin Sir, Edenton 30th September 1784 By the printed journals of Congress you will observe that a little before the adjournment sundry important subjects were agitated & the questions lost on principles which some of us could not have suspected. It was generally admitted to be essential towards the discharge of the national debt that the lands ceded to Congress by New York & Virginia should be purchased from the Indians; and a military force somewhat respectable is necessary either to holding an advantageous treaty, taking possession of the Western Posts, or keeping the Indians in check. But some of the states would not admit that Congress has any right to make a requisition of troops during peace. The southern and middle states were of the opinion that such a right could not be given up. It is provided in one of the Articles of Confederation that \""the United States in Congress assembled shall have the sole power of  SEPTEMBER 30, 1784  raising troops.\"" There are no words by which this power is restrained to the time of War; hence we supposed it to be perpetual; especially when we considered that the existence of such a right may be essential; for the very independence or safety of an Empire may depend upon its arming in time of peace to prevent an invasion. The minority however would not recede and we had recourse to a poor expedient, but the only one remaining viz To calling on Certain states for Militia.(1) The inefficacy & expence of this measure may probably give rise to better ones. The enclosed paper No. 1 is an extract of a Letter from the Legislature of Massachusetts. No. 2 is an Act of the general Assembly of Connecticut. These papers have been refered to a grand Committee who have reported on the several articles to which they refer, but I cannot allow myself to believe that Congress will adopt the report without great amendments.(2) For myself I confess that I am not possessed of such information, though I have sought for it with diligence as to enable me on those questions to determine with any degree of certainty what is the true Interest of the state. Hence it is that I am to trouble Your Excellency with a few questions, whose solution I cannot otherwise obtain. You will observe that the propositions of Massachusets open a field for extensive charges by that state against the United States. New Hampshire too has claims similar to those of Massachusets for bounties & old Continental Money. There is a redundance of old money in Rhode Island, & Connecticut has large claims for Militia service. If these several claims are allowed the debt of the United States must be encreased by several Millions of Dollars. Something must doubtless be done on these several heads, but if my calculation is right our state must gain or loose near half a Million of Dollars according to the principles on which the different resolves may be founded. I am aware that since I have had the honor to serve the state some of the same questions that I am going to propose have been stated by the delegates & no answer returned. However as I conceive the subject very important and as the time approaches when a final settlement must be made of the late military expences of the United States, I flatter myself that more attention will now be paid to those different subjects. The claim of Massachusets that she may be allowed for all the bounties that were paid for recruiting the Continental Line in the last years of the War is said to be very large, & New Hampshire has a similar claim. We are told that a bounty of 100 dollars per annum was paid by the several classes to the recruits whom they raised for three Years. In support of the claim Massachusets alledges that she has raised more than her quota of the Continental Line & that Congress has promised to indemnify any State for such exertions. I presume this single charge may amount to a Million of Dollars. But it is enquired, has Massachusets done more than her quota or has North Carolina done less than her quota of military service: at present we are not furnished with materials by which we can answer those questions.  The personal service to be performed by the Citizens of any state was to have been according to the number of its white Inhabitants, and no account can be procured of the number of our inhabitants. Early in the revolution, our Delegates, for obvious reasons, stated the number of our Militia at 40,000, but the motives to such large statements have long since vanished & it is now our duty & interest to be more correct.  The number of inhabitants in some of the states have been taken from the Militia rolls, by Counting five Inhabitants for every Man on the roll. On this principle we may venture to fix the number of our White Inhabitants, without any risque of its exceeding the truth; especially if we take the very last Musters that were made on the Year 1782 when the effective Militia in the several Counties were divided into Classes for the sake of making the 18 Months Continental draught. Certainly the several Brigadiers could furnish you with such a return within a few Weeks, as the Militia were classed in the same manner on the Year 1781 either of the Muster Rolls would answer our purpose and they must be considered as correct, for they were taken on Oath. In such a return it would hardly be fair to include the settlers in the new Counties over the Mountains who were not there during the War, nor would any list taken on the present Year be so perfectly unexceptionable. I have some reason to believe that our fensible Militia were much nearer 25 than 40 thousands. Having discovered what was the number of our fensible Militia, perhaps we shall find that near the beginning of the War we raised too great a proportion of Continental troops & when the Vast bodies of Militia are considered who did duty towards the end of the War, who are chargeble, or who may hereafter may be charged to Continental account, it is probable that North Carolina will not appear to have been deficient. If so, she will hardly be the first in objecting to the claim of Massachusets, provided she obtains a credit for similar bounties. There are other facts of which the Delegates may need to be informed viz. What are the different tours of duty that have been performed by the Militia of this state during the War? What is the number of Men who have served on those several tours & the length of their service? At whose Instance was the Militia called out on the several occasions? Your Excellency will immediately observe the use of this last question, for according to the Resolves of Congress, all militia service that has been performed in consequence of recommendations of Congress, or at the request of a Continental Officer Commanding in a seperate department are to be charged to the account of the United States. I presume that all the Militia who have served in Georgia or South Carolina, all those who were draughted in 1780 to serve under Major General Caswell & those who served at any time with General Greene are chargeable to Continental Acct. But I fear that they who  SEPTEMBER 30 1784  served at the Nor-West in Virginia under General Gregory, & those who served in 1781 near Wilmington & in other parts of the state, also the state Regiment may not at present be chargeable to the acct of the United States. It is curious but not very pleasing to observe, that while some of the Northern States never turned out a serjeants guard of Militia without obtaining the sanction of Congress or of some Continental Officer, our state in the true spirit of a patriot but not of an accomptant has been expending Militia & raising state troops without taking any heed concerning the day of retribution. The Delegates can easily find what Militia have been called for by Congress, but they do not know how many have served in consequence of such Calls, nor do they know what numbers have served in consequence of the Calls or recommendations of different Continental Officers. By an Extract from the Letters of the several Continental Officers who have commanded in the southern department, on the subject refered to, we shall know what part of our Militia service is to be charged to the United States. As the Camp was formed on the borders of Virginia by order of the Executive Council sitting at Hillsborough, perhaps the measure was sanctioned by the continental Commander who was then with them at Hillsborough. Being possessed of the different informations to which I have alluded, we shall be enabled to reason Mathematically on the following heads, viz. We shall know whether the amount of service performed by our State, either by its Continental line, or by its Militia in Continental pay is equal our quota of Military service. If we find that we have done much service which we are not at present authorised to charge, perhaps we may find that it will be our interest to indulge Massachusets in her Ponobscot claim, & Connecticut in her claims. If Congress should agree that all tours of Militia duty that have been undertaken to repel an enemy, or to stop his progress, shall be charged to Continental account, our Indian expeditions will be charged in Course, but I suspect that some difficulty may arise in obtaining such a Resolve. The agreement of nine States is necessary. New Hampshire has already obtained credit for all the Militia service she has done, Rhode Island is nearly in the same predicament as also New York. Pensylvania has obtained a full credit. Deleware has rendered very little Service of that kind & Maryland none, or none that can be mentioned. All these States or a Majority of them may object to admitting any new charges by which their quota of the national debt must be considerably increased, & nothing added to their own Credit. Having mentioned the difficulties that may arise in obtaining credit for the amount of our Militia services, I cannot help refering to the act of Cession that was passed by the last General Assembly and though I see by the journals that a great diversity of Opinions prevailed in the house on that subject, I am not in the least apprehensive   of giving Offence to Gentlemen who have been on either side of the question, for I am fully pursuaded that they were equally desirous to promote the true interest & honor of the State & the harmony & strength of the Union; they only differed in their opinions concerning the best means.(3) It happens however that some very strange & unexpected incidents have presented themselves since the last Spring which may impress the minds of men considerably, must affect our finances greatly and may render it proper for the State to embrace measures or to use cautions which on the last Spring were not indicated. Be this as it may, it is my duty to mention the incidents or charges that have occured, if they should appear of little importance they will occasion the less trouble. Congress or several of the States were in such haste to adjourn on the 3d June last, that we could not obtain a Vote for appointing Commissioners to treat of Peace with the Southern Indians, though the plan of a treaty had for some Weeks been prepared by a Committee.(4) Should an Indian War break out by such neglect, the Western Inhabitants of our State would be among the Chief Sufferers. When I consider the political & military Virtues of those brave Citizens who live over the Mountain, and recollect that we are in a great measure indebted to them for One of the greatest Actions that has been atchieved during the late war, I am not a little hurt by any want of attention to their safety. Massachusets has at this late hour put in he[r] claim to an extent of two degrees of latitude across the Country that is claimed by New York: & immediately before the adjournment she petitioned to have the question determined by a foederal Court, which is to be appointed. This claim I conceive is to extend to the South Sea or at the least to the Mississippi & will include part of the New York & Virginia Cession though it will not Come southerly of the present Massachusets. Connecticut having faild in her attempts to cut one degree out of the State of Pensylvania, has just entered her claim to the same degree Westward of Pensylvania. Her south boundary is somewhere near the latitude 41°, & she extends to the Mississippi. Indeed she is willing to cede that degree to Congress on Condition that they will give her 100 miles in length of it from the border of Pensylvania. This curious act of Session [Cession] arrived at Congress on May last. It may seem strange that Connecticut should have accepted of the Virginia Cession when she yielded that very land to Congress, without disputing her title which might have been tried by foederal Court, tho' she now claims it from Congress when no such Court can be instituted; for there are no indifferent Judges.(5) Another event of great importance has drawn the attention of the Public since the adjournment. Rhode Island is said once more to have   rejected the 5 Per Cent Impost by a great Majority in her Assembly. If this impost shall finally be lost North Carolina has a bad prospect of being able to pay her quota of the National Debt. Virginia & South Carolina will immediately impose a duty of 5 Per Cent for their seperate use by which they will be enabled to pay a Considerable part of their quota. We shall impose a duty, and what will be the consequence. Near half of the goods we consume are imported by land from Virginia & South Carolina, And as our sea trade is chiefly carried on in small Coasters near half of the remainder will be Smuggled through our numerous inlets. The goods we import by land will have paid a tax of 5 Per Ct. for the benefit of Virginia & South Carolina but they will hardly pay one half Per Cent into our Treasury; for it will not be possible to guard an entrance into the State of 150 Miles in Length on each boundary. The goods that come by Water will in General have paid a Tax of 5 Per Cent to some of the Northern States, but by the address of Coasters & small adventures they will pay little into our Treasury. These are not very pleasing prospects. It is well known that Georgia, who has done very little service during the War has obtained a very extensive territory by the manner in which our bounds were settled at the Peace. She might yield to the United States at least 63 Millions of acres after retaining to herself an Extent of 300 Miles from the Sea. Our share of such a Cession, if she could be prevailed on to make it in Concert would I think be equal to the greater part of what remains for us to give. To the different considerations that have been mentioned we may add the situation of our Indian expeditions. You may recollect that on the 22d October 1782 the delegates had the honor to express to your Excellency their hopes that if a Cession of Western territory should take place it would be on certain Conditions, of which the first was \""That the whole expence of our Indian expeditions shall pass to account in our quota of the Continental expences.\"" And on the 11th of September in the same Year, the Delegates expressed their uneasiness that they had not been officially informed of an expedition then going on against the Indians, nor authorised to apply to Congress for their approbation, as Pensylvania was doing at that very time so that she might pass the service to acct. But no such approbation has been obtained & the whole of our expeditions with a good part of our other Militia service continues to be a State expence. I perceive that a great part of the late general Assembly viewed this subject in a different light, which doubtless was the reason why they omitted the stipulation that has been mentioned or some Conditions to that amount; they seem to have thought that all Militia services whether they were pointed against tawney or the white savages ought to pass to the Continental account. If ever that should be the case it will cost us much trouble to obtain such a credit.  You observe that there are three measures which we are greatly interested in promoting viz, That Rhode Island & Georgia should agree to the 5 Per Cent Impost, That Georgia should cede part of her territory and that the Expences of our Indian Expeditions should be paid by the United States. Can the Western territory, belonging to our state, be so managed as to promote those several Interests? The last mentioned it may doubtless secure. If we should immediately complete the Cession, we shall give up the power of making advantageous terms and shall loose the argument which may bring others to adopt fOEderal measures; on the other hand should we sell out what remains of this territory to the Western Inhabitants whatever inconveniences they may suffer, will loose the prospect of becoming a Seperate State; the quota of our State will be doubled though we shall hardly have the Means of paying half of our present Quota; in that case too we should give up the means of making terms, or the power of adopting better measures if better should present themselves. The situation is critical. Perhaps it is most consistent with prudence & sound policy to make a Pause. Whatever shall finally appear to be for the honor & true interest of the State may be done 12 Months hence as well as now. But we may do wrong things which cannot be undone. Among the Acts of the last Assembly, there is one for empowering Congress in the final Settlement of the proportion this State is to bear of the whole expences of the War, the foreign loan excepted, to adopt such principles as may seem just, without being wholy governed by the rule laid down in the 8th article of the Confederation.(6) From this it appears to have been the expectation of the state, that Congress would come to a Settlement & allot to each state the portion it is to pay of the national debt, the foreign loan excepted, which quota each state might discharge as it could or at least the balance of its quota. Doubtless the Delegates Will press for such a Settlement as nothing could be more fortunate for our State, but such a measure will be warmly opposed by most or all of the states who have no vacant Lands, the question has already been agitated. The reason is pretty clear why such states may refuse to divide the National debt. According to the present allotments, Maryland which is one of the states that has no vacant territory, would have to pay 94 Dollars out of every thousand; & North Carolina would have to pay 72. But as soon as our Vacant territory shall all be located & surveyed, our quota according to the existing rule, would be near 148. I need not say that Georgia would pay above 200 whose quota at this hour is 10; nor that the quota of Maryland must decrease while ours was encreasing. However ungenerous it may seem to think of burthening posterity with our National debt, and of throwing half of it round the neck of those infant States who are rising on tother side of the mountains, there are people who are not ashamed to cherish sentiments of this kind.  By the Letter from Massachusets you will observe that Congress are still haunted by the Old Continental Money. Justice & sound policy require that its manes should get some repose. Massachusets having called in 40 millions, which was her quota, discovers that there are near 30 millions more remaining in the hands of Individual Citizens. Your Excellency may wonder how she made such a discovery, when we find so much difficulty in obtaining any information that can be of use to our funds or claims, but those people loose nothing by the Want of industry. Massachusets & the other States, who have too much of the old money propose that it should be sunk according to the Resolves of Congress at 40 for 1. There are other states in which the money circulated at 5 or 600 for 1, who propose to sink it at that rate. Perhaps neither plan is founded on strict justice. It is very clear that a considerable part of the old money was carryed into Boston after the value had sunk below forty, but it is also affirmed that no part of it ever circulated after it had sunk to 100 for one. The states who have more than their quota of this Money alledge that justice is refused them because it is the Interest of the Majority to do wrong. In whatever manner this question may be determined I think we shall find that our situation would not have been worse if there had been a few Millions more of the old Continental money in our Treasury. Your Excellency will see by the Journals that Congress has not yet agreed on a plan for opening the land Office for the sale of Western territory.(7) Much of our hope depends upon the prudent management of that business; however as I have more than once mentioned the Western territory as a fund by which a great part of the National debt might be extinguished I shall try to explain my ideas on that subject. We are apt to estimate the value of Vacant land by considering what it sold for under the regal Government; without considering that the object of the Crown was to settle Colonies & not to raise money; that the property is now conveyed in fee simple, but the Crown used to reserve a perpetual quit-rent; and that the value of Land increases in such proportion as the Government is more free. From the states which formerly were proprietary Governments where the soil belonged to a subject who was attentive to the improvement of his estate, we may form some estimate of the true value of vacant Land. In Maryland the price of Land was £5 stirling per hundred acres with a reserved quitrent of 4/. The amount was equal to 37 dollars & 3d. In Pensylvania where the form of Government was more free, with the advantage of having no Ecclesiastical establishment such as prevaild in Maryland, land was readily sold for a greater price. In the Year 1769 the Land office was opened for the sale of several Millions of acres that had just been purchased of the Indians. The price was £5 sterling or £8.6.8 with a quit rent of 8/4 sterling or 13/10½ Currency; but 13/10½ per annum is the interest of £11.10.8 hence the purchase if   the quitrent had been bought out would have been £19.17.4½ or 53 Dollars lacking four pence per hundred acres. On those terms above three thousand tracts were sold in one day, and more entries made in a fortnight than the whole of the Vacant lands. A Considerable part of the land refered to lay over the Mountains, some of it on the Ohio, and is exceeded in Value by at least 50 millions of acres of ceded Land that is not controverted on tother side of the Ohio. Surely the present form of Government is more free than what formerly prevailed in Pensylvania or any other Province and a silver-Dollar was of more value either in Europe or America 15 Years ago than it is at present, wherefore our lands ought to sell for much more than 53 silver Dollars, but our Lands are to be sold for public securities not for specie, and no man will say that money in the Public funds is to be valued as money in the Pocket. In great Britain, whose funds are among the best in Europe, A Man could not on the last Year get more than £65 in Cash for £100 national stock; In the United States, where the public funds have not acquired any system, national stock is much lower. It is at 20 or 25 per Ct. Is it not certain that we may sell our Lands at 100 dollars per Hundred acres without any difficulty? the money to be paid in public securities. Your Excellency may possibly wish to know the present Situation of the public arms, especially as that situation may chance to draw the attention of the State. There are from 30,000 to 40,000 stands of arms, besides a large train of artilery, deposited in different places. At Springfield in Massachusets, at West Point in New York & at Carlisle in Pensylvania there are large magazines & arsenals which have been erected at the Expence of the United States. In those places a sufficient quantity of arms is deposited for the Northern & middle States. The proportion of public arms which ought to be laid up in the Southern States is stored at a heavy expence in private Ware-houses in Philadelphia & at other Sea Ports. It was proposed to build arsenals & magazines at the Point of Fork on James's River, and at Camden in South Carolina to which those arms were to have been transported, but we have not been able during the two last Years to obtain a Vote for the expence of sufficient buildings; in fact money has been deplorably scarce in the Treasury, nor is the Case like to alter much for the better. Hence it is probable that some other measures must be adopted for the disposition of our quota of the Public arms. If our State was provided with an arsenal & magazine sufficient for holding them, or if it had appropriated sufficient funds for the purpose, I think it probable that the Delegates would move to have our proportion immediately brought into the state, for we should then understand it to be the Wish of our Constituents. I need not mention that the Confederation requires, nor that political prudence requires, that our Militia should be well armed and that we lay up Military Stores in time of Peace so as to prevent insults, by a respectable state of De-  fence. If it is the opinion of our State that some kind of military preperations are necessary, perhaps no time can be so fit as the present for beginning to erect the buildings, for a small part of the state arsenal may be set apart for storing our quota of the Continental arms. In cold climates it is found that 2 men are sufficient to keep 4,000 stands of small arms free from rust. In a warmer Climate 3 may be required. This is a small expence. I am aware that the low state of our finances will be objected to this useful undertaking. But it appears to me that if 5 or 6,000 pounds worth of forfeited property was vested in the hands of Commissioners to be immediately sold for the sole purpose of erecting arsenals & magazines it would be a sum well disposed of: And a Military or political forfeiture would be naturally applied to a Military use. You will be so good as to excuse this digression. It appeared to be my duty to represent the situation of the Public arms and our embarrasments on that account. I have merely hinted at a measure, by which some of those difficulties might be removed. This Letter has insensibly grown very long. If the Subjects to which it refers claims the attention of the State it needs no apology, if otherwise an apology would not save it. In every case where I have ventured to give an Opinion I have stated the facts on Which that Opinion is founded; from such evidence if the conclusions are ill drawn, you will readily correct them. In what manner shall this State obtain full credit for the services it has performed during the late War? In what manner shall our claims be Supported so that our quota of the National Debt may be diminished & our Citizens rescued from heavy Taxation: To this particular object I would turn your attention & for this purpose it is that I repeat the original request, that the Delegates may be informed what have been the number of effective militia in the state? What tours of duty they have performed? and what is the Continental sanction under which they have served on different occasions? It is with much reluctance that I have troubled Your Excellency, or the State with such a detail of questions, but the property of our Constituents is deeply concerned in subjects to which those questions refer, and in the determinations to which they may lead; hence it is of the utmost importance that the Delegates be well informed. It is humiliating in a statesman to be reduced to conjectures, and perfectly shameful for an Accomptant to be stumbling in the dark when certainty is to be obtained. I have the honor to be &c, Hugh Williamson ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Oct 1. 1784  Though I have nothing agreeable to write, yet I cannot suffer Mr Short to go without a line to give you some information of the present situation of Affairs. Agreeably to your advice, when Congress adjourned, I met the Committee of the States and having opened a book for their journals & made the necessary arrangements, I applied for leave of absence which was readily and unanimously granted and I returned to Philadelphia. The Committee also gave themselves a short recess by adjournment from the 4 to the 26 of June. Nine States did not meet till the 8 July when they proceeded to business but not with the harmony and good humour that could have been wished. The Deputies from Pensylvania attended on the day assigned for the appointment of a court to decide on the claims respecting the private right of soil of the Wioming lands between the claimants under Grants from Pensylvania & Connecticut. But as the deputies from Connecticut did not appear and the Committee of the States had not assembled, the business went off without any thing being done and that affair remains in a very disagreeable situation & is like to produce very unhappy Consequences. On the 29 July a motion was made for adjourning the Committee of the States to Trenton; but being lost it was again renewed on the 3 August & being then lost, three of the members, viz. Messr. Blanchard, Dana & Dick left the Comee. on the 11 & returned home. The remaining members after waiting till the 19 & seeing no prospect of forming a comee. advised the removal of the papers & records to Philada and wrote to the several states to send on delegates to that place. Five have met here and have caused Notice of their meeting to be sent to the states unrepresented, with an earnest request to send on delegates. But it does not appear to me that any Committee will be formed before the Meeting of Congress which is to be at Trenton on the 30 of this Month or the first Monday in November. Though this invisibility of a fOEderal head will have little effect on our affairs here, or on the minds of the citizens of the United States who can easily reconcile themselves to it and who will view it in no other light than the rising or dissolution of their several legislatures to which they have been accustomed, yet I am apprehensive it will have an ill aspect in the eyes of European Nations & give them unfavourable impressions, which will require all your address & abilities to remove. OCTOBER 1, 1784  The messenger sent to Canada is returned and has brought an answer from Genl Haldiman of which I enclose a copy,(1) and by which you will see that though he has recd. official information of the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace, yet no orders are sent to evacuate the posts within the United States. And there is a report that the garrisons are relieved & the posts supplied with near 12 months provisions. I leave you to draw conclusions from this Conduct. What steps Congress will take respecting this matter I know not. In the mean while I am sorry to find that R.I. still continues obstinate & refuses to grant the impost, which seems to be the only means of establishing national credit & reputation & giving us weight with foreign nations. H. & E.(2) it is said got home just in time to prevent a change that was like to take place in their public councils & to confirm their former obstinacy. On the 13 August I wrote a long letter to Doct Franklin in which I gave him a full account of the proceedings in the case of Long-champs. Matters still remain in the same situation, and I am apprehensive that the bill which I mentioned to be before the legislature has not been passed, as that Assembly was suddenly broken up, on Tuesday last by the secession of 19 Members on Account of an Alteration that was about to be made in the test laws. I have not yet heard whether Mr Jay will accept the office of Secy. for foreign Affairs, though I have some faint hopes that he will. Mr L[aurens] arrived in town some weeks ago. I am told that he was hurt at not being received with the same demonstrations of Joy and marks of Attention as were shewn to the Marquis de la Fayette who arrived some days before him. He purposes to wait the meeting of Congress as he has some communications to make respecting their affairs in Europe. I find that Spain is still bent on obtaining the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi. Rendon shewed me this morning a letter from Galvez the Minister for the American department wherein he desires him to inform Congress that the intercourse with New Orleans & with Havannah is shut till the boundaries between the US & S are settled & that the court cannot admit that England had a right to settle the boundaries with the U.S. in that Country which Spain had conquered in 1782 before the provisional treaty.(3) Please to make my Compliments to your Collegues.

  Sir Philadelphia Oct. 6th. [17]84. Yesterday's Post brought me yr. Excellency's favors of the 16th &  OCTOBER 6, 1784  23d Septr. I am happy to find that the line of conduct my judgement suggested to me as most eligible, appear such to you. As my stay in Annapolis without any prospect of being join'd by other Members was at once awkward & coud answer no good purpose I sat out for this place on the 18th but arriv'd here the 22d. Notwithstanding I was ever averse to a removal thence & still more so to the unjustifiable measures taken to effect it--Yet now I feel happy, that in coming hither every imputation of neglect of the ConfOEderal Government in the State of Virginia will be avoided. Only six States have assembled--the Secretary of Congress in pursuance of the Opinion of the Majority of the Members present, has written to the Executives of those States who have no representative here.(1) He has stated the importance of the particular business before the Committee, which conjoin'd with the dishonor of leaving the Union without a head, it was expected woud induce them to send on Members. No good effect has yet arose from this measure, & none I imagine is to be hoped for. If no Committee convenes before the session of Congress, we shall avoid the impropriety suggested in yr. Letter of the 23 & which I was very sensible of. I had indeed determined to proceed to business, had the competent number of members convened--this the critical situation of our Affairs demanded of me, & woud have justified me--at least to myself--but not without stating my reasons in writing, which woud have amounted to a protest against a measure so pregnant with fatal consequences being hereafter adduc'd as a precedent. The American Government has sustain'd a rapid declension of Character since the peace, both at home & abroad. <<This will be accelerated by our present situation & indeed I see not where it will end unless the E[astern] S[tates] send us Men more honest & more able.> Encouraged by our weakness Haldimand has refused the N. Western Posts to an Official demand, & the Spaniards commit all manner of depredation & insult. Oliver Pollock who had been sent to Havanna to succeed Mr. R. Smith on his death, in the duty of detecting & preventing Neutral Nations from advantaging of & disgracing our Flagg, has been stopp'd by an order of the Governor of that place & all his property seized. I am particular in mentioning this as the reputation of the State of Virginia seems to be in some measure interested in the story of this Man.(2) The Warrants issued to him by the State he passed away both to his American & Spanish Creditors. Upon the Act of Legislation which stopped their payment, they were returned on him & his person altho' protected by a public Character arrested & his property seized. He had sent to this place his Wife & a large family for support--immediately on her Arrival the American holders of those Warrants seiz'd on all her Baggage, even her Wearing Apparel. Certainly the situation of a Man first seperated from his family & then hearing that  OCTOBER 16, 1784  they are destitute of support, & not allow'd to come to their relief, wants not the aid of exaggeration to excite pity & I can not doubt its truth as what I relate is chiefly from my own observation. The Legislature had no doubt the best reasons for stopping payment to Pollock; but if it is probable, that in every view he will have money due him, they may in their present circumstances judge it proper to relieve his family untill he is permitted to come & resettle his Accounts. Under this idea I coud wish yr. Excellency to communicate this information to the Legislature when next assembled.

 Richard Dobbs Spaight to Alexander Martin Sir, October 16th. 1784. I wish through your Excellency to communicate to the honorable  OCTOBER 16, 1784  the general assembly the cause of the dissolution of the Committee of the States, appointed by Congress to sit during their recess. Its effects I fear, will prove very disadvantageous to the interest of the United States, at this particular & important period. It has already been spread throughout Europe by the emissaries of the British Court \""that the United States are only united in name and that a little time will shew that we are incapable of governing ourselves, that great dissentions prevail in the different States, and that we are unwilling, if not unable, to pay the debts we have contracted during the War.\"" Many circumstances which have taken place on the Continent tend to confirm these reports; but none has more fully answered that purpose than the dissolution of all Continental Government by breaking up of the Committee of the States. It is expected that the Commissioners of the United States have opened or shortly will open negotiations for forming treaties of amity & Commerce with the European Powers. Under what disadvantages must they negotiate with a People, prejudiced against us, as a nation divided in itself, and whose Government has not sufficient powers to compel even its own Citizens to keep the articles of a treaty when made. They will rather suppose that more beneficial treaties may be made with the respective States; and will cherish those ideas of independence & seperation which is said to prevail among us, for their particular emolument. Towards the last of July Mr. Dana the Delegate from Massachusets, seconded by Mr. Blanchard the Delegate from New Hampshire, moved that the Committee might adjourn on the day of August, to meet again at Trenton on the first Monday in September and that in the interim the papers of the Secretary's Office, & the Office of foreign affairs should be removed to that place.1 To strengthen the reasons in favour of the adjournment, they said they were obliged to leave Annapolis in a short time, and it would give their Colleagues an Opportunity to come forward to take their places; And that they did not expect they would come so far south as Annapolis. These reasons being urged, & knowing the bad effects of the dissolution of the Committee, by the withdrawing any of its members, would have in the political World on the affairs of the United States, induced me to vote for it, thinking it would have a better appearance for the Committee to be dissolved (if it should happen to have that effect, by its not being formed again) by its own vote, than by the former mode; the one would at least bear the face of unanimity, the other of disunion. Four states being opposed to the Motion, negatived it. Those Delegates being still determined in their intentions of returning home, obliged the others who saw the consequences of their leaving the Committee without a competent number to do business, to fall on   some mode if possible to prevent their going, or to make them postpone it until they should be relieved by their Colleagues. Accordingly a motion was brought forward by General Hand seconded by myself, stating the evils that would result from a dissolution of the Committee, in order to convince them, of the necessity there was for their staying until relieved, or until Delegates should come on from the unrepresented States, to fill up the Committee (a Copy of the Motion is enclosed).2 After the motion had been some time debated, and the chairman about to put the question, Mr. Blanchard the Delegate from New Hampshire left the room; there being then only eight states on the floor, we could proceed on no business. The members present, [sent] to him requesting his return, but he declined it. He did not appear the next day, & was again sent for, but declined coming. On Wednesday the 11th of August neither Mr Dana nor Mr Blanchard appeared and on that evening they both left Annapolis to return home, carrying with them Mr Dick of Jersey. This unprecedented step of the Eastern Delegates did not Supprize me, it was only acting in unison with their former conduct, & seemed to me to be a concerted scheme among the Delegates of the four New England States, as they opposed the appointing a Committee during the recess, and would not have agreed to it, could they have had an adjournment of Congress without. Since I have had the honor of a seat in Congress their uniform conduct has been to Weaken the Powers of the union as much as possible, & sacrifice our national strength & dignity in hopes of rendering themselves more conspicuous as individual states. They have even attempted to answer their particular purposes to call in question & dispute those powers which are expressly granted to Congress by the Confederation. I do not think they wish for a dissolution of the Confederacy, but they press so extremely hard on the chain that unites us, that I imagine it will break before they are well aware of it. A Seperation certainly would not be to their advantage. The produce of the Southern & middle States will ever command the friendship of the maritime powers, while the New England States depending totally on their industry & the carrying trade in the last of which they are rivals to the British & Dutch must ever depend upon the friendship of the Southern & middle States for their employment & support. This event may, by many, be thought to be distant, but it is my Opinion, that unless those states lay aside their present policy, and adopt one more liberal, and which shall have for its basis, the general good of the Whole, uncrampt by the policy & interest of particular States, that it will happen in a very short period. The disputes between Pensylvania & Connecticut, for the Wyoming Lands--and New York & the Vermonteers with the support & promises, which the New England States have given the Latter, have sown the   seeds of dissention which I think will not end without a Civil War. And the conduct of the Eastern states in opposing the peace establishment, plainly appears to me, to have been with a view to put it out of the power of Congress to check those evils in the bud, as soon as they should appear. The six states that remained at Annapolis met from day to day until the 19th of August, when finding there was not the most distant prospect of a Committee being again formed at that place, and that our remaining there without power to do any one act, would answer no beneficial purpose, came to an agreement to recommend it to the secretary to remove the papers of his offices and office of foreign affairs to Philadelphia till places were got ready for their reception at Trenton.(3) I should still have thought it my duty to have remained at, or in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia so that if a Committee had met before the meeting of Congress, the state of North Carolina should not have been unrepresented--but receiving no supplies from the state & my Finances growing low, at the same time knowing that my private affairs wanted my Presence in Carolina, I determined on returning--and proposed getting back to Trenton by the annual meeting of Congress; for which place I am at present on my Way. I have the honor to be &c, Rich. D. Spaight ""

  Sir New York 25th. Octr. 1784 My last which bore date about the Middle of Septr.(1) was from Philadelphia by Captn. Strong of the ship Philadelphia. I trust that dispatch came safe to hand as I am informed by private Letters of the safe Arrival of the ship at Charleston. By that Opportunity I did myself the Honour to make all the Communications to your Excellency that appeared to me important for your Information or the satisfaction of the Legislature. I have not been favoured with any public Advices from Carolina since the Letter alluded to. Am sorry to inform your Excelly. that I was deceived in the sanguine Expectations I had formed of the speedy assembling of the Committee of the states at Philadelphia owing to the Inattention of the Eastern States or their delegates to that Object. I fear this Invisible State of our Government will not redound much to our Credit with Foreigners. They will I fear impute it to other Causes than the private Business of the Members of the Committee & draw Conclusions unfavourable to our Interests & highly disadvantageous to the Confederacy, of the stability & Firmness of which this Measure will create great doubts. I wish I cou'd at this Time assure your Excellency of the success of our Indian Negociations. We know Nothing authentically indeed of the Proceedings of the Commissioners, but Report here says that little more was hoped to be concluded than a Cessation of Hostilities for one Year. Our Commissioners were detained so late from proceeding on the Business from a want of Money, Troops & the other necessary supplies that the Indians had generally returned home after their Negociations with the Commissioners from the State of New York. What the Nature of these were will be discovered on the Meeting of Congress--at present they appear to me to militate directly with the Articles of Confederation. Tho' the People in Power in their state strenuously deny that any violation of the federal Compact has taken place, Time & a report from the Commissioners for the United States must decide that Question. OCTOBER 25, 1784  I am just returning to Philadelphia from a Tour to the Eastward as far as Portsmouth in New Hampshire. Mr. Bull did me the Favour to remain on the spot ready to have taken a Seat in the Committee of the states for So. Carolina, if that Body cou'd have been assembled. Mr. Laurens also continued in that Neighbourhood, but conceived he cou'd not act as a Member of the Committee until he had presented himself & made a Report to Congress of his late Mission. Mr. Pinckney is just arrived from Newport in Rhode Island. His Health is greatly mended & he proposes being at Trenton in Time to take his seat on the 30th Inst. I am a Stranger to the Contents of any public Dispatches that may have arrived since the unfortunate dispersion of the Committee of the States, but I dare say Mr Bull will have kept your Excellency fully informed of every thing material from abroad.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Oct 26. 1784 I shall not trouble you at this time with any thoughts on our southern boundary or the views and disposition of our southern Neighbours, as I imagine Mr. Madison whose letter I enclose has written fully on that subject;(1) but it is possible he may not have known what I am told is a fact that the Sp. are strongly fortifying at the Natches. I am informed by some of our Merchants trading to Lisbon, that it is a custom or law of the place, when flour is admitted to order the cargo into the hands of a public officer who is to retail it out in very small quantities, and that this is destructive to trade & ruinous to the shipper as it consumes time and prevents a speedy return, which is of the utmost consequence to Merchants, especially if their Capitals are but Moderate. In case of a commercial treaty with that nation it will be well to enquire Minutely into this Matter & to have every obstruction removed.

  Sir, Trenton, Oct. 30, 1784. I have the honor to inform your Excellency that I arrived here last night, and can with pleasure add we have the prospect of a representation of the states in a few days. As yet neither of my colleagues have joined me; but I understand Mr. Lee is in Phila, and of course expect him to-day. In a visit I lately made by the North river to the lakes, in the necessity I was under of returning thro' Canada to the States, I was informed of some of the measures adopted by the British Government in that province, which I conceived highly interesting to us; that the commanding officer had received orders to retain the possession of the posts which fell within our lines by the treaty, and which shod have been evacuated sometime since, and that many of the vessels on the lakes, laid aside under the provisional treaty for a peace establishment were again put in commission. This information I had from authority so respectable as to gain my entire assent, which further added that this procedure was founded on the conduct of the States of New York and Virginia, which they accuse of having violated the treaty. From every information I could obtain I have reason to believe that the temper of that court is very unfriendly to us and that they require only the most flimsy pretext to create a rupture; their councils are, it is true, in a divided state, but, in the talents and superior popularity of Mr. Pitt, this may not long be the case. I have thought it my duty to give to yr Excellency this information and have the honor to be with great respect and esteem, Your most humble servant, Jas. Monroe.

 NOVEMBER 1, 1784  Dear Sir Trenton Novr. 1. 1784. Two days since I arriv'd here after performing a tour up the north river by fort Stanwix, down the wood-creek, thro' the Onida, Ontario, & (by the Niagara falls) part of lake Erie, thence back by Niagara thro the Ontario by Carlton Island thro the St. Lawrence to Montreal & from Montreal over lake Champlain by Albany to N. York again. You find I have taken a rout different from the one I intended, as my object was to take in my view the practicability also of a communication from lake Erie down the Potowmack. But from this I was dissuaded by an accident wh. happen'd to some of the party, upon lake Erie, with whom I came from fort Stanwix to Niagara. I had seperated from them by accident three days before the event. They landed near some Indian huts (a Mr. Teller from Schenactady with four men in a batteaux) & were fir'd on by those Indians, Mr. Teller & two men kill'd, & a 4th wounded; the latter, with the 5th made their escape. The Indian chiefs highly reprehended the act & were at the earnest instigation of the gentlemen of the Brith. garrison, endeavoring to detect & bring the villains to justice. Upon advice of this disaster Colo. Depeister,(1) commanding at Niagara, sent an Express to me just entering upon lake Erie advising my return, with wh. I complied & took the above rout to this place. My excursion hath been attended with great personal exposure & hardship & much greater expence than I had expected. It hath however I hope been advantageous to me in some respects. I have ascertaind I believe with some accuracy the different degrees of difficulty from Michelemackinac down the grand river to Montreal, thro the lakes to Montreal and by the north river. {The preference is at least 20 percent in favor of the north river}.(2) The first leasure time I have I will take the rout of fort Pitt to lake Erie & form some estimate in that direction. {Canada, I find from individuals, [thirty] miles below Cataraqui to Montreal much richer than I had expected, although} I am of opinion Ld. Shiffield's expectations are visionary in his calculation that it will supply the Islands with flower & lumber.(3) {Still I think it has great resources, in those articles but the best timber} is high up the river, wh. together with the difficulty of geting it down the rapids & thro' the gulph of the St. Lawrence to the west Indies must make it an expensive trade to them, more expensive I am told than that from the Baltic. If I were to estimate the present, or the probable future value of Canada to the Brith. Dominions, consider'd in a commercl. light, {and compare it with expences neces-  saryly incur'd if they keep up a military establishment in supporting it}, I shod. think Britain wod. act a politic part in relinquishing it; {and the not doing it satisfyes me [she] either has or will have other objects. Under the bounds of the U.S. by the late treaty the principal part of the fur trade must leave} it & run in some channel within the {U.S. The merchants established, or connected in it, the batteaux men and other dependants will take the same course}. This will increase the expence of {their government in supplying their upper posts in Canada, as the price of hands will be higher and the means scarcer. In addition to these difficulties which nature has thrown in her way others will exist under their government to which ours will be a stranger at present. No merchant is allowed to build vessels on the lakes but must} if he takes that course, avail himself {of those of government and this exposes them to constant and most oppressive impositions. Their peltries are subject to duties and preference passes from lake Superior to Montreal; the duties} may be taken {off but the preference passes can not be prevented; while their restraints on their trade are high it will be our policy} to increase them in every instance wherein {they depend on us; while we give those within our bounds great indulgences we must prohibit under high penalties all commerce between the U.S. and Canada; prohibit their landing or storing their goods on our side under at least thirty percent} ad valorem at the place where landed. {Canada I consider as standing upon different ground in regard to us from any other part of the british dominions; a free inter-course between us and the people of Canada} can, in my opinion, only be advantageous to them & will defeat any political arrangement we can adopt respecting them. {By prohibiting them the participation of the} advantages which {we} possess, {we occasion them great difficulty. Their merchants might get their goods much cheaper up the North river than the St. Lawrence and until we permit them} to navigate on {our shore} from the commencement of {the Ontario they are deprived of the possibility of} navigating {it except in} vessels of considerable burden. {If they take the North-west in batteaux they must go round the lake seventy miles above Niagara}, & down the other side before they reach it, for the passage is impracticable there. I submit to you these observations that you may judge what weight they shod. have {in forming a treaty of commerce. The English ministry will I am satisfied readily agree it shall be so framed as to exclude the U.S. from a free intercourse with Canada. Their jealousy will tell them to beware how they admit it lest the sweets of those rights which we enjoy might invite them to us; but the people of Canada will be more sensible of our blessings by the restraints laid on them; they will feel their own misfortunes and envy the blessings to be attained under the protection of the fOEdral arm}. In the mean time the acquisition {of Canada is not an object with us, we} must make valuable what we  have already {acquired} & at the same time take such measures as {to weaken it as a British province}. As yet we have not a representation of the States but expect it in a few days. {This will certainly be a very important and interesting session. In Canada I was informed that the commanding officer had received orders not to evacuate the posts and that many of the vessels laid aside under the provisional treaty} had again been put in commission {on the lakes}, a measure sd. to be founded {upon the supposed violation of the treaty by New York and Virginia}. The latter in {not repealing the laws prohibiting the recovery of British} [debts] & the former in {confiscations}. But if their conduct is unauthoriz'd, {is this the way to obtain redress. I trust that the conduct of Congress upon this occasion will be firm though temperate, but indeed we are in a poor condition for war. We may lose much but can gain nothing. The minister of finance has arrived here to present his commission to Congress. Those lately appointed in his stead are too diffident}, I am told, of {themselves to} succeed {him. Two}, I hear, have {resigned; the situation is difficult but the road for Congress to take up appears to me a plain one; an arrangement superseding his office} hath taken place. He must bid us {farewell. If those already} appointed {can not serve, others} must be appointed {in their stead.(4) Our Indian commissioners have quarrel'd with the State [of] New York; the State also held a treaty with the Indians which preceded ours; to this they took exception. The affair will, however, easily be accomodated. The delegations are generally the same. Williamson is here} but it is said that {Spaight will dispute his right to sit. Pinkny} in the stead of {Beresford; Georgia has a Houston and Gibons here; the former has been to Europe to leave behind him what little wit} he had, and the latter I believe never had any, or very little. {He is however a married man} & I hear well intention'd. The court of Pensyla. sentenc'd the man who made the attack on Mr. Marbois to pay the fine of 200 dolrs. & to suffer two year's imprisonment.(5) {With this he is dissatisfied. Will the court of France be so}. I shall write you very fully so soon as we have a Congress & by every packet & private opportunity & beg of you to do the same. I have not heard from you since you left Phila.; perhaps your letters to me are in Virga. if you have wrote. I reach'd New York 10 days after Mr. Short left it. I wish'd to have seen him.

  Dear Sir(1) Trenton Novr. 2nd 1784 The Pamphlet(2) you was so good as send by Mr. Lawrence with the Packet of Papers came safe to Hand. Mr Lawrence is now here with us. I am much obliged to you for the Pamphlet from which I recd much useful Information. Once as you know I thought it worth while to sign a Paper for the Inspection of the British Parliamt and Ministry in hopes of correcting their Conduct by unanswerable Proofs that they were in pursuit of bad measures.(3) Was argument of any use? no certainly, unless to make them desperate the sooner. For many Years I have laid it down as indisputable that the Br. Nation is not to be convinced except by the Argumentum a necessitate. Uniform and consistent nation, where individuals are generally persuaded & yield to the Argumentum ad Crumenam & the People at large to the Argumentum plumbeum.(4) A late Report of the Council (5) is in proof that Arguments which I thought unanswerable have made no Impression. If we do not find some means of putting a stopper on the present demand for British goods in this Country I am greatly mistaken. In truth I am not grieved at the present Madness of your Rulers, it was needed and will be of use for our Instruction in mercantile & political Wisdom. I had been in North Carolina 3 months during the adjournmt of Congress and arrived at Philada. from that state seven days ago where I found your Letter of the 6th Augt. Had it come to hand before I left Home I should certainly have visited your Farm, At present I can form no Estimate of its Value because the Lands adjoining the great dismal are very unequal, some of them being very good and others thin and sandy. I shall write however to a friend in that neighbourhood for a correct History of the Tract You have described. There are two Companies to whom the whole of the great Dismal belongs, including the Lake. The boundary line passes through that great Desart. Genl Washington and nine other Gentlemen have taken up the Part that is in NOVEMBER 2, 1784  Virginia, about 100 Thousd Acres. Another Company, of which I am one, hold all that part of the Dismal which is within N Carolina, about 50 Thousd As. I consider our Part as by far the most valuable acre for acre on Accot of the vast Cyprus forests it includes. This is the Timber generally call'd Cedar of which Shingles are made. We now have a Party of men employ'd in that manufacture. In Mitchels Map or the American Atlas I forget which you will find a tolerable Draught of that sunken Tract calld the Dismal. In all parts that we have try'd there are 21/2 feet to 3 feet deep of black soil, under which there is a stiff blue Clay. After the Timber is removed, such land cannot be exhausted by Agriculture. From the Head of Pasquetank River which is within the Lands of our Company into Drummonds Lake the distance is about 5 miles. The water is at least 4 feet deep & without any falls to the Place calld the Head of that River. From Drummonds Lake the Distance is hardly two miles to the deep & stagnant water of Tucker's Mill dam. The Tide water, in the West Branch of Elizabeth River, on which Norfolk stands, rises to the very back of Tuckers mill dam; from this you may calculate the necessary length of a Canal to pass large Boats from our Rivers to those of Virga. to carry off our Lumber and to carry off our redundant waters so as to drain our low ground. Genl Washington, who has view'd the Lake and the Virginia Tract carefully assures me that a Canal 4 feet deep may convey Boats of sufficient Magnitude from the Lake to any of the contiguous Rivers. The Virginia Company seem desirous of beginning the Canal immediately & our Company are equally desirous to forward a work that must treble the Value of that Estate, but as they seem to have considerably overrated my Judgement on subjects of this kind they have signifyed to me that they wish for my assistance in putting that Business in a Train. On the next summer I expect that some thing will be done. If your Enquiries arose from any desire to purchase into the Virga. Company I think such purchase would be impracticable. Several Gentlemen have told me that they had attempted in vain. There is a kind of agreemt. among them that if one sells the others shall have the refusal. I was told about 4 weeks ago that a Gentleman who owns 1000 As. in our Company is willing to sell that, and that he was willing to take three quarters of a Dlr per Acre. How long he may retain that mind I cannot guess. During the late war the Virga land office continued open for the sale of Land at a given Price, when the mony was greatly depretiated. People took out Warrants for vast Quantities of Land (for the real Price was a perfect Trifle, whatever the nominal one might be). The custom was to issue a Warrant for so much Land to be taken up where you could find it on the East side of the Ohio. I believe the good Lands are universally taken up & there are still as many Warrants unsatisfy'd as would cover all the Rocks & Mountains, which are many, Three Times over. There may chance to be among the skirts of the mountains some little Plains of 2 or 300 As. hitherto unexplored; But  there are so many woods men constantly employ'd in searching for Land for their own Use, that an adventurer who cannot personally attend to the Work will hardly be a gainer though he gives but a shilling the Hundred for those Locations. I have purchased some Lands in the Western Part of our state, but the greater Part of what I hold I have recd in Payment for advances I had made to the state during the War. I have also recd a few thousands, as an Officer. From your remark that Lands may be so far back as to be of little value I observe that you presume antient Prejudices without considering that we have in some measure a double front. No Nation on Earth will nor can with safety dispute that the Mississipi is open to us. And you know that Vessels may come in 8 or 10 feet water up to the falls of Ohio and several Hundred miles up the Cherokee River. It appears by Experience that the Climate on the West side of the Appellachian Mountains is more stable & more hea[l]thy than on the East Side and the soil in general much more fertile and of a kind that must be infinitely more durable. There are large bodies of People from all the states migrating across the mountains, I verily believe that such migrations will nearly keep Pace with our increase by birth. To the advantages mentioned they add another of some weight, that though the sea Coast Inhabitants may by their Commercial Intercourse be involved in foreign Disputes and subject to naval Insults they over the mountains shall live in safety, being procul a fulmine.(6) Lands in the state of Georgia are burthened when sold by conditions of settlement; in So. Carolina there are hardly any vacant Lands, In North Carolina and Virginia no Conditions of cultivation are appended to the sale. We have been selling Lands in discharge of Debts that we owed to the Army or other Citizens and not from any desire of forming Colonies or sending our Citizens to a distance. When the Lands are once paid for, 'tis indifferent to us who occupies them, provided they are occupy'd by friends & associates or by perfect neutrals such as the present Quadruped Inhabitants. But the western Country will in fact be settled much faster than many of our Citizens wish, for People on 'tother side of the mountain will not assist in paying Taxes half so well as the same People would have done on this side. A Gentleman a Citizen of Philada who has just returned from visiting the Caintuckey settlemt. which is on the Ohio in Virginia some hundd. miles below fort Pitt assures me that the present Inhabitants are at least 40 Thousand. There is a County in N Carolina on t'other side of the Appellachian mountains calld Davidson County in memory of Genl Davidson one of my mother's Brothers who fell on the Bank of Catawba in defence of his Country; I am told that many Thousand Inhabitants have been added to that County in the Course of the last summer. I have some Lands In Davidson County which I am ready to sell on Terms that must be extremely easy to settlers and may fit mony'd gentlemen equally well. The Lands are ready to be delivered  perfectly clear with surveys and Deeds; I believe them to be of the very best Quality; because the man who took them up is very well acquainted with the back Country. He is a man of good Character, he was at liberty to fix on what spots he pleased out of 15 millions of Acres, and for his Trouble he draws a certain share of all the Lands that are survey'd, which share he is to get by Lott. If he has taken up any bad Pieces he must have been very indiscreet; his own Interest was at stake. I have paid in the first Instance for those Lands 25 Dlrs per hundd As. partly in Discount & partly in Cash, this is counted as hard mony; I then paid 25 per Ct of the whole for the Expence of looking them out, surveying them & taking out the Deeds. Whence the remaining Lands cost me just 33 1/3 Dlrs per hundd. As. In this computation I have no reference to what was given me. My Lands are situated in different Tracts on the great River that in some of the Maps is calld the Cherokee River and on the Tenessee River which is only the same River by another Name towards its head. If you know any Person who wishes to adventure a little in landed Property of this sort or who wishes to bring out a Colony to form a settlement, I will sell him Ten or fifteen Thousand Acres either in one body or in separate Tracts at 40 Dlrs per hundd As. There was a large Tract of 40 or 50 miles square laid off in that County and reserved for the Use of the Continental Line of our state. I have about 5000 As. in that Tract which I do not consider as better than the other Lands, But I know that an Officer lately, Genl Green, refused 20 Thousand Dlrs in silver for 20 Thousand As. that he holds within the same Tract, hence I am induced to believe that the Price at which I offer the Land is very cheap. As I don't know any difference in the Lands, the buyer may chuse by saying at once whether he will take the Lands next the Head of the River, next its mouth, or near the middle; or he may number the Deeds and draw his Quantity. Our state having offered to give up all its remaining vacant Lands to Congress, there are no more Lands to be taken up at present in that state. I have told you how the Case is in Virga, Georgia and So Carolina. I greatly wish to see you and Mrs Ruston in America Though I hardly promise myself the Pleasure of living in your Neighbourhood. It is at least questionable whether the southern Climates would prove healthy to Mrs Ruston & the Children. In a Country perfectly new & strange the Society at least of a large Town would be desirable to a Lady much used to living in the World or among Company. I presume that a Life of absolute inactivity is not your Object. You will still amuse yourself by taking a slice at Physic. In any of our large Towns you may be sure at least to greese the wheels of your Carriage by it. Boston, New Port, New York or Philada preserve a high degree of Health and much social intercourse with the World. Baltimore full as thriving a Place and as social Inhabitants, perhaps not quite as healthy. In this   Town I think 500 Houses have been built on this Year. Norfolk at present a heap of Ruines will soon be a great Town. At present it is very unpleasing for a Lady to be where nothing but the noise of Hammers salute the Ears and bare brick walls are presented to the Eyes. The Harbour abounds in shipping and the Warehouses are full. Perhaps you may ask whether in fact I prefer a Country which is generally considered unhealthy and which but thinly setled & having none but small Towns does not afford as much society as People in general desire! You must observe that the Climate of N.C. has proved to me among the most healthy I ever experienced, in that state too I have very numerous relations who have deserved well of the public. And having suffered much in Arms in that particular state I have acquired an affection strong as instinct in its favour. Let me add that the state has treated me with particular and pointed marks of Respect. I have twice recd the Thanks of the Genl. Assembly for my Services and have recd other and more substantial marks of their Regard. Such a State, in which I do not think that I have an Enemy, you may readily suppose has more Charms to me than it might have for a stranger. As to the Article of Health I believe Chas Town to be nearly as healthy a Place as there is on this Continent. For a man at Mr Fishers Time of Life I should suppose it preferable to any Part of England. However it will not for two or three Years be a place for families to remove to, because since the Conflagration and since the Peace tis difficult even to get the Corner of a House. In all our Towns House Rent is very high, for during the War the Inhabitants of the Country in Spite of the Land increased in number but the buildings in the Towns in general decreased by fire or other accident. For Example the old House of Dr Thos Bond, the new House at the Corner not included, now lets for £200 per Ann. Some Houses in Chesnut Street near the State House 3 stories high & 20 or 30 feet long let for 700 to 1000 Dlrs per Annum. If a man could engage on good Terms and bring over with him a few bricklayers and Carpenters he might soon erect a Property of great Value. I shall write you as soon as I hear from Virga concerning your Lands there, in the meanwhile I believe I have given you no reason to think that I am weary of your long Letter unless you suspect that I have been taking revenge by writing twice as much. Give my Compliments to Mr Fisher and to my very good & much esteemed friend Mr Ruston & believe me to be with the utmost Regard Dr Sr, Your obedt servt, Hu Williamson ""

  Dear Sir Trenton Novr. 12. [17]84. Altho' I shoud have blush'd to have met you, after having so long delay'd repaying the money, you kindly advanc'd me,(1) yet the sincere pleasure I felt in the expectation of again taking you by the hand effaced every other impression & my dissapointment was real when I learn'd that you had return'd to the South without my meeting you. After you left me in Congress---;I was subjected to the inconvenience---;I may indeed say misfortune---;of committing money to the care of four different friends, whose necessities were so urgent as to make them forget mine. This added to my expences in attending an itenerant Congress, surpassing infinitely the appointment from the State, has given a very unfavorable complexion to my conduct to you. At this moment I am unable to restore the whole of the money you loan'd me & the mode I have taken of remitting you 400 Dollars (whilst I hope it will answer perfectly your purpose) discovers my inability to adopt any other. You will be so good as to shew the enclos'd order to the Treasurer & consult with him. Inform him that I only desire the money to be paid you, at the time I might draw it myself, consistently with the Law of the State. Therefore if the forms of the Office require delay untill a quarter's salary has accumulated---;notwithstand- NOVEMBER 12, 1784  ing this specific sum will be soon due---;I woud be oblig'd to you so to arrange the payment, as to comply with what is requir'd by him. As soon as my Crops can be converted into cash I will be punctual to pay the sum I shall still owe you. Twelve days have expir'd since the time affix'd for the Reassembling of Congress, & as yet but four states are represented---;Doctor Holten alone, has appear'd from the Eastern States. This total relaxation & innatention to the ConfOEderal Government (not to speak of the cause, but the effect) must necessarily have an exceeding evil tendency both at home & abroad. The judicious Men who have lately return'd from Europe, all agree, that the prevalent opinion there is---;that we are verging fast towards anarchy & confusion---;& some of them say, they were frequently asked by men otherwise well informed, whether we had any thing like Government yet remaining among us---; & in this opinion they all join, that nothing is so ardently desir'd by the British nation & ministry, as a renewal of the War with us---;that the same old leven that work'd to such effect in 72 was still strongly fermenting at the British Court. Colo. Monroe has lately arriv'd from Canada & our North Western Frontier. He says that every thing wears the most unfavorable appearance in that Quarter---;the retention of the Posts---;intrigues with the Indians, & in fine every measure in that Government, indicates a settled plan, unfriendly, if not hostile to the United States. From all this I am led to apprehend that if the war, which seems ready to burst forth in Europe, shoud break out, & France becomes involv'd therein (which her late engagements with the Dutch Republic render inevitable), that Great Britain woud keep her neck out of the halter, purposely to deal with us. The lightest visions of imagination, appear as solid ground of apprehension to a suspicious mind---;but really suspicion becomes a virtue in a political Character where there is a consciousness of internal Weakness & total want of resource. In my judgement there never was a crisis, Threatning an event more unfavorable to the happiness of the United States, than the present. Those repellent qualities the seeds of which are abundantly sown in the discordant manners & sentiments of the different States have produc'd great heats & animosities in Congress now no longer under the restraint impos'd by the war---;insomuch that I almost despair of seeing that body unite in those decisive, & energetic measures, requisite for the public safety & prosperity. The scanty & irregular Supply of Money to the Continental Treasury, from the feeble & disconnected efforts, of the different States, have dwindled into nothing. Several States have not yet taken up the requisitions for 84. Some after taking them up, declare they do not understand 'em, & they all conclude in just the same point---;that is they pay nothing. M. Morriss tells me that the Contributions of Virginia have alone kept the wheels of Govern- NOVEMBER 14, 1784  ment in motion. Now notwithstanding it is much to be regretted, we must withhold too, or pay with a cautious hand---;for why ruin ourselves to postpone a misfortune that must come at last, & perhaps the sooner the better. We pay greater Taxes than any people under the Sun & if neighbouring States will pay nothing---;the effect must be the depopulation of our Country. This evil has already made a progress of fearful extent. I can discover no resource for Congress but to adhere strictly to the plan Recommended in April 82 & to call on those States who have pass'd the Impost to carry it immediately in execution. The refusal of Rhode Island does not change the principle on which they agreed to it, or render the measure less necessary. I believe no other plan, short of divine wisdom, & not protected by the providence of God, woud meet the unanimous concurrence of these States---;& at all events the necessary delay woud be fatal to our situation---;for an Years interest will be soon due in Europe & all the interest here, without a Shilling to pay. If ultimately R. I. cannot by a demand of the principal due from her & some other certain mode be induced to consent to the only alternative of Public Justice---;that of providing funds for the interest---;if other States shoud fail to carry the Law into effect---;the Willing States may recant before any great injury can arise. Such are my reflections, I wish I coud see others as sober & as serious as the occasion merits---;but I am sorry to say that, always more anxious about where we shall sit, than what we shall do---;our chief dispute now is whether we shall spend the Winter in Philadelphia or N. York. The advocates for Philadelphia are more numerous & more zealous, so that I suppose we shall revisit the State House. Wherever we go & whatever we do I shall remain yours with great esteem & sincere friendship, John F. Mercer [P.S.] I beg of you to remember me very particulary to Mr. Jones. ""

  Dear Sir Trenton Novr. 15. 1784 You recd. I hope by the last post a small cypher from me.(1) At fort Stanwix you were necessarily acquainted with the {variance}(2) which had taken place between the {Indian comrs. of U. States}, & those {of N. York} as well as of the principles upon which they respectively acted & the extent to which they carried them.(3) As I reach'd {N. York} about eight days after you had left it & {the Indian comrs} were then on the ground & have not since made a stat'ment of their final transactions there. I have nothing new to give you upon that head. The questions wh. appear to me to arise upon the subjects {of variance} are 1. whether these {Indians} are to be consider'd as members of the state of {N. York}; or whether the living simply within the bounds of a State, in the exclusion only of an European power, while they acknowledge no obedience to its laws but hold a country over which they do not extend, nor enjoy the protection nor any of the rights of citizenship within it, is a situation wh. will even in the most qualified sense, admit their being held as members of a State? 2. whether on the other hand this is not a description of those whose manag'ment is committed by the confideration to the U S. in Congress assembled? In either event the land held by these {Indians}, having never been ceded either by {N. York} or {Massachusetts} belongs not to the {U. States}; the only point then in wh. {N. York} can be reprehensible is, for preceding by a particular, the general {treaty}. This must be attributed to a suspicion that there exists in {Congress} a design to injure her. The transaction will necessarily come before us, but will it not be most expedient in the present state of our affairs to form no decision thereon? I know no advantages to be deriv'd from one. If the general {treaty} hath been obstructed the injury sustain'd in that instance is now without remedy. A decision either way, will neither restore the time we have lost nor remove the impressions wh. this {variance} hath made with NOVEMBER 15, 1784  the {Indians} & in the {Court of G. Britain} respecting us. If the right {of Congress} hath been contraven'd shall we not derive greater injury by urging it to the reprehension of {N. York} who holds herself aggriev'd in other respects than by suffering our sense of that delinquency to lay dormant? Our purchases must be made without her bounds & those {Indians} whose alliance we see inhabit a country to which she hath no claim. {Mr. Marbois} is dissatisfied with the decision of the {Court of Pennsylvania} in a particular affair.(4) His own conduct in the management of that business previous to the decision, obtain'd the entire approbation of the {King of France} as he is assur'd in a letter from {the minister} of marine, and certainly he conducted it in as high a tone as {the minister} the most jealous of the honor of {the King of France} cod. have done. Since that period he hath not recd. the orders of his {Court} & in the interval hath some difficulty how to act. If {Congress} go to {Phila.} he says he will be precluded from a personal attendance or communication there. I have consider'd this matter more attentively since I saw you & think that in whatever character we hold the man we cannot surrender him to the {Court of France} even if {Pennsylvania} wod. accede to whatever we desir'd. That all they have a right to expect is that he be punish'd agreeably to the laws of {Pennsylvania} & that if they are not adequate, others be made for preventing the like in future, wh. might [be] effected by a recommendation from {Congress}. The variance wh. took place between the members of the {committee of the States} wh. terminated in their abrupt dissolution, by a secession on the part of some members, is also an affair which may come before us. But had we not also better keep this affair out of sight & while we lament they could not in that instance be calm & temperate, prevail on them if possible to be so in future? But the more interesting object is the {variance} between us & {Great Britain}. Indeed the former derive their consequence principally from the weight they may have in forming her conduct with respect to us. If they are hostilely dispos'd these circumstances will tend to give them confidence. My letter to {Governor Harrison} gave you what had taken place in {Canada}.(5) I am strongly impress'd with the hostile disposition {of} that {Court} towards us. Not only what I saw, but the information of all the American gentlemen lately from {Great Britain} confirm it, & particularly one of {Maryland}, one of {Pennsylvania}, & {Mr. Laurens} who is now with us. The former two have lately return'd to the continent. We are certainly in no condition for {war} &, while we preserve the honor & dignity of the {U. States}, must earnestly endeavor to prevent it. If they will comply with the conditions of the late {treaty}, as we must on our part do whatever it enjoins, our situation is as happy as we cod. expect it. The sooner we are ascertain'd upon this point the better it will be for us. We must suppose they will comply with the {treaty} & surrender the {western posts} & it is therefore  our business to make provision for taking possession of them in the Spring. {The minister} whom we may order to that {Court} to obtain an answer upon this head & cultivate its good wishes toward us, will we trust inform us by the Spring that the {western posts} will be given up & the troops whom we may raise for that purpose will of course be applied to the garrisoning of them. Many of the {western posts} I have seen & think 1200, the smallest number we shod. think of. But yet we have no Congress nor is the prospect better than when I wrote you last. All my associates are here except Grayson. I beg of you to write me weekly & give me your opinion upon these & every other subject which you think worthy of attention. A motion will certainly be made as soon as we have a Congress for its removal hence, to wh. shall we give the preference {N. York} or {Philad.}. We know not whom we shall have for {the President of Congress}. The {Deligates} of {So. Carolina} think of {Mr. Laurens}, but if I may venture a conjecture from what I have observ'd, with respect to {Mr. Laurens's} intentions I shod. suppose his object was to attain the appointmt. to the {Court of Great Britain}; the rule heretofore adopted in the election of {the President of Congress} will I think be deviated from,(6) if this shod. be the case it is not improbable {R. H. Lee} may be elected. I have heretofore address'd my letters to Mr. Jones to Richmond but fear from the accounts I have of his health he hath not left home. Is this the case? I am with great respect & esteem Dear Sir yr. fnd. & servt. Jas. Monroe(7) ""

  My dear Sir, Trenton in N.

I thank God that I am now pretty well recovered. Insomuch, that I have been prevailed on, once more to take a seat in Congress; my brothers three years having ended with this federal year. I am much grieved my dear friend, to observe the wonderful lassitude that prevails in public affairs. It is now eighteen days since Congress ought to have assembled here, and as yet we have but five States. It surprises me that these five are all Southern. None but the worthy Dr. Holten from your State being yet arrived from the eastward; whence, formerly we used to derive most punctuality, alacrity, and judicious dispatch of public business. Yet there are many subjects of great importance, that demand the speedy, temperate, wise, and firm discussion of Congress. We have seen here the late report of a Committee of the Privy Council in G. Britain upon the petition of the W. India planters and Merchants, soliciting an open and liberal trade with these United States. In this report, all the illiberal & senseless principles of commerce that are scattered thro Lord Sheffields book, are taken up and recom- NOVEMBER 18, 1784  mended. The report was laid upon the Table of the House of Commons---;But it seems that the Parliament is prorogued without touching the subject of their Commerce with us. So that it remains on the old ground of proclamation, interdicting our Trade with the B. West Indies, but thro the medium of British Vessels. It is not difficult for an attentive and diligent enquirer to discern the old Leaven working in the British councils. The same men still rule in secret, the same measures are wished to be practised upon. Nor does it signify much whether a Pitt or a North comes forward upon the Stage. The Nation too, like a strong, proud, & sullen Man angry from unexpected defeat, and imputing misfortunes to Casualties, would seem not averse to a second trial. I remember when once I detested the moderate character. At this moment I think that moderation, wisdom, firmness, and attention, are the principles proper for our adoption: and highly becoming the dignity of our successful situation. Being always prepared for the worst, the best events will not be unpleasing. It is observable that great hopes are entertained beyond the waters from the expectation of discord, disunion, & apathy on our part. I sincerely wish that they may be disappointed. We understand that Silas Deane & Arnold are in frequent conversation with the British M[iniste]rs---;And it is said that the former composed part of the book adopted by Lord Sheffield. Indeed, the principles of that book are precisely the same with those contained in one of Mr. Deane's intercepted letters in 1781. What kind of conduct are we to expect from G. Britain, when its councils are mixt with gall, and when the acrimony of blasted ambition and avarice is permitted to insinuate itself? I shall be extremely happy to be aided by your counsels during my residence in Congress. Our letters may, in this direct line of post, be secure---;especially as the times are not quite so inquisitive as formerly. I beg that my best respects may be presented to Mrs. Adams, and remember me, if you please, to Gen. Warren, to Mr. Gerry & Mr. Lovell.

  My dear Cousin,(1) Trenton Novr. 19. 1784 This mornings post put into my possession your favor of the 17th instant, and I thank you for it with great sincerity. I am very happy to hear that Mr. Reed is in your delegation,(2) and I should have been much more so, if your worthy father had been there likewise. It greatly NOVEMBER 19, 1784  smooths the rugged paths of politics, to travel them with men of ability, integrity, and candor. We are as remote from having a Congress, as we were 19 days ago(3)---;with the southern delegates at Philadelphia, and those of your State inclusive, we have but Six States and an half represented. But one delegate as yet from the eastward, whence formerly proceeded the most industrious attention to public business. I do not like this lentor, this strange lassitude in those who are appointed to transact public affairs. I am here placed in the house of a Mr. Howe, where I have a good warm bed chamber, and other conveniences to my satisfaction. The streets of the Village in this rainy season, are most disagreeably wet & muddy. How long we shall remain here, it is not in my power to say. Mr. Woolcot, one of the Commissioners for the Indian treaties has come here with a Treaty concluded very satisfactorily with the Six nations.(4) He says that the other two Commissioners are gone to Pittsburg to treat with the Western Indians, and he apprehends that they will accomplish their business on that quarter with facility. I am a good deal distressed about my horses---;if they go to vendue, they will sell for nothing. If they remain unsold, they will eat more than they are worth. At this place I think they would not sell, because here are so many for sale. If they were in Virginia, I should have no doubt of being able to sell the two for 40 or 50 pounds. In this state of things I can devise no mode of proceeding but the following, which by your friendly offices may perhaps be accomplished. My namesake Mr. Lee of the Indian Queen, is a goodnatured, obliging person, and I understand that he has something to say with the Stage that goes to Virginia. But tho this last should not be the case, his interposition with Twinings Stage may obtain what I want; which is, that my horses be received to work their way to Alexandria in Virginia so as not to injure them, but only to travel them reasonable distances at a time and giving them due rest & food---;which will at once ease their Cavalry, and accomplish my purpose of getting my horses to Virginia. At Alexandria they are to be deliverd to Mr. Fendall (with the inclosed letter) who lives about half a mile from the Town and is well known there. If Mr. Lee will undertake the affair for me, I shall certainly succeed, & my horses will not be injured in going back---;Which latter may happen by overdriving---;not properly resting & properly feeding. Will you be so kind as try your talents at negotiation with Mr. Lee? Julius Caesar shewd his ambition as much when he preferd being the first man in a small Village to the second in Rome; as when he grasped the Imperial purple. So evidence may be given in small negotiations of superior fitness for great affairs. I will inclose you a letter for Mr. Fendall to go with the Horses, upon a presumption that your address will be surely successful. I am glad to know that Mr. Quanier promises well, and I expect he will remember that the promises of a Man of honor are sacred.  Present my best love to your Father, Mother, & Sister---;And when you see the Old Gentleman do not forget me with him. I am my dear Cousin your affectionate Uncle and sincere friend, Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Will Mr. Hiltzheimer be so kind as have attention paid to my horses backs while they Stay? They shd. be put to Oats & dry hay 2 or 3 days before they Travel.(5) ""

  Sir Trenton November 20. 1784 I wish it were in my power to give you the satisfaction that I know it would afford you to be informed that Congress was assembled and proceeding well with the public business. Unfortunately, we have not yet a Congress, & altho twenty days are elapsed since the time appointed for its meeting, but 4 States have been convened. No doubt Colo. Monroe has informed his Correspondents of the intelligence he received on his Tour to Montreal, Niagara &c. that one reason assign'd for detaining the western posts from the United States was, because Virginia had not repealed her laws that impede the recovery of British debts. It is sincerely to be lamented that our State should be so charged, and it is much to be wished that the Advocates for retaining those laws wd. no longer insist upon furnishing pretext for detaining from the U.S. possessions of such capital importance to the Union as these posts are.

It was brought here NOVEMBER 20, 1784  by Mr. Wolcott,(1) who informs us that the other two Commissioners were gone to Pittsburg to hold a treaty there with the western nations---;he apprehends (from the content that appeard at fort Stanwix among some Shawanese chiefs) that the commissioners will not find much difficulty in treating with the western Indians. The accounts that we daily receive of the powerful emigrations from our State to Georgia, to North & South Carolina, & from the interior parts to Kentucki, are very alarming. The causes assigned, are two---;the desire of removing from heavy taxes, and the search after land. It certainly becomes our Legislature to consider this point with great attention, and to remove, or lessen the causes that effect the depopulation of the country. Do you not think Sir, that the Taxes might be considerably lessened by funding all our debts, both foreign and domestic---;And then, by imposing such Taxes only as will most punctually pay the interest & sink the principal by very slow degrees and for support of the Civil list? This would satisfy the public creditors, because the certainty of receiving the interest will render the principal vendible on good terms. It seems to me, that by this mode, the tax might be considerably lowerd from its present enormous height. I think that I may venture safely to say, that our Revenue, Certificate, and all other taxes, amount in the aggregate to a heavier taxation than prevails in any part of the world! Upon this circumstance, I find some British writers founding the hope of our depopulation. It surprised me a good deal that our last Assembly did not take up and adopt, for the ease of our fellow Citizens, the Facilities given by Congress in their Act of the 28th of April last.(2) By this Act (which I understand is before the Assembly) one fourth of the federal demand against us, may be discharged with Certificates of interest for money loaned the U.S. or for interest on liquidated debts of the U. S. If these certificates were by law made receivable in the Revenue tax, it would certainly & considerably facilitate the payment of that Tax. It seems that the parliament of G. Britain was prorogued without any thing being done respecting our Trade with them, altho a Committee of the privy Council, upon the petition of the W. India planters & merchants for a free trade between them & the U. S. had reported an approbation of all the silly, malign commercial restraints upon our trade with their W. India islands, that are to be found in Lord Sheffields book on the Commerce of the two countries.(3) I have the honor to be, with much esteem and regard, Sir your most humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. ENCLOSURE Articles of a Treaty concluded at Fort Stanwix on the 22d day of October 1784 between Oliver Wolcott, Richard Butler, and Arthur Lee Commissioners plenepotentiary from the United States in Congress Assembled on the one part and the Sachems and Warriors of the Six Nations on the other part.  The United States of America give peace to the Senecas, Mohawks, Onondagas, & Cayugas, and receive them into their protection upon the following conditions. Article 1st. Six Hostages shall be immediately delivered to the Commissioners by the said nations, to remain in possession of the United States till all the prisoners, white & black, which were taken by the said Senecas, Mohawks, Onondagas and Cayugas, or by any of them, in the 1ate war, from among the people of the United States, shall be delivered up. Art. 2d. The Oneida and Tuscarora Nations shall be secured in the possession of the Lands on which they are settled. Art. 3d. A line shall be drawn, beginning at the mouth of a creek about four miles east of Niagara called Oyonwayea or Johnsons landing place upon the Lake named by the Indians Oswego, and by us Ontario. From thence Southerly in a direction always four miles east of the Carrying path between Lake Erie and Ontario to the mouth of Tehoseroron or Buffaloe Creek on Lake Erie. Thence South to the north boundary of the State of Pennsylvania. Thence West to the end of the said north boundary. Thence South along the west boundary of the said State to the river Ohio. The said line from the mouth of Oyonwayea to the Ohio shall be the western boundary of the Lands of the Six Nations, so that the Six Nations shall and do yield to the United States all claims to the country west of the said boundary, and then they shall be secured in the peaceful possession of the lands they inhabit East and North of the same, reserving only Six miles square round the fort of Oswego to the United States for the support of the same. Art. 4th. The Commissioners of the United States in consideration of the present circumstances of the Six Nations, and in execution of the humane and liberal views of the United States, upon the signing of the above articles, will order goods to be delivered to the said Six nations for their use and comfort.

  Dear Sir, Trenton in N. Jersey Novr. 20. 1784 I should sooner have done myself the honor of writing to you, if it had been in my power to have communicated any thing agreeable---;But I could only have informed you that we had not, have not, nor can we say when, Members enough will be assembled to make a Congress. As yet we have but four States convened. This lassitude in our public councils must afflict our friends, and encourage the hopes of our Trans-Atlantic foes, who look at us with an evil eye. Mr. Wolcott arrived here yesterday with the Treaty made at Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations, and he informs us that the other two Commissioners have proceeded to Pittsburg to treat with the western Tribes. He thinks (from the satisfaction that appeared among some Shawanese Chiefs who were at Fort Stanwix) that the Commissioners will not find much difficulty in their treaty with the western Indians. I have the honor to inclose you a copy of the Northern treaty, and shall be happy to know your opinion of it.(1) I understand from Mr. Wolcott, that the Commissioners of the United States met many difficulties thrown in their way by N. York, which they overcame at last by firmness and perseverance. It is unfortunate when individual views obstruct general measures, and more especially when a State becomes opposed to the States; because it seems to confirm the predictions of those who wish us not well, and who cherish hopes from a discord that may arise from different interests. Colo. Monroe, of our delegation, who is lately returned from a Tour to Montreal, Niagara, and Lake Erie, informs us that he learnt in his journey, that the western posts were to be detained from us; and that the reason assigned was, because of the conduct of N. York and Virginia. The former for pushing the law of confiscation beyond the terms of peace, and Virginia for not repealing the laws that impede the recovery of British debts. The Governor of N. York told Colo. Monroe, that it was a mistaken charge upon them, for that they had not confiscated since the provisional articles. It is to be lamented that any pretext should be furnished for injuring us in the essential manner that the detention of these posts will do. The Parliament, it seems, is prorogued without touching the subject of their trade with us, altho a committee of the privy Council upon the petition of the West India merchants and planters, had reported an approbation of all the silly, malign principles of Lord Sheffield respecting our trade with the NOVEMBER 20, 1784  B. W. Indies. This book of Lord Sheffields has been ably answerd by several writers in G. Britain. My respects, if you please, to your Lady---;I hope that she has recoverd her health.

  Sir Philadelphia 20th. Novr. 1784. My last Letter was by Captn. Strong of the Ship Philadelphia & dated 31st Octr.(1) in answer to your Excellency's dispatch of the 17th of Septr. last past. When I wrote I entertained the most sanguine hopes that the New Congress wou'd soon have made a House & have proceeded with Alacrity & dispatch on the various & important business now on the Files & ready to be acted on. In this however I have the Mortification to have been mistaken. Three Weeks have elapsed & we have not assembled more than four States, vizt---;Georgia, So. Carolina, Virginia, & New Jersey, with one Member from Massachusetts & one from No. Carolina. Pennsylvania indeed only elected her new Delegation on Tuesday last---;that of the last Year was so near expiring that it was not worth the trouble of a journey to Trenton. We are at a Loss to conjecture what keeps back Maryland,(2) the Delaware State & New York. Further Eastward I believe their General Courts are sitting at this Season & 'tis probable the Members elected may choose to keep their seats thro' the session in Order to come on fully possessed of the sentiments of their respective Legislatures. I have placed their absence in the most favourable point of view---;so great Inattention at this Moment is however very unpleasing. We hope on Monday or Tuesday to have No. Carolina on the Floor,(3) & also think by that time the Pennsylvania Delegation may be ready to attend. If then New York & Delaware shou'd pay any attention to a Circular Letter the States attending at Trenton instructed the secretary to write on the 11th Instant,(4) we may hope to assemble a proper quorum of the states for ordinary Purposes in the Course of the next Week---;but without a full House we cannot touch the important Matters in which the nearest Interests of the Union are involved. NOVEMBER 20, 1784  I have the Pleasure to inform your Excelly. that on Wednesday last Mr. Woolcott one of the Commissioners of the United States for negociating peace with the Indians arrived at Trenton with the Treaty concluded on or about the 24th of October (I am not pointed as to the date) with the Six Nations.(5) Our Commissioners have gained a most advantageous Line of division of Property from those people & have secured effectually all the carrying places to & between the Lakes as well as proper Territory round the Posts that may hereafter be necessary to be fix'd by the united states for protection of the settlements of the Country & the security of the Traders. As all our foreign Advices remain under the seals with which they have come to hand, I cannot speak authentically of any European Transactions. We have heard of the arrival of Mr. Jefferson one of the Commissioners for negociating Commercial Treaties in Europe &c in Paris & that he was well received by the French Court; & the Minister of the United Netherlands in a Conversation yesterday seems to think the differences between the Emperor & their High Mightinesses will be compromised without a War. This Opinion is also confirmed by Monsr. de Marbois Chargé Des Affaires of the Court of France to Congress. It gives me great pain to find Colo. Laurens is under the necessity of leaving the delegation at this time. He is upon the Point of setting out by Land from this place, having left Trenton on Wednesday last.(6) His great abilities & thorough Information in our European Affairs are highly necessary in Congress at the present which I believe is generally admitted to be a most critical Period to the United States especially to the Commercial Interests of the Union.

  Sir. Trenton 21st. November 1784. The last week has given birth to nothing of material Consequence. The Assemblies of most of the states to the Eastward of this being now met, their members have not yet attended, and we are of course without a Congress. When we consider the important Objects which demand the most early Attention of the fOEderal government, & the unfavourable impression which this inattention must produce both here & in Europe I cannot but lament it as a most unfortunate Circumstance. General Woolcot one of the Commissioners whom we appointed for Negociating treaties with the Indians arrived here three days ago. He brought a treaty concluded with the six Nations at fort Stanwix.(1) The Commissioners have guarantied to them all their land within the state of New York except the Posts of Oswego & Ni[a]gara with the carrying place, & four Miles along the lake from Niagara to Buffalo Creek which empties into lake Erie. The six Nations in return have ceded to the united states all their claim westward between lakes Erie & the Ohio. The other two Commissioners are going to fort Pitt for the purpose of holding treaties with the Indians in that quarter. From the advanced season & an aversion which I am told the Indians discover to treating seperately I fear Nothing great will be effected. With great respect, I have the honour to be, Your Excellencies Mo. Obedt. humble servant, S. Hardy ""

Laurens & myself have been waiting the Meeting of Congress until Wednesday, when Colo. Laurens left us for Philadelphia on his return to Charleston, where he expects to arrive by the Middle of the next Month.(2) Mr. Read says he will take his seat for a few Weeks, but that he will certainly return with his Mother & sister (who are at present in Philadelphia) in the course of the next Month, & expects to be in NOVEMBER 23, 1784  time for the Meeting of the Legislature.(3) Mr. Bull & myself will remain & shall be obliged to your Excelly. for all such Communications as you may think necessary to make upon subjects that will probably be agitated in Congress, & in which the Interests of our state may be involved. We are waiting the determination of Congress respecting their either remaining here, or removing to some more convenient place, where the Members may be better accommodated & the dignity of the Union better supported. Several places are mentioned, but wherever we may fix, your Excellency may depend upon hearing from me frequently & fully upon every subject of a public Nature. The great scene of commercial Politics will soon be opened & the Intentions of the British Court developed. The evident design of retaining the Posts on the frontiers contrary to the Treaty---;their restraining commercial Regulations in general & the Report of a Committee of their Privy Council respecting the West India Trade, evince something on their part, very unfriendly to the Interests of this Country. These will be the first topics of discussion after we have fixed a permanent residence, & you will easily perceive we have a sufficient share of business to engage our closest Attention during the Winter. We shall probably make a Congress next week. The New York & Delaware delegates are expected by Sunday, & the Massachusetts' & Connecticut in less time. I have this moment had the Treaty concluded between our Commissioners & the six Indian Nations put into my hands---;it is the most concise & comprehensive thing of the kind I ever saw. Notwithstanding the many Attempts from some of the neighbouring states to obstruct it, the influence of the British emissaries & the neighbourhood of their posts, the Commissioners have formed a treaty infinitely more advantageous than could have been expected. They have recovered all our prisoners, established a protection to the frontier inhabitants, & obtained the Cession of a very rich & extensive territory.

  Dear Sir, Trenton November 26. 1784 I received your agreeable letter the day after mine of the 28th instant had been dispatched.(1) I thank you Sir for the very particular and satisfactory information that you have favord me with. It is certainly comfortable to know that the Legislature of our country is engaged in beneficial pursuits---;for I conceive that the Gen. Assessment, and a wise digest of our militia laws are very important concerns: the one to secure our peace, and the other our morals. Refiners may weave as fine a web of reason as they please, but the experience of all times shews Religion to be the guardian of morals---;And he must be a very inattentive observer in our Country, who does not see that avarice is accomplishing the destruction of religion, for want of a legal obligation to contribute something to its support. The declaration of Rights, it seems to me, rather contends against forcing modes of faith and forms of worship, than against compelling contribution for the support of religion in general. I fully agree with the presbyterians, that true freedom embraces the Mahomitan and the Gentoo as well as the Xn religion. And upon this liberal ground I hope our Assembly will conduct themselves. I believe there is no doubt but that the population of our country depends eminently upon our Revenue laws, they therefore, demand intense consideration. It is natural for men to fly from oppression to ease, and whilst our taxes are extremely heavy, and North Carolina & Georgia pay little or no tax, it is not to be wonderd that so many of our people flock to these States & unfortunately they are carrying to Georgia & South Carolina the Cultivation of Tobacco. I do not mean by this, that we should suffer ill example to prevent us from honorably and punctually paying our debts. But I think that we may fairly practise here, as other Nations the most honest do---;I mean, exactly to pay the interest, and slowly to sink the principal. An attempt to do the latter too suddenly, will ruin, by depopulating, the country. The only mode appears to be, a funding of the whole debt, so as certainly to pay the interest, and slowly the principal. Cannot a sinking fund be brought to bear upon the latter, by throwing all overflowings of taxes into a Reservoir for gathering interest upon interest? I suppose that at all events, the facilities offerd by Congress in their Act of the 28th of April last will be among the amendments to the Revenue law this Session. The people have certainly sufferd much hitherto by not knowing in season what taxes are lawfully demandable from them. For want of NOVEMBER 26, 1784  this information, numbers are compelled to submit to the extortion and abuses of Collectors. The Treasurer used formerly to publish annually in the papers what were to be the Taxes of the year, and this practise was then very useful. But at present, the dispersion of newspapers is so uncertain, that information thro that channel would reach but few. A Statement from the Treasury printed in the way of Handbills, to be put up at the Court Houses & churches, might perhaps furnish the requisite information, & save the people from extensive abuse. I am very happy to know, for the honor of our country, that there is a probability of the impeding laws being again taken under deliberation. What I wrote to you in my last upon this subject, is a most serious consideration, and the inclosed paragraphs, taken from a late paper, will shew you how quickly the fame of our proceedings travels, and the effect likely to be produced upon our Commerce! By the 5th article of the Confederation, the annual meeting of Congress is to be on the first Monday in November, and by our Act establishing one yearly meeting of the Assembly on the third Monday in October; you will see Sir, that there is very little probability of Virginia being represented in Congress for some time after its federal day of meeting. So that it becomes necessary to consider this matter. I suppose that either the Assemblies time of meeting must be altered, or the Delegates for the ensuing federal year be chosen this present Session.(2) We have not yet made a Congress but we have some reason to expect eight States on Monday next. I understand that Spain means to insist upon the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi, which will render the exploring our western waters of the greater importance. I am dear Sir, with great esteem and regard Your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee P.S. If the election of Counsellors is not over, may I be permitted to suggest what I realy believe will improve and fortify the counsels of that Board. It is, that Major Gen. Gates be appointed a Member of it. He has a pretty good estate in Berkeley, is a single Man & therefore not withheld from due attendance by domestic considerations. But above all, he is a Man of great worth, solid judgement, and sound attachments to America. A propos---;It is by many here suggested as a very necessary Step for Congress to take---;The calling upon the States to form a Convention for the Sole purpose of revising the Confederation so far as to enable Congress to execute with more energy, effect, & vigor the powers assigned it, than it appears by experience that they can do under the present state of things. It has been observed, why do not Congress recommend the necessary alterations to the States as is proposed in the Confederation? The friends to Convention answer---;It has been already done in some instances, but in vain. It is proposed to let Congress go on in the mean time as usual. I shall be glad of your opinion on this point, it being a very important one. R. H. Lee NOVEMBER 26, 1783  ""

  Dear Sir Trenton Novr 26th. [17]84. The Gentlemen from the Eastward have at length made their appearance & I expect in a day or two a Congress will be once more form'd. This commencement however has discovered so great a relaxation in the ConfOEderal springs that I doubt the machine will not be long kept in motion, unless great & effectual repairs are made. For my part I have no hopes but in a convocation of the States. In this measure I yet see safety, it is the disposition of the people of America to place their ConfOEderal Government on the most respectable basis---;& the patriot fire is not yet extinguish'd---;but I do not know how long it will last---;there will be a motion made early in the ensuing Congress for such a Convention. I woud suggest to you a subject on which I find my Colleagues & myself concurr & indeed which we have determin'd to mention to our friends in the Legislature. The recess of Congress the last year, was the first I believe since the Revolution & the situation of the members consequently new & unexpected both by themselves & the State. I must confess that I consider the with drawing the allowance during that period, as unworthy the dignity of the Government & as it is injurious to her representatives, it will in the end prove detrimental to her interest.(1) When Gentlemen quit home & their domestic employments---;& are carried to a considerable distance from their own State---;it cannot be expected that their presence for a Small interval, will be of any service to their private affairs---;in fact they are by their appointments disengaged thoroughly from all pursuits but their public avocations & their style of expence cannot be temporarily suppress'd or altered for the time of this recess.(2) I am therefore not only interestedly but politically of opinion that it woud be the wisest & most honourable conduct for the Legislature to pay us during the re NOVEMBER 26, 1784  cess altogether. So. Carolina, make an allowance by the year, nearly equal to the extent of our appointment on the supposition we charg'd for every day, & yet their Members complain of the inadequacy of the provision. Mr. Hardy & Colo. Monroe tell me they have suggested this matter to their friends. If they shoud view in the light I do the subject will be probably agitated. I know you have been so long subjected to the inconveniences of bad & insufficient pay, that I can add nothing your own reflections will not readily furnish.

The posts are certainly not evacuated & in addition to this I was appriz'd in Canada, in a trip I took, during the recess of Congress, that the commanding officer had recd. orders to hold them, in consequence of wh. he had put the vessels in commission wh. had been laid aside under the provisional treaty, upon the lakes Erie, Ontario & Champlain. I was at Ft. Erie, Niagara, & the posts on the St. Lawrence as far as Montreal & saw no step wh. argued a disposition to evacuate the posts within our bounds, but if a contrary disposition existed in the Ct. of London I am more fully impress'd with the necessity, from the view I have had of that country of keeping posts on the lakes; upon that alone will the direction of the NOVEMBER 29, 1784  conduct of the Indians & the fur trade depend. We have it in our power to avail ourselves of those advantages if we will not shut our eyes agnst. measures, wh. point their own necessity; but if we loose the present moment we shall not only loose them ourselves but add them to the resources of the Brith. Province of Canada. Upon the Missisippi, our attention is call'd by the conduct of Spn., she is stimulat-ing the Indians agnst. us & will I hear deny us the right of navigation. Our situation, in every view, requires the wisest arrangement of our affairs in every department, and it will be particularly incumbent on us to have those of yr. department well attended to. It will be, for yet we have but six states, among the first objects of Congress. I cannot determine what course Congress will pursue, but my own opinion is, yr. presence shod. be immediately requir'd here. Nor can I say in what light you are at present consider'd, but I shod. suppose certainly in command, or rather, in the service of the States;(2) of this you may rest assur'd that the last Congress, & I am well satisfied this will do the same, entertain'd an high sense of your merit & services & will be happy to give you the most honorable testimonials of it.

Nine States were present yesterday in Congress;(1) the States of New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York and Maryland are not yet represented; there is however one Delegate present from each of said States, except the latter.

  Sir, Trenton 5th December 1784. The instructions from the legislature of Virginia to their Delegates in Congress came to hand by the last Post.(1) The Objects to which they point are interesting indeed, to the peace & prosperity of the Union in general, but more paticularly so to the southern states. The part directing the formation of treaties with the Indians had been anticipated by a report of a Committee which had been previously brought forward on that Subject.(2) It stands the Order of the day for tomorrow, & I hope to have the pleasure of informing your Excellency by the next Post that the views of the General Assembly of Virginia relative to treaties with the southern Indians have been fully complied with. The part touching the Navigation of the river Missisipi is referred to a Committee who had been appointed before our instructions came to hand, to take under Consideration a letter from Mr De Marbois who ushered in a kind of remonstrance on that Subject from a Mr Rendon, who is said to be invested with some public appointment from the Court of Madrid, but who as yet has produced no Credentials.(3) This is an important subject, & may involve in it Consequences very important to the Union. By the treaty of Paris in 1763 it was stipulated that both Great Britain & Spain should have the free use of the Navigation of the Missisippi from its source to the Atlantic Ocean---;And G. Britain having ceded her right under the last treaty of peace, to the United states, we surely stand on the ground on which she stood, & are entitled to every right which she possessed. The refusal of Spain to admit us to participate of the Navigation, & the threat she has held out to confiscate the Vessels of our Citizens, I view as a National Out- DECEMBER 5, 1784  rage; which independent of Commercial Considerations, should not be passed over unnoticed. For in national as well as individual Controversies I hold it to be a principle pretty generally prevalent, that in proportion to the Concession and humiliation of one party, is the Arrogance & insult to be expected from the other. Unhappily our Situation at present, from an assemblage of Circumstances, seems to proscribe every idea of War, & to subject us to national insult without the power of national resentment. But with nations as with Individuals there is a point of forbearance beyond which, neither can yield without dishonour, & sometimes without danger. Heaven forbid that Spain should drive us to this point! I hope nothing on our part will manifest a disposition to rush prematurely & rashly into a rupture with her. I trust that whatever is adopted will be the result of calm & dispassionate reflection; & that the Measures of the Union will carry with them that Air of deliberation with the necessary firmness which will be the most likely to produce the desired effect. I congratulate you Sir on your appointment to the Office of Chief Magistrate of Virginia; May your Administration be happy to yourself & approved of by the state over which you preside. Permit me to assure you that whilst I have the honour to continue in Congress it will give me pleasure to communicate to you any information which may have a tendency to amuse you in your private, or aid you in your public character.

Carolina, No. Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Jersey & Massachusets, as it was late in the day before they collected, nothing was done except reading the Credentials of the Delegates---;on the 30th the State of Rhode Island was represented, & Congress proceeded to the Choice of a President, after seven or eight ballottings Mr. Richd. Henry Lee of Virginia was elected.(1) There are Several matters of very great moment now before Congress, but none which I think bears so serious and alarming an aspect as the dispute between Spain & the United States, respecting the navigation of the Mississipi, and their taking possession of part of the western frontiers of the southern States. They totally deny our right to navigate that River, or the right of Great Britain to grant it to us, as Spain was possessed of the Territory on each side of it, by Conquest, prior to the date of the treaty with G.B.---;and that if we wish to avoid the confiscation of our Vessels, not to attempt it. DECEMBER 6, 1784  These Sir, are the Ideas of Spain on this head, and they differ so widely from ours, that one of the nations must recede from their opinions or a War will be the consequence. Congress are preparing instructions on this Subject, for a Minister who on this occation I imagine will be sent to Madrid.(2) From the Conduct of Great Britain in not evacuating the Western posts which are within the limits of the U.S. before this advanced season of the year---;we cannot but suspect, that she means something hostile, and should a rupture take place between Spain & the U.S. we can not doubt but she will be ready to the advantage of it. It is talked of among the Delegates as a necessary step, the sending an Ambassador to that Court, whether Congress will do it is a matter of uncertainty---;it is a measure that would render us essential Service. If your Excellency can give us any information respecting the encroachments of the Spaniards on our western frontiers, you will be so Obliging as to forward it by the first Opportunity. Congress have been so taken up with other business since their meeting, that have done nothing respecting the No. Carolina cession. Should they take it up, and accept before we receive any fresh instructions, it will place the Delegates of the State in a very disagreeable Dilema, they knowing the divided Sentiments of the State on that Act.(3) I am in hopes it will be dormant untill we receive some intelligence respecting the transactions of our Assembly in their October Session. Should it be called up we must postpone doing any thing with it 'till we do hear from Carolina. I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Most Obedient and most humble Servt., Richd. D. Spaight. ""

  Trenton December [10--;11] 1784 At a Conference at Mr Jays on Fryday Evning the 10th Decr present all the Agents from New York & Mr Wilson DECEMBER 10, 1784  The List proposed by Massachusetts was taken into Consideration.(1) They name Gentlemen from Virginia alone from from . It was observed that while we have given them scope in our List for a Choice from each of the States they have in theirs confind us to States only. That Virginia by her Constitution founds her territorial rights on the ancient Charter to which comprehend a very great part of the Country of the Six Nations. That the Claim of New York Covers the Country of the 6 Nations and consequently a great part of the jurisdiction reserved by Virginia in her late Cession to the United States: and that it cannot be a pleasing Office to the Citizens of that State to pass a Judgement which might interfere with the Constitutional Claims of their Country. That With respect to Connecticut there is such a similarity between her Claim against Pensylvania & the Massach. Claim against New York that her Citizens cannot be presumed to be free from some Degree of Prejudice. That New Hampshire has an existing Controversy with New York which has been brought to a formal hearing before Congress:  That upon the whole only Mr Harrison (2) of all the Gent. proposed by Massach. Can be agreed to consistent with the Duty which we owe to our State. It is therefore unanimously agreed that a new proposition be made to the Mass. Agents (to wit) That the Agents on both sides respectively name two Gent. from every State excepting New York & the Massach. which will make the number 44 and the Agents alternately strike out one till the number shall be reduced to 22 And that from these an Attempt be made to constitute Judges by Consent. And Mr Duane is appointed to communicate this proposition. Mr Duane accordingly made The said proposition to the Gentlemen of the Massach. Saturday the 11th A M Mr. Duane reported the Answer of the Masss. Agents to the above proposition (to wit) That they expected that the Agents from New York woud furnish them with a new List of 13 Gent. according to the first Agreemt. That they woud take it into Consideration and if it produced no Effect they woud make us a Proposition. We thereupon formed a new List of the following Gent and Mr Duane at the request of the Agents deliverd it to the Mass. Agents.(3) Nathaniel Green Rhode Island John Cone & } New Jersey Judge Smith }  George Reed Delaware Thomas Johnson} Rob. H. Harison} Maryland Charles Carrol } Thomas Stone } William Nelson Virginia William Hooper } Abner Nash } North Carolina John Penn} Edward Rutledge South Carolina Saturday 11th. P M Memor. I called on Mr Sullivan & Mr Lowell (Agents for Mass. who did not attend as Delegates in Congress) on a Visit: The Conversation turned on our Controversy. They expressed great Satisfaction at the polite manner in which the business had been conducted but said they were apprehensive that it must probably be submitted to Congress to name a List for Judges according to the federal Articles. I observed that on the part of New York we shoud be as conciliating as circumstances woud possibly admit---;that we only wished for an impartial Tribunal to decide upon our Rights & lay a foundation for perpetual Amity between the two States. That we ought not to consent to throw the burthen of the determination on Gent. from Virginia and must put them in a disagreeable situation to pass a Judgement on our evidence which woud call in Question the Right of that State to a part of the Jurisdiction which they claimd by their very Constitution and had reserved by their Cession to the United States---;And that yet the Mass. Agents had been pleasd to name no less than four Gent. from that State as Judges. Mr Lowel replied that Objections to States must prevent any amicable Appoint. of Judges which coud only take place from a Considn. of the Rectitude of Individuals: that All the small States were averse to the Claims of the large---;that the legisl. of Maryland had openly protested against those Claims on the broad principle that all unappropriated Lands in every state belonged not to the respective States in which they were situated but to the united States. Here this subject dropped. Mr Sullivan afterwards took Occasion to observe that some things had been published in the New York papers <<which> were <<thought> exceptionable <<in the Massachusetts& & had at first occasiond a Resolution in himself > others to give them a Reply but on Reflection it was thought best to pass them over in Silence. I asked to know what he alluded to, and he mentiond the Speech of our Governour & the Answers of the Senate & Assembly with respect to their demand of a fOEderal Court. I answerd that the Claim of Massac. coud not but excite an agitation in our Government. That it was of so undefined & extensive Nature as to include over Albany & Schenectede &c planted by the Dutch before the date of their Charter and that it struck at our  very existence as a State. He replied that it was not their Intention to claim Albany or any dutch settlement which had been made antecedent to their first Charter: and that they woud take an Opportunity to relinquish such districts at the Hearing but they conceivd all other Lands within the bounds of their ancient Charter to belong to them. I told them that as a proof of Candor I woud in my turn mention a Circumstance or two which had excited dissatisfaction at the Conduct of their Government. That our State was among the first to make a common Cause with them in the Hour of their distress: that it seemed to be a singular Circumstance that after we had contributed every thing in our power to maintain a successful War, the old Charter of the Mass. shoud be now revived for our Destruction: that it coud not but remind us of the fable of hunting with the Lion. I added as another Instance that we had submitted our Contest with our discontented Citizens on the Grants to the Arbit. of Mass. in common with the other States: that while the Cause remaind sub Judice her Legislature had thought fit to Offer a formal release of her Claims within that District in favor of Vermont if Congress woud agree to establish it as an independent State: that <<such an> this <<was> unreasonable interference discoverd such a Partiality in their Favour or either such an Enmity against us as coud not be accounted for: the more especially as our Zeal for the Common Cause had been as operative as the Treachery of Vermont & her Intreagues with the Enemy in Canada were notorious. The Gent. both admitted that this Conduct coud not be Justified: and that it was a hasty Measure: that however some Allowances were to be made for it: That the Connection of that District with the Enemy was well known & its total Defection from our Cause apprehended: that at the same time the two Northern Counties of Massac. were discontented & opposed to Government & had gone so far as to prevent administration of Justice & even to break up the Courts by violence, at the same time that they were entreaguing with the Vermonteers: and under these Circumstances & in hopes the Independ. of Vermont woud be a means of attaching it's Inhabits. to the Union & reestablishing the Tranquillity of the before mention'd District, the Measure of which I complain'd had when [....] An Obvious Remark occurred on this Explanation but considering that it coud be of no use I suppressed it. One of the Gentlemen asked me what in my Opinion woud be done with Vermont? It was a Subject I wished to have discussd for a very particular Reason which I need not explain---;I therefore answerd that it was a Case of great difficulty of which it was not easy to form an opinion. In hopes this might have brought on some farther Conversation I stopt here---;but to my disappointment they did not pursue the subject.  They turnd the Conversation to our powers and enquired whether we had any Authority or whether the Legislature had it in Contemplation to accommodate the dispute between the two States? I told them that we had no power or Instruction but what were containd in our Initial Credentials---;the Law which had been communicated to them. They answerd that neither had they any power on that Subject---;that as they nevertheless wished for a friendly Accommodation, they had it in Contemplation to make a proposition not doubting but if the Agents for both States approved & recommended it we might hope that it woud take place. They then explaind the proposition viz. that the Content of both States shoud he estimated; and after assigning to each an Equal Extent of Territory the Surplus of the Lands in Controversy shoud be equally Divided! They expressed their wish for my candid opinion of Such an Accommodation. I reminded them of the Nature of our powers which did not extend to any accommodation---;But assured them that every proposition which they thought fit to make woud meet with the respectful Attention of the Agents for New York.(4) ""

  Sir: Trenton, Dec. 11, 1784. I should be very much obliged to you to inform me, whether, by the orders of Congress, the widow or children of a Major-general who lost his life in the service is entitled to the half-pay of a Major-general for seven years, or to that of a Colonel only. There is a dispute in the State of Massachusetts which is suspended on the decision of this question. If you think the case clear, your opinion, with the grounds of it, will no doubt give satisfaction; but if you are in any doubt, I shall apply to Congress for an explanation of those acts.(1) I am, with the highest esteem, your obedient servant, George Partridge.

  Sir Trenton 11th Decer. 1784 I have the honor to inform your Excellency that since the late meeting of Congress, nothing more than General Federal Questions have been agitated. The Treaties with the Indians as far as they have gone are favourable, and except in a few deviations from the late Provisional and definitive Treaties of Peace, We stand in all Considerations in a most respectable point of View. The Quotas for the present year are not yet fixed, as soon as they are, your Excellency shall be informed of it. This will suggest to your Excellency the necessity or rather the Expediency of at least one of our representation, continuing with Congress;(1) the Committee's of Finance and almost every other Committee of Importance are composed of a Member from each of the states.

  Dear Sir Trenton 11th Decr. 1784. Very little Progress has been made since your departure in the Plans  DECEMBER 11, 1784  for improving the great Dismal. People near Edenton are afraid that a Canal from Pasquetank to Elizabeth River, through Drummonds Lake would deprive that Town of its small remains of Trade and the People on Pasquetank River who would be profited by the Canal have not Enterprize enough to go on with the Work. They want a Conductor, an able and persevering Director on the Virginia side would answer the Purpose. Our Company has from 30 to 40 Thousand A[cre]s. We have a Party of Men working in the Swamp. The mannager has lately been through it. No Part of the Lake is within our Tract, for it is 3/4 of a mile North of the Line. There is a Mill on a head Branch of Elizabeth River to which the Tide flows & it is said that the stagnant Waters of the Dam of that Mill extend to within half a Mile of Drummonds Pond. If so, a single Lock at the Mill and a very short Canal opens the Carriage from Norfolk into the Lake and a Mile further brings it among the weighty Junipers in our Swamp. I have directed our Agent to try to buy two or three shares more for me but don't know what success he may have.  A valuable Improvement is said to have been made in Mecanicks by a Citizen of Virga on Potowmack. He says that he has found a method of working a Boat carrying from 5 to 10 Tons 70 or 80 miles a day by three men up such a River as the Ohio. He says she will go @ 3 miles the Hour up a River where the Stream runs @ 6 miles. Do you believe this? Genl. Washington has seen the Boat in miniature and certifies that it has exceeded his belief & he thinks it a useful discovery. The Projector is getting Laws in the different States to operate as a Patent for his Discovery for 10 Years.(1) You will soon hear many Complaints concerning our Western Country. The Spaniards have not only interdicted the Navigation of the Messissipi but they seem to be making Incroachments and are doubtless taking Pains to exasperate the Indians, to the great Terror of our frontier Inhabitants & to the loss of some Lives. It is true that the Spaniards had subdued two or three British Garisons in West Florida & possess'd the lower Part of that Province previous to the Peace. Does such a Tenure give a good Title to a Country. Such Positions are dangerous; they have been objected to by Spain herself. There is a diversity of Sentiments respecting the probable Effects of those strange proceedings of the Court of Spain. Doubtless they are pointed with an evil Eye against the Prosperity of the US, but I think they will be favourable in their operations. Should the Navigation of the Messissipi continue open vast Bodies of People would migrate thither whose mercantile Connections could be of no Use to the old States. In Taxation their assistance would be very inefficient. On the contrary let the Navigation of the Messissipi be shut up and the Country joining our present settlements will be first improved and a durable commercial & civil intercourse established. DECEMBER 12, 1784  The Business I suppose will cause us to send a Minister to the Court of Spain. From the strong representations that have lately been made by Mr. Lawrence who says he is requested {by Doctor Franklin so to do, I suppose the doctor will be}(2) permitted {to return}. Should that be the Case I hope {you will be his successor at Versailles}. In that Case too we shall have much {difficulty in determining who is to go to London}. Perhaps {Livingston, Jay, or Adams. I think the last} has Prejudices too strong. We have lately heard strange stories concerning a certain Doctor in Paris who performed some thing in the Cure of Diseases like inchantment. Is there any useful discovery made? I have the Honor to be with the utmost Regard, Dr. Sr, Your obedt Servt, Hu Williamson ""

I have been here so short a Time, that I can say very little to you upon the Subject of our general Affairs, wait a little Time & I will give you a general State of them. This place for the residence of Congress has many inconviniencies, and a motion was a few days since made to adjourn to Philadelphia, but passed in the negative.(2) We shall however adjourn I think from this place, either to the city of New York or to Philadelphia. DECEMBER 12, 1784  We have before us a serious remonstrance from the Spanish Agent against our navigating the River Missisippi, they deny the right under our Treaty with the Court of London, and say that any american vessel which may come into that River will be confiscated.(3) This is a subject that alarms the Southern States, and will require a considerable degree of delicacy and firmness to be conducted with safety. No account from the British Court favors the idea of a cordial amity towards the united States, and the detention of the Posts on the western frontier is probably under positive instruction.

  Dear Sir: Trenton, 13th December, 1784. The Marquis de Lafayette is so obliging as to take charge of this letter. He has seen much of our country since his arrival, and having had many opportunities of knowing our true situation, will be able to give DECEMBER 14, 1784  you full information on the subject. I think he is (and has reason to be) convinced that the attachment of America to him has not been abated by the peace, and that we are now as little disposed to break friendship with France as we were during the war. This is a most favourable season for her to relax the severe commercial restrictions which oppose our trade to her islands. Her liberality would be contrasted to British ill-humour, and unavoidably produce correspondent impressions. The present Congress promises well. There are many respectable members here. Federal ideas seem to prevail greatly among them, and, I may add, a strong disposition to conciliation and unanimity. Your letter on the subject of leave to return is, with a variety of foreign papers, referred to a committee. They have as yet made no report, and, therefore, I can give you no satisfactory intelligence on that head.(1) I lately saw Mrs. Bache in good health and spirits at Philadelphia, and I am persuaded no less anxious for your return than you can be. Mrs. Jay and our little family are at Elizabethtown, and her last letters inform me they were all well. Be pleased to make my compliments to your grandsons. I am, dear sir, Your obliged and obedient servant, John Jay. MS not found; reprinted from Jay, Correspondence (Johnston), 3:136. 1 Franklin's request to return to America, which had been conveyed to Congress by Henry Laurens, had been referred to a committee on December 1, which reported on December 23, but its recommendation to accept Franklin's resignation was not brought up for debate until January 21. As Congress was torn over making a decision on the shape of the postwar diplomatic establishment abroad, acceptance of Franklin's resignation was held hostage to agreement on how to fill diplomatic posts at London, the Hague, and Madrid, as well as at Paris, and not until March 7 was a resolution adopted permitting his \""return to America as soon as convenient.\"" See JCC, 28:13--;14, 122; and PCC, item 186, fol. 167.

It gives you a concise acct. of my late rout to the lakes &ca, as well as some observations wh. I thought worthy your attention in the formation of a commercl. treaty with {Great Britain}(2) respecting {Canada}. It was late in Novr. before we form'd a Congress but at present we have 9 States on the floor with a member from all the States except Maryld. & in a few days we expect her Delegation on. From N.H. we have Mr. Foster agn, B.(3) hath given place to some other gent. whose name I do not recollect. From Massachtts. we have Mr Gerry, Holton, Patridge, King, & Goram is appointed but hath not taken his seat. Chancelor Livingston, Jay, Benson their attorney genl. & a Mr. Lansing from N. York; from R.I. H. and E. agn.(4) A Mr. Johnson hath taken the place of Sherman & Colo. Cook of Wadsworth in Connecticut. Jersey hath the same members with Mr Houston formerly in Congress. Pensa. hath chang'd her members & with others appointed Mr. Reid, the late President. S. Chase, Smallwood, Stone & McHenry are I hear from Maryld.(5) This is a respectable Congress & I am happy to inform you they have hitherto acted with perfect good temper & propriety not only in the manner of conducting the business but of a mind comprehensive of the interests of the union as well as an inclination upon the most genl. and liberal principles to promote it. I really promise great good to the Union from this Congress. Our affrs. with {Spain} and {Britain} are before us. They are referr'd to Committees & I flatter myself that, the necessary measures will be effected respecting those {two courts}.(6) I mean here: with those to whom they are committed in the manag'mt. with each will the subseq[uen]t success depend. You know how difficult it is to ascertain this latter point. It seems to be an opinion generally given into that a minister shall be appointed to the {Court of Britain}; that one shall also be appointed to take the place of {Franklin}. Whom the former will be is altogether incertain but I think it beyond a doubt {you} will be the latter. It is also probable that {you} may be appointed to negotiate that particular business with {Spain} but this is only probable. If {Franklin} hath left {France} it may be proper {you} should not leave the {court} in case of that appointment. The {French} gentn. here are very desirous of it. Monsr. La Fayette hath been recd. with very high marks of attention by Congress; they appointed a grand Committee to receive him & give him the thanks of Congress. Congress have also wrote a letter to the king in his favor.(7) Propositions for the arrangment of Commerce, to be handed to the states requiring that they invest Congress with the power of levying the duties upon DECEMBER 14, 1784  imports & exports are before them. I think recommendations to that effect will pass. A distinction will be made between the revenue & the regulation; the former unless ceded by the State to go to the State. As yet we have heard nothing from you except in a letter from on b[oar]d ship to Mr Hardy on the Committee of the States. It will give us pleasure to hear from you as well for the information you will give us of our affrs. abroad and what we shod. do here, as to be assurd of your health & welfare. The Marquis of Fayette will know every thing which I have not mention'd of the affrs. of the Union in every part wh. will supersede the necessity of my detaining you longer for the present.

  Dear Sir Trenton Decr. 14. 1784. I have recd. yr. favor of the 27 of Novr.(1) in answer to mine of the 15th. My last gave you the state of the representations here. The business of importance is still before committees or if reported not yet acted on. It seems to be the Genl. sense of Congress to appoint a minister to the Ct. of London & to give him instructions upon many sub- DECEMBER 14, 1784  jects & particularly those wh. arise in the conduct of both parties under the treaty, but whom they may appoint is incertain, indeed I fear that the difficulty of obtaining a vote for any person will obstruct this measure for a length of time. Franklin hath thro' Mr. Laurens & the Marquis of Fayatte solicited permission to return home;(2) this will no doubt be assented to as soon as taken up. An appointment must therefore be made in his place to that ct.; I think there will be little difficulty in obtaining it for Mr Jefferson, for the opinion of all the members seems to concur in the propriety of it. The first question will be whether we shall or not add other ministers to those in office & annex them to the cts. of London & Madrid, or depend on those for the manag'ment of all our business in Europe.(3) Connecticut hath I hear authoriz'd Congress to carry into effect the impost with the assent of 12 States only. She hath also laid a duty of 5 pr. centm. upon all goods imported from a niegh'boring State. This affects R. Island very sensibly. The question must soon be decided whether this State will accede to this measure, or the other States recede from it for it is sd. N. York & Georgia will join in it. Have you been able to carry the point in fav[or] of the delivery of such citizens as may be guilty of the offences you describe, to the power, in whose territory & agnst, whose subjects they are committed.(4) This is certainly in strict conformity to the laws of nations but I believe not the common practice, except between those with whom particular treaties stipulate it. With us it will be beneficial as it must serve not only political but in the instance of the Indians (if the latter are comprehended in it) very humane purposes. I wish the same regulation cod. take place throughout the union but especially on the frontier next the Brit[is]h. But how are you to ascertain the fact or what evidence wod. you require of it? Or do you mean it shall operate without the concurrence of the other States?

Since this the delegates from the different states have been constantly coming in, so that we now have Ten states upon the floor, & a Gentleman from each of the states of Connecticut & New Hampshire---;the Maryland delegates are expected every day, so that I think we shall very soon have a compleat representation of the Union. There perhaps never was a Period at which such a representation was more necessary, or a session in which more essential & important Questions will be agitated. Our commercial arrangements with the Court of London, the dispute respecting our right to the Navigation of the river Mississippi which the Spaniards are determined to contend, and the very important business of the Indian Treaties to the southward, and the western Territory are all committed, and I hope we shall enter upon them with Unanimity & decision. If the Spaniards should not attend to the remonstrance we shall make them upon the subject of the Mississippi Navigation, it is not improbable the inhabitants bordering on that river may proceed to hostilities with each other, & that it may not be in our power to restrain them. This added to the reports prevailing of the unfriendly disposition of the southern Indians will dictate to the states of South Carolina & Georgia the necessity of organizing their Militia---;the one to keep the Indians in peace until we shall be able to form Treaties with them & establish a permanent confidence between them & our inhabitants, and the other to prevent the excursions of the refugees & other banditti from Florida. Colo. Laurens having returned to Charleston & Commodore Gillon not coming on, I suppose the appointment of delegates will be one of the first Acts of our new Legislature. If they should think proper to honour me with a re-election, I shall have no objection to remain another Year, or as long as they please. I should suppose it will be necessary our Legislature should adopt the recommendation of Congress so as that their next delegates should be only elected to sit till November---;then the delegates again elected will be able to take their seats from the first Monday in November agreeable to the Confederation.(1) I would also mention to your Excellency that all the delegates from the other states take their seats under a Commission from the Governor, with the great seal affixed, certifying the election of the Legislature & the Times for which they are to remain. A Motion was made on Thursday to adjourn from our present residence. The debate lasted three days, & was lost---;so that we shall re- DECEMBER 18, 1784  main in Trenton until this question is again agitated which may not be for some time.

  Dear Sir: Trenton Dec. 18, 1784. We are placed now, I think, pretty nearly in the same political relation under which our former correspondence was conducted; if it shall prove as agreeable to you to revive it, as you were then pleased to say it was to continue it, I shall be happy in contributing my part. The intelligence from hence cannot now be so interesting as formerly, because important events can be expected to occur but seldom in these times. It is, however, not unpleasant to know how things are going, and likely to go, in the world; that part of it at least in which we are in any manner interested. The courts of Spain and London do not seem to be upon such cordial principles with the United States as we might wish, the former seeming to be intent upon possessing, with a strong hand, the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi, and the latter has actually encroached already upon our peace boundary on the river St. Croix, and they detain the western posts; assigning, for reason, that we have violated the peace by not repealing the laws that impede the recovery of British debts; the court of London seems also willing to injure its own possessions in the West Indies, rather than not wound our commerce with British Isles. Much of this mischief arises from the want of a proper understanding of each other, and from the active industry and acrimonious misinformation that the exiled tories and refugees are constantly inculcating and asserting, without much danger of contradiction in having the truth fairly displayed. A well informed gentleman, in our ministry abroad, therefore, lately wrote us, that we could much better have dealt with these people among ourselves, than we can counteract the evils now resulting from their conduct abroad.(1) This temper of the two courts will, however, produce the necessity of sending to each a well informed minister to negotiate commencing difficulties, and thereby prevent the evils of renewed war. It DECEMBER 18, 1784  seems yet to be a matter of much doubt, whether the imperial determination to open the long closed navigation of the Scheldt, and restoring Antwerp to its former splendour as a commercial city, will not light up a general war upon the continent of Europe. I hope that our dispute with Great Britain may be previously settled. Our commissioners have concluded a peace with the six nations, and are now on their way to Cayahoga, on Lake Erie, to meet the western nations and to make a treaty with them also. I present you the compliments of the approaching season and assure you that, I am with great regard and esteem, Dear Sir, Your Most obedient and very humble Servant, Richard Henry Lee.

Reports upon our affairs with {Great Britain, Spain}(2) & our foreign affrs. in general have been presented & alternately acted on. To adjust the points of {variance} between us & the former {Court} it seems to be the general opinion that a {minister} shod. be sent there, that it would tend to conciliate the disposition of either to the other, effect the settlement of those points & avert the evils wh., if things remain long in their present state, threaten both parties, that it is more honorable to both that they shod. be adjusted in one of our capitals & that we owe that respect to the elder party. We have had no official communications but those with wh. you are already possess'd on the subject. {Dr. Franklin} hath thro' {Mr. Laurens} & {La Fayette} desir'd permission to return home which will of course be granted.(3) The claim of {Spain} to the exclusive navigation of the Missisippi &ca had been presented to our view before the instructions from {Virginia} arriv'd, in a note from {Mr. Marbois} covering a letter from Rondon with the extract of a letter from Don Galvez.(4) {Mr. Marbois} assures us of the pleasure with wh. {the King of France} will see measures taken to co[n]solidate & maintain a good understanding between {U.

At the same time therefore that it was thot. necessary to make a polite return to the note it seem'd to DECEMBER 18, 1784  be generally agreed that measures shod. be taken with the {Court of Spain} for the amicable settlement of those points; and that a {minister} shod. also be sent there.

Livingston & all those who were averse to new appointments (the affrs. with {Spain} being first before us) were for evading the question whether new appointments shod. or not take place, & appointing {Mr. Jefferson} immediately to the {Court of Spain} in support of wh. they urg'd the particular qualifications of {Mr. Jefferson} for that business. The object of the two former was readily perceiv'd. The two {Courts} of {Great Britain} & {France} wod. then be open. The first is I believe contented with his present station, the salary of wh. will I think be rais'd & some other matters so settled as to accommodate him, but the latter wod. willingly serve the {U. States}, at either {of} those {Courts}. It was therefore in opposition to this urg'd that for the more permanent interests of the {U. States}, if we were to be represented only at two {Courts} it had better be at those of {France} & {Great Britain} than any others; that the {minister} station'd at each might make occasional trips elsewhere & return, that in the magnitude of the question & the urgency of it that of {Great Britain} was the first object before us, that the regular way was to take up the whole together; first give {Dr. Franklin} permission to return & in respect to that {Court} supply his place, that then the question wod. come regularly before us, shall {Mr. Jefferson} & {Mr. Adams} transact our other business with the other {Courts} or shall we appoint others, that those who were averse to other appointments wod. derive advantage from bringing it on in this manner, for then each point wod. stand fairly on its own ground & be determin'd by its ixpedience. After very long debate it was carried that a minister shall be appointed & sent to the {Court} of {Spain} instructed &ca. The decision of the house, in the point upon wh. it turn'd was, that he shod. be appointed from the Continent, but those in office are not precluded from the vote. They are however not in nomination. R. R. Livingston, Govr. Johnson of Maryd., {R. H. Lee} & some others are. {R. H. Lee} earnestly advocated the appointment of {Mr. Jefferson} to the {Court} of {Spain} only in my opinion to open those of {Great Britain} & {France} to himself & friends among whom are R. R. Livingston & {Arthur Lee}. He reprehends highly the opposition the other {Delegates} made to it, talks of the superior urgency of the affairs of {Spain} to us & ca. {LaFayette} & {Mr. Marbois} assur'd me that {Mr. Jefferson} had been well recd. in the {Court} of {France} & that it was their wish he shod. succeed {Dr. Franklin}. {R. H. Lee} hath hitherto given all the opposition in his power to this appointment & will continue to do it untill opposition will be vain wh. I think will be the case. {Arthur Lee} is in the nomination for the Treasury bd. by {Mr.   Gerry} & {Mr. Mercer} by a delegate from Georgia. In a late ballot Osgood had 6 votes, {Mr. Mercer}, 5 votes & {Arthur Lee} two, Virginia votes for {Mr. Mercer} & seem'd inclin'd to suffer {Arthur Lee} to retire from the publick service in the opinion it will be advantageous to the publick.(5) It is propose'd to recommend it to the States to invest Congress with the power to regulate the commercial intercourse of the States with other powers, without wh. it is thought impracticable to comply with our ingagements in treaties or derive any advantage from them as a nation, to regulate the duties upon imports & exports, by wh. if wise regulations are adopted, we may take some share in the carrying trade by giving priviledges to our own citizens in the exportation wh. may encourage the merchants of the U.S. to employ natives as navigators as well as the merchts of other countries to take in partnership those of the States. To enable us further to act in concert in the measures wh. may be found necessary to counteract the policy of the powers with whom we have not treaties of commerce: propositions to this effect are before a committee.(6) The regulation & revenue are seperated from each other, the latter will go to the States unless conceded to the U.S. for particular purposes by each particular State. As a citizen & a lawyer I am pleas'd with the regulation taking place in the judicial department. I am yrs very sincerely, Jas. Monroe P.S. I heartily wish we had a better cypher, as it is dangerous to trust those subjects upon wh. I wish most confidentially to correspond with you thus to chance & the curiosity of vicious or idle people.

  Sir, Trenton 18t December 1784 Your Excellency's Letter to the delegation of the 27th of November, enclosing an Act of the Legislature repealing the act ceding to the United States the unlocated Western Lands, was handed to us Tuesday last by Captain Craddock, together with a letter to the President of Congress on the same subject, which was laid before that body.(1) I observe in your Excellency's Letter mention is made of the Assembly's having laid a tax to pay their quota of the interest of the foreign loan,(2) but no notice seems to have been taken of the requisition of Congress of the 26th April last, for the payment of part of the interest on the domestic debt, and for the expences of the Year 1784. I hope the Legislature have not passed over this matter in silence. It is certainly time that we should begin to make some payments into the Continental Treasury; of all the specie requisitions that have been made by Congress we have not complied with one, even in part, nor do we stand credited for a single dollar. Nothing can be done at present respecting the appointment of a Commissioner for the settlement of the Continental accounts in our state, as Mr. Morris the financier has resigned. That department is hereafter to be entrusted to a board of treasury to consist of three Commissioners, Congress have several times balloted for them but have not yet come to any choice, next Tuesday is appointed for another trial, but I don't expect we shall make any choice until there are more states represented, having only nine states present. As soon as they are elected we shall have either Mr. Jackson (according to your desire) or some other person sent on to settle the accounts. Since my last Letter to Your Excellency, Congress have resolved that it is necessary to send a Minister to the Court of Spain, and a day is assigned for his election.(3) Indeed our affairs with the Spaniards respecting the navigation of the river Mississippi, & their claims to the lands between the 31° & 32° degrees of North Latitude demand our earliest attention, and I am only afraid much time will be lost before we agree on the person who shall be sent. The conduct of great Britain also demands our most serious attention. Congress are at present deliberating on the measures necessary to be taken, and I expect a Minister will be sent to that Court. That nation so far from delivering up the Western Posts according to the Treaty, have, by the last accounts from Canada, reinforced the nearest post to the United States, And again put their shipping on the lakes into Commission, and for that purpose have sent back the sailors, that have been discharged, and were pretty far advanced on their route to Quebec. This conduct of Great-Britain seems to me to wear a very hostile appearance, and ought to put us on our guard. By having a Minister at  DECEMBER 18, 1784  that Court, we can be more readily informed of their intentions respecting us, or if they meditate any thing against us. From the European intelligence it appears that hostilities have commenced between the Dutch and the Emperor, at least they have done that which the Emperor declared he should consider as a declaration of War; that is, they have stopped some Vessels bearing the imperial colours from going up the Scheldt; it is further said, that they have taken the Town of Sluys.

  Dear Sir 22 Decr. 1784 I recd. yours of the 20. I feel for our Assembly. I am afraid they have been led into a wrong path by the popular arguments used to secure their election and by the artful management of some leading members who are deeply interested and who are utter strangers to the political as well as legal maxim that it is better to suffer a private injury than a public inconvenience.(1) I wish the assembly had confined themselves to a strict compliance with the last requisition of Congress and provided for the payment of one years interest & the discharge of those notes which they heretofore issued for a years interest on a former requisition. This I am persuaded would have extended to the utmost limits of their present ability. If however they find their finances in so flourishing a condition and are of opinion that justice requires that they should undertake in behalf of the United states to fund the public debt & provide for the annual & punctual discharge of the interest, why confine that justice to their own citizens? I grant that every state by its fOEderal Act is jointly and severally bound to the public creditors for the payment of principal and interest, and they may rest assured that if they thus generously provide for the fulfilment of that obligation to their own citizens there is another class of creditors I mean those in foreign nations and particularly the Dutch, to whom a  DECEMBER 22, 1784  very large sum is due, who will find means to compel them to extend that justice & generosity to them by reprisals on our trade & possibly by harsher measures. I say nothing of the breach in our fOEderal government, this appears to have but too little weight, and I fear much that public calamity and a sad experience of the evils that will result from disunion will alone convince us of the advantages resulting from a fOEderal government and the necessity of preserving it. I am pleased with the arguments of Council except, those which glance at a distinction between the holders of public securities. There is a political as well as moral Justice. If the latter demands of government a discharge of public debts, policy likewise requires from it support of its honor, its dignity, its existence and for the preservation of public credit and internal peace and harmony that there be no distinction made between the holders of similar evidences of the debt. Government is not accountable for the inequalities that arise among its citizens by their mutual contracts & mercantile transactions or dealings nor is it bound to equalize them, except where the fundamental maxims of its constitution requires an equal division of landed or other property. Esau sold his birthright for a mess of potage, but Jacob inherited the cave of Macphelan & the field adjoining,(2) nor do we find that Isaac annuled the contract. The Arguments of Council are in my opinion conclusive against the law for appointing additional comrs. to settle the public accounts. The Assembly may be assured that the other states in the Union will not agree to be bound by their settlement, I am persuaded the Assembly themselves would have been among the first to complain had the same measure been taken by any other State. Time will not admit a farther Answer. I shall endeavour to take a copy & send the first sheet of your letter back by this conveyance, if I cannot get the copy compleated before the stage sets out I shall send it by tomorrow's post. I am, Sir, Your obedient humble Servt. Cha Thomson(3) ""

There was a stronger party formed against us than I remember to have seen, but I think it will subside and matters be in good train again.

To adjourn to New-York and reside there until suitable buildings are prepared. This I consider a fortunate affair in every respect but one.

  Dear Sir, Trenton December 26th. 1784 I had the honor to receive your obliging letter, of the 14th instant,(1) seven days after its date; and I thank you Sir for its friendly contents and sensible communications. Your ideas concerning the western country are wise and just. They will certainly have great weight when that business shall be discussed in Congress: and that will probably be the case soon after we know the success of our commissioners at Cayahoga. Much time hath been taken up in debate upon the permanent and temporary residence of Congress, and finally it is determined that the former shall be on the banks of the Delaware, not exceeding eight miles above or below this place, and on either side of the river that may be fixt upon by commissioners to be appointed for the purpose of superintending the fOEderal buildings. New York is to be the temporary residence, and Congress stands now adjourned to meet in that City on the 11th of January next---;when I hope that we shall diligently put forward the public business. Spain seems determined to possess the exclusive navigation of the Mississippi, which, with the bickerings that appear already on that quarter, will oblige Congress to send an able Minister to Madrid. And one also to the Court of London, that we may, if possible, negotiate commencing differences, before they have proceeded too far. The western Posts are with-held, and an encroachment already made on our north-eastern boundary. An ambiguity in the Treaty arising from there being two rivers named St. Croix that empty into Passamaquady Bay has encouraged the British to settle the country between them---;thus determining in their own favor the right to an extensive and valuable country. The fact is, that the eastermost of these rivers is the true St. Croix, the same name having been of late date only, applied to the westermost of these waters. The very unfriendly commercial principles entertained by the B. Ministry and the disputes concerning debts and removed Negroes, are points of consequence also; which together form a field for able and ample negotiation.  The Marquis Fayette had embarked for Europe before the letter for him that you enclosed came to my hands.(2) I should be glad to know your pleasure concerning it---;whether I am to send it on to France after him, or return it to you? My respectful compliments attend your Lady, and wishing you and her the compliments of the season, I am, with very great esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee ""

  Dear Sir, Trenton Decr. 27. 1784 Your favor of the 11th(1) reached me ten days after its date and after the post had gone out for that week, so that I fear this letter will not get to Richmd. before the adjournment. The proceedings of last Assembly respecting B. debts have not yet been before Congress, because they have not arrived at this place. It seems that they were deposited in Mr. Hardys Trunk which a variey of accidents have prevented him from getting brought here before the adjournment of Congress, which took place on the 24th.(2) They have determined to make New York the place of their temporary residence, & the permanent one is to be on the banks of Delaware within 8 miles of this place, where the fOEderal buildings are to be erected as soon as possible. The new Congress meets on the first Monday in Novr. annually. Now it is plain that since the meeting of our Assembly is not until late in October, and as they seldom convene until long after the stipulated time, there is no probability of Virginia being represented for a considerable time after the fOEderal time appointed.(3) North Carolina [is] in the same situation, and to avoid the inconvenience has already sent forward her choice of Delegates for 1786 to take their seats on the 2d Monday in Novr. 1785.(4) The Confederation says, to meet on the 1st Monday, yet the Credentials of most States, & ours among the number, has it From the 1st Monday, which inaccuracy has caused some debates in Congress, and is fitted to exclude Members for one day, and thereby, in some instances may be productive of inconvenience---;this should be alter'd in our next form. I think that the Assize law will improve much the dispensation of Justice in our Country, a thing devoutly to be wished. I am very apprehensive that a war with the Southern Indians will take place. Land Speculators, & Spanish jealousy will probably force it on, before our treaty with them can take place. We have such momentous concerns with the two courts of Madrid & London, that we shall be obliged to send special Ministers to each of them, or else a war may be the consequence of neglect. Mr. Madison has been nominated for Spain,(5) and is much approved by the Southern States. The conversation concerning a Continental Convention has ceased for some time, so that perhaps it may not be revived again. The pointed manner in which Spain insists upon the exclusive navigation of Mississippi renders it of more important consequence to explore & improve the navigation of the waters running thro our States. In a few days I proceed for N. York, having given a little time for fitting a Presidents House there. The Members of Congress, except two or 3, are already departed for N. York & Philadelphia.

Upon my being acquainted with the late proceedings of Congress, I find a Resolution, which I enclose a copy, notwithstanding, I have so far supported your petition,(1) as to have it referred to the Consideration of a come. but when they will report or how soon after I shall be able to git Congress to attend to the same, is uncertain, there being such a multiplicity of important business before them. I shall only add, that you may be assured of my attention to the same, & that I don't forgit an absent friend. I am, with great respect, your most obedient ""

  Sir Philadelphia Decr. 30th. 1784. I had this moment the pleasure of your Excellency's favour of the 18th of December & as I mean to answer it fully in a few days either by the return of Captn. Allibone or by the Post, should the ice in the Delaware prevent Captn. Allibone's soon returning, I will just at present mention that after sitting between three & four weeks the question of adjourning from Trenton was agitated, and after several leading motions were carried, it was finally determined, that a fOEderal town should be erected near the falls of the Delaware---;that Commissioners should be appointed to fix on a proper spot, & that as soon as an exclusive right of soil & such jurisdiction as Congress should deem DECEMBER 30, 1784  necessary could be procured, the buildings should be erected, & that until they were ready for the reception of Congress, they determined that New York should be the place of their session. One hundred thousand dollars are appropriated for the erection of these buildings, & as soon as a safe Opportunity can be met with, the Ordinance together with the official dispatches respecting this business will be transmitted your Excellency.(1) On the 24th Congress adjourned from Trenton to meet at New York on the second Tuesday in January, at which time Mr. Read, Mr. Bull & myself will, if no accident should prevent, make a point of being present. As soon as the Journals of our Proceedings at Trenton are published, they will be sent to your Excellency. We are much obliged to your Excellency for the Treatises on Commerce, & as some recommendation to the states respecting the internal arrangement of our commercial system is now under commitment & will soon become the subject of very serious discussion,(2) it will become the delegates of a state so importantly concerned as ours to pay very particular attention to every measure that may affect its Commerce. The report of the Committee on the southern Indians will soon be called for after our meeting,(3) & I trust such arrangements made as will tend to secure a permanent Peace with them, founded on treaty, & place our frontiers in a state of safety. I mentioned to you in Novr. last (4) that Mr Read meant to return with his Mother & family to Charleston, & since that time that he has altered his mind. As this will reach you before the legislature will enter upon any business of consequence, I must repeat to your Excellency that Mr. Read has agreed to meet Congress with us at New York, so that any determination of his respecting his remaining or returning, is only to be taken from his own Letters---;for my own part, I am inclined to think he will remain if reelected. The many & important affairs now in agitation & which must be determined in the course of the spring, will induce him with Mr Bull & myself to remain & pay the closest attention to the business of one of the most important sessions that has been held for many Years. I shall write your Excellency soon & more fully---;in the mean time I shall be glad to be honoured with your Commands, & remain with respect, Your Excellency's Most obedt. & most hum. servt., (signed) Charles Pinckney ""

  Hond. Sir New York Jany. 3. 1784 [i.e. 1785] I returned to this place about a week since on the adjournment of Congress to meet here on the 11 Inst. Their coming to this city will enable me to attend my duty without any inconveniency. We have agreed with the Agents for supporting the claims of the Massachusetts, on the Gentlemen who are to compose the Federal court, and I hope the inhabitants of this state will approve of the Judges we have appointed. While I was at Philadelphia, contrary to my inclination I was put in nomination for one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, among a great number of applicants. On the ballots being taken Mr. Osgood and myself had each Six States, but as Seven states were necessary there was no election. The question remains undecided and three Commissioners will be appointed on the meeting of congress.(1) Before I left Trenton I resigned all my pretentions and declared I would not serve, my [reason] was because it would obliged me to leave my [fam]ily, but since Congress will reside for some years in this place, I shall reconsider the matter and advise with my friends. If I am appointed it will be necessary for me to give Security in the penalty of 14,000 Dollars, or pounds, I dont recollect which, in which case I must request to be informed whether you will become my Security, as it will be proper for me to be provided, before I resolve to accept, should I be again offered the services of my friends in Congress, which I cannot be sure of as I formally declined at Trenton and they may now be otherwise engaged. The Commissioners will be allowed 2500 Dollars each per Ann. clear of all charges, and the Duties of the office will be fully adequate to the reward. Wishing you and Mama many returns [of] the Season I remain, your Affect. Son. Walter Livingston [P.S.] Please to let me hear from you by the Post directed to me at No. 95 Broadway. Cornelia desires her affectionate love to you and Mama. ""

  Hond. Sir New York Jany. 18.85 On Thursday last Congress made a House and have proceeded to business, the gentlemen seem to be well pleased with the reception they have met with since they have been here. There is no news except such as is contained in the papers which I have given to brother Henry. War between the Emperor and Holland seems inevitable and will involve almost all Europe. I wrote you by Jack to know if you have any objection to become my Security provided I accept of an offer from the Public of a Place mentioned in that letter.(1) Cornelia joins me in love to Mama and Yourself.

  Dear sir N York 21st Feby [17]85 On revising [reviewing?] the Journals, I find the Commissioners of the Treasury are directed to lease to the Trustees of Dickinson College for a Term not exceeding ten Years, the Buildings at Carlisle, or such part as are not wanted for public Stores.(1) Yours in Haste, E Gerry ""

  Hond Sir New York Feby. 25. [17]85 I was honored with your favor of the 16 Inst. yesterday by the Post inclosing the Bond which I had forwarded for you to execute on my behalf,(1) for your compliance with this request I render my thanks, and assure you that the trust reposed in me shall never be violated even in the smallest degree. The expence of living in the Stile I am under the necessity of supporting is enormous, and will not fall far short of £500 over and above my Salary, perhaps the Summer Season may not be so expensive. Congress have not yet heard from either Mr. Gervais or Mr. Osgood. I am apprehensive the former will not accept, as he cannot live here with a family for the Sallary now allowed.  Congress yesterday elected a minister for the court of London and the Majority of Ballots were in favor of Mr. Jno. Adams who is now our minister at the Hague. Your letter to Robert will be taken into consideration this day. For my own part, I am decidedly in favor of your commencing an Action against Mr. Livingston and that for the very reason which you assign (viz) that should he recover, he cannot possibly injure you more than he now does, so that you cannot be a looser by trying to support your just rights. Should you be so very unfortunate as to be deprived of that right which is bequeathed to you by your grandfather, you have other Mill places in that neighborhood which may be improved to good purposes. John is now at Greenwich and sends express for Harry to come out, as he is ready to set off for the manor. Cornelia joins me in Love to Mama and yourself. Mr. & Mrs. Cochran desire their best respects to yourself and Mama. Your affte. & Dutiful Son, Walter Livingston ""

  Sir N. York May 2. [17]85 The bearer Capt Elholm who was an officer in the late Count Polaskie's legion until the reduction of that Corps will wait upon you for the purpose of settling his account agreeable to a resolution of Congress of the 18 Ulto. which he will shew you, and by which you will find you are authorized to settle and adjust his account, and that the resolution of the 22d of January 1784 respecting General Armands corps is made to extend to him.(1) As this Gentlemans merit and services entitle him to particular attention the delegates of South Carolina will esteem themselves obliged by your settling his account as soon as possible, as the Captain is under the necessity of returning to the southward in a few days and only goes to Philadelphia for this purpose. Should the Muster rolls or other documents necessary for settling the accounts of that Corps have been lost during the war; We conceive MAY 3, 1785  there are resolutions of Congress upon that subject to guide you in the settlement of accounts. Or should any other difficulties occur to prevent your being able to adjust them---;I shall be obliged to you to write me upon the subject by the return of Capt Elholm stating them fully together with your opinion what he should do or where he should apply to have them settled as this alone brought him from Carolina and it would be extremly inconvenient and expensive to him to remain longer at the northward than was absolutely necessary. Your attention to this affair will very much oblige the delegates of South Carolina and particularly your humble Servant, Chas. Pinckney(2) ""

  Dear Gerry New York 23d. May [17]85. Lowell, Sullivan & Parsons are here and we are attempting to complete the List of our fOEderal Judges---;indeed we want your good assistance and knowledge in this business. However we will do as well as in our power. It is said this evening that Guardoqui has arrived at Philadelphia, and may be expected here without delay. I hope he has powers adequate to a proper adjustment of our claims to the Missisippi. We do not expect a federal Court until November.(1) New York are now easy, and without farther objection will go to Williamsburgh. I have written to Mr. Pierce of Newbury Port, who is in my Office, to send me by you, when you come on, a few summer Cloaths---;they will not be bulky or heavy, consisting of thin waistcoats, &ca: I hope it will not be inconvenient for you to bring them on. Lest Mr. Pierce shd. fail me, I must take the Liberty, in case they are not sent to Marblehead in season to you, that you would send a servant to Newbury Port to Mr. Pie[r]ce for them. But I trust you will not have this Trouble. We have passd our Land Ordinance, but it was on Saturday, and I have no copy yet.
