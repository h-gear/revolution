  Dear General, York 1st Jany. 1778.  This Morning the Baron Holzendorff brought me the honour of a Letter from you dated 20th November probably intended to have been 20th December accompanied by a packet directed to Monsr. Le Compte De Broglie at Paris.(1)  In my present circumstance pained & fatigued by the Gout & very fully exercised by the Duties of my Office in Congress I am persuaded Dear General you will excuse the brevity of my present respects. If the Packet, which is no doubt of great importance, had not made a part of your charge, 'tis possible I might have taken the liberty to delay writing to you until I should find my self at a little more ease.  The Packet I shall recommend to the Special care of Mr. John Adams at Boston who is going in the Character of Commissioner from Congress to the Court of France. Should his departure be intended to take place at any distant period, he will send it by some early safe conveyance.  That part of your Letter relative to Baron Holzendorff I have Communicated to Congress, which, with a memorial from the Baron, is committed to the Consideration of the Board of War. The Board will probably make a Report in three or four days to Congress, the result of which I will do my self the honour of communicating in due time.(2) I am &ca.  ""

  Dear Sir, York Janry. 1st. 1778. The year is rendered quite pleasing to me, in its beginning, by the arrival of your favour of the 6th of December, which assures me you were then in health with your lovely family.(1) May part of that happiness long continue! I say part, for I wish you may e'er long be in France, or at York Towne. Your aid has been greatly wanted upon a most important transaction. We have had a call for your Stores of Grotius, Puffendorf, Vattel &c &c &c to support reason & common sense or to destroy both, just as your Honour & Da & Du & Dy should interpret the text. I shall expect a long, long letter when the business which the bearer of this carries to General Heath shall have been communicated to you.(2) There are certain words which might be so used as to cause a vast expenditure of ink. For instance, Men may dispute a year about \""just Grounds,\"" and each remain of the opinion he first set out with. Calm posterity alone perhaps can make a faithful decision upon the weighty matters now in dispute between Great Britain and these States as to the verum decens et honestum with which they are conducted.  I do not mean by that remark to deprive myself in any measure of the advantage of having your speedy & free opinion of the business before hinted at.  The next weighty affair is to settle the army after such a conference and consultation abroad as may make firm ground for determinations here within doors. Much work is to be done in a short period. One month of winter is gone. Howe will have no embarkation of troops to make in the spring to impede his early operations; and more of our soldiers perhaps will be destroyed by the galenic than by martial [arts?] at this season. All possible [effort] therefore should be exerted to [fill] up the quotas by every state. Virginia will draught, and I hope the substitution acts will be repealed every where.  With the compliments of the day to your Lady & yourself be assured you receive not the product of meer custom from your affectionate, humb Servt. James Lovell  ""

Your abilities are greatly wanted here in the medical committee. There is a certain house most virulently divided against itself, and the unlucky removals of the sick which have become necessary from the change of station made by our army, has furnished picturesque scenes to be displayed by the pen of a ready writer, who is too apt to attribute them to a different cause from what I have mentioned.

  Dear Sir, Jany 1, 1778 I am astonished Mr Brown (1) could have so far mistaken me as to inform you that the letters from Mr Dean to you were read in Congress. As the president was absent, the comee on foreign affairs delivered me a letter in the Evening directed to Mr Hancock which I opened & found under the cover a letter to him & one to you unsealed. Next Morning I carried it to Congress & consulted Mr Lovel & he concurring in opinion with me that the letter was of a private nature I sealed that for you without shewing it to any person & sent it down to Mr Brown, who I was told was forwarding dispatches to you I think on the same day in the evening before Congress rose other dispatches were brought and among them a duplicate of that I had sent you; upon opening the packet I informed congress it contained a private letter to Mr Hancock & one to you. Some of the members however required that the letter to Mr H should be read which was done. The circumstance of yr letter being open was not attended & an objection was made to opening that for you, upon which I put it in my pocket & upon calling at Mr B lodging's after Congress rose I found your servant was in town upon which I sealed the letter in the cover & desired Mr Brown to inform you, As I had not time to write, that the letter directed to Mr H only was read but that to you was not Opened nor read.2 But as some intimations were thrown out of T.M.'s ill conduct, I desired Mr Brown to mention to you it was my opinion you should come to town.

Willkinson, who at the Request of general Gates Recd a Brevet as a Brigadier general which you Say has given you Pain I most Sincerly Simpothise with you, and Can Say it has given me Senceble Pain ever Since it was Done. I was glad he asked no more at that time, for assured I am that if he had it would have been granted.

The army Severel times were with out Bread for thirty Six hours at a time. This together with the Quarter master general being Sick and his Department thrown into Confusion, and the inhabitents of this State in general being unfriendly to the Cause in which the United States are Ingaged, has given us more trouble and JANUARY 2, 1778  taken up more time then all the Rest of the Business done in Congress.

  Sir, York-Town Pennsylvania Jany. 4th. 1778. I very lately received a Letter from Mr. Marchant in which he informed me that our State was at so great an expence, and so deeply in debt that he was afraid we should be obliged to emit more money, or reissue that which will be collected by taxation; unless a warrant could be procured from Congress upon the Loan-Office for a large Sum; and proposed to me to make an Application therefor. If the General Assembly should think proper to give me any directions on this head I will execute them with the greatest cheerfulness, and not without hopes of Success; provided Loan-Office Certificates can be negotiated, and will answer in Payment of our Debts. The demands upon the Treasury are at present so great and pressing, that all the Money now in it, and which may be collected by the Loan-Offices for some time to come will not I am afraid satisfy them; but if Loan-Office certificates will answer our purpose it is my Opinion that Congress would grant Warrants for them to a considerable amount, rather than we should be obliged to emit or reissue Money. In the JANUARY 4, 1778  Letter which may be wrote to me on this Subject they will doubtless place the necessity they are under to make an Application in a strong and striking Point of Light.(1)  The Committee which was appointed to examine the Journals of Congress and report the Resolutions which have passed respecting the Defence of our State, and recommending an attack on Rhode-Island have not yet reported, but I cannot entertain any Doubt but that Congress will determine the Expence of the late inglorious expedition to be continental when the Committee shall have reported. Perhaps it would be best not to apply to Congress for a Warrant on the Loan-Office 'till that matter shall be decided; as a great part of the Expence for the defraying of which a warrant may be desired may have accrued by that expedition.  We have nothing new either foreign or domestic. As soon as Acts shall have passed in pursuance of the late Recommendations of Congress I should be glad to have them transmitted to me.

By him you will receive mine of the th of Decembr.(1) giving you such Intelligence as had lately Occurred to that time since which nothing material from the Army. They have moved on this side the Schuylkill about 20 miles distant from Philada. where they mean to hut for the winter in the best manner they can, and it is not very likely there will be much more fighting this season, only what will necessarily arise from parties of two hungry Armies Scrabbling for provisions, which may occasion some bloody noses in the Contest: and dare say between them both will most effectually glean the Inhabitants of this State both Whig & Tory for at least 50 miles from the Metropolis, fear Nothing more will be done this way, This Winter.  In Congress there are applications from every quarter, the burthens JANUARY 5, 1778  of every department of the Army is revolved upon them, but the most Important & perplexing of all is the measures & conduct we ought to take with respect to Genll. Burgoyne and his Army;(2) on the one hand there is every thing to fear if he is suffered to embark that he will join the Enemy in America instead of going to Great Britain, on the other hand it concerns us inviolably to keep our faith, & maintain our honor, pledged for the punctual fullfillment on our part of all treaties, Contracts or Conventions made even with our Enemies; as we would not offend Heaven by our perfidy, nor forfeit our honor & reputation in the eyes of this, or the European World, who are & will be most attentively watchfull, over every part of our publick Conduct, and will fix their opinion & form their Estimation of these American States on no part more than that which concerns our publick faith, & honor. In the beginning of this infant Empire the greater care is to be taken to establish a fair & reputable Carracter, which if once lost is hardly to be regained. We have entertained a Jealousy of Genll Burgoynes Intentions to violate the Convention of Saratoga ever since his entire Surrendry, we think he very early made some Infractions in it, in the abuse of the Arms, carrying of many of the Cartouch boxes &c tho of so Small Consideration that we had no thought of taking any advantage of it; but by a late letter of his to Genll Gates, wherein he declares, that we on our part have broke our publick faith, in not providing for him & some of his Officers, such convenient accommodations as they ought to have had, has given us a particular Alarm, and as we Conceive are Strong Indications on his part of his Intentions, and gives us just reason to fear that he will take the Advantage to break over that Convention if he is suffered to Embark, & has it in his power.  This by all the great writers on the law of Nature & nations will Vindicate us in a Suspension on our part till he can and does remove those just grounds of Suspicions & fear. Thus far the way has been clear to me & my mind has been free from labouring doubt or perplexing Suspense; but the line of our Conduct Consistent with prudence & sound policy has given me greater solicitude & more anxious fears, and concern, than any other matter which has come under Consideration of Congress since I had the honor of a seat there, tho they might be as important or more so, yet the way has been much clearer which side to act, or what part to take in the conclusion; in this, to suffer Genll Burgoyne to Embark with his Troops, at once puts it in his power to joine the Enemy and to be more dangerous to us than if we never had accepted of his Surrendry, & which we are Inclined to think he will do not only by the declaration he has made that we on our part had broken our faith, but by his denial of giving us the name & description of the soldiery with him, by which they might be known if again found in Arms against us, and by Genll Hows sending the Transports to Rhodisland & the Sollicitation  made for Liberty of Burgoynes embarking there. On the other hand, in making up our Judgment, we are deeply Interested, how to Judge in our own Cause, our Jealousies & Suspicions may goe too far, & warp our Judgements; and Indifferent Powers, not seeing through the same medium, may view the Conduct of Burgoyne in a different point of light, especially after his specious pretences and plausable explanations, and of the Court to which he belongs, and may Judge that we are a people of no Faith, & in whom no Confidence is to be placed, in the most solemn treaties or Conventions, & who will not be holden by the ties & obligations which bind the Civilized Nations at peace or in War. It may also disaffect the remaining friends or rather those of the opposition to the present Ministry & measures against the American States, whereby Irritated to the last degree by this supposed Violation & Infraction of a Solemn Convention, may kindle anew the Expiring flame, call forth fresh Vigor & Exertions among themselves & to arouse some friendly powers in Europe, to furnish them with greater Aid and Supplies to Crush if possible this new, & as they will say perfidious rising Empire, in whom there is no trust, nor faith, and may rouse and Animate the present hostile bands in America to more desperate Exertions, as they will not ever think again in any Circumstances to enter into any Capitulation or Convention with any of our Generals. To avoid such conclusions & Consequences and to guard as far as possible against every unfavourable Construction of our Conduct, in this important transaction, there were a Number in Congress of the opinion, first to Order a detainer of Gll Burgoin and his Troops, Until he should explicitly revoke the declaration he had made in his letter to Genll Gates, & solemnly renew & Confirm the Convention of Saratoga on his part, & Declare that on his Embarkation he would Immediately & directly proceed with them to Great Britain according to the true Interest and meaning of the Convention, which if he should readily do, then to permit him to Embark & Trust Providence with the Event, but if he refused (which we rather supposed he would) then to detain him with his Troops at all adventures, and should have no doubt of being fully justified therein by the Impartial world, and Every danger of any ill Consequences arising therefrom would be avoided. This was the Question we Insisted on being first put, but on a previous resolution being carried that no further Confidence or security were to be had or relied on from Genll Burgoyne, rendered it absurd to put him on any further declaration or Confirmation of the former Convention, which brot. it to the Conclusive resolve which was passd. viz. that Genll Burgoyne and his Troops should be detained until the Court of Great Britain should ratifye & Confirm the Convention & proper notice thereof be Given.(3) In this the Yeas & Nays were called for & there were some members with myself who did not Choose to act or give our voice in the matter, as we chose first to have taken the other Method   proposed, (ie) to call upon him for a full & explicit declaration and renewed Confirmation of the Convention on his part (as he had publickly declared we had broke our faith therein) & if so he must suppose himself to have been exonorated therefrom, and if he had refused, then we were clear for the last resolution proposd, & as we were denied that question first, declined acting in the latter, as our opinion & conduct on the whole could not appear in its true light to the publick. How far my Conduct in this important affair may be approved or not by my Constituents I cannot say but an approving Conscienceness of the rectitude of my Intentions, Yields satisfaction in my own heart.  No one wished more to have Burgoyne detained, but before the last step was taken, on which the future Carracter of these United States so much depends, & on which Consequences the most Interesting to them may follow, I could have wished such previous steps to have been taken (& which I firmly believed would have terminated in the same manner) and would have put it beyond a doubt, that we had acted not only a cautious & prudent part but Consistent with good faith & honor & that which could not leave so much as a stain behind, among friends, or foes that we had violated either. In this as well as many other Important matters I longed for the aid and consultation of some of my Judicious Colleagues, it would much have lightened my burthen, strengthened my faith, or rectified my Judgment, but hope it will terminate well & no ill Consequences follow, that Heaven will approve, and man not Condemn, in which shall be most happy, tho I could not see my way Clear in the manner. An Express is gone forward with the Resolution of Congress to Genll Heath to detain Genll Burgoyne with his Troops till the Convention is ratified by the Court of Great Britain, which by the way, I feared would only appear a meer protest as all agree that the Convention never required a ratification either by Congress or Great Britain as to its Validity. But as this matter is Enjoined a Secret till published at Boston, I hope this letter may be kept private till you hear of it from there, and then am willing it should be as publick as you think proper.  We have just received from Genll Washington the agreeable intelligence that a large brigantine of the Enemy laden with Officers baggage & Cloathing for 3 or 4 regiments, above 7000 of small arms, a Col., Lieut & about 70 privates on board, a number Mariners, about 40 officers wives or ladies besides other baggage, run aground a little below Wilmington of which Genll Smallwood was aprised of, attacked her from the shore with 2 field pieces, obliged her soon to surrender and was unlading of her with all speed with about 300 men, was in hopes of getting away all her Cargoe, the people all made prisoners, Many other valuable articles on board not Enumerated above.(4)Also he had heard but not with so full a Confirmation  that another of the Enemies Vessels had run ashore on the Jersey side & was taken by the Jersey People Contents unknown, a most seasonable relief to our Army who were much in want of those necessary Articles; which a kind Providence has thrown into our hands. Mr Davenport, Mr Colts Clerk has been waiting here some days for directions in his department. As Congress had Committed the affairs of that Department into your hands they neither had time nor Inclination to attend to them. Mr Buchanon will write him what he thinks proper on the subject & he must apply to you for any further direction he wants.(5) Am with the greatest respect your honor's most Obedt Humble Servt Elipht Dyer  [P.S.] I had forgot to mention, that previous to the above, some time agoe Congress passed a Resolve that Genll Burgoyne was not to Embark till he paid off in Silver or Gold all the Expenses for his support & his Troops since the Convention.(6) The want of Provisions especially the meat kind for our Army, will we fear, not only prevent calling in such reinforcements as are necessary to drive How out of Philad (which was fully proposed & there on [are] men Enough ready to step forth on such an occasion from the Jerseys & Elsewhere) but fear will oblige the army we have to scatter or disband, we are really alarmed that that will be the Case. Every exertion is necessary from Every quarter to prevent it.(7) ""

  Dear sir, York Town 5th January 1778. I had the honour of Addressing you on the 28th November & 3d Ulto. in Official Letters from Congress. My present business is to entreat your protection to the enclosed Packet from Baron Kalb which he intimates to me is intended to be of particular service to JANUARY 5, 1778  these States.(1) You will be pleased either to take it under your immediate care if you intend within a few Weeks to embark for France or, if you do not, to commit it to the charge of some person in whom you can confide, with direction in case of Capture to use his utmost endeavour to conceal & save it & attempt a conveyance from England if he should be carried into that Kingdom. The Baron will be much obliged to you for information how you intend to dispose of this Letter.(2)  We have advice from General Smallwood stationed at Wilmington, of a Capture made by him of Brigantine which had got aground about 5 Miles above that place-a British Captain & 67 Soldiers-the Master & Mate & 12 or 15 Seamen & 40 Women some of them Officers Wives made Prisoners-The Brigantine was armed 6, 4 pounders & some Swivels. The British Captain was sulky & refused to disclose the particular Contents of the Cargo. The Master of the Vessel said she was laden with Bales & Boxes the Contents not known to him but he understood there were Clothing for four Regiments with Camp Equipage, 1000 or 1500 stand of Arms, some ammunition, 5 Hogsheads Rum, Butter & other Provisions, some Sugar, Tea &c. proper the Clothing & Arms were intended for new Levies expected to be raised. General Smalwood intimates that he had 300 Men at work unloading the Vessel & hoped soon to give a more special Account. A Sloop laden with flour & Pork is also taken, the Cargo would be secured & the Vessel burned.  'Tis reported also that the Jersey Militia had taken a Scots Vessel aground supposed to be fully Loaden with Merchandize & the Master's name, Speers, is mentioned-but this wants confirmation.  I beg you will do me the favor to present my Compliments to Mr. S. Adams & believe me to be with great Respect & Esteem, Sir, Your Obedient & most humble servant, Henry Laurens  ""

  Sir, York Town 5 Jany 1778 I flatter myself with hopes that the very important Letter which I had the honour of writing to you the 27th Ulto. by Messenger Mackloskey together with one enclosed in it calculated for Barring the departure of General Burgoyne will be put into your hand this day.  It may appear to Gentlemen who are not informed of the Circum- JANUARY 5, 1778  stances of Congress, the intervening time has been sufficient for maturing their intended Declaration & Resolves upon that subject, but you Sir, will not wonder at the delay, when I tell you that from unaccountable deficiencies in the several departments, Congress have found it absolutely necessary for saving the Army from general dispersion to interfere personally in the businesses of Quarter Master general, Clothier General, Commissary general, Director general of the Hospitals &c &c. These extraordinary & unreasonable burthens have fallen extremely heavy upon a few Members who faithfully devote their time to Public service. However the other great work although not completed has not been neglected. Congress have proceeded so far as the inclosed Copy of two Resolves intimate-these I transmit in confirmation of what I had the honour of writing as above mentioned & under the same injunctions of prudent & necessary secrecy.(1) Tis highly probable that in the Course of the present Week I shall be authorized to transmit the Act complete & Certified.

  Sir, 5th Jany 1778. I catch a few minutes between adjournment & meeting of Congress to say a word in reply to your Excellency's favour of the 2d Ulto.(1) which I was unable to do by the late Messenger. I have been a good deal affected by the perusal of Colo. Jno. Trumbull's correspondence-the cause of his disappointment & mortification is no Secret to me. I discovered it very early after I had the misfortune of arriving at the State House Philadelphia. Although I do not mean to add to the affront which appears to me to have been calculated for that Gentleman, yet I cannot forbear wishing that had been the greatest Evil produced from the Source I allude to. My sentiments cannot be otherwise than in favour of Colonel Trumbull's determination, because, I declare it upon my honour, I would have acted the same part had I been reduced to similar circumstances. Men have a right to punctilio, when an honorable tenacity does not essentially injure their Country.  I was almost a Stranger in Congress when the appointment of a Commissary general was on the tapis, & candidly confess I was much misled by specious Representations, not that I was without some jealousies. For before the debate upon that Subject was finally ended, I saw party, & lamented the prospect, every day enlightened me & I soon prognosti[c]ated Evils which we are now labouring under & which must be conquered by Virtuous exertions or we shall soon be exposed to the ridicule annexed to those who attempt to build without counting the Cost. Ridicule will not be the whole penalty which will be laid on thousands of us. We are now good Sir, now at this Instance on the brink of a precipice. If we have Wisdom, if we have Virtue, we will hasten to withdraw. I pray God to aid us in this moment of danger. Not only the Commissariat but other departments on which the Salvation of the Army equally depends are somewhat more than deranged, they are shattered & distracted. Congress for some time past have been obliged personally to act Commissary general, Qur. Master general, Clothier general, Director general of Hospitals &c &c. Since you have invited me Sir to conversation from the respect I bear to your Character I wish I could communicate my Sentiments more copiously than the present time will permit. There- JANUARY 5, 1778  fore I must return. I have great reason to believe that Gentlemen in general now wish that the demands which were made by Colo. Joseph Trumbull as the condition of his holding his late Commission had been complied with, because we must now be convinced he had only public benefit in view. I have also reason to believe it will be necessary for us to resort to him again. Should this happen, that Gentleman's patriotism will appear in Lustre, if he passing over those exceptions which the pride of human nature will first dictate, will Step in & contribute his Talents & abilities for saving his Country. In the mean time I am persuaded he will as far as it may be in his power assist & promote the business of supplying the Army & put out of countenance every malignant insinuation of throwing Stumbling Blocks in the way.  General Washington informs Congress of a capture made by General Smallwood to whose letter he refers Vizt. Wilmington 30 December 1777.(2) \""I received intelligence of an Armed Brigt aground 5 miles above this place. I detached a Strong party & two field peices-she refused to surrender & prepared to engage supposing we had only Musketry but on firing two shot she surrendered. The prisoners are a British Captain & 67 Soldiers-the Master, Mate & 12 or 15 Seamen & about 40 Women some of them Officers Wives-the Vessel carries 6 4 pounders & some swivils-the British Captain is too sulky to give any information of her load & the Master says he never was suffered to know but believes there is the Officers Baggage of 4 Regiments & Camp Equipage & some Soldiers Clothing & Arms, 4 or 5 Puncheons of Rum, some Sugars & Teas. The Master says he has heard from the Soldiers & Women that there is Clothing for 4 Regiments & 1000 or 1500 Stands of Arms, but he is in doubt, as the Captain always evaded his Enquiry, but says she is filled with Bales & Baggage & some ammunition. I have 300 Men at work unloading her which is attended with much difficulty on Account of Mud & Ice, I will render you a more particular account shortly.\""  A Young Gentleman with whom I correspond in the Army adds, a Sloop \""laden with Flour & Pork for the Philadelphia Market is likewise taken & will be burnt or secured.\"" (3)  & a Report is just now brought in of a third prize a Scots Vessel fully laden & even the Captains name mentioned Speers taken in the Jersey shoar. I wish this may prove true. I am with very great Regard &ca.  ""

In that letter (2) I advised you that with the advice and concurrence of my colleague, Mr. Duer, I had purchased woollens for the use of your troops, amounting to £2,223 5s. which remains in Mr. Duer's quarters, waiting for your orders.

I hope they will advert to the appointment of one or more Delegates to represent them in Congress. Mr. G.

  Dr. Sir York Town Jany. 5th. 1778 The letter from his excellency the President & the Speaker of the Assembly was this morning read in Congress.(1) As far as could be discovered the expediency & indeed necessity of something vigorous & immediate were in the sentiments of the whole house. They referred the letter to a Committee viz: myself, Dr Witherspoon & Mr. JANUARY 5, 1778  Fulsom. The articles of arms & provisions will probably be a weight. Can meat be procured? We are informed this day that eno' for 6 weeks for the army cannot be had of flour &c. I can have no doubt. Indeed I this day assured congress that all the difficulties arose from the mismanagement of the Commissaries only. It is probable a copy of the letter will be sent forward immediately to the General. Possibly the army may not now be in a situation to support the measure, as upon a late formal discussion on the subject, when a Committee from congress was at camp on the purpose, it was deemed impracticable; & many officers are away, & perhaps as great a proportion of the men. I think you may rely on Congress having it much at heart. [I will] be glad to know particularly from time to time what [response the?] inclinations of the people make. I shall feel myself [happy in?] having an opportunity of gaining to this state a reputation [with Congress?] on this head; & shall not fail of availing myself of informations you may give.  The Papers respecting waggons &c are now with a Committee. Congress appear averse to raising the pay.  We have a letter from Genl. Smallwood informing of his having taken a Brig of 6 Guns bound from N York to Philada. one Capt. & 70 Privates on board, a master & 12 mariners, & 40 women, officers wives &c. The Sulkiness of the Capt & the ignorance of the Master who says the loading was concealed from him prevented the Genl. from giving an account of what was on board. 1500 stand of arms, some ammunition, cloathing for 4000 men, or for 4 regiments which uncertain, some cash, rum, wine &c. he heard of.

  [January 8, 1778](1) Notes on General Burgoyne's Letter to General Gates 14th November 1777 General Gates transmited a Copy of that Letter to the President of Congress, Henry Laurens, without one syllable of remark upon or reference to it. \""The Public faith is broke\"" must have been understood in full force by General Gates, who knew the subjects of Complaint on which that intimation was founded, were trivial & feigned.  The accomodations were the best that could on a sudden be procured upon the first arrival of the Convention Troops at Cambridge, nothing contrary to agreement & better than General Burgoyne & his Officers must frequently have submited to between Canada & Cambridge, but our General perhaps a little captivated by the flattery of a British Lieutenant General, while he felt it his duty to transmit the Letter was too polite to animadvert as if he had said, \""I'll leave this matter to Congress.\""  It is certain he was too polite to make the Lieutenant General & his Troops Prisoners at discretion which might as easily have been effected as making a Convention.  From the moment I perused General Burgoyne's Letter to the conclusion of the business I always made the following comment upon \""the public faith is broke.\""  The British Commanders having frequently declared there is no faith to be kept with Rebels & having as often acted in conformity, Sir Wm Howe, Sir H Clinton have directed Burgoyne whenever his Troops shall be embark'd to order the Transport Ships to go into New York or Delaware as the Winds may permit.(2) General Burgoyne a little staggered by such an Order & feeling for his own reputation, devised means for vindicating the intended breach on his part whenever his conduct should be called in question & the Letter to General Gates was calculated for the purpose, encircled by flattery of Gates in particular & of the Military at Boston in general, a kind of loose hint is thrown in \""the public faith is broke.\""  By whom & how? By the Government of Massachusetts or the Magistracy of Boston, because they have not in an Instant furnished the Convention Officers with more commodios Lodgings than they were allowed when Sir Wm. Howe was in possession of Boston, or more commodios than probably some of them injoyed at the very time for themselves & families, at the same time more commodios were in preparation & were very soon provided for the Officers & Troops.  \""This Letter, reasoned General Burgoyne, will take up some days to reach General Gates, possibly he may overlook my hint, but should he forward it to Congress, that will be a work of more days, more will be required for their deliberations, & more again for sending  JANUARY 8, 1778  their Resolutions to General Heath at Boston in the whole at this season of the Year at least five Weeks, in the mean time the Transports will arrive & we shall be gone.\"" (This would certainly have happened had not the Transports suffered delay by very tempestuos weather.) \""Should I go into New York or Delaware & be afterwards charg'd with breach of the Convention, I shall refer to my Letter written to the very General with whom I contracted, in which I complain, the Public faith was first broken by the United States. I shall obey my Orders & at the same time exempt my self from any imputation of dishonor.\""  That it was not intended to send the Troops across the Atlantic appears clearly from the inadequate quantity of Tonnage of the Transports which were sent to receive them as well as from the scantiness of provisions & Water laid in, for a Voyage to Europe, & from General Burgoyne's refusal to give proper descriptions of his Officers, Non Commission'd Officers &c-see Report of a Committee, or of General Heath or both. Besides General Burgoyne had violated the Convention by the affair of the Cartouch Boxes, the Army Colours, The Military Chest, more particularly by rendering all the Muskets of his Army unfit for service.  That Sir Henry Clinton & Sir Wm. Howe were equal to an Act so dishonorable as ordering the Convention Troops into New York, holding every thing fair play with Rebels, there can be no doubt when we reflect upon their former conduct & upon their subsequent stratagems in conjunction with their Brother Commissioners, for swindling Congress out of those Troops, pretending they were authorized to Ratify the Convention which authority when demanded they could not produce. See Letters to & from Congress on that point.  No plausible reason ever appeared, none can be assigned, for the high Resentment of the British Court against General Burgoyne but his having written that Letter, the intended business would have been accomplish'd but for his mar-plot delicacy. The King would not see him, he remained under a heavy Cloud during all Lord North's Administration. He was afterwards promoted.(3) Why? Because he had been injured.  Had the Convention Troops reached New York or Philadelphia they would instantly have been employed against us, either in Garrison or in the Field, probably both. Congress might have clamored, but their complaints would have been treated as former complaints had been, with contempt. And the World at large would have laughed at them.  When General Burgoyne found the ill effect of his Letter, his temper sowered, he became crabbed & sought for occasions to pick quarrels with the American Military.  The correspondence between him & General Gates, no doubt there was a correspondence, after it had been determined to suspend the  embarkation of the Troops, would be a curiosity. I know Gates maintain'd the rectitude of the suspension.  ""

  My Dear Son, 8th Jany 1778 The day before yesterday I sent you a few hasty lines (1) by Messenger Gray-last Night pretty late in Congress your very affecting Letter of the 3d was brought to me (2)-it accompanied a packet from Your General dispatched the 2d.(3) The Contents of this, as duty required, I reported immediately, but your writing, as discretion bids, I have concealed in my own breast. You speak in the warmth & affection of a Man under strong attachments, therefore I do not wonder at certain expressions which you would not have dropped to any but a friend in whose attachment you confide. If my memory does not deceive me, I hinted some time ago my discovery of party in our Councils. The events which I dreaded & in many instances predicted, are now coming to maturity. Some of our friends in Charles Town to whom I had communicated my sentiments freely when they learn our present circumstances will look back to my Letters of August & September. I lament the particular unhappiness which you write of, but I do not confine my view to so narrow a Circle, our whole frame is shattered. We are tottering, & without the immediate exertions of wisdom & fortitude we must fall flat down. Among the Causes of this melancholy state are to be found some Men in whom your friend (4) reposed an implicit confidence. I do not mean in the Army-did not I intimate to you some distress I was under in answering a Letter soon after I was called to the Presidency, because I could not flatter? (5) The Man I alluded to, against whom I can have no prejudice, for we always in our short acquaintance sat & drank together in great cordiality has contributed largely to the promotion of party. His fawning mild address & obsequiousness procured him toleration from great Men on both sides, a sort of favoritism from some. His Idleness, duplicity & criminal partialities in a certain Circle laid the foundation of our present deplorable state. If your friend knew these JANUARY 8, 1778  things as well as I do, he would see as clearly as I do, how his honest heart has been deceived-but enough of this till we meet.  I am not quite sure of the fact, but I believe you have hit the pivot (6) upon which the late mischiefs have turned. In order however to justify this Idea, we must include Characters of whom your friend entertains the most favorable sentiments, these taken together form a Club whose demands upon the Treasury & the War Office never go away ungratified. Candour obliges me to say that some of them respect your friend & I am persuaded would not wittingly be concerned in a plot against him, but they \""want the honour to defend.\"" In all such junctoes, there are prompters & Actors, accomodators, Candle Snuffers, Shifters of scenes & Mutes.  I have been & am uniformly opposed to all of them. The motives of your friend are pure, he has nothing in view but the happiness of his Country. That pivot & the rest of them, one in particular (7) who stands high in the good graces of your friend, make patriotism the stalking horse to their private Interests & some of them as I am well informed have already mounted to vast paper Money Estates-in sound, equal to any made by that group of Commissaries, Contractors & Tools, who were celebrated by Foote at the end of the late War.(8) This Game at the public expence, cannot be successful played without the knowledge & the Aid of a Circle. Those among them who love Money best, must sacrifice peace Offerings to the passion of those of their Colleagues whose ambition is most impetuous, & some there are whose vanity & avarice must both be fed. All these in course of time will be exposed to public view-at present they seem to triumph. God knows I feel no regret from private considerations, I never touched, I desire never to touch public Money, & I have no ambition to gratify. I feel for my Country-I feel for thirteen Infant States. I have delivered my sentiments very freely against Maladministration & pointed to that of the \""one in particular\"" nor will I ever spare my honest opinion, when it shall be proper to deliver it. To break the combination is a work not to be easily, nor suddenly performed, & you will perceive it is the more difficult from the texture which I have very fairly described.  I will attend to all their movements & have set my face against every wicked attempt however specious, but there is no other measure so likely to defeat the projects against your friend as a Steady perseverance in Duty, of which he if I may judge from his conduct, is truly sensible. His virtues are admitted & admired by all Men & if there be such a Devil in the opposition as a rooted Enemy to him, yet even his knowledge of Mankind must dictate despair of degrading that worthy Man without the procuration of his own consent & Aid. These I trust he will never afford to him or them. In his would be involved the ruin of our Cause. On the other hand his magnanimity, his patience will save his Country & confound his Enemies. Com-  parison, I have often heard, of the miscarriages & inactivity in the Sothern, with the successes in the Northern department, but I have never been at a loss for argument to convince reasonable Men, there was no ground for censure in one Case, & that in the other we had been fortunate. It would be useless to relate stuff of this Class, Men of sense treat these things with contempt.  The affair of G.C.(9) which has so deeply affected you must be a little troublesome to your friend-but it cannot long continue so, if the fact relative to the Letter be exactly as you have been informed -every Man of honour & sensibility throughout these states will feel himself wounded & will think & speak of the circumstance according to its demerit. While I lay Ill of the Gout the G____(10) explained that transaction to me, but in much softer language than your quotation speaks,(11) indeed he denied there was such a sentence in his Letter & averred he had spoken of your friend in terms of respect. However there was something in the manner of his representation which raised doubts in my mind, the correspondence even under favour of his own narrative appeared to me to have been indiscrete & dangerous. I never wished for you more in my Life than I did upon that occasion. I have no body here to whom I can with pleasure & safety unbosom myself, but do not mistake, I have not lowered my tone when I am called upon to speak of public Men & public measures. I have been twice called to account by a Stricken Deer & I suppose stand open at this instant to a third attack by Interrogatories. The Visitor who came next to my Bedside introduced the subject which the G. had just dropped. I very candidly said, according to the G's explication there appeared no criminal intention, but there was something about it which did not look well. The G's late behaviour towards your friend is, in my judgement, through the whole, very reprehensible, but the taunts & sarcasm contained under the 31st December are unbecoming his Character & unpardonable.(12) Your friends Letter & the correspondence which accompanied it are committed to the B.W.(13) The event will be known in two or three days, I hope there will be no appearance of disrespect by delay- the occurrence demands attention & determination.  I could not forbear remarking because it produced a striking evidence of party-affection & prejudice, to say nothing of Ill manners & breach of- Order, when I had the name of Baron d'Arendt it was instantly followed in a loud voice, \""as great a Rascal as any in the Army.\"" Pray Sir, tell me who is this Baron d'Arendt who is also Stigmatized by the same tongue, as an Indolent worthless Creature.(14)  G.W. must be willfully blind if he cannot discover such glaring defects in a Man's character as denominate him a first rate Rascal. I have no apprehensions that he is so-it is impossible that he should recommend such a Character to an important trust.  Your private opinion is that G.C. never meant to act in his late  appointment-my private opinion was from the first, that he did not mean to cross the Atlantic until he had made further attempts on this side.l5 Our first conversation justified my conjecture. I was not satisfied of the propriety of his returning to the Army, but from the high opinion generally entertained of him, I wished he were sent to Georgia & to conduct an expedition a little further South. I proposed the subject for his consideration & he most heartily approved of it. What may follow the present appeal is uncertain, Mens Mouths are shut, they wait to hear a Report, but you know me & after what I have said you know it is not in my power to take any part but that which Conscience & honour have dictated. I have made my Report- here the Subject must rest a few days.  I have heard nothing yet in favor of your friend Duplaisis, if it falls to my Lot to give him a Commission a Resolution of Congress shall be annexed to it.(16)  You must excuse this patch work, I began it yesterday Morning, 'tis now 10 at Night the 9th. This finishing Stroke is the 6th effort to complete the performance & I have not time to make a second impression, I'll go to Bed now, & add in the Morning any thing that may occur, but first to answer your enquiry about my Gout, I am still extremely lame, unable to walk to the Court House, the Ankle on the left is now, as it is every night, as thick as the Calf of the Leg however I laid by the Crutches two days ago, & can hobble about house supported by a Cane, in a word the fit has been exceedingly severe, & has deducted two & thirty bottles of Madeira from my ordinary allowance. I have not tasted a drop since the 8th December & I still feel a reluctance, which against all opinion, is convincing to me that however palatable that Wine is not friendly to my feet. When I am perfectly restored, if experience may speak, there will be pleadings against partiality.  10th By Candle Light. I intend to write to our friend in St. Mary Axe (17) by Mr. Batwell, in a Style which I hope he will understand & that it will not be too late to prevent the Evils which his Letters have invited, in the mean time I cannot shake off the anxiety lately mentioned. I am often exercised by debates in my mind on the propriety of recommending to my Brother & Sister to come out to Philadelphia or New York & to bring all the Childrens with them. I mean also to include your family with your consent. From Mr. M's (18) Letter which I now return there is no reason to expect your Wife will come with Mrs. B., & you have put an effectual Bar to your personal attendance, which seems to be the most desired.  I may truly say my mind is exercised by this subject, it is very often so, & as often do I wish for that aid, at least for that alleviation, which might be derived from your conversation. But you seem to be wholly   absorbed by one passion. If you have marked for your self any limit, I am ignorant of it. What shall I say to our friends on this head?  Upon a review of the former parts of this Letter I have determined how it ought to be disposed of after you shall have read it, you will undoubtedly be of the same opinion & act accordingly.  My Dear Son. I pray God to bless & guide you &ca. I will thank you for as explicit an account as you can collect of all the prizes lately made in Delaware on both shores.(19)  P.M. 10th. I am just returned from a large Company where I heard a discussion I should say such a discussion on the necessity of appointing a Quarter Master General & the recommendations of your friend & his opinions treated with so much indiscreet freedom & Levity as affected me exceedingly & convinced me that your suspicions of a baneful influence are not Ill founded. It would give me too much pain to repeat the Comparison drawn or rather the parallel between de Arendt & Hay.(20) Let us have a little more patience. We shall discover if there is a system to overturn & Rule-for aught I know, to throw into Confusion & bring in the ancient Rule.  ""

4702,dg008478,1778,John Witherspoon s Speech in Congress,"""John Witherspoon's Speech in Congress
  Mr President, [January 8, 1778] (1) I am sensible, as every other gentleman in this house seems to be, of the great importance of the present question. It is of much moment, as to private persons, so to every incorporated society, to preserve its faith and honour in solemn contracts: and it is especially so to us, as representing the United States of America, associated so lately, and just beginning to appear upon the public stage. I hope, therefore, we shall detest the thoughts of embracing any measure which shall but appear to be mean, captious, or insidious, whatever advantage may seem to arise from it. On the other hand, as the interest of this continent is committed to our care, it is our duty, and it will be expected of us, that we give the utmost attention that the public suffer no injury by deception, or abuse and insult, on the part of our enemies.  On the first of these principles, it is clearly my opinion, that we ought, agreeably to the spirit of the first resolution reported,(2) to find, that the convention is not so broken, on the part of General Burgoyne, as to entitle us to refuse compliance with it on ours, and detain him and his army as prisoners of war. I admit that there is something very suspicious in the circumstance of the colours, when compared with his letter in the London Gazette, which makes mention of the British colours being seen flying upon the fort.(3) I agree, at the same time, that the pretence of the cartouch boxes not being mentioned in the convention is plainly an evasion. They ought, in fair construction, to be comprehended under more expressions of that capitulation than one-arms, ammunition, war-like stores. They were so understood at the capitulation of St. John's. In this present instance many of them were delivered up, which certainly ought to have been the case with all or none. And once more, I admit that the detention of the bayonets in the instances in which it was done, was undeniably unjust.  As to the first of these particulars I am unwilling to distrust the honour of a gentleman solemnly given; and therefore as General Burgoyne has given his honour to General Gates, that the colours were left in Canada, I suppose it is substantially true, whatever small exception there might be to it. The colours seen flying at Tyconderoga, were perhaps old colours occasionally found there, or perhaps taken from some of the vessels lying at the place, and left there when the army proceeded farther up the country. This is the rather probable, that if the regiments in general had had colours, they must have been seen very frequently by our army in the battles, or upon the march.  As to the other circumstances, they are so mean and little in their JANUARY 8, 1778  Portrait of John Witherspoon  nature, that I suppose them to have arisen from the indiscretion of individuals, quite unknown to the commander in chief, or even to the officers in general.  We ought also to consider that it was so unexpected, and must have been so humiliating a thing, for a whole British army to surrender their arms, and deliver themselves up prisoners to those of whom they had been accustomed to speak with such contempt and disdain -that it is not to be wondered at, if the common soldiers did some things out of spite and ill humour, not to be justified. To all these considerations, I will only add, that though the want of the colours deprives us of some ensigns of triumph which it would have been very grateful to the different states to have distributed among them, and to have preserved as monuments of our victory, the other things are so trifling and unessential, that it would probably be considered as taking an undue advantage, if we should retain the whole army here on that account. I would therefore, Sir, have it clearly asserted, that though we are not insensible of those irregularities, and they may contribute to make us attentive to what shall hereafter pass before the embarkation, we do not consider them as such breaches of the convention, as will authorize us in justice to declare it void.  On the other hand, Sir, it is our indispensable duty to use the greatest vigilance, and to act with the greatest firmness, in seeing that justice be done to the American States. Not only caution, but what I may call jealousy and suspicion, is neither unreasonable nor indecent in such a case. This will be justified by the knowledge of mankind. History affords us many examples of evasive and artful conduct in some of the greatest men and most respectable nations, when hard pressed by their necessities, or when a great advantage was in view. The behaviour of the Romans when their army was taken at the Caudine Forks may be produced as one. The conduct of the Samnites was not overwise; but that of the Romans was dishonourable to the last degree, though there are civilians who defend it. Their consul, after his army had passed through the yoke, a symbol at that time of the utmost infamy, made a peace with the Samnites. The senate refused to ratify it; but kept up a shew of regard to the faith plighted, by delivering up the consul to the Samnites, to be used as they thought proper. That people answered, as was easily suggested by plain common sense, that it was no reparation at all to them to torment or put one man to death; but that if they disavowed the treaty, they ought to send back the army to the same spot of ground in which they had been surrounded. No such thing, however, was done. But the Romans, notwithstanding, immediately broke the league; and with the same army which had been let go, or a great part of it, brought the unhappy Samnites to destruction. Such instances may be brought from modern as well as ancient times. It is even the opinion of many persons of the best judgment, that the convention  entered into by the late duke of Cumberland, was by no means strictly observed by the court of London.(4)  When I consider this, Sir, I confess I look upon the expression in General Burgoyne's letter to General Gates, of November 14, as of the most alarming nature. For no other or better reason, even so much as pretended, than his quarters were not so commodious as he expected, he declares the public faith is broke, and we are the immediate sufferers. In this he expressly declares and subscribes his opinion, that the convention is broken on our part; and in the last expression, we are the immediate sufferers, every person must perceive a menacing intimation of who shall be the sufferers when he shall have it in his power.  Being sufficiently settled as to the principle on which I shall found my opinion, it is unnecessary for me to give an account of the law of nature and nations, or to heap up citations from the numerous writers on that subject. But that what I shall say may have the greater force, I beg it may be observed, that the law of nature and nations is nothing else but the law of general reason, or those obligations of duty from reason and conscience, on one individual to another, antecedent to any particular law derived from the social compact, or even actual consent. On this account, it is called the law of nature; and because there are very rarely to be found any parties in such a free state with regard to each other, except independent nations, therefore it is also called the law of nations. One nation to another is just as man to man in a state of nature. Keeping this in view, a person of integrity will pass as sound a judgment on subjects of this kind, by consulting his own heart, as by turning over books and systems. The chief use of books and systems is, to apply the principle to particular cases and suppositions differently classed, and to point out the practice of nations in several minute and special particulars, which unless ascertained by practice, would be very uncertain and ambiguous.  But, Sir, I must beg your attention, and that of the house, to the nature of the case before us-at least as I think it ought to be stated. I am afraid that some members may be misled, by considering this declaration of General Burgoyne as an irregularity of the same species, if I may speak so, with the other indiscretions or even frauds, if you please to call them so, of withholding the cartouch boxes, or hiding or stealing the bayonets. The question is not, whether this or the other thing done by the army is a breach of the convention. I have for my part given up all these particulars, and declared my willingness to ratify the convention, after I have heard them and believe them to be true. But we have here the declared opinion of one of the parties, that the public faith is broken by the other. Now, the simplest man in the world knows, that a mutual onerous contract is always conditional; and that if the condition fails on one   side, whether from necessity or fraud, the other is free. Therefore we have reason to conclude, that if Mr Burgoyne is of opinion that the convention is broken on our part, he will not hold to it on his. He would act the part of a fool if he did. It is of no consequence to say his opinion is ill-founded or unjust, as it manifestly is in the present case; for whether it is just or unjust, if it is really his opinion (and we should wrong his sincerity to doubt it) the consequences are the same with respect to us. Men do often, perhaps generally, adhere with greater obstinacy to opinions that are ill, than those that are well founded, and avenge imaginary or trifling injuries with greater violence than those that are real and great. Nay, we may draw an argument for our danger from the very injustice of his complaint. If he has conceived the convention to be broken on so frivolous a pretense as that his lodging is not quite commodious, after the just caution inserted by General Gates in the preliminary articles, what have we to expect from him as soon as he shall recover his liberty, and the power of doing mischief? It shews a disposition to find fault, and an impatience under his present confinement, the future effects of which we have the greatest reason to dread.  The more I consider this matter, Sir, the more it strikes me with its force. General Gates says upon the subject of accommodation, granted as far as circumstances will admit. Was not this proper and necessary? It was very natural to suppose that General Burgoyne, accustomed to the splendor of the British court, and possessed with ideas of his own importance, would be but ill pleased with the best accommodations that could be obtained for him, and his numerous followers, in one of the frugal states of New England. It was also in the neighbourhood of a place not in the least expecting the honour of such guests, which had been long the seat of war which had been exhausted by our army, and plundered by their's. One would have thought that the recollection of the ruin of Charlestown, the burning of which, if I mistake not, in a letter of his from Boston to England, he calls a glorious light, might have prevented his complaints, even though he had less elbow room than he wished for. But as circumstances stand, by what conduct shall we be able to satisfy him? When will pretences ever be wanting to one seeking to prove the convention broken, when it is his inclination or his interest to do so?  It has been said, Sir, that we ought not to take this declaration of his in so serious a manner: that it was written rashly, and in the heat of passion; and that he did not mean that we should dread such consequences from it. All this I believe to be strictly true. It probably fell from him in passion-and very unadvisedly. But is he the first person that has rashly betrayed his own mischievous designs? Or is this a reason for our not availing ourselves of the happy discovery? His folly in this instance is our good fortune. He is a man, Sir, whom  I never saw, though I have been more than once in England; but if I should say I did not know him, after having read his lofty and sonorous proclamation,(5) and some other productions, I should say what was not true. He is evidently a man showy, vain, impetuous, and rash. It is reported of General Gates, from whom I never heard that any other words of boasting or ostentation fell, that he said he knew Burgoyne, and that he could build a wall for him to run his head against I do not by any means approve of boasting in general. I think a man should not boast of what he has done, much less of what he only means to do; yet I cannot help saying, that this was a soft accurate prediction, which, with the event that followed it, plainly points out to us the character of General Burgoyne. Do you think that such a man would not take the advantage of this pretended breach of the convention on our part; and endeavour to wipe off the reproach of his late ignominious surrender by some signal or desperate undertaking? (6)  MS not found; reprinted from John Witherspoon, The Works of John Witherspoon . . ., 9 vols. (Edinburgh: J. Ogle, 1815), 9:108-16.  1 Although Burnett tentatively dated this speech January 2, 1778, there is reason to believe it was actually intended for delivery on January 8. Witherspoon's mention in the second paragraph of \""the first resolution reported\"" appears to be a reference to the first resolution of the revised committee of the whole report on the Saratoga Convention that was submitted to and approved by Congress on January 8, rather than the first resolution of the report on this issue that was offered to Congress on December 26 by the committee on the convention and then considered in committee of the whole on December 26-27, January 2-3. The first resolve of the December report dealt with General Burgoyne's ill-fated remark in a November 14 letter to General Gates that \""the public faith is broke,\"" which Congress did use to justify suspending the convention, whereas the first article of the January report concerned British failure to surrender to Gates all their \""cartouch boxes and several other articles of military accoutrement,\"" which was not considered in itself sufficient justification for suspension. Witherspoon was a member of the committee that wrote the original report submitted to Congress on December 26 and the revised version approved by Congress on January 8. Therefore it is probable that he prepared this speech for delivery on the 8th in order to remove any lingering doubts among the delegates about the wisdom and justice of delaying the return of Burgoyne's army to England until after the British court had ratified the convention. See JCC, 9:1034, 1054 55, 1058-64, 10:13-14, 16-17, 29-35; Burnett, Letters, 3:5n.2; and Henry Laurens to William Heath, December 27, 1777, note 1.  2 See JCC, 10:34-35.  3 See JCC, 9:1060.  4 A reference to the 1757 Convention of Klosterzeven, on which see Richard Henry Lee to George Washington, November 20, 1777, note 5.  5 A reference to a notoriously boastful proclamation issued by Burgoyne on June 20, 1777, that long riled many Americans. See Henry Laurens to John Lewis Gervais, August 17, 1777, note 5.  6 As part of his work on the committee appointed December 18 to consider alleged British infractions of the Saratoga Convention, Witherspoon prepared the following draft report. Whether it was submitted to Congress has not been discovered.  JANUARY 9, 1778  \""The Committee to which were referred the Convention of Saratoga & the Letters of General Gates, General Heath Sc General Burgoyne upon that Subject beg Leave to report the following State of Facts  \""That some of the Belts & car[t]ouch Boxes of the Soldiers were not delivered up with the Arms.  \""That the Word Accoutrements was not added to that of Arms in the Convention through oversight.  \""That the Case was the very Same at the Capitulation of St. Johns and yet the whole were delivered up as comprehended under the Word Arms.  \""That many of the Bayonets were withheld though in general delivered up.  \""That many of the Muskets were twisted or damaged and the whole are now returned unfit for use.  \""That in the Opinion of General Gates this last was in a good Measure occasioned by want of proper Covering for them and other Accidents,  \""That no Standards or Colours were delivered up.  \""That General Burgoyne declared on his Honour that the Colours were left in Canada.  \""That there is Mention made in the Account published in the London Gazette of the taking Possession of Ticonderoga of the British Colours being seen flying upon the fort.  \""That General Burgoyne in his Letter to General Gates of the 14 of Novr says expressly that the public Faith is broke on Account of his not having so commodious quarters as he expected.  \""That General Gates in the Articles preliminary to the Convention did upon the Subject of Accommodation & other similar Circumstances take a Latitude from the Nature of the thing Saying as far as Circumstances will admit.  \""That General Burgoyne has refused to give the Names and Description of his Soldiers & refers to General Carltons Dismission of our Soldiers under Parole not to serve during the War.  \""That the Committee on Enquiry find that General Carlton made all our Prisoners sign their Names to a Paper containing Columns describing the Province, County & Town from which each of them came.  \""Resolved that the whole Soldiers under General Burgoyne shall before they embark be obliged to sign a Parole with a Description of their Place of Abode exactly in the same form as that required by General Carlton.\"" Witherspoon Papers, DLC.

We are also told that Doctor Guyon is about leaving No. Carolina and going to some of the Islands. We thought it our duty to give your Excellency this information that should the report be true, you might be able to put a stop to Doctor Guyon's going off. It is said he has recd. very large sums JANUARY 9, 1778  of money, we hope there is no real foundation for a charge of so black a nature but at any rate a proper inquiry should be made.  It gives us great concern that we have not recd. a single letter from your Excellency or from the General Assembly since their meeting, it is absolutely proper that some General officers should be appointed for our State to Command the Troops from there, we were under difficulties & wrote to the assembly desiring that we might be informed wch. of the Colos. should be promoted. Colo. Martin has resigned, we should be glad to receive any Commands that the Assembly may think proper to send us.  We got the favr. of Alexr. Gillon esqr. of So.

The President will send all the resolves of Congress himself to the different states wch. is one reason of our not writing so often as we should.

4707,dg008483,1778,Committee Examination of John Folger,"""Committee Examination of John Folger
  12 Jan. 1778. The examination of Capt. John Folgier (1) of Nantucket taken before Mr. Lee, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Duer, Mr Dana, Mr. Lovel.  The examinant left Nantucket, Septr. 4. 1775-went from thence to England, as mate of a vessel, of which Cpt. Shubal Worth was commander-arrived in London, in about five weeks. The vessel was sold in London to Mr. Dennis DeBert from whence she sailed December 6 following with the same captain, & the examinant still mate, on a whaling voyage to the Brazils, but was taken at the Cape De Verd Islands by the Portuguese; & this examinant remained at the Cape De Verd Isles, the vessel being sent to Lisbon, where she was acquitted. From the said isles, this examinant sailed, in the ship Nancy, captain Js Scott, belonging to Francis Roach, on a voyage to Falkland Islands; was upon monthly wages on board said vessel- left Falkland islands Feby. 1777; arrived in England the beginning of May. From England he went to Holland, 1st June 1777, arrived there 3 days after. His intention in going to Holland was, to go to France; whither he did not choose to go directly; he went immediately to Havre de Grace from Holland. His view in going to France was, to get into American employ-called on Mr. Deane at Paris-had no letter to him. Dr. Franklin a distant relation of his. Dr. Franklin asked him, whether he inclined to take a privateer. He told the Doctor, he had never been concerned in the working of cannon, & therefore could not take the command of a privateer. Saw a Mr. Lee, but not Dr. Lee, at Paris. Dr. Lee was gone to Prussia. They desired he would be still, until they could determine what part of the French coast he should go to-was in Paris 18 days, leaving it July 15. It was concluded that he should go to Havre to view the Pacifique, which the Commissioners intended to buy; he reported her very deficient, & she was not purchased. About the 20 of July, Capt. Hinson came  JANUARY 12, 1778  to Havre, & he was jointly to view the Pacifique-remained at Havre for two months, in the employ of the Commissioners. After the vessel was given up, he sent word by Mr. Silas Deane's Brother to the commissioners, that he should tarry for further instructions. About the 9 of October, he received a letter from Mr. Deane, desiring him to take the command of a swift sailing vessel, intended to go with dispatches to Congress. He received with the letter a packet for Congress. He found at Havre a sloop, in which he arrived in America. He did not know the person who brought the letter from Mr. Deane with the packet. He lodged at Madame Moreaw's, in which one Haley her son in law also lodged. The house was near the water upon the pier. He eat with Haley & his family. Captain Hinson lodged in the same house. The person, who brought him the packet, told him where the vessel lay. Hinson, Haley & Examinant always eat together in a common room, but had each a chamber to themselves to sleep in. The chambers were not locked. On the arrival of the person from Paris, examinant was abroad, so the person was told to call in an hour. The person when he came again, desired the examinant to write his name which he did; on which the person gave him the letter & packet, & gave Capt Hinson another, about the size of the letter directed for him. The messenger could talk little English. The examinant read his letter to Hinson, who after reading his own letter, asked the examinant what he determined upon. The examinant told him he intended to come, upon which no more passed upon the subject. After receiving the packet, he directly locked it up in his trunk, in the chamber where he lay, & believes his trunk was not opened by any person but himself. He gave a receipt to the Messenger for five packets-one was marked \""dispatches,\"" wrapped in brown paper-sealed in two or three places-tied with a string-no wax over the string-no impression on the seals. A packet sealed with no directions, was also delivered: He thought it further instructions to him, broke it open; found it contained two letters, one for Mr. Hancock, & the other for Richard Henry Lee Esqr. Another packet directed to Barnabas Deane of Connecticut-another to the same which was only a plan of Paris-gave a receipt mentioning only the number without describing the packetts. The 5th packet was newspaper, covered in the same manner with the rest, but had no direction: he broke it open before he knew what it was. The papers in the cover marked A, were enclosed between the newspapers directed to Richard H. Lee. He opened the packets on the road from Wilmington to New Bern about 28 miles. The Wrapper contained two packetts, both of which he delivered to col. F. Lee last night. This packett got wet by a bottle of spirits in his saddle bags. No packet directed to R. Morris Esqr.-moved his trunk & the papers in it from his lodgings at Havre, on board the vessel. Capt. Errico was the commander of the sloop in which he sailed from Havre. She was cleared out for St.  Domingo, & manned with Frenchmen. Two Passengers; a Frenchman, Boileau; a German, Pittnier. The examinant lay in a separate cabbin & took great care of the chest, in which the papers were. He informed the captain & mate, that he had dispatches for Congress; the passengers knew it. He never mentioned at Havre his having these papers to any one but Hinson. He took a boat at a town three leagues below Wilmington (North Carolina) & brought his trunk to Wilmington on the 21 of December. He landed at the first town on the 20 of Decr.-was ashore three or four hours-had his keys in his pocket-left his trunk in the vessel. The whole of the papers were put in a canvas bag, & tied up at Havre de Grace; where he put weights in it, in order to sink it-the bag was not disturbed from the time of his leaving Havre, until his arrival at the town below Wilmington, except once, on the passage, when he opened it, & took out the plan of Paris, which was under cover, directed for B. Deane. He lodged at Wilmington at one capt. Hinson's who kept a tavern, where he remained four days. Had a room to himself where the trunk & his chest lay-no key to the room. He sold all the things he could not bring in his saddle bags at public auction, having no more than 5 crowns which he brought from France. The next day after his arrival at Wilmington, he took out the iron weights. He left Wilmington the 24 Dec. last. He did not examine his bags, until he got 28 miles from Wilmington. He there examined them, & found Mr. Lee's packet wet as above. The main packet not in the same end of the saddle bags. He broke open none, but that one only which was wet. Within eight miles of Newbern, he met with govr. Casswell on the 26 Decr., & two other gentlemen, one a col. Alcott. They interrogated him so closely, that after some time, he told them he came from France in a French vessel, the captain of which was a stage behind, on his way to see His Excellency, upon which, one of the gentlemen told him, that was his Excellency, pointing to govr. Casswell, whom he did not at first know. They all lodged at the same house that night. He shewed govr. Casswell the letter he had from Mr. Deane, which he shewed to the President. He desired the Governor's passport which he procured-marked B & C. He asked his Excellency, not knowing whether he might not suspect him, as Mr. Dean's letter was unsigned, whether he had a mind to see his papers -took out the main packet directed Dispatches & did not think of his breaking it open-were in a private room together. The Govr. broke it open-the examinant informed him it never had been broken open before. After he had broken open the 3 seals, with which the wrapper was sealed, he run over the superscriptions of the letters, & saw to whom they were directed. He resealed the packet marked dispatches, putting into it, the same letters. When the governor saw the blank paper he said, he was surprized & did not know the service of sending clean paper so far. The examinant answered he was surprized & did not know he had clean paper   under his care. They both assisted in repacking the letters, & the next morning the governor gave him the passes. The passengers he left at Wilmington selling some goods they had brought. Boileau talked of coming into Virginia. On the road he found the covering of the large packet wet by rain, & then he wrapped it up in a piece of brown paper unsealed, having torn off the original wrapper, but put on no direction at all-arrived in York Town, about 3 O'Clock yesterday afternoon-put up at Steak's-shifted himself, & then went to deliver his letters. He mentioned to some persons at Steak's that he had letters for Congress, but did not stay to sit down before his going out to deliver them. Had no verbal or other message, to whom to deliver the packet marked \""dispatches\""-never saw Mr. Deane after he left Paris, or ever received any letter or message from him, but the letter sent with the packets, delivered to the President of Congress. He came passenger in the sloop from Havre. On his arrival at Wilmington in capt. Hinson's house, where there were several in company, he enquired for a continental agent, for he had goods for Congress; he was told, if You have goods for Congress, that is your man: the person, who told him, pointing to a gentleman then in the room. He informed the person he wanted his assistance. He shewed him the letter from Mr. Deane, & as it was not signed & interlined in one place, he would not give him any money or assistance, upon which the examinant told him, he should inform Congress, unless he would supply him. Shewed him also the joint letter from Mr. Deane & Dr. Franklin. Question. How did You know, to whom You were to deliver the letters or packetts given You at Havre, without directions. Answer. I was governed only by my own judgment, which was that they were to be delivered to Congress. He opened no paper in France; of this he is sure. Did You open the paper marked A? I did not. Had the seal any impression, when delivered to You? It had not. The wax run by holding it to the fire to dry. Had You any particular orders respecting the cargo of the vessel? I had not. How came You to apply to the continental agent at Wilmington, & inform him You had goods for Congress? I wanted assistance to get on my journey. Did You receive any money in France, from the Commissioners? Ans. I did, by their order, 42 Louis, & 12 Livres. For what purpose was this advanced You? To bear my expenses in France. I received it at Havre. Did You receive any money or credit from the Commissioners to bear your expences on the passage, or from the port of arrival to Congress. A. Neither. The paper marked A I knew to belong to Mr. Lee, because it was in the packet with the newspapers directed to him which I had opened.  Are you sure there was not a packet or parcel of papers nearly the Size of that directed dispatches, delivered to You, directed to Robert Morris? There was not. Was the wrapper which You put upon the main packet in place of its original wrapper, which You threw away because it was wet, directed in any manner whatever,  or sealed? No it was a perfect blank, tied by a string crossed over it. Had You any command in the vessel from Havre? None, unless Mr. Deane's letter gave it. Did You act as master or mate? No, I was only a passenger. How came You to say in the beginning of this examination, that You received a letter from Mr. Deane, desiring You to take the command of a swift sailing vessel intended to go with dispatches to Congress? I meant only, of the packet or papers. Where did You get the paper with which You wrapped up the main packet? On the road.  The examinant further adds, that there was a large packet, which he delivered to the President, who tore up the seal so far as to see that they were newspapers & said he was mistaken: it belonged to another person; & returned it to the examinant to deliver it, to Mr. Brown at Mr. Steaks's, which the examinant did accordingly. This packet together with one of near the same size, which the president opened, & found to contain only blank papers; were both, together with some letters, inclosed in one wrapper, which the examinant calls the main packet & which was wrote upon Dispatches. It is the same which Govr. Casswell opened, & the examinant afterwards took off the cover, & wrapped it up in another cover unsealed but tied, & without any direction, & delivered it so to the President.

  Gentlemen, York Town Janry. 12th. 1778.  Not having received any letters from you since the 26th of May we were severely chagrined yesterday upon the arrival of Capt. John Folgier, who, under the name of dispatches from the Commissioners at Paris, delivered only an enclosure of clean paper, with some familiar letters, none of which contained any political intelligence.  You will see by the within examination of Folgier (1) that he was by no means a discreet person fit to be trusted with what you committed to his charge; but, we cannot yet prove that he was wilfully connected with the robbers of the packet. The paper referred to by the letter A in the examination was a plain cover to plain paper which had been put into the place of an enclosure, probably very interesting, sent with the Public Ledgers to Colonel Richard Henry Lee. We shall endeavour to find whether the roguery was committed after Folgier left France; but, we must depend upon you to trace the circumstances from the time of your sealing to that of his embarking.  Congress have sent to Governour Caswell to explain the part he is said to have taken in the affair and to examine the ship-captain and the two passengers.(2) Should he confirm Folgiers narrative so as to make his veracity less problematical than at present, his confinement may be rendered easier to him; but, he must not be quite discharged till we hear from you.  There ought to be the greatest caution used with regard to the characters of all those persons who are confidentially employed by you. The connexion which Folgier since his leaving America, has had with persons in England & on the voyage to Faulkland's Isles cannot be thought favourable to our interests if his own family & native place are so.  We shall only add, on this subject, that Folgier, upon recollection, asserts that the largest packet delivered to him at Havre de Grace was directed \""Dispatches for Capt. Folgier\""; and he laments that he did not himself open it before he sailed. If this Circumstance is true, it accounts for Governour Caswell's opening the Packet.  We are with much Regard, Gentlemen, Your humb. Servts, Jno Witherspoon  James Lovell ""

  Sir Albany 12th Janu'y 1778.  I entreat that you will do me the Favour to inform Congress that, as soon as the Commissioners for Indian Affairs in this Department cou'd be convened, I attended them at this City.(1) The Result of our Deliberations they dispatch by Express. The Entreagues (2) and Liberality of our Enemies have made a deeper Impression on the Minds of many of the six nations than Congress apprehended. The Senecas and Cayugaes in particular can, I fear, no longer be regarded as Friends or even Neutrals; while the past Declarations of the Commissioners denouncing Vengeance against them for any Act of Perfidy or Hostility, which they might presume to commit, have engagd Congress, from a Regard to their own Dignity as well as the publick Interest, to proceed to more vigorous and decisive Measures than we had conceivd to be necessary.  But all this is explaind so fully by the Commissioners; as well as our Joint Sentiments on the part which ought to be pursued at the approaching Treaty, that it is needless for me to be particular.(3) These misguided nations must Feel the Power of the united States, since we have not the means of (4)4 preserving their Fidelity by our Bounty, and they slight our Condescention.  The other important object of my Commiss'n is put in a proper Train.(5) Secrecy with the Blessing of Heaven, will bring it to happy Conclusion. I can foresee no unsurmountable obstacle.

To my great grief & mortification I presently discovered the latter part of his information to be true, & accordingly Reported to Congress this Morning. The House was exceedingly chagrined by the disappointment & suspicions were so Strong against the Man, as to occasion an immediate examination into particulars which ended in an order to confine his person until some further enquiry shall be made into this mysterious circumstance.

Morris Esqr. & I sent it to his Clerk with eight other Letters & packets which Folger had laid on my Table.  By the Main Packet he means this, & that, & intimates that Your Excellency opened both-but the Mans behaviour is such as induces most of the Members of Congress to believe him an Arch Knave affecting the Fool. My private opinion is that he is a very confused stupid Creature altogether unfit for the charge which Mr. Deane committed to him & that some Emissary of the British Court played him a trick before he left France by robbing him of the original Packet & palming this Counterfeit on him. If he is a Knave, he has pressed & prevailed on Your Excellency to look into the packets in order to gloss his Roguery.

JANUARY 12, 1778  Very early after my arrival at the State House Philadelphia I discovered the spirit of party triumphant. I lamented the prospect exhibited to my view & predicted certain evil consequences which have naturally followed. I was a Stranger, a by stander, I was careful to take no decided part except that of Speaking & voting according to the dictates of conscience.  I will not boast of having been instrumental in promoting beneficial measures which from all appearance would otherwise have failed, nor of defeating attempts which if they had succeeded would greatly have injured our Cause-you would smile Sir to hear me say that America is a little indebted to me for her successes against the threatning flood of the invincible Burgoyne. If I were to attempt to prove this, it would be with no other view but this of shewing my steady opposition to party-you will conclude therefore that upon questions I have not been found always on one side.  I mean only to say, Yes Sir, I have long known there were divisions among those whose duty required from them as honest Men, Strict Union. I have observed such to be so carefully supplied as never to fail of keeping up a Spark of discord-hence I have often been induced to beleive there were Agents from our Enemies if not within Doors, yet too closely connected with some who sat there.  You will however be pleased to observe Sir, or I should rather say, you very well know Sir, there is no subject more abstruse than this of party, it is said to be the sinews of Liberty, I have neither Leisure nor abilities for going deeply into the enquiry, nor is it necessary. I will only say that party animosity between the Eastern States & the Inhabitants of New York is almost coexistent with the Inhabitants.  These are the grand divisions-each has its atmosphere, they are Sometimes very troublesome in their disputes which are carried to such extremes as seem to threaten a dissolution of all friendship, nevertheless, danger from a common Enemy will reduce them to good order & as it were by a Charm, instantly establish a coalition. I have said so much on this Subject in order to remove in Some degree the Strong apprehensions which you seem to be under from reports of prevailing parties in Congress-they make the Road rough but not impassable-so much upon party in general. Concerning the particular influences which you Speak of, I must acknowledge your conjectures are not ill founded. But I think the friends of our brave & virtuous General, may rest assured that he is out of the reach of his Enemies, if he has an Enemy, a fact which I am in doubt of. I beleive I hear most that is said & know the outlines of almost all that has been attempted, but the whole amounts to little more than tittle tattle, which would be too much honoured by repeating it.  All Men acknowledge General Washington's virtue, his personal Bravery, nor do I ever hear his Military abilities questioned but comparatively, with the fortunate event which you allude to, why  cannot General Washington grasp General Howe abounding with every advantage of situation & every necessary article for defence or attack-as General Gates conquered General Burgoyne, under every disadvantage of situation & reduced to the last extremity? Answers are easily given to such silly remarks, when one is disposed to reply.  In a word Sir, be not alarmed, I think it is not in the power of any junto to lessen our friend without his own consent, I trust his good sense & his knowledge of the World, will guard against so fatal an error. If you desire it Sir, Mr. John Laurens will communicate what I have written in confidence to him, I say in confidence, not because I am afraid of having my sentiments known. I speak them honestly & unreservedly upon every proper occasion but I very much dislike correspondencies which may be misunderstood & charged with design to foment dissentions-it is my constant endeavor to reconcile & make peace.  I am not insensible that General Washington has been in several Instances extremely Ill used by the neglect of those who ought to be his grand support & to prevent every cause of complaint on his part, but if I were with him half an hour & could persuade myself he wanted information, it would be very easy to convince him there has not any thing been designedly done or omitted to affront him. I speak of so large a majority as 9 in 10.  The General very well knows what we are, & will continue to make suitable allowances for all defects seeming or real-we are in a State of infancy, yet thank God, we are not quite so foolish nor so wicked as our Parent. Men whisper & very harmless things too of General Washington-loud bellowing Scandal appears in every Newspaper upon the name of his Antagonist Sir William. But I will dwell no longer upon these matters. A large Committee appointed by Congress of four of its own Members & three from the New Board of War will shortly be in Camp in order to concert measures with the Commander in Chief for the reformation of the Army. God grant every good purpose may be answered by their consultations-to these Gentlemen Sir you are particularly referred for an answer to your last favor without date relative to Monsr. du Pin de Montauban, & also for the desired promotion of Monsr. Gemaut.(3) The powers of this deputation are very ample, I will not say unlimmitted.  The Clothing which you had been informed of, Colo. Lee assures me is little more than a collection of old wearing apparel of all shapes & sizes & that the whole is appropriated.  You will learn by the dispatches now sent to General Washington, that Mr. Burgoyne is destined to pass the present Winter in Massachusetts Bay & the reasons which urged Congress to a determination which must undergo the Criticism of all the politicians in the Civilized World. I shall be happy to have the approbation of those in our own Country. If I had not honestly thought the measure justi-  fiable as well as necessary I would not have been a strenuous advocate in favor of it. I think he will appear to have been the dupe of his own policy. The intimation which he gave to Gen. Gates who was at Albany of a breach of Public faith was artfully enough insinuated calculated for a particular purpose but not intended for the view of Congress. If in this we have acted wisely, it will be set to our Credit in opposition to some of our supposed errors. I have the honour to be, Noble Sir &c &c.  ""

  Gentlemen, York Town 12 Jany 1778. I had the honour of receiving & reporting your Letter of the 10th to Congress this Morning. It is referred to the Marine Committee from whence you will receive a proper reply I hope by return of the Post.(1) Congress having received information by divers means of the arrival of the Cargo of Salt intimated in your Letter abovementioned, framed the Inclosed Act of the present date for securing if possible the whole for the use of the Army for which it is wanted in the extremest degree. As some days may elapse before the Governor & Council can act, I am directed to transmit the Copy inclosed as abovementioned to you & to request you to exert your endeavours to prevent a Sale or removal of the Salt until His Excellency shall give directions in consequence of the present recommendation & Resolve. The term \""secure\"" in the latter part of the Resolve, you may be assured comprehends the Idea of purchasing, & I have so explained it to the Governor.  It is expected that every freind to these States in your Town will give you all needful assistance to serve the Public in this momentous business; without Salt it will be impossible to lay up Magazines of Provision for the Army & I need not predict what will be the consequence of deficiency.

  Dear sir York 13th of Jany 1778 I have waited some Time, in Expectation of informing You with the Sense of Congress on the several Subjects mentioned in your agreable Favour of the 25th Decr;(1) but am not yet fully able to answer my Purpose.  A Committee is appointed from Congress & the Board of War, who in Concert with your Excellency have full Powers to form & execute a Plan for reducing the Number of Batalions now in the Service; to recommend the necessary Appointments of General officers; to determine on the necessary Reinforcements for the Cavalry, Artillery, & Infantry, & report their opinions on the best Mode of obtaining the same; to remove from office any officers of the civil Departments of the Army for Negligence, Incompetency, or Fraud, & appoint others untill the Sense of Congress can be known; to report the necessary Alterations to be made in the Regulations of these Departments; to remove all just Causes of Complaint relative to rank, confining it as nearly as may be to the military Line; & for other purposes mentioned in their Commission. The Members are Messers Fulsum, Dana, General Reid, & Harvey from Congress; & Generals Gates & Mifflin & Colo. Pickering from the Board of War. I sincerely wish that Dispatch may be made in this Business, & that the first Thing may be to consider of the necessary Reinforcements, that Measures may be immediately pursued to obtain them, the mentioning of this is however unnecessary to your Excellency.(2)  The Resolutions for allowing hereafter to officers the Care of their Retained Rations, & for enabling your Excellency to increase the Number of Your Aids,(3) I find by your Letters to Congress are at Hand; & the proposals of allowing to officers who shall continue in JANUARY 13, 1778  the Service to the End of the War & whose regiments shall then be reduced, half pay for a limited Time; of enabling officers after the War to sell their Commissions under proper Regulations; & of giving to the Widows of such officers as shall hereafter lose their Lives in the Service, pensions whilst they remain in a State of Widowhood, are now before Congress. The first has been largely debated, & I am apprehensive that it will meet with a negative;(4) there are many weighty Arguments against it, such as the Infant State of the Country, its Aversion to placemen & pensioners whereby G Britain is likely to loose her Liberty, the Equality of the Officers & Soldiers of some states before the War, & the bad Effect that such provision would have on the Minds of the latter; but I must. confess that none of these weigh so much on my Mind, as the Necessity of making a Commission so valuable that a Dismission will not only be disgraceful to an officer, but injurious to his Interest. This will introduce that Subordination to civil Authority which is necessary to produce an internal Security to Liberty; And to the high Officers of the military Departments such authority as to enable them to establish Discipline, without which an Army can be neither vigorous nor successful.  Colo. Wilkinson is appointed Secretary to the Board of War which I hope he will accept, that the just Causes of complaint arising from his hasty promotion may be removed.(5) Should he refuse, I think Congress will be justified in taking effective Measures to remedy the evils resulting therefrom.  General Heath is directed to procure & send to your Excellency one thousand bell Tents, to prevent in future the Danger arising from heavy Rains at the critical Moment of an Engagement with the Enemy.(6) Is it not necessary that Measures should be taken by Congress or your Excellency for further providing against this Evil, by appropriating a Drummer, Fife, or some other officer in each company to carry a Bell Tent for the same, in Times of Action when the Baggage Waggons are ordered to leave the Army: that whether advancing or retreating the Soldiers may never be in Danger of having their Muskets & Ammunition rendered useless from the want of this Article?  I remain Sir in Haste, but with much Esteem & Respect, your Excellency's very humble Serv. E. Gerry  ""

  Dear Sir Janry. 13th. 1778 First & foremost, become a reconciling advocate for me with your dear lovely Portia, who, from the most rational tender attachment to you, is as angry with me as her judiciously patriotic Spirit will allow, upon a foundation which I hope you have been acquainted with, long e'er this day.  This hint must pass for an acknowledgement of the rect. of her letter of Decr. l9th and for all the answer which I have the courage to make.(1)  Mr. Thaxter must supply for my only mentioning that your favour of the 9th Ulto. is in my pocket. JANUARY 13, 1778  By consulting my Scrawls to Mr. Hancock (2) & to Mr. S. Adams, you will see why I seem so stingy of ink just now, who have appeared a prodigal in your eye not long since; when you have seen me spoiling whole quires of virgin paper with that black and mischievous Liquor.  As a Supplement to what I have Sketched to Mr. S A I give you a Specimen of the agitating Genius of the Men of Leisure on the Banks of Schuylkill. They have offered 13 quarto pages of hints & observations to Genl W. for his concurrence and conveyance to Congress.(3) The spirit of those pages is contained in the following Analisis made by Secretary Thompson who was kept very near the Letter. You will perceive a roguish sneer in the preface & conclusion, but it is what no whig Farmer could avoid.  For an honest Clue take the word recommend instead of make Lt. Generals &c &c.  A short & easy method of promoting the interest of America, of increasing her internal strength & her reputation with foreign powers.  1 Let all colonial distinctions be done away.  2 Let each state send to head quarters a proportional number of men to compose an army of 60,000 foot, 6,000 Artillery and 8,000 horse, besides artifficers &c.  3 Let the Commander in chief & 6 officers whom he shall be pleased to make Lt. Generals model & officer this army as they please, and, that those whom they dislike may not be much disgusted by being turned out of service, let them have lands assigned, by Congress; and, if the Chief & his 6 Lieut. Genls. think proper to give them a letter of recommendation, let them have a pension for life equal to one half of their present pay.  4 To attach officers to the service let them hold their commissions for life, with liberty to sell out, when the commander in chief pleases, and let them have half pay, if the army is reduced.  5 To establish a due subordination let none be promoted out of turn but such as the Chief & his 6 Lt. Generals please.  6 Let all above the rank of Coll. be dignified with and after the war have pensions suitable to their rank.  This done, Order & Regularity & Discipline will immediately take place. Every soldier will be clean & neatly dressed, his head combed & powdered; Sloth, Desertion & Disease will be banished the camp of the American army; nay, what is more, they will be well fed and their meat will be boiled instead of fried or broiled.  I have a private letter from Docr. Franklin of Octr. 7th by which I find he and I are fully together in Sentiment as to Applications of foreign Officers for employ here so that my labours will be diminished in future.(4) Our Commissions & Instructions to W L-& R I (5) got to hand the beginning of Octr. You will know the rest from Mr.   Hancock as I have not time to tell the roguish Story to all my Colleagues. The public papers were stolen either in Fr. or in Amer. Or sold by the bearer.  Genl. W informs me that the Journals are found, upon my Directions, near the Gulph, and shall be forwarded directly;(6) The 3d Vol. will immediately be set on foot after finishing the 2d by printing the month of Decr. 1776.  I shall only say on this half Sheet that I am Your most affectionate humble Servant, Js Lovell  [P.S.] I mistake I must go further or break a much more important promise.

  Sr Jany the 14th [1778] Mr Davenport has been detained & the above letter with him long beyond my expectation, as has Majr. Spencer who has been here now more than a week with the representations from Genll Spencer to Congress of the State of the Enemy at Rhodisland their late Increase, & of the ships of War lately arrived & of the weakness of our Army & state of Defence in that quarter, applying for relief; and that the Troubles & burthens lying upon him are so great that he requests liberty to resign his office that the Command at Rhodisland may be Committed to some other, his resignation is accepted tho to Continue in Command till another General officer arrives to take his place.(1) Congress taking under Consideration the forces necessary to be kept up and raised from the New England States had before them the report of the Comtee. from the Several Eastern States att Springfield agreeing on the proportion of Each of the New England States for the Defense of the State of Rhodisland proposed adopting that plan as most Just & equitable being agreed by those States, but on Consideration of the present defenceless State of Connecticut, the Continental forces being drawn of so much from New York Department down this way, & the remainder as I have lately heard, ordered up to Fishkill, which leaves Connecticut open & exposed to the ravages of the Enemy, from Horseneck to Stonington, a large body of the Enemy at New York & probably by this time advanced parties up as far as Mamaroneck, our whole coast exposed daily to the Enemies Ships which must oblidge the Connecticut to keep up a large force for their own defence, no help or assistance from Congress (2) or any particular State, Massachusetts & New Hampshire in no part Exposed to the Enemie at present, on which I concluded that Connecticut ought not to send any Troops to Rhodisland but that the other New England States ought to defend Rhodisland; & Insisted that Connecticut ought not to be called upon for any assistance that way; but all to no purpose. The New England States you may depend upon it were JANUARY 14, 1778  all against me, Enforced by the agreement at Springfield; I, single, and alone from Connecticut, no one to assist or support me. I opposed & opposed but in Vain. Connecticut must take care of themselves & assist the other New England States with one Regiment in the defense of Rhodisland; was obliged to submit, tho in my opinion against reason & Justice & had only the satisfaction to fret & scold a little while after as usual & then submit with quietness to what I could not help or prevent. The determination of Congress to detain Genll Burgoyne &c I perceive has somehow now got abroad therefore to no purpose any longer to conceal it, it was only meant to keep it secret till the order for that purpose reached Boston that proper precautions might be taken on such an event. Have the honor to be Yours, E Dyer  [P.S.] I have to add that one Mr Folgier of Nantucket who has since he left that place been to London, from thence a voyage to the Falkland Isles & back to London, from thence as he says he went to France to get employed by our Agents there in the American service, he so far gained the confidence of Doctr Franklin & Mr Dean as to be Intrusted with a special Packet containing as we Imagine matters of great Importance. It was sent to him from Paris to Haver de Grace to his special care to Deliver to Congress. He landed att North Carolina, came to this place a few days agoe, delivered his Packet to the President & when it came to be opened nothing in it was founded, but 8 or ten sheets of clear blank paper done up packet wise. It appeared to have been opened the outside cover gone. He pleads his Innocence, says he has taken the utmost care of it never suffering it to be out of his hands or possession except a few minutes looked on by the Govr of North Carolina in his presence only to please him. He was Intrusted with a packet in order to procure a pass to York Town. He has been strictly examined and at present Committed to prison till the matter can be further enquired into.(3) He says it must have been taken out & the blank paper put in in its way from Paris to Havre as some packet before he says had been Interrupted in the same way. It is probable the original Inclosure is gone to the Ministry at London instead of coming to America and possibly may be of as much service in the whole as if it had come . . .(4) but at present we are very uneasy at the disappointment. There were several private packages most of which appeared to have been opened but no letter of consequence.(5) Arrived there is one for Mr. Barn. Dean which is forwarded to him. E.D.  ""

  Sir, York Town Jany. 14th. 1778. Congress hath lately resolved, for reasons specified in their Resolution, to suspend the Embarkation of Genl. Burgoyne and the Troops under his Command; until the Convention of Saratoga shall be ratified by the Court of London and notified to Congress. This Circumstance, the Arrival in Newport Harbour of a number of Men of War, some of them of the line, and my Fears of our not being able to sustain an Attack made by the Troops at Rhode-Island joined by Marines and Seamen from those Men of War have made me anxious for the Town of Providence particularly; against which the Enemy would, in my opinion, bend their whole force if they should think there was any Probability of Success. Impressed with these anxious feelings I have represented the State of Rhode-Island to Congress in such a manner as to procure a Resolution recommending it to the States of N.H., M.B., R.I. and C. to immediately furnish and constantly keep up in the State of Rhode Island the Troops stipulated by the Committee which met at Springfield last July. The President will immediately transmit to you authentic Copies of the Resolutions hinted at, and also of other Resolutions enter'd into in Consequence of Genl. Spencer's Letter, whose Resignation Congress have accepted.  I am suspicious that the enemy will consider the suspension of the embarkation of General Burgoyne and his troops as an infraction of the convention, attempt to rescue those troops, and at the same time pour their resentment on our State. If these should be their Ideas it seems to me that Providence will be their object. Because when possessed of that town they might communicate by Spies with Burgoyne, a Day might be fixed by them for the latter to burst with his Troops through the Guards, and at the same time the Enemy might advance from Providence to meet and receive them. If the Assembly should not think this chimerical they will without doubt be on their guard, and make the best preparation they can to repell any Attempt that may be made upon our State. Apprehensions of an Attempt of JANUARY 14, 1778  this kind have induced Congress to recommend it to the State of Massachusetts-Bay to increase the number of the Guards upon Burgoyne's Troops, and to the New-England states to furnish and keep up their Quotas of Men in the State of Rhode Island as before mentioned.(1) The Provision made for the Payment of the Troops in that Quarter will prevent any demands on our Treasury in future. I hope that this Consideration, and the Question about the Payment of the Expence of the late inglorious Expedition not being yet decided, will induce our State to put off any Application they may have in contemplation to make to Congress as long as they can.  We have nothing new. Both Armies are very quiet. Heartily wishing that everything in our quarter may be so, until we shall be ready to make a vigorous Effort for the recovery of Rhode-Island, I continue to be with great Respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. hble Servant, William Ellery  P.S.

  Sir, York Town 14 January 1778. My last to you was dated the 5th Inst. & sent by Messenger Weir- since which I have been honoured by yours of the 17th & 25th December-both of which having been committed to the Board of War & Board of Treasury are by one or other so far mislaid as to deprive me by the present opportunity of means for giving any reply except such as may be found in the Act of Congress of this date directing the Issuing of Salted provision & restricting you in making advances of Money to the Officers in the Commissary, Quarter Master & Clothier generals departments, to Cases of absolute necessity only- which Act you will find under this Cover-as you will an Act of the 6th directing that One Thousand good Bell Tents be sent to the Army under General Washington's Command.(1) You will likewise receive two Copies of an Act of Congress dated the 8th Inst. for suspending the embarkation of Lieutt. General Burgoyne & his Troops until the Convention of Saratoga shall be explicitly ratified by the Court of Great Britain & notified to Congress. One Copy of which you are directed by another Act dated the 12th which will accompany the abovementioned to deliver to Lieutt. General Burgoyne; by the same Act you are enjoined to order such  JANUARY 14, 1778  Transports if arrived, or when they shall arrive, to quit the Port of Boston immediately.  Congress have directed General Washington to renew his demand on General Sir Wm. Howe for Passports for Vessels to transport Provision & Fuel for General Burgoyne's Army,(2) but as good Policy dictates that we should keep the Court of Great Britain from a knowledge founded upon authentic accounts of the Act of Congress of the 8th Inst. as long as we can fairly do so, that demand will not be made until Congress shall be informed that you have delivered a Copy of the Act to General Burgoyne. The transporting Provision under such expected Passports, admitting such will be granted, may therefore be long delayed; from these considerations you will judge Sir, of the expediency or necessity for applying to General Burgoyne to order Provision for the use of his Troops from on board the British Transport Vessels which probably from motives of ceconomy he will interpose, for it is not intended he shall ever depart until he shall have paid up all his Accounts in terms of a Resolve of Congress lately transmitted you.  I have the honour to be, With very great regard, Sir, Your obedient & most humble servant,

  My Dear son York Town 14th Jany. 1778 This will be delivered to you by Monsr. le Chevalier Lanuville a Gentleman who at a very great expence is come to offer his service JANUARY 14, 1778  in our Army, you will learn from himself in a very few words, his pretensions & expectations & in further conversation I believe you will find him to be a Man of great Military talents.  He anxiously wishes for a Yes or a No-to his applications to Congress, this is his own Language-but as he had determined to go to Camp, where the Committee of conference to whom all power for the present is given, it was judged best to defer an answer until their return. If you can with propriety introduce him to some of those Gentlemen-I know you will shew him every civility that circumstances will admit of.1 Tell me your thoughts on our determination to suspend the embarkation of Mr. Burgoyne. I am not answerable for nor do I claim the merit of the manner in which the thing is ushered into the World, 'tis plain & simple not free from exceptions I know. All that was done while I sat in the Chair & is mere fringe & Lace from an infant manufactory-but for the thing itself, the propriety, the justice & the sound Policy I contended in the Committee of the whole-so well was I persuaded of the rectitude of the Act, I declared I would rather lose my whole Estate, than hear a majority of dissenting Voices. The grand Resolve passed Nemine Con.  This great determination will have its effect in Europe, in England more especially, whether good or Evil time will inform us. I feel strongly confirmed, that the Act is good & therefore entertain no alarming apprehensions. I pray God protect you.

  My Lord, York Town Jany. 15. 1778 Your favours of Decr. & Jany 3d but lately came to hand. The want of provisions in the Army gives me great concern. Complaints of this kind are frequent. This deficiency arises in part from a defect in the System, but much more from the indolence, Ignorance, disaffection or avarice of the Commissaries. Measures are frequently taken to remedy the Evils, but all hitherto have proved ineffectual, and will I believe continue to do so untill a reform is made in the department, which is now under consideration of a Committee.(1)  On Sunday evening a person with dispatches from France Arrived in this Town, but upon opening the Packet to our great Surprize we found little more than blank papers; every Letter of importance had been taken out, and their places Supplied by clean paper. Some few Letters on Commerce remained but not one Containing any intelligence-how or where this villany was effected is hard to determine. The bearer recd. the dispatches at Nantz with a Letter of directions from our Commissioners, which Letter he produced. He says the Packet was longer on its way from Paris than usual and he Supposes the Letters were taken out before he recd. it, as measures of that kind had been practised before; he gives but a poor Acct. of his proceedings-Acknowledges he had opened several of the bundles to see if no instructions were inclosed for him. He is ordered to be confined till the affair can be enquired into.  Your Lordship mentions the want of Military merrit in a Gentleman lately promoted;(2) I always before heard him mentioned as having great Military Abilities, and this was all I had ever heard concerning him. The kind of Correspondence he carried on with General G____(3) was not known at the Time of his promotion. His Letters to General Washington is of late date.(4) Was the business now to be done Congress would probably Act otherwise. A dissention among the principle Officers of the Army must be very injurious to the Publick interest. I can't say what Congress will do; by the Letters sent them An Appeal seems to be made, which I trust will be carefully attended to. The Authority & Credit of the Commander in Chief must be Supported.  Upon such a disagreable Subject as contained in Genl. Gates Letter to General Washington,(5) I recd some Consolation at finding the offense so highly complained of fall (as it must fall somewhere) upon a person for whom General Gate's unbounded friendship and earnest solicitation had procured a promotion very injurious & disgustful to the Army. I was not in Congress at that Time, but think the measure injudicious. To remedy this hasty Step, Congress lately took  Mr. W_____ from the Military line by appointing him Secretary to JANUARY 15, 1778  the board of War of which Mr Gates is President;(6) what will be done with him next I can't say. If he betrayed the Confidence of his Pattron he may do the same by his Country,(7) and from the Opinion Mr Gates seems to have of such a Character, I think he will not hereafter chuse to have him near his person.  As General Burgoine & his forces are to be detained untill the Convention of Saratoga is rattified by the Court of London, and as there are now a Considerable force of the Enemy at Rhode Island with a large Number of Kings Ships, it becomes necessary to keep up a respectable force at Boston & near Rhode Island, And as General Spencer is dismissed agreable to his application, some General will soon be appointed to take the Command in his place.  As the British Ministry have found means to Obtain the Letters for some time past, sent from our Commissioners at Paris, we remain ignorant of what is doing there; from the intelligence our Enemies get that way I am persuaded they are much Alarmed, for tho' they mayn't find the French determined on a War they will find them doing every thing else for us in their power.  Your Lordship no doubt hath heard of the Arrival of Barron Stuben at Boston. He is Lieut Genl., Quarter Master Genl. and Aid de camp to the King of Prusia; he is coming to Visit the Army, he Asks nothing but to serve as a Voluntier, he came without any Contract and does not propose to enter into any with us. I consider him as sent by his master to gain a true information of the Strength & Commerce of this Country, and withal to lend us the aid of his Military Abilities.  As the Reduction of the battalions is become necessary, a Committee of Congress with three of the board of war are going to the Army for that purpose. It is said many good officers are weary of the Service and wish to Resign unless they are placed upon a permanent establishment. That they Are weary & wish for ease I don't wonder, but who are there engaged either in Civil or military departments but are weary and wish for retirement of the Service they are engaged in would Admit? The service in every part is Severe. The Militia in some parts are half their Time out, the Legislatures spend much of their Time & Substance; Congress Set day & Night taking little Rest. Must we all therefore Resign? This is no Time to talk of Ease & retirement, let us first establish our Liberties, our desires of ease will then be Obtained. I do not mention this as applicable to your Lordship. I never heard of your desire to turn your back upon a service the most noble & Glorious. Some however do it. We all engaged I hope upon Patriotick Principles. May the same Seperate from every Lucrative and Ambitious view, carry us through this Contest. I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's Obedt. & Humble Servt.

  Sir, York Town 15th Jany 1778 I was honoured on the 7th Inst. by the Receipt of your favor of the 9th Ulto. by the hands of Mr. Thaxter.  I desired that Young Gentleman to call on me the Morning after he arrived intending to have conversed with him & to have aimed at  JANUARY 15, 1778  some plan for procuring a suitable employment for him, but I found that by the Interest of other friends he had been introduced into the Secretary's Office. You may depend upon it Sir, if it shall hereafter be in my power I will not fail to join those friends in order to give him a lift in proportion to his merit. For my own part long experience has convinced me that inaccuracy & confusion attend supernumerary Clerks in any Office. The Duties of mine demand the Eye & hand of the principal & afford sufficient, oftentimes heavy, employment for every moment between adjournments & meetings of Congress, borrowing deeply of the Night & stirring very early every Morning but there is not half work enough for a Clerk who would have the whole day for the easy business of Copying which is all he ought to be entrusted with, I have a Young Man who serves me tolerably well in that branch & at intervals he finds other necessary work to do.  You will learn Sir, that by the present conveyance I have dispatched an Act of Congress of the 8th Inst. to Your Council & two Copies to General Heath, for suspending the embarkation of General Burgoyne, it would have given me great pleasure if a copy could have been obtained for you in time for the present conveyance but to this hour I have not been able to procure one for any State southward of this. This is one of the benefits arising from superabundant assistance, I could have Copied the whole with my own hand in twice 24 hours.  I feel myself exceedingly anxious lest Great Britain should get the start of us in publishing in her own terms & Glossings an account of this great event at the several Courts in Europe. I believe the Committee of foreign Correspondence have yet only one Copy which I delivered no sooner than yesterday to Mr. Lovel & if I understood him he did not intend to transmit that by the present conveyance, I beg leave therefore to submit to your consideration the propriety of procuring immediately accurate Copies from the originals above mentioned & dispatch one by every Vessel that shall Sail for any part of France within a Month or Six Weeks from Boston directed to our Commissioners at Paris. I would wish in order to guard against accidents to send at least six repeated Copies, the expence of Copying compared with the benefits which may arise from such early intelligence is not equal to a drop compared with the Ocean. Certified Copies under your hand will enable the Commissioners to represent our conduct in a true light at all the foreign Courts & to defeat wicked attempts to calumniate Congress which will be made by British Agents. I think our Act stands upon a firm bottom. It will appear when truly Reported to be as justifiable as it was necessary. Let us if possible for once take the lead of those who trust in lies & misrepresentation for success.  Mr. Lovel will no doubt inform you of the trick played upon us by palming a bundle of blank Papers for a Packet of Letters & dis-  patches from our said Commissioners & according to the account which the bearer of the above mentioned Counterfeit gives, this is the third instance within a few Months past of Interception on the other side of the Water; in the present Case there is too much the appearance of unpardonable remissness in those friends of ours, who ought to be incessantly watchful.  It appears to me, our circumstances there are deplorable & require immediate aid to keep us in any tolerable Credit with out self Interested friends & from being despised & hissed by our Enemies.  Concerning the Captivity of Mr. Howe I wish for it as anxiously as you do, but I will not Insure it this Winter, Providence has favoured us in the discovery of his designs with the Troops of the Northern Hero & I trust enabled us to frustrate them, otherwise strings of Captivity might have appeared even about York Town.  I flatter my self with hopes of your determination to accept the Commission which I lately transmitted you & of your proceeding very soon to attend the duties of it. I pray God to give you a speedy & pleasant passage & to protect you against the hands of our Enemies.  My Compliments to Mr. S. Adams whom I long to see in Congress again & believe me to be with great Esteem & regard, Dear sir, Your most humble servant, Henry Laurens  ""

  South Kingstown State of Rhode Island &c Honored Sir, January 15th. 1778  I have had the honor of Yours of the 15th of December inclosing the Resolution of Congress of the 12th of the same Month appointing me one of the Commissioners for inquiring into the Causes of the Failure of the late intended Expedition against Rhode Island under the Command of General Spencer and into the conduct of the General Officers employed upon that Occasion. The Commands of Congress must be honorable-And the Politeness with which You so happily communicate them must be powerful Inducements to a ready Complyance with Them. Nothing but those Considerations, and the great Propriety I conceive of the Measure could have persuaded me to a Task, I felt myself very incompetent to, and which will be rather invidious, as the ground has already been travelled over by a Committee of the States more immediately concerned in the Expedition. I am much releived however under my Difficulties when I consider the Light I shall receive from the other Gentlemen under Appointment. The Zeal I have for the Honor of the American  JANUARY 15, 1778  Arms and the public Service, while it creates a proportionable Diffidence, stimulates me to an Exertion of the Powers I have. Happy shall I be on this and every other Occasion my Services should prove as beneficial to my Country, as it is my most ardent Wish they may. I shall endeavour Sir to meet the Gentlemen at Providence on the Day appointed.  I have the Pleasure to inform You that the Credit of the Currency is reviving. A vile bartering Trade which had very generally taken place is almost entirely done with. Goods are brought out from the Reposatories of monopolizers, and Shops are numerous and well filled-Extortion shakes-and a virtuous concern for the public Weal very apparently emerges from that Gulph of Darkness, Folly and Destruction wherein she had been too long bound by the Artifices of Our open Enemies-Tories-and those Pretenders to Whiggism. But She requires the constant attention of Congress to give her full Strength and to preserve Her from a like Disaster.  When I was at Providence the Keeper of the Loan Office informed me he had very few certificates left. That he had often wrote to Mr. Govit respecting the Office but never had any Answer. I apprehend that all the Loan offices ought to be immediately well supplied, as the Time draws nigh when Lenders may be foreclosed from Drafts for the Interest in France. The current will every Day run stronger into the Loan offices.  Upwards of twenty Men of War and One hundred and fifty if not two hundred Transports are now in Our Harbour of Newport chiefly it is presumed from the Deleware. The great number of Sailors and Marines that must be on board with at least 3500 Soldiers upon the Island renders the Safety of the Towns and Estates upon the Rivers and Bays very precarious, and puts a Load upon this State, that without more Assistance than we have yet had from our Sister States and more constantly supplied, must bear it down and end in its Ruin. It is to be wished that Congress would consider Our State and Situation. It is to be acknowledged that Congress have born, and doubtless will continue to sustain chief Part of the Expence-but save this (and money alone will not support a State against a formidable Enemy) This State has drawn no Continental Aid. But Her Sons have marched in as great Proportion as the other States and joined the Continental Army-have fought Their Battles and nobly defended Their Garrisons. But I need not add, I know it is the Wish and Intention of Congress to afford equal Assistance where it is equally wanted. I have the Honour to be Dear Sir, Your most obedient and very humble Servant, Hy Marchant  ""

We Should have sent an answer to the first before this Time, but have waited for the resolutions of Congress on the report of this Committee respecting the principal parts of that letter. We now inclose you the resolutions of Congress on all points about which you requested information, excepting that of Pay and Rations for officers not in actual service, which is postponed for further consideration.(1)  When Congress shall have determined thereon we will transmit to you their Resolution. We inclose you likewise a Resolution of Congress of the 9th of Decemr. and the opinion of the Marine Committee of the 25th of March from their Books which hath long since been transmitted to the Continental Agents; and also twelve blank Commissions and fifty Warrants. You will inquire for such Continental officers as are out of employ and commissionate them, and not others, unless such cannot be found.  A Bill drawn by the Honorable Thomas Cushing Esqr. superintendant of the building of the 74 Gun Ship and frigate in Massachusets Bay hath been presented to Congress and paid, and is charged by the Marine Committee to your Board, for which he must be accountable to you. The amount is 13359 Dollars. You will please  JANUARY 16, 1778  to inform him that applications for Money and any thing respecting these Ships ought regularly to be made to you. In answer to yours of the 16 December we observe what you have said respecting the equipment of a Number of Brigts to employ our officers not in actual service and to Cruize on the Trade of the enemy is a measure that cannot be gone into at this time.(2) The Dispatch must pursue her intended Voyage-The Necessity of fulfilling our Contracts requires it. A voyage is planned for the Mellish and we shall have employment for the Schooner and every other Vessel we can procure. We have wrote to the Navy Board in this District and to Maryland about the purchasing flour and Iron for the use of the Navy in your department (3) and so soon as we shall have got things in a proper train shall give you notice of it.  We are at a loss to determine precisely what you mean by the distribution of Prize Money among supernumerary officers as to each Vessel a Certain Number of Officers is assigned among whom and the seamen the prizes are to be distributed, all above that number are useless and cannot be entitled to a share of Prizes otherwise than Privates.  We are sorry to find that you were under the necessity of augmenting the wages of the Carpenters in Connecticut. As Committees are met at New Haven to regulate the Prices of Provisions and other Articles we hope you will be able soon to reduce the wages to sums proportionate to such regulations.  In answer to your last of the l9th of December, The account of the arrival of Captain Chews valuable prize gave us great pleasure. We hope the Boston will be soon at sea; and don't doubt but you will take proper Steps for the preservation of the Warren, Providence and Columbus. How many of the Continental Agents could have paid Commodore Hopkins the one twentieth part of all prizes taken before his suspension and since his arrival from the Bahamas we cannot conceive when the inclosed determination of the Marine Committee of the 25th of March was immediately transmitted to them for their Government.(4)  As to a Supply of Cash we presume before this Time you have received the Warrants granted the 3d of December for 100,000 Dollars which we think you could not have received when you wrote the l9th December. We send you a Copy of the New Signals for the Navy of which you will order your Clerk to make out Copies and see that they are delivered to the Commanding officers of the Ships in your district as soon as may be.

Washington, and three members of the new board of war, Genl. Gates, Genl. Mifflin and Coll. Pickering.(1) The expediency or inexpediency I believe will chiefly depend on our States supplying at least our own Militia that shall be called out with provisions, at the Continental expence, grounded on yr. offer and surely every nerve will be exerted, for if we do not retake our Capital this winter, besides the horrid devastation the Enemy may make next Spring in this State when reenforced, when shall we be able to rout them out of Philadelphia? If the voice of Providence may be concluded from the offers of neigbouring States in addition to the Continental Army, and our own Strength surely we may say without presuption, on this and many other accounts, now is the most opportune occasion. Maryland has offered 3000 Militia, Virginia 10 Regiment besides 2000 new Recruits to fill up  JANUARY 16, 1778  her Battalion, No. Carolina besides that New Jersey is full of ardour and would fly to the attack. I trust no discouragement will be given by our State. I know that the shameful want of Provisions is to be attributed to an erroneus arrangement of the Commissarial Department, but it is no time for recriminations. Cannot our State engage skilful patriotic purchasers, and in different parts of this and in the neigbouring States, with full exertion gain the necessary supplies of meat as well as bread provision.(2) Baron Stuben a Lt. general and experienced Officer in the King of Prussia's Service has offered his Services to Congress which are accepted, and he required to repair to Gen. Washington's Hd. Quarters. The Business of the Committee with the three Gentl of the board of war & Gen. W are to reform the army by reducing the Regiments and introducing decipline. The Baron may be very useful on the occasion. I am respectfully, Sir, Yr. most ob. huml. Servt,  Danl. Roberdeau P.S. The Council will naturally correspond with Coll Reed on this occasion who may have considerable wait in the Council at Head Quarters.  ""

  Sir War Office Jany 17th 1778 I have been duly honoured with your Favour of the 11th instant.(1) The Comittee to whom I communicated it feel themselves happy in the Anticipation of the Supply they shall acquire from your Exertions, the Necessity whereof still continues & Things yet bear the same unfavourable Aspect.(2) Pork can be procured here at £4.10 per hundred but Salt is not to be had for curing any large Quantity. The Comittee will not prescribe Price or any other Matter to you as they are so perfectly satisfied of your better Judgment in the Business arising within your State. The Seisures & Certificates in Consquence of them were intended to be levelled against & given to Engrossers & Speculators great Numbers of whom abound in the State of Maryland equal at least to Persons of that pernicious Cast in any other State.(3) They extend their Purchases & Influence into this State wherein the Board of War have had repeated Information they have purchased up great Quantities of Provisions & every Article wanted for the Army. These avaritious & dangerous People had raised the Expectations of the People so high that no reasonable Price would command their Comodities. This Consideration induced the Idea of Seisures & Certificates & the Comittee cannot but think that the severest Steps would be justifiable with People whose sole Motive was Gain. Any Loss they may sustain will be but a proper Punishment. As to the Persons who grow or raise Provisions on their Farms the Case is to be sure different. The Comittee are sensible of the Justice of your Excellency's Observations as to the Bay Navigation. They shew too the Necessity of forwarding everything we can during the Winter when the Men of War do not venture so high up the Bay. Your Sentiments as to the Necessity of building Boats of a proper Construction have been laid before the Marine Comittee who have had some such Measure in Contemplation & will no Doubt immediately take Steps for having them built. Mean time if your Excellency can have Tobacco Flatts, Shallops & other Craft fitted for a temporary Purpose all Expences in hiring, buying or repairing them will be borne. The Treasury Board will take Care to furnish the necessary Supply of Cash & either transmitt it to you or pay your Drafts as you shall deem  JANUARY 17, 1778  most proper. I enclose the Information herewith sent for your Excellency's Consideration & Enquiry & have the Honour to be, Your very obed Sevt, Francis Lightfoot Lee  ""

  Sir,(1) 17th Jany 1778.  The Letter signed by your self & Brigadr. Gen Patterson dated 21st December came duly to hand.(2) I presented it immediately to Congress, & it was referred by the House to the Committee appointed to inquire into the Causes of the loss of Tyconderoga-of which I should have advised you some days ago, but deferred writing from an expectation of bringing the Committee together & of proceeding so far in the enquiry as would have enabled me to have transmitted you an Account somewhat more interesting than a Simple acknowledgement of the Receipt of your Letter which is all I have at present to offer, except to assign a reason for what might otherwise appear to you, to be neglect on the part of Congress. Two of the three original Members of the Committee, Mr. J Adams & Mr R H Lee, had retired from Congress-of which I reminded the House some days before your Letter appeared, in consequence of which the Revd. Doctor Witherspoon & Mr. Dana were added to the Committee.(3) These Gentlemen have not been unmindful of their duty, but unable after several attempts even to enter upon that part which we are speaking of. The business before Congress for a Month past has been uncommonly extensive & burthensome, too much of it, which ought to have been performed by Gentlemen who are largely paid by the public; these circumstances have rendered it impracticable for the Members to give that dispatch which they wish for to every branch & besides we had been waiting in expectation of receiving further accounts in answer to Enquiries which had been made in several departments Northward & Eastward. Mr. Dana is now ordered on a Committee to Camp where you will have an opportunity of speaking to him. In his absence Mr. Witherspoon & my self will prepare for making a Report immediately after his return to Congress.  I beg leave to assure General Patterson & your self that I feel sensibly for your honour & although I am so closely employed by the necessary duties of my Office as not to be allowed quite time for common refreshments, I will exert my endeavors to bring this Enquiry to an Issue & to releive you from a State of suspense which must have been very painful.

  Jany. 17th. 1778 Your favor of Octr has come to my hand this week.(1) I am well persuaded that all your blottings woud not only do you the credit hinted at by the Poet whom you quote, but be quite sufficient to embellish the performances of some who take to themselves vast merit for their Writings. And I sincerely lament that you did not arrive early enough at Paris to blot & correct the first MS works referrd to in my criticisms of July last. They were vile Catch-pennies.  I have wrote to you by this opportunity officially in Committee concerning the robbery of the Dispatches sent by John Folgier;(2) but I must here take up that subject again as I am Individually of opinion that the man is honest tho' I can by no means celebrate his discretion.  I beleive the theft was committed by some one intimately connected with your affairs, who knew the nature of all the Papers intended to be sent.  Had only the main Dispatches been stolen, I shoud not be so sanguine as I am in my belief of a bosom traitor being concerned. But some valuable paper was taken from the midst of a parcel of Gazettes wch. were under seal to R.H. Lee & directed probably by the same person who superscribed the other parcel of Gazettes for him, but did not I believe seal them, as the impression is not the same made use of upon a Letter which came safe for him. Now why was not the large handsome Packet for Robt. Morris unseald, why was  JANUARY 19, 1778  not that for President Hancock wch. containd the several Copies of Anecdotes respecting T. Morris. Why was not the one for B. Deane which had on its outside a pressing recommendation to forward it by Express at the first convenient stage after landing? Why was not yours to me who am a Delegate as well as R.H. Lee, mine containing many pieces of Baron Steuben's writing. All those Seals were sound & original, as well as all Mr. Izards. The reason is evident. The theif knew the only two Enclosures of public concern, For I take R.H. Lee's to have been such as well as the main packet. This you can know by enquiring of his worthy Brothers. The hand writing & Seals of the Covers of the two parcels robbd might have afforded some clue but you see by the minutes of examination that both those Covers were thrown away.(3)  ""

  My dear Brother, York Town, Pensylvania. January 20. 1778 As the Committee for foreign affairs write fully on public matters, by this opportunity, I need not trouble you on that score.(1) I will only observe that I think America stronger than ever; but as we began the war empty handed, & have ever been put to this shift; we have never been able to establish any system in the different war departments in consequence of which our expence has been much greater than it otherways need to have been. This has occasioned our paper money greatly to depreciate, & of course the expence is greatly encreased. It is therefore essential to have a fund in Europe, to enable us to support the credit of our paper. Our bror. Richard, who is now in Virginia, desires me to inform you that he has received the pocket dictionary which you sent him. I fear our Enemies will receive great advantages from the intelligence in the Packet by Folger, which they have rob'd us of. Are you sure you have no traitor about your persons? Our Enemies are so adroit in the Arts of corruption, & so powerfull in the means; that it requires the utmost circumspection. I am sorry we are still to support the whole weight of British power; I hope we shall be able to bear the burthen, but cou'd [wish?] France wou'd ease us of part; her not doing it cools the zeal of America for a connection with her. It gives me uneasyness that we have not been able to profit from the abilities of many French Officers who have offer'd their service. Being overstocked with Officers, before their arrival, & their not speaking our language, have been great impediments. Many of them are returning, I fear disgusted. I hope you have made Europe acquainted with the real importance of Philadelphia. We really suffer little by its loss, except being deprived of many valuable Artists; however we have still enough.  I do not perceive by the London Papers you sent us by Folger that the People of England are much distressed by the War; I fear they were so replete with riches, that it will take a long time to exhaust them.  Your brors & Sisters, and their families are all well. My love to the Alderman, tell him I have recd. the goods he sent by Barron & thank him. Col. Tayloe recd. his packets, I beleive by the same opportunity.  God bless you both. Francis Lightfoot Lee  ""

An Epicure would have said something about the clams but you turn me to the prophesies of Isaiah. Child Man is no word in use among us or perhaps I should tell you it would suit as well as the one chosen by Father West, suit, I mean, now the Veterans are absent, I would not have you think, however, that the Gentry you hint at are allowed to look after their private affairs to hide them from the public; a Committee is ordered to examine what papers are now at hand; but it was expected that Mr. J. Adams & Coll. R.H. Lee would collect some materials, tho' absent. You cannot have been more surprized than some here have been chagrined at the notice taken of St. C .(2) You could not expect more smartness in a Resolve which was meant to rap a Demi G- over the Knuckles, than what you found in the one hinted at. What a fatality attends some men in the choice of their favorites! It seems as if honest men are not to be found in the 13 United States sufficient to make aids de Camp, Secretaries and privy Councellors to one great Man, whom no Citizen shall dare even to talk about say the Gentlemen of the Blade.(3)  `Genl. Gates is arrived here; I suspect he will not consent to go to camp on the Committee mentioned.(4) In short I begin to think our Army will not be properly reformed, thro' the winter, which is half gone already.  Mr. Dana is gone on with Genl. Fulsom. I ought to have told you that both my Colleagues have altered their minds about Establishment of Half-pay. They see the aspiring temper of a set of men who are always talking about wounded feelings, spirit of a Soldier, honor dearer than life, &c &c when degrees of rank are in question, tho on other occasions those feelings, that Spirit and that honor have been quite problematical.

  Gentlemen York Town in Pensylvania, January 21st. 1778 We mean in this letter to give you a succint view of the state of our military affairs. You must long before this reaches you have been made acquainted with the signal success of the American arms in the northern department, particularly the several Engagements in that quarter previous to the surrender of General Burgoyne & his whole army to General Gates. Since that time Ticonderoga & Mount Independence have been evacuated by the enemy, so that the whole of that Department is now in our possession. The Indians are perfectly quiet and we have lately received intelligence that those formerly in the interest of our enemies incline to our side, as also that the inhabitants of Canada in general where the enemy have but small force are much disposed to favour us. General Burgoyne and his troops are now near Boston; and on account of several very exceptionable parts of his conduct Congress have resolved that he shall not be suffered to depart till the convention of Saratoga is ratified by the Court of London.  A part of the enemies army is still in possession of Newport in Rhode Island. An expedition intended to dispossess them of that place, on account of some mistakes & neglect of those who were to make the proper preparation for it, was obliged to be laid aside, but, we expect, will some time hence be resumed. As to the armies in this state, General Howe is still in Philadelphia but possesses no part of the country round it. General Washington's army is in Huts to the westward of Schuylkill refreshing & recruiting during the winter, and it is in contemplation to call in a number of Militia and attempt to expell Howe before he can be reinforced in the spring. A part of our army is stationed at Wilmington and they with the militia on both sides of the river have been very successful in taking several of the enemy's vessels since winter set in. A committee of Congress has just set off for the army to assist in regulating it for the next campaign & concerting measures for the most early & vigorous operations.  Copies of newspapers & of the proceedings of Congress relating to the Convention of Saratoga are sent to you by this conveyance, besides which we hope you will have the advantage of information from Mr. Adams in person.

That on the 16 Octr. after the preliminary articles were agreed, & the treaty drawn up in due form, & approved by general Burgoyne, & his approbation & ready concurrence in every article signified by capt. James Henry Craig to col. Wilkinson, genl. Burgoyne manifested a disposition to break off & commence hostilities.  That by the 2d preliminary article of major gen. Gates which was agreed to by lieut. genl. Burgoyne, the officers & soldiers were permitted to keep the baggage belonging to them: and by the 4th preliminary article of lieut. general Burgoyne, agreed to by major gen. Gates, \""no baggage was to be molested or searched, the lieut. genl. giving his honor, that there are no public stores secreted therein.\"" JANUARY 21, 1778  That notwithstanding this, cartouch boxes were carried away.  That at the capitulation of St. Johns on 2d Nov. 1775, whereby the officers & men were to retain their baggage & effects, & to deliver up their arms, the cartouch boxes & other military accoutrements were delivered up.  That these things being known, Congress issued an order to take descriptive lists of the non commissioned officers & privates comprehended in the convention of Saratoga, as a security, that what yet remained of the convention to be fulfilled by them might be complied with. That on the 20th Novr. gen. Burgoyne refused those lists, & on the 23d of the same month justified his refusal & asserts that Sir Guy Carlton & himself released from Canada many hundred prisoners troops upon their bare parole of not serving against the King 'till exchanged; & that they have since had no other dependance than that of public faith that those men have not been indiscriminately employed in arms.  That notwithstanding this assertion, it appears from the original list of the prisoners released from Canada, now lodged with Congress, that the provinces, counties, & towns to which the prisoners released belonged, were annexed to their respective names; which for the greater security of the conquering party, were in the hand writing of the respective prisoners.  That the fifth preliminary article of lieut. gen. Burgoyne viz \""upon the march the officers are not to be separated from their men, & in quarters the officers are to be lodged according to rank & are not to be hindered from roll calling & other necessary purposes of regularity\"" was \""agreed to\"" by major gen. Gates \""as far as circumstances will admit.\""  That in his letter of the 14th Novr. to Major gen. Gates, lieut. gen. Burgoyne complains that \""the officers are crouded into barracks, six & seven in a room of about ten feet square & without distinction of rank\"" & that \""he & gen. Philips after being amused with promises of quarters for 8 days together, are still in a dirty miserable tavern\"" &c. & concludes with this paragraph & charge \""while I state to You Sir this very unexpected treatment, I intirely acquit M. Gen. Heath, & every gentleman of the military department, of any inattention to the public faith engaged in the convention. They do what they can; but while the supreme powers of the State are unable or unwilling to enforce their authority, & the inhabitants want the hospitality or indeed the common civilisation to assist Us without it, the public faith is broke, & we are the immediate sufferers.\""  That application has been made by lieut. gen. Burgoyne to gen. Washington for leave to embark with the troops at Rhode-Island, or some port in the Sound.  That gen. Howe has sent transports to Rhode-Island to take them in there.   That gen. Pigot in a letter of the 5 Decr. informs gen. Burgoyne, that the Reasonable, man of war, with 26 transports from the Delaware, were arrived off the harbour mouth.  ""

  Dr. Sr. Wmsburg 22d Janry 1778 On my return to Congress I found the speakers Letter informing me my resignation was accepted by the House of Delegates and that I might as soon as I pleased return home which I did after staying abt. a week to put the Business we had been sent upon to Camp in a proper train, the Issue of which I had then every reason to expect wod. be according to the wishes of the Army but what the event has been I have not yet been informed.(1) Many reasons pressed me to retire from Congress and if I felt a concern it was only that in case I continued I might possibly be of some use in obstructing or endeavouring at best to prevent the mischevous consequences of those base Arts and machinations that are but too prevalent among some people and which it is the Duty of every good Man to resent and suppress. I knew not so much of these matters before I went to Camp as I discovered there, and after my return; for it was on my return only that I had the first intimation given me of the conduct and language of a certain popular Pensylvanian lately appointed to the New Board of War-of the disposition and Temper of another Gentleman of that Board whose name the fortunate events of last fall hath JANUARY 22, 1778  greatly exalted, I had before heard.(2) But whatever may be the design of these Men, and however artfully conducted, I have no doubt but in the end it will rebound to their own disgrace. You stand too high in the public opinion to be easily reached by their attempts and the same equal and disinterested Conduct, the same labour and attention, which you have manifested in the public service from the first of Contest, will shield and protect you from the shafts of Envy and malevolence. There may be instances, and these your good sense will point out to you, which require your Notice and the public welfare may be injured if passed over in silence, but in all other respects such petty Larceny attacks as these may be called deserve, as they will ever meet with, your Contempt. Two thousand men are ordered to be drafted to fill up our Battalions, and five thousand Volunteers raised to join you, and serve for six months, also a state Battalion in the room of Mathews's taken by the Enemy, and the Counties where draughts were deficient the last fall are ordered to make them good besides their proportion of the new levy. Colo. Braxton has a Letter of the 17th last month from Capt Chamberlain in one of the French Islands informing him that 6000 French Troops were there in the pay of Spain, that abt. the like number were daily expected, that the Spaniards had at Hispaniola abt. 10,000 Men & 12 Ships of the line, and it was imagined by some they meditated an attack upon Jamaica. Mr. Chamberlain may be as I suspect he is equally sanguine with Mr. Bingham. Every exertion is made use of to get a supply of provisions for the Army. We are this day to choose a Deligate to Congress to serve from 10th of May to 11th Augt. as R.H. Lee was chosen only to that time, and as some think he ought not to be longer continued as he will then have served three years, it is uncertain wh[ether] he will be chosen.(3) Mr. Mercer is the other Gentleman proposed. I am sorry to hear it is probable the Enemy have got possession of Mr. Pleasants portmantue as there were Letters of Col. Harrisons to you and myself in it, and containing some things I shod. wish them not to know.  Having left my chaise with Greentree in the City to be sold, and not having been able yet to provide myself with such a one as wod. suit me, I am obliged to make use of your Carriage untill I do. I shall send it to Mt. Vernon as soon after I am provided as lies in my power. As I am pretty confident I could rely on Col. Bannister (4) and Mr. Harvie respecting the conduct and Secrecy of any Business I shod. mention to them it may perhaps be in my power to be usefull to my Country by Communications to them of any matter you may think necessary and which you may Conceive to have been neglected or not duly attended to.

  Dear Sir, 22 Jany 1778 The 19th Inst. I was honoured by the receipt of your favor of the 7th which is now in view.(1)  It must be exceedingly mortifying to be so long a time as you have described without intelligence from our nearest freinds & the more so when there is reason to beleive the failure owing to vilainous interception, but mortifying as it is, we know it to be no uncommon thing in time of War, we must by every prudent means endeavour to guard against miscarriages, when they happen we must submit. I have had Some experience in disappointments of this kind.  You are exceedingly welcome my Dear General to make use of me either for the purpose of conveying or receiving your Letters. You may depend upon my attention & fidelity.  JANUARY 22, 1778  I think it more probable your Letters have been arrested on the other side the Atlantic than upon this. Congress received a few days ago a large Packet containing blank paper; a genuine packet had been Stolen at Nantz & this Counterfeit put in the place. Mr. Lee was played exactly the Same kind of trick & I have a Letter this Evening from Mr. Morris complaining of the loss of one of his packets from France. I have not the least doubt but that I have lost half a dozen.  I think myself as an American Interested in the safe conveyance of your public dispatches, because I am persuaded they are intended to procure benefits for my Country, but public or private when you commit any to my care I will forward them by such means as will keep them free from every risque but that of Capture at Sea.  You write nothing unimportant-every thing you write should therefore be forwarded under quadruple transcripts at least-if you send so many Copies for instance to Mr. Adams & request him to take one with himself & to send three by so many different conveyances directed to the protection of our Commissioners at Paris, or perhaps better to a friend at the French Court-there will be little ground to fear the loss of all of them.  I presented all the latter part of your Letter to Congress, your remarks & opinions on the State of the Army were received with Satisfaction. Most of the Evils complained of arise from measures adopted by the State, out of the province of Congress, nevertheless as the Legislature are convinced of their errors in the former Militia arrangements tis probable they will attempt to pursue a wiser Course, Congress have interposed so far as to recommend an alteration,(2) and I trust proper regard will be paid to their opinion.  No doubt it is \""painful to you,\"" to see Orders slighted but can one forbear asking this Question-whose fault is it? or giving this answer -the fault of the inferior Officers the frst time.  It is \""discouraging & fatiguing\"" & I may add disgusting to a Man of Spirit accustomed to discipline & punctuality to be a daily Witness of such irregularities as those you have marked. I feel pain even from thinking of such bane to good Service. If the General has a fault it is that which everyone who love & respect him Speaks of, but it should be remarked if he has that fault it is a very pernicious one, it is attended by a train of evil consequences which may prove the ruin of the Army & of the Cause for; the Support of which he is sacrificing all domestic enjoyments & risquing his Life. Were I near him in Rank & in the Army & convinced of his oversight in the particulars you allude to, Irksome & even dangerous as the attempt might be, I would find words, void of offence, for giving a proper alarm. This is a delicate Subject & I speak only hypothetically. I know not where the mistake begins.  You will have seen Dear Sir, the Resolutions of Congress, for suspending the embarkation of Lieutt. General Burgoyne & his JANUARY 22 1778  Troops-and the Report of the Committee upon which those Resolves are founded. If I do not ask too much let me intreat your sentiments -will the Courts in Europe acknowledge our Act to be founded in Justice & good policy?  Dear Baron, I am with the utmost Regard  [P.S.] I make no apology for a Letter hastily performed at 10 oClock at Night after a fatiguing days attendance in Congress &ca &ca.  ""

There could never be a more improper juncture for applying for new Commissions. In this view I feel my self unhappy because I cannot do all that I wish. Nevertheless my endeavours shall not be wanting to give a lift to this Young Soldier, I have just sent to seek him in order to offer at least, my countenance, & in a word Sir, I will make him a witness of my gratitude to Marquis delafayette for his friendship to my Country.  The Committee appointed to confer with His Excellency the Commander in Chief in Camp, are now Stripped of all their intended Military Coadjutors & will consist of Members of Congress. Perhaps I ought to except Colonel Reed who is at the same time a Member of Congress & a Military Man. General Gates, General Mifflin & Colonel Pickering are called to attend the duties of the appointment at the Board of War. An application to that Committee will be as likely a measure for obtaining employment for the Young Gentleman as  JANUARY 22, 1778  any I can think of, but it is much against him that he speaks not a word of English.  P.M. Just returned from Congress, where a Report was made from the Board of War making out a Seperate Command for Major General Marquis delafayette. This will undergo debate this Evening & probably you will very soon receive minute information from the Board of War or from the President of Congress. If the plan is Resolved upon the Young Gentleman in view will be provided for.(2)  I continue in the the most sincere Esteem & Respt.(3)  ""

  Dear Sir Janry. 22d. 1778.  I fear that, upon the recommendation passed some time ago to the states to seize necessaries for the army, our own state will exert itself while almost every other shirks.(1) Jersy & Maryland acknowledge the JANUARY 22, 1778  receipt of the Recommendations, with many objections. In short it was a measure founded in very horrid descriptions of the miseries of the army and of the abominations of monopolizers & speculators. I think a supply may be gained by other means. I was ever afraid it would discourage trade too much. I hope it will have a fair debate in the Assembly of our state. But I do not wish that the Massachusetts should like Maryland tell us that Salt is in plenty to be purchased at £15 per Bushell & recommend that we should rather buy 1000 Bushels at that than seize at £8.(2) What shall we come to at such a rate of purchasing? The demands upon the Treasury are horrendous. I hope our currency will speedily mend, but there is a now to be attended to. I hope to see a proper spirit in the eastern states to support the grand contest with Britain but I do not think they ought to bear a ten fold burden. A report is to be made next Monday respecting the Evacuation of Ty &c. I cannot tell yet what materials it is to be made out of, but will set about it as soon as this Express is sent away. We shall have full 17 members o'Monday, unlucky number!  Pray get a supplement to the 7th delegate (3) & hurry him on, at least, if you cannot persuade two others to come with him. My Cloaths are dropping off my back tho I see a [tailor?] weekly, and you know that Linnen & hose are not mended tho my Lady of the Tub demands 10/ per dozn. When therefore you have undergone the necessary repairs yourself I think conscience will call upon you loudly to consider the York Town Sufferers. Even you who have had a long term of drudgery must not demand more than 90 days of refreshment.  I am now at Evening & have just received your favor of the 5th. I find you & your Neighbours were in all the inquisitive just fretfulness which has long agitated many of us in this quarter. I have said enough to you in my former scrawls upon this Topic. I quit it, only giving you a wish which has strangely forced itself upon me this moment-that the Election of our General Officers had been made annual.

Morris-but I left out ostensible before reason. It is best as it will now be managed. The tale is too long or I would tell you the why & the wherefore.  (Bingham) writes Decr. 3d (5) that \""3 Divisions of troops have already arrived amounting to 7,000,\"" 6,500 of which are to remain at Martinque, tho' \""2000 are sufficient to garrison it, this certainly is an unequivocal argument of hostile intentions.\"" \""22 Ships of the Line besides Frigates will sail togetther from the Havannah with more than 15 millions Sterling in the month of December.\"" (6)  JANUARY 23, 1778  ""

I find the Board of War have transmitted you the Intelligence of your appointment by Congress to a Command, to  JANUARY 25, 1778  which I shall add no opinions of my own.(1) If you accept it, Monrs. Sigougne will probably be provided for & therefore I have said nothing to restrain his desire of returning to Camp. I had conferred respecting him with Mr. Lovel, who promised me his aid in procuring a Lieutenancy for this young Gentleman, but some difficulties were started from a consideration of the arrangements intended & expected at Camp which I alluded to in my last. To keep this Gentleman wasting his time & money in this extravagant Market would be cruel. He will learn at Camp your determination & at the Same time will have an opportunity of being presented to the Committee of Conference, therefore Sir, I have rather encouraged his inclinations to skip the Scene. I am writing with a frozen hand & the Gentleman waiting at my Elbow. Your kindness will overlook the imperfections of the present Address & believe me to be with the warmest respect &ca.  ""

  My Dear Sir York in Pennsylvania 25th Jany 1778 I have attended to your Sentiments on the Subject of Money and am equally unhappy with You \""to see Injustice, both to the publick & Individuals so frequently,\"" but how to remedy it, \""hic Labor, hoc Opus est.\"" The Mode proposed by an Act allowing Depreciation or Appreciation on Specialties may releive a few, but I fear that it would not have a general good effect.  The comparative Value of Money appears to me to depend on three principles; the quality, the quantity, & the plenty or Scarcity of the Articles, which are generally considered as Necessaries of Life.  With Respect to the quality, it matters not much whether it is paper or Species, if a Confidence is placed in the Government, & the quantity does not exceed the Sum required for a circulating Medium. To prove this, have We not frequently seen paper in these States, preferable to Gold or Silver of the same nominal Value, as it was more portable & equally good for any other purpose within the State? True it is, that if the Government is in Danger of an Overthrow, or is supposed unable to redeem the Money, It's Value will be proportionably diminished, but I beleive that our Currency suffers no present Injury from either of these Causes.  But when the quantity is increased beyond it's due Bounds, whether JANUARY 25, 1778  Species or paper, the Currency must necessarily depreciate. This is one great Cause of the Evils We now feel, & therefore We knew that by lessening the quantity, We shall find releif. Taxation is an effectual Remedy as far as it goes, but whilst the War continues, It must be assisted by others that are more extensive. Loans from the Inhabitants of the States are safe & ought to be promoted by all the Means in our Power. Whilst the Interest is to be paid in Bills of Exchange, I was in Hopes that the Citizens of America would have fully supplyed the Loan offices, but find it otherwise. Surely it is not from the Want of Money, for an assertion of this Kind would be contrary to Experience: It must arise then from the present Want of Zeal or an apprehension of Individuals that they shall be Sufferers by the Measure. If the former, ought they not to be addressed by Congress & the respective States, & excited by every Argument to supply the necessary Means for supporting the War? if the latter their Fear is groundless, for it can easily be demonstrated, that the Value of the Bills of Exchange which they are to receive for their Interest, will increase in an inverse Ratio to the Depreciation of the Currency. Confiscated Estates, if the Recommendations of Congress are carried into Effect, will produce large Sums for this purpose. An Estate in Connecticut of a Refugee with the Enemy, I am credibly informed amounted before the War, to £50,000 Currency. Is not the Value enhanced since, & ought not the States without Delay to realize such Interest. We have directed the Commissioners at the Court of France & Spain to apply for a Loan of Two Millions sterling, which is to serve as a Fund on which Bills of Exchange are proposed to be drawn for sinking Part of the continental Currency. This I hope, with the Establishment of an Office to answer the Bills that shall be drawn for Payment of the Interest on Loan Office Certificates will claim the immediate Attention of the Commissioners. Let Us determine to go on & multiply the Measures for reducing the quantity until it is accomplished, & I doubt not We shall answer the purpose.  But one Thing further appears necessary, which has not hitherto met with your Concurrence, I mean, a general Regulation of prices thro the Continent; from the Want of Which the plan in N England has once miscarried. Many of the Articles imported from abroad, or captured by privateers, are necessaries of Life, & in such Demand from the Scarcity as to enable the Importers & Retailers to exact from the publick exorbitant Profits. The Evil does not end here, the farmer, finding that foreign Goods are high increases the prices of produce in proportion to the highest prices of such Imports & thus the Money is depreciated excessively. Would not this be the Case if the Currency was in Specie, & there was not a greater Sum in Circulation than was necessary? Perhaps by attending to the Matter We shall find that it would, for Avarice is not to be satisfied by Gold & Silver, any more than by paper Bills. The Importer & Retailer un-  restrained by Laws, would in the one Case as well as the other, have the Inhabitants in their Power, & by their exorbitant Demands would oblige the Farmers & Manufacturers to rise in the same Proportion, in order to support themselves & Families, & thus accomplish a Depreciation. A very good Reason may be assigned for the present Difference of prices, when Articles are paid for in Gold & Silver. These have a more extensive Circulation, & the present high prices of produce renders it necessary to obtain Species for Exportation; but by reducing the quantity of paper, & curbing Extortion, the prices of produce will naturally fall & Gold & Silver will not be often wanted to send abroad, & never by Traders at Home, unless, as I said before the State is in Danger. Has not every Legislature frequently interposed & provided restraining Acts, when by some unhappy Catastrophe or other Accident, many of the necessary Articles of Life have become scarce? & if this had not been done is it not evident, that during such Scarcity, some of their Inhabitants must have been a prey to others? I am sensible, after so lengthy an Epistle that the Subject is copious, & much may be said on both Sides, but it is evident from three Years Experience of most of the States, that Trade will not so regulate itself as to reduce the excessive prices of Articles therein, but that unrestrained in every Respect, it has been attended with a great Depreciation: And we have not had any Experience to determine the Effect of a general Regulation of prices, because the partial Attempt of a few States to restrain their Inhabitants, whilst those of the other States were permitted to make enormous Fortunes, must necessarily have produced the greatest Uneasiness, & created an Opposition that was not to be withstood.  Mr Thaxter is in the Secretary's Office & is much liked, he might have had the other place which You proposed, but was fearful of residing with a Gentleman troubled with a Disorder which often discomposes the calmest Minds.(1) His Merit will probably soon entitle him to promotion.  The Cloathing of the Army is a Matter of great Concern, & I sincerely hope that the Commissioners will consider it as meriting their immediate Attention. When Cloth arrives, It is almost impossible in many States to find Tradesmen to make it up, & when this is accomplished, the Work is so slighted that the Cloaths are not durable. You may remember, that when the Cloathing was ordered twelve Months past, some oeconomical Gentlemen urged that part of it should be sent in Cloth, & to gratify them We have probably lost a thousand or two of our bravest Men. I hope that proper persons will be appointed in France to superintend the Business of making up Cloaths for the Army, & that Cloth will not in future be sent in the peice.  I have this Day inclosed in a Letter to Mr Sproaut (2) the £4 which You owe him, & shall consult him on the best Method of sending  your Chest to the North River. He is at a great Distance from hence, being as I am informed at a place 30 Miles below Philadelphia on the Jersey Shore. The other Chest shall be sent by the earliest Opportunity. Have you seen his Majesty's Speech at the opening of the present Session? He appears to be in great Tribulation, & I hope to see him in greater, before the End of the next Campaign. By the Smiles of divine providence & one noble Exertion, I think We may give the coup de Grace to his project for enslaving America.  Mr Lovell has shewn me a Letter from a Lady of your Acquaintance, who appears to be much displeased with Batchelors; I cannot think she is in earnest, because they are generally devoted to the Service of a Sex, Who are not to be exceeded in Kindness. But I suspect a particular friend of her's of originating the opinion that \""Batchelors are Stoics,\"" & conclude, that is is the practice of Husbands to hide their Failings by imputing them to others. Certain it is that a Stoical Batchelor is an Inconsistency in Terms; & if our Friend supposes that her Opinion is founded in Experience, the Inference is, that she was never acquainted with a Batchelor. Pray give my best Respects to her, & believe me to be with the sincerest Esteem Sir, your Friend & hum serv, E Gerry  ""

Some time last Summer he left a French Gentleman of the name Monsr. Capitaine sick at Salisbury with a considerable part of his Baggage. A Gentleman here undertook to bring that Gentleman & the Baggage forward, but neglected it. The Marquis is greatly distressed both on Account of the Sick Gentleman & the Goods. I most earnestly request you to make an enquiry into this affair & if Monsieur Capitaine is yet at Salisbury to furnish him with means to proceed immediately to this place with all the Marquis Baggage, let him settle his Accounts & draw Bills on me for the Amount which I will pay at Sight, & I will also pay your order for the hire of a Waggon or Waggons which may be employed to bring the Baggage. The Marquis is a most excellent worthy young Noble Man, fighting in our Cause, & using his utmost endeavours to promote our Interest at the Court of France & all without pay or gratuity. He deserves to be considered & respected by every friend to these States. If I knew what Sum of Money would be necessary I would send it by Major Polk- but you may depend upon me for the immediate payment of all that has been & that shall be incurred on this Account as soon as I know the Amount. Therefore Sir, I rely upon you as a Man of kindness & benvolence to exert yourself in behalf of this worthy Stranger.

Thanks Peters for his January 21 letter and kindly \""observations respecting the affair of my Brother.\"" Explains that \""it was my Friend Governeur & not me,\"" as Peters had mistakenly assumed, who had been recently appointed to the Committee at Camp after Board of War members were excused from that assignment. Responds to Peters' lament that slanders and misrepresentations were contributing to the low morale of the Continental Army.(1) \""I am very glad you gave me an Acct. of your Rencountre with Colo Morgan or Fame with her Foul Mouth'd Trumpet had not been Idle. The report reached Manheim with aggravated circumstances just before Your letter enabled me to do you Justice & some of your Friends here can Witness how much pleasure I took in setting that affair in its true light. I am sure you are sincere when you say you neither are nor will be concerned in any party Work, for Heavens Sake & for the sake of your Country & of Justice keep firm to that resolution, for I really think it a horrid thing that mankind shou'd ever combine to support each other in unworthy attacks on Worthy Characters. General Washington's is too well established to be easily injured, it is too important to be sported with and I think the Man or Men that dare to do it on insufficient grounds are justly obnoxious to chastizement. The General will not suffer alone in any loss of Character, his Country & his Country's Cause will inevitably suffer more or less with him. His private Character has been too long & too amiably & well supported to suffer by the Combined  JANUARY 25, 1778  Force & Arts of Malice, Envy, Hatred & detraction. But His Military Character does not so much depend on himself or his Conduct, as on the Success of his measures & therefore in my opinion, injurious Reflections on the want of Success, should be avoided by Good Men & discouraged on their first appearance amongst People of another Cast. Let us therefore withstand these attempts against the first Man in this World & unite our endeavours to procure him such Force as will enable him to shine with that Splendour he Merits. His Enemies must then hide their Heads & silently witness the Triumph of that Virtue which first excited their Envy. These are my Sentiments & these my wishes and what is in my power shall be done for the Accomplishment of them.(2)  \""I find Doctor Shippen is called to attend Congress to defend himself against an attack made on him by Doctr Rush. It is a pity he is called from hence at this time because I observe he is much employed in the Duties of his Station and I fear our Friend Nesbitt will miss him if detained long at York. I am no judge of his Medical abilities but have always been taught to believe greatly of them, his treatment of Nesbitt has strengthened my Faith, and as I have had an opportunity of observing his Conduct in office for some time at this place, it wou'd be injustice not to give my opinion on the occasion. I have been accustomed, as probably you have too, to Consider the Doctor as too great a devotee to Conviviality for a Man of business (this probably is giving myself a Slap in the Face too) but I see him exceedingly attentive and find an anxiety in him to support his Credit & Character in the Management of the Hospitals far beyond any expectation I had, before these things came under my own observation & I account for [it] by perceiving that the Station is grateful to his ambition & pleasing to his Vanity. Therefore I do believe he has done & will do every thing in his power to preserve the Sick & Wounded Soldiery for his own Sake. If you think these opinions will be of any use to him you are at liberty to communicate them to whom you please, for as I entertain them I care not who knows it.

  Dear Sir,(1) 26th Jany 1778. Your favour of the 18th November found me arrested & confined in Bed by a very severe Gout-the heaviest attack I had ever felt. I had no hopes of walking again with any degree of Strength till the warm weather should have releived me, but having my mind full of business, & an anxious desire that our State should be represented, however lamely, without stooping the Idea to a pun which is not meant, I adventured again upon my old project, which people here called Neck or nothing-Cold Water. I carried the practice to a greater length than I had ever done in England or Carolina. Thank God, it has succeeded. I have been present in Congress for a Month past at the discussion of some of the most momentous Questions & have been Strong enough to hobble to the Court House about 200 Yards & back twice a day for the last 8 days; if I could be indulged only half a Week, I am persuaded my former Strength would be recovered-But sitting 18 or 19 Sometimes 20 hours in the 24 in Congress & at this Table encourages horrible swellings, which are not quite dispersed by the short respite in Bed, nor has the continued use of Cold Water all that efficacy which it would have, if aided by proper rest.  Be that as it may, I have saved already a good deal of time & by persevering in the severe exercise am apparently gaining ground far beyond all former experience.  This exertion My Dear Sir has likewise put it in my power to attempt to serve Mr. Dart in the appointment intimated in your Letter. I have made the necessary enquiry of the pay Master General Mr. Palfrey, he informs me that Mr. Benj. Harrison Junr. of Virginia is his deputy P.M.G. for the Sothern district, that he is not authorized to appoint any other. If I were to apply to Congress in form, I ought to be armed with arguments in order to shew the utility & necessity of such appointment. 'Tis true Mr. Clay was appointed for Georgia & also that it was in consequence of my particular request & recommendation-a Million of Dollars were granted for that State-I judged it exceedingly necessary that such a Sum of public Money to be distributed in a State distracted in their politics  JANUARY 26, 1778  & Councils should be deposited in the hands of a Man on whose accuracy & Integrity the public could rely. Without meaning to disparage any other Man, or to pay so much attention to the benefit of Mr. Clay as to the Safety & Interest of the public I named him as a Citizen in whose custody the public Treasury would be safe.(2) The Delegates from Georgia, whether they had any other person or mode in view I cant say, could have no objection to the Man, nor to the measure, they acquiesced, & Congress from these considerations made a special appointment altho' Mr. Palfrey is pay Master General of all the forces of the United States.  If the appointment of a Dep P.M. General is necessary in So Carolina & the President will be pleased to represent it & direct me to apply to Congress I will obey the order without delay & you & Mr. Dart may rely on me not only to put him in Nomination but upon my Vote & all the Interest I can secure in his favour. All this may be done in the course of two Months. If I were to press the Subject without such ground, it is my sentiment that it would be equally improper & impolitic & probably defeat the good end you have in view.  Your kind notices of my Son's behaviour affects me very much. I thank you sincerely for them, I speak & think of that Youth now, not as my Son but as a fellow Citizen whose love for his Country is pure & unmixed. If you knew how totally he is lost to all feeling for Interest or pleasures, & at the same time knew as I know, the unhappy state of our affairs & the shameful prevailing peculation & scrambling for our Loaves & fishes, I beleive you would as I do wish he had a little more attention to the Question-what may be? Notwithstanding this apparent deficiency which is not very criminal in a Young Man I feel great satisfaction result from a knowledge of his distinction in private life, which I am well assured has rendered him acceptable not only in the family in which he resides but to all who know him in the Army. If I may judge from his conduct he has forsaken Father & Wife & Child, Houses & Beds & all for the sake of his Country & the Cause which possesses his whole Heart. O God, I thank thee he is not single, there are yet thousands more & better than him who have not bowed the knee to Mammon, these my Dear Colonel must come forth soon from every Corner of our union to save us, or we shall become a prey to the Robbery & the insatiable avarice of wretches who are hastening our destruction by more sure & infallible means than any other in the hands of the great Tyrant. I say any other, because I beleive some of these are his Instruments. If the States do not exert themselves & speedily too, their Stewards will complete their Ruin & disgrace, the Mortification appears to be already too far Spread to admit of Cure without some grand amputating & if delayed the whole fabrick will tumble.  In England there was one Lord Holland,(3) here in these Virtuous  States we have an hundred Foxes who hold unaccounted Millions & who have been taught that Congress have not power to call them to Account.  O Liberty, O Virtue, O my Country! Upon the base prostitution of these sacred names, Knaves & fools are building enormous Estates, sapping the foundations of Liberty, & Virtue & their Country & taxing the honest & undesigning a thousand fold more than the British parliament would or could have done. My Dear Colonel believe me this is no rhapsody, or indulgence of fancy, I speak the words of truth & daily discovery, truth which all acknowledge & pretend to lament but none will heartily join to amend. I fear too many are indirectly concerned by a Brother, a Son or a freind-& some have been directly engaged. Pluck the Reins out of such hands, send more & better guides & tie them down by Instructions-but why do I slander these. God knows we are what we are-too much indeed of the old Leaven, but the Evil complained of had not its origin upon yesterday, we are reaping the fruits from Seed Sown long ago.  We have been from time to time for above a Month past alarmed by accounts from the Commander in Cheif of the near & almost inevitable dispersion of the Army from a want of provision. Nakedness is chearfully submitted. The General has made the most affecting complaints of neglect in the principal departments, has proceeded even to say, that \""never was Officer so impeded as he has been,\"" yet, I intimate it with deep feeling & much regret, too little regard has been paid to his sensible, spirited, Manly Representations. This great & virtuous Man has not acted the half patriot, by a hasty resignation. His Complaints are well founded, nevertheless he will not take a Step which may greatly injure thirteen United States because of the inconsiderate conduct, design, ignorance or negligence of a Majority of twenty one, too often only of fifteen Men. No internal Enemy can hurt him without his own consent. I trust he will not gratify the wishes of those who seek to remove him, if there be any such, & I hope the States will be roused, fill their Representations in Congress with Wise & Spirited Men by whose exertions the heavy Cloud which now hangs over our heads may be dispelled. I have exhibited a very small part of a most gloomy prospective. I speak to you Dear Sir as to a friend & a fellow Citizen, from whom important truths ought not to be concealed & in whose discretion I can confide to apply if practicable, what is laid before him to public use & no other. The first great Step will be for every State to Send proper Men to fill the whole Representation, Men of Integrity & Men of great ability. Let Carolina Send no other & call me away for being deficient in the latter requisite only. I am sure I am honest, I am as sure of my insufficiency for this great Charge, but let me tell you if you & all the other States do not exert yourselves (4) instantly you may be too late. I tell you with a tear of Blood-I shall not be shocked if I learn this Evening Our Army is dispersed, because there is too much   ground to fear & therefore I am not unprepared for the Event. This cannot happen from a want of provision in the Country, nor from a want of the appointment of a Quarter Master General, & commissaries general & Deputies of both without number. If it shall happen infamous envy may be gratified, but the General will bear no blame. I know who & who will execrated & who now deserves to be so. When engaged in these melancholy reflections I am tempted to think that those who have scraped in Millions of Dollars & vested them in permanent property are endeavouring at all hazards, to secure by any terms of peace, their Ill gained pelf-but I will say no more. I will go to Congress, endeavour to Counteract some, & reconcile the honest hearts now at variance.  It is impossible that you should be kept ignorant of an unhappy dispute subsisting between our Commander in Cheif & General Gates, I was long ago told of jealousies, but lately dangerous altercations have appeared & passed through Congress; a Letter written by General Conway to General Gates fanned up this alarming flame. You will see in Charles Town some particulars of this affair. General Conway has been with me, assured me General Washington had been deceived & imposed on, that his Letter contained no such expressions as had been reported to the General, he was pleased to ask my sentiments upon propriety of printing the Letter but did not offer to shew it me. These I delivered in every dissuasive argument to the measure, & added all the reasoning I was capable of to press the necessity for drawing a Veil before the Eyes of our Enemies, who from the very appearance of so capital a division would collect fresh encouragement for continuing their attempts to destroy our Independence-& their success would be followed by Scenes of Calamity in thousands of families of these States horrible even in Idea. Under a Strong allusion, I remarked, it was the duty of every Citizen who pretended Love to his Country to employ his Talents in attempts to heal wounds upon our fraternal connexion, none but Enemies in disguise would recommend a measure which must infallibly widen the breach &c &c. The General was pleased to receive my opinion with apparent cordiality, said he was convinced of the justness of my observations, & that it did not become Soldiers to print.  I have seen the Letter-in the hands of one of your good sort of Men who shews it only to proper persons, I gained a perusal by intreaty!-this day (the 27th).(5) It is true General Washington was misinformed, the Letter does not contain the words which had been reported to him-but-ten times worse in every view.  I say these things Dear Colonel to your Self, the World will be informed, but while it is not my province I desire not to appear officious or to be held up as an author. Depend upon me for this Duty, I will strive to make peace by every proper means & here I will leave this disagreeable Subject.  As I strove hard for effecting the determination of Congress for  suspending the embarkation of Mr. Burgoyne, it affords me great satisfaction to find that measure approbated by the most sensible & by all the Officers in the Army, as well for the justice as the policy of the Act.  We have now in motion an Irruption into Canada under the Command of Marquis delafayette, provided he will condescend to accept of Mr. Conway for his second, if I may judge from his Letters to me in which he speaks of this Officer with the utmost abhorence, he will not.(6) What Congress may then determine is uncertain. General Conway having learned the Marquis's disposition, pushed forward only yesterday (29th) which according to the plan of his friends, will make a shew of his activity in having commenced the enterprize, the Marquis will be here this Morning. A particular friend of General Conway has lamented to me that all the French Officers hated him & I learn from others that none of the English Officers (except a little party) love him. I had, before some late discoveries, entertained a very high opinion of this General.  A late determination in Congress has mortified me more than a little. Upon my application for appointing a Brigadier in our State it was determined to postpone the consideration until a Committee now at Camp should return. In Justice to Colonel Huger I nominated him, expressing my wishes at the same time that Colonel Motte on Account of his personal Merit as well as from the real necessity of our State, should also be appointed, but there was no body on the floor to take up & improve the Suggestions from the Chair, or to reply to the specious reasonings for postponing, in which I perceived a good deal of design relative to Rank. I was necessitated to content myself, however much discontented, with barely demanding the appointment as a Right.(7) We deserve the Evil of this delay & greater for our Shameful unpardonable delay of filling up our Delegacy with sensible, vigilant, faithful Citizens.  The Representation of these Infant States as above remarked has been for a long time past 21 Men often 15-sometimes barely Nine States by Units. Admitting we were all, what truth knows we are not, there are not Men enough even for the drudgery of Committees. But at present, we want genius, Insight, foresight, fortitude & all the virtuous powers of the human Mind. O shameful, shameless Sons of Liberty-versatile boasting Americans!  Ye have brought Yokes of Oxen & Maried Wives, ye stay to prove them. Trifle a little longer, & ye & your Wives, go graze with those Oxen which once had been your property.

You will have opportunity of special inquiry into any further hidden machination, as the Board of War have stopped the progress of the Waggons, and I hope it will be improved, and that you will not hold the sword of Justice in vain. Congress has no right to interfere in our civil policy, nor will it be presumed, however their result on the Subject of the papers above mentioned will be communicated as soon as I have it in my power. The copy of the Letter forwarded to Gen. Washington found on the Serjeant would have [been] very satisfactory, pray favor me with it without delay, with a particular account of the Escort, and the ostensible rank they bear, for I very much suspect ficticious Characters. I also request to know something more particular of the conduct of the Capt. & Lieut. bearers of the indecent paper deliverd to the Secretary of Council, and whether they are not Continental Officers. The astonishing Conduct of the two Members of Congress who were to have consulted with the State on the Subject of Supplies, is a presage of the unfortunate issue of that measure, concerning which you are entirely silent. JANUARY 26, 1778  I could weep over my suffering Country cramped at this season for vigorous exertion, by the want of provisions, with which our Country abounds, and I wish I could clear our own State of the horrid sin of the Commissarial Department from which at the very time of that most mischievous arrangement, carried I believe but by one voice, I predicted the injuries we have and still suffer, for Gods sake, for our Country's sake never let a Delligate represent the State from any consideration, one moment longer than he is faithful, or one moment after he is a Subject of just suspicion. You would pardon me if you knew my sufferings and indignation on account of this and other less destructive measures, tho very hurtful to the common cause, which a very feeble voice could not prevent. I pray you to cast about for some Characters (2), 3 or more, expert, faithful and active in the way of purchasing, that you can recommend to me, will Robt. Towers do as one? I know he was indefatigable in another line of Duty. I pray you also to point out some elligible mode of procuring large quantities of biscuit and proper persons for that branch that I may be furnished with proper Characters to recommend to Congress. Ludowick I fear is incompetant.2 The use of flour instead of hard bread has been I believe the death of thousands. I beg to be favoured with hearing from you soon & am, Sir, Yr. most obt. huml Servt,  Danl. Roberdeau [P.S.] The Commissary General,(3) warmly recommended by our State has just found out that he is incompetant to the business.  ""

  Sir York Town Jany. 27th. 1778 The unsettled State which I have been in since I got here, has put it out of my power to answer your Letter of 19th Jany. before this Time.(1)  Congress is extremely sorry the Salt could not be procured; at the same Time they highly approve of your Excellency's Conduct, and desired the president to return you and the Council the Thanks of Congress for your respect and Attention to their resolve.  Congress have accepted the Salt you offered, and I expect the president has wrote you fully upon that head;(2) the Commissary is likewise to purchase such quantities as he may think necessary; and I am in hopes with what he will receive from you, there will be a sufficient quantity for the present Demand.  I am sensible of the low state of our own Treasury and I believe I may assure you with truth, that the Continental Treasury here is in a much worse Situation. However we have procured a Warrant on Ths. Harwood Esqr. commissioner of the continental loan office for the State of Maryland for twenty thousand dollars, drawn in your favour for the purpose of recruiting the Army.(3)  The Situation of our Army is truly alarming and unless we can supply it with provisions by some means more effectual than any now adopted, I am afraid they must seperate-a Committee is now out for that purpose.(4)  The Army is to undergo a Reformation. Mr. Carroll was one of the Members of Congress appointed on that Business, but the indisposition of Mrs. Carrol called him home; the other Gentlemen that were appointed are now at Camp.(5)  Congress have at length agreed upon the just and equitable Doctrine of Ritaliation,(6) which you may see by the enclosed papers.  We have no news. Make my respects to the Council and believe me to be Sir, with great respect your very hble. Servt.  J. Henry Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir, 27 Jany. 1778. I have but a moment at present for acknowledging, & returning thanks for the Honour received in your Excellencys favour of the 8th. I shall always reflect upon the tender of Gov. Livingston's freindship as one of the very happy events in my Life. I will also sedulously endeavor to retain an acquisition which feels the more valuable as it came unexpected. But alas Sir, what have I, who am neither a Scholar nor a Wit, to return in Exchange for your polite correspondence, call me one Step beyond the composition of a plain Letter of business, & I am gravelled. If after this frank & laconic declaration your Excellency shall be pleased to take me as I am, & to confirm the late proposition, you will find me faithful, ready to embrace occasions for evidencing an Esteem which I had entertained for your Character, long before the adventitious circumstance of Official addresses had drawn me into Your Excellency's veiw. Set me down therefore, if you please Sir, upon the premised Conditions, as one of your humble Servants, one who rejoices in the opportunity afforded him of signifying his desire to be sincerely attached to you, & in nothing within the Sphere of my capacity will Your Excellency be deceived, or wilfully disappointed by me.  If I were to indulge a querulous vein I should detain your Excellency by a long detail of disorders & distractions in all our public affairs, Superadded to the baneful effects of avarice & peculation, among them & not the least, the appearance, it would be warrantable to Say, raging, of a dangerous party Spirit, but I forbear, & will still JANUARY 27, 1778  trust, that the States will be awakened from their present Lethargy & again think it necessary to be Represented in Congress by Men of ability & in Sufficient Numbers. A most shameful deficiency in this branch is the greatest Evil & is indeed the source of almost all our Evils. Admitting that we, who are present, were all, what truth knows we are not, it would not be possible for 21, often 15, & sometimes barely 9 States represented by Units, to discharge with accuracy & expedition which is due to all business, the business which is daily presented to Congress, much less, if that can be, to look into that which has long been in Arrears. Hence Thousands I may say Millions have been wasted & are wasting every day-hence our American Foxes holding unaccounted Millions have gained time enough to learn & impudence enough to Say, the powers of Congress fall Short of compulsive means for bringing them to a reckoning. Besides, we want genius for Striking out new matter, for correcting errors & repressing dangerous appearances, by measures Wise, silent & effectual. Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the disorders of our domestic concerns, I am sorry to assure you, all our foreign wear the aspect of mere chance-medley. Hence Naked Soldiers, Deaths, replete Hospitals, desertions & evacuated Regiments, hence too in my judgment, we are very lightly esteemed abroad & probably are held up this very Instant at Auction-part of the conduct of the faithful Court of Versailles will justify the suggestion. Is it not from these considerations incumbent upon every Man of Influence throughout our Union to exert his powers at this Crisis, to exhort each State to fill up its Representation in Congress with the best, that is the most sensible, vigilant & faithful Citizens? At present it seems as if every such Man had bought his yoke of Oxen & prayed to be excused. A little longer trifling will fix a galling yoke upon themselves, there is but one thing I think can prevent it Our Antagonist is as Idle, as profligate as ourselves & keeps pace with us in profusion, mismanagement & family discord.  Some of us however should remember the fate of the quarreling Curs & guard against a Similar decision, disgraceful & fatal.  Methinks I can perceive a design in our artful, Specious half-freinds to come in for at least part of the Bone. Perseverance in our present track will oblige us to run in debt more & more abroad, & there are among us some who discover an amazing avidity to do so. Let us be dipped a few Millions deeper in foreign debt, means will be easily found for protracting the War & our flimsy Independency will become abjectly dependent upon those who may either Send their Ships to collect accumulated Interest & dictate the mode of payment, or may obtain payment if they prefer it in Thread Needle Street. Will sober Men rely upon the faith or upon the Benevolence of Kings? Has France done one act of kindness towards us but what has been plumply for the promotion of her own Interest? Has she   not played off our Commissioner-Ambassadors like puppets? She has bountifully offered us the loan of Money provided we would furnish her with the means for raising it. \""Contract for Hogsheads of Tobacco in order to help the Revenue & you shall have Money.\"" We have received & I believe Spent without any visible profitable Exchange the Money but the Tobacco is not Shipped. What consequences must follow? Interest infallibly-resentment & reprisal when their policy shall direct. Has not France \""cautiously avoided every transaction that should seem to imply American Independency.\"" Have we not been told that \""every step was taken to gratify England publicly, forbidding American ships with Military Stores to depart, then privately permitting them, recalling their Officers who had obtained leave to go to America but encouraging them to go in Shoals, giving strict orders that our prizes should not be sold in their Ports, at the same time assuring us of their good Will & intimating that these measures were necessary at present.\""  Have not we been also told that the French Ministry after reading our Quixot propositions for a Treaty had said, \""You have not bid high enough,\"" & that while we were keeping the knowledge of that Treaty perfect free Masonry in Philadelphia, Lord George Germaine was laughing at it in the Plantation Office?  These Sir are old Stories, but they are the most recent we have from that quarter. Our late Packet from Plasy through the superabundant circumspection of our commissioners imported nothing more than Charte Blanche. We have been Jockied out of the Original. We have the strongest proofs of French perfidy, as well as of British imbecility & American credulity & puppetism-and yet Sir, we are dreaming on, trusting as it were to providence to give us this day our daily need of Brown paper, & drawing from France, as from an exhaustless spring, altho she has told us in so many words, \""it is (1) impossible to lend us two Millions Sterling.\"" Our Agents in the West Indies without money & over head & Ears in debt. If Congress were full or even two thirds full, might we not expect Some Men in the group who would look into these important matters & contrive means for playing a Card against French policy, it is not necessary that we should break off with France. We might make use of her. I am sure it may be done with good effect, but as I have already intimated, it seems as if every Man fit for these great purposes had Married a Wife & stayed to prove her. Sir I see & I lament-but I can do nothing more than a kind of negative good. I do no harm, & think my Self very happy when I can countermine an intended Evil. If there be not Speedily a Resurrection of able Men & of that Virtue which I thought had been genuine in 1775, We are gone-we shall undo ourselves-we must flee to the Mountains, but Woe to them who have been Governors & presidents who have given orders for borrowing the King's Gun powder & for suspending the embarka-  tion of his favorite Warrior. Forgive me Sir I have been deceived in the time & did not mean to have been so troublesome. I am with very Sincere Regard &ca.  ""

  Dear Sir Janry. 27th. 1778. Your Letter of the 10th from Windham has come to hand, and, I assure you, gives me all the pain which a stranger to you would conjecture you wished it might give me at the time you wrote it. But, be equally assured that ninety nine hundreths of that pain arrises from the consideration of your ill state of health. Personally I deserve not any of your railing. And, if I was the main instrument in bringing about all you complain of, yet the present sufferings of the public Cause would, as they well may, so fully occupy my mind and occasion so much regret & pain that there would be no room left for your complaints of a personal nature to make impression. To be very honest with you, I think you have more than bodily Jaundice. The JANUARY 27, 1778  Gentleman who now presides here has a great regard for your hond. Father, and perhaps from an aim to show it has put you into a rage. A circular letter was written by a Committee to go to the Legislature of each of the 13 States. It begins Sir; and the President was ordered to transmit it. This he ought perhaps to have done variously as the Legislatures are variously constituted. He ought to have sent to the Govr. or the Presidt. or the Speaker; for Sir is meant for the Head of the Legislature. But you have taken it for granted that yr. good Father was treated differently from the Head of the other Legislatures, and this designedly by Congress. The President being sick at Home thought Sir was intended for the Speaker of the lower house; here is the mystery.(1)  I feel a little vexed with myself for having wrote so many lines upon this subject when I ought to have spent the same Ink in persuading you to come and help other honest men to mend bad plans or make some new ones.  I must remark that you are as much wrong about P 's being preferred before you as you were about yr. Father's being ill treated.2 A Board of War was chosen while a Committee was planning a Victualling board. This last Committee reported that the addition of yr. honor alone to the board of war would compleatly answer all the end proposed, thus you was elected. And the addition of one more was made as Genl. Gates may be occasionally called away in a military line ergo Mr. P . I have no arguments to use with you to come here but merely that of serving your country, for be assured that your accommodations will be bad and your Salary little adequate to the avaricious griping Spirit of these anglo-german People. I recon, dear Justice, you will call this Letter a new Insult; but be prepared, for I will continue to ask you from time to time to help us through the dangers of Shipwreck tho' I should be scolded by you ten times more than I have been.  My best Regards to your Amelia who I suppose could hang me for persuading you to forget your Injuries & consequently to leave her and wear yourself out for the public. Yr. obliged Friend, J L  ""

  Dr Sir (1) York Town Jany 27. 1778 Your Favours of the 20th & 31st of last reached me at the same Time & no sooner than the Day before Yesterday by Capt. Lane. I was sorry for this as some things required an immediate Answer for want of which I am probably bearing some Blame. You would however I hope receive two Letters written by me since I came here (2) which by making no Mention of such a Thing would convince you that a Recess of Congress was not in Contemplation. I never heard it so much as mentioned in this Place & I am persuaded that the Circumstances of Affairs do not admit of it. My former Letters would convince you how much Anxiety I felt for the State of New Jersey this Winter but you have reason to be thankful that the present situation of the Army is favourable indeed compared to what was fully intended when I passed through the Camp in my Way to this Place. They designed to have gone as far back as Lancaster, Reading & Easton. I spoke to Gen. Washington with great Earnestness upon the subject & as soon as I came here obtained a Resolve of Congress recommending to him to pay a particular Attention to the exposed State of New Jersey.(3)  I am sorry indeed that your Tax Bill failed but you must set about JANUARY 27, 1778  it again immediately. The State of Massachusets have besides large Taxes called in all their own Paper Money to be paid either by the Taxes or by Treasury Notes on Interest which has already raised the value of continental Money 15 per Cent. I could heartily wish our State would do the same. Measures of so essential Importance at such a season ought to be pursued without minding [. . .] popular Clamours of wrong headed People. I have always found that time justified what was in itself right when done from upright Principles. You were right to send a Committee to New Haven since it was desired & the rest were to do it but I look upon the scheme to be impracticable & absurd.(4) Fixing Prices by Law never had nor ever will have any Effect but stopping Commerce & making Things scarce & dear. That Circumstance with some other Defects in the Commissary Department has brought our Army frequently near to starving. I believe the Congress is now convinced of that & though late will try to lay up the Magazines for next Summer by voluntary Contracts. I wish the Legislature of each State would take the Direction of this Matter. They are doing so in Connecticut. When your Assembly meets could not the Members point out Dealers in the different Counties who would Contract for & collect Quantities of Flour, Beef, Pork & have the meat salted up before the Hot weather comes on- but I cannot enlarge.  You will have heard by this Time that Congress has ordered that Gen. Burgoyne shall not be suffered to embark till the Convention is ratified by the Court of Britain. I arrived here just in Time to help on that Measure.(5) It appeared to me both just & Necessary. There are many Circumstances that indicated an Intention in him on frivolous Pretences to break it & if he had availed himself of these Pretences after he had got aboard the Public would not have easily forgiven us for not acting with greater Caution.  There are no other News that I am at Liberty to communicate. Mr Hart will inform you what was done as to the Demand for money. Since that time there has been an Order in favor of Gov. Livingston for 10,000 Dollars out of the Loan Office of New Jersey & as I suppose before the first of March a considerable sum will be there. We shall take Care that no Body shall get it but our own State.  A Committee of Congress is gone to Camp to regulate the Army in which I wish they may succeed. Our Officers are infected with such a seizing thirst for Rank and Pay & there is sometimes such a Want of Firmness in Congress that there is Danger of their throwing Things into Confusion. In this as in most Cases we grow wise though late by Experience so that I hope they will not obtain their exorbitant Demands & yet be brought into Order. Some of them to my certain Knowledge have threatened to resign who if they did resign durst not show their Faces in their own States. I believe I would have been chosen upon that Committee but I positively refused it chiefly on   Account of my Character & Profession but not from any fear of encountering them or yielding to any unjust Demand.  I am at a Loss what to say about the Time you mention for my Return Home. It is now so near that unless Dr. Scudder comes immediately it is impracticable and it is really improper to leave Congress at present when much Business of the last Consequence is to be done & the Time is approaching when we must hear from England and France after the News of Burgoynes Surrender reaches them.(6) I must expect to hear from you in Answer to this which will determine me.  I would willingly contribute all in my power to the Circulation & Success of Collins's Paper.(7) I wish he would send it to me regularly by Headquarters, which I think might be done. I do not well know how this letter is to be conveyed but if the Opportunity be proper shall send you all the foreign News Papers I can procure & in the mean time with Compliments to Mrs Houston, I am Dr Sir your &c, Jno Witherspoon  Wednesday Jany 28. Since writing the above I am favored with yours of the 19 & 21 by Dr Bloomfield or Dr Tilen & take the Opportunity of their Return to add somewhat further.(8) I am obliged to you for the particular Detail of abuses which I know to be real & great & shall make every Use in my Power of the Information given. Particularly I hope soon to obtain a Request of Congress to the Legislature of our or perhaps all the States to take the Oversight of the Continental Officers in their Bounds.(9) This has been done already in particular Cases in N. York & Connecticut & from what happened in these Instances I am convinced there will be no Difficulty in obtaining it.  Pray let Dr Scudder come here without Delay. A Committee of 6 members of Congress are gone to Camp. There are at present 4 or five single Persons if any one of whom should be Sick there could not be a Quorum.  Dr. Rush & Dr Shippen are here just now & were yesternight & this forenoon examined before a Committee of whom I am Chairman as to the Abuses in the Hospitals.(10) No Pains will be Spared to rectify what is amiss as far as practicable. The unlucky movement you mention in December was the Consequence of an Order from Headquarters though a very improper one.  We have flying News to Day from Lancaster that the Decr. Packet is arrived after a short Passage. That Gen. How will not suffer any Letters to be delivered even to Officers. That Lord Chatham is come into the Ministry and that Part of the British Forces are to be sent to Jamaica but I cannot answer for the Truth of them. It is however certain that upwards of 7000 French Troops had actually arrived at the West Indies before the last Letter from our Agent their came  away. The Congress have now positively determined that Burgoyne and his Army shall not be suffered to embark till there is a formal Ratification of the Convention Sent from the Court of London & that all the Expences of his Troops shall be paid in hard money or Provisions. I inclose you the Proceedings of Congress relative to the Prisoners & mean to Send Some English News Papers not very late indeed but which you must keep & return by a safe Conveyance when it can be found. If Dr Scudder comes I shall probaby set off immediately but am very much pressed to Stay & in Case any Important Intelligence came from England or France it may seem to demand it & therefore I wish you would try to get Mr Faitoute to teach the few boys you have for a Week or two when you are obliged to go to the Assembly. I received no Letters from my Family by Dr Bloomfield which surprised me as well as disappointed me. Since therefore they are so very inattentive I wish upon any Opportunity offering you would put them in mind. I forgot indeed that I had a Short Letter from Mr Montgomery without any Date which was also the Case with his last but I had not a Syllable from any of them by Jos. Lane.  I am Dear Sir Yours affectionately, Jno Witherspoon  Thursday Jany 29 Postscript. I have just sent up for you all the English News Papers that are in this house. There were some come later but they are now so dispersed among the Members that it would be impossible to collect them. If I meet them I will send them by a future Opportunity. These however must be kept & returned. The Governor returned them lately.  ""

  Sir Camp at the Valley Forge Jany 28. 1778.  Upon Conference with the General on the Business recommended to us, it appears clearly that the Appointment of a Qr. Master Genl. is a Matter of great Importance & immediate Necessity. When we consider the State of the Department, & how much depends on filling it up in a proper Manner, we cannot help mentioning General Schuyler, & for the Benefit of the Service we could wish he would undertake it.(1) At the same Time we must observe it is by no Means clear, that he will accept of it; besides this, the Charge or Accusation he now lies under may demand some Attention. And the Rank he holds in the Army may be a strong Objection to place him in a Situation where Fortune may throw in his Hands the supreme Command. What Weight these Objections will have in Congress we cannot presume to say. They are great in the Minds of the Comm. But we are convinced that unless the Quarter Master Genls. Department be administered by very superiour Abilities, very little can be expected from our Exertions during the next Campaign.  The Committee are of Opinion that if Congress judge it inexpedient to make the Appointment we have suggested, no Time should be lost in acquainting the Committee of it, as they have some other Persons under Consideration, but cannot at present determine to whom they shall give the Preference on their Recommendation to Congress.

You command me to keep parts of your Letter in confidence, be assured Sir, the whole will be held in that Esteem. If I can produce or procure any good from the knowledge which you are pleased to communicate, it shall be effected without disclosing the source.  I know from the Gentleman himself that General Conway is desirous of accompanying your Excellency upon the intended expedition & I am equally sure a rejection on your part will be received as a great disappointment. I took the liberty of intimating that it would be decent if not necessary to consult your Excellency upon the Question of who should be your second, but the thing had been not only preconcerted but apparently predetermined, indeed by some contrivance I was deprived of the honour, & the means of doing my Duty, of informing you Officially of the appointments.  As I do most sedulously avoid even the appearance of being a party Man, Your Excellency will the more readily excuse me for Speaking only in general terms. I think I can discern on which side Virtue & honour predominate as well as that where Craft & design are lurking under specious guise when perhaps the party themselves are blinded by prejudice & not sensible of their own errors, & as I judge charitably I would endeavour to act circumspectly even with such Characters, who divested of the spirit of party may be valuable Men in community.  I have taken such measures as I think cannot fail to bring Monsr. Capitaine & the Baggage forward. Major Polke who left the Army last Week has engaged not only to deliver my Letters but to exert his utmost endeavors that my direction & requests shall be duly executed.  I have the honour to be with the most sincere attacht.  ""

  My Dear Son, 28th Jany 1778 I Received yours of 23d & of 26th Inst. last Night by Colo. Duplesis.(1) When you transmit me your plan for the measure of raising a Black Regiment I may be better able to judge & finally determine than I am at present. I have been cautious of Speaking openly of the project, but hitherto I have not heard one person approbate the Idea from the hints which I dropped in order to gain opinions & yet I will not say that the design might not be beneficially improved provided there would be found twenty more Men to share the reproach of Quixotism & to carry it into respectable execution. Your Regiment if you trusted to your own resources would not consist of more than forty Men perhaps not so many, in 300 Negroes there is a great proportion of Women & Children & if you have any dependence upon free Negroes depend upon it you will be deceived. If a Man had a Bird Plantation of 1200 & upwards he might venture a bold Stroke, have you consulted your General on this head? Have you considered that your kind intentions towards your Negroes would be deemed by them the highest cruelty, & that to escape from it they would flee into the Woods-that they would interpret your humanity to be an Exchange of Slavery, a State & circumstances not only tolerable but comfortable from habit, for an intolerable, taken from their Wives & Children & their little Plantations to the Field of Battle where Loss of Life & Loss of Limbs must be expected by every one every day.  I could offer a Thousand other things for your consideration but they are not necessary at this time nor indeed will the time allow me. You shall have my honest sentiments & then do as you please.(2)  General Conway has been twice say thrice with me, the second time he consulted me on the propriety of printing, I'll call it, the Letter. I replied by every dissuasive argument. He did not offer to shew me the Letter, but I have since seen it in the hands of a good Sort of Man, & 'tis possible the poison will by such means be disseminated. I cannot commend the Liberality of this proceeding, but I take it for granted he has first sent a Copy to the General, in that case there will be less crime or no crime in shewing it to his friends. From this consideration I say nothing of the Contents.  Yesterday I read to Congress a Letter from Mr Govr Morris JANUARY 28, 1778  recommending General McDougal to be the Marquis's second,(3) in the afternoon General Conway called upon me to take leave & entered immediately upon his Journey to the Northward. \""There was not a moment to be lost\"" & a Resolution is framed ordering Bills of Exchange to be drawn to a certain amount to be put into the hands of Marquis delafayette or any other Commanding Officer of the Troops intended to be Sent to Canada.(4) These are facts which you & I may think of, but I have neither time nor inclination to paraphrase, which I would do & boldly too if I were on the floor.  Adieu my Dear Friend. May God keep your heart pure &ca.  [P.S.] A Taylor has cut off as much of your Scarlet as will make he says a Waistcoat for 6 feet 3 inches.  James has in vain ransacked the whole Town for Buff Cloth. The remainder of your Scarlet is only fit for a Coat & Waistcoat for you or me.  ""

  Sir January 28th 1778 We have received your favour of the 23d instant and are sorry that your late effort to get to Sea had failed. The great service that might be done to the States by your Ship being out, has urged us to wish much for that event and altho you have been unsuccessful in your late attempt yet we would not have that prevent your making an other trial and as we are perfectly satisfied that your best endeavours has been used, we doubt not a continuance of them will be kept up until the business is happily Accomplished.(1)  We observe what you say respecting the term of entry of some of your Crew being expired. We would have you if possible engage them again allowing them the bounty.  The Navy Board at Bordenton in A Letter of the 13th instant writes that they had collected 19 or 20 Seamen belonging to the Navy and would send them forward to Baltimore as soon as a waggon could be had to take their baggage and Provisions. These men we expect are now nearly got down and you may order them on board your ship. This supply with such of your present Crew as you may reinlist will keep the Virginia well manned. JANUARY 28, 1778  We authorize you to provide A Small fast sailing Tender2 to preceede your ship down the Bay to give notice of the situation and motions of the enemies Vessels as we formerly directed & we trust you will embrace the first opportunity of pushing out.

  Sir No. 3 Camp at the Valley Forge January 29, 1778  In the Course of Inquiry into the State of the civil Departments of the Army, that of the Commissary General of Purchases has attracted very considerable Attention. That there have been very great Failures in the necessary supply of Provisions is unquestionable, but we are not so clear, as to the Causes which have produced this Evil. Many have been assigned, it is unnecessary to ennumerate them as we understand Congress have made Inquiry into this Department, the Result of which has not been favourable to the Capacity & Abilities of the Gentlemen now in Office. We beg leave to acquaint Congress that our Inquiries into this Department have rather confirmed than Changed this Opinion. We are therefore induced to recommend to the earliest Attention of Congress the Choice of a suitable Successor, a Man of Abilities, extensive Connection & Influence. We have not been able to fix upon any Person in our Opinion so proper as Jeremiah Wadsworth Esqr. of Connecticut.(1) It is said he is about to go to some part of Europe, but at the same Time it is probable he would accept the Office if honoured with it. We therefore submit it to Congress whether it will not be advisable immediately to proceed to the Choice of this Office, & if Mr. Wadsworth stands approved to give him the earliest Notice least he should leave the Country unacquainted with the Appointment or be so far engaged in other Business that he cannot accept it.  I have the Honour to be on Behalf of the Committee, Sir, Your most Obedt. & very Hble Servt. Fra Dana per Order  ""

  Dear Sir, Moor-Hall Jany. 29th. 1778 Genl. Fulsome informing me that you are very desirous of seeing a schedule of the Cargo of the brig Symetry captured at Wilmington I have enclosed one given me by Colo. Biddle which he supposes to be correct. We yesterday forwarded to Congress our recommendation of Genl. Schuyler for Quarter Master General.(1) Genl. Fulsome was vehemently against it. We cou'd not make him say Schyler unless to curse him. The Committee were convinced of the absolute necessity of filling that office with a person who thoroughly understands the duties of it, and cou'd not find one equal by any means to Schyler. They were nevertheless persuaded of the weight of certain objections against him, which they leave for the consideration of Congress. Some of us execrate him as a Genl. tho we think him well qualified for a Quarter Master. This day we have recommended Mr. Wadsworth for Commissary Genl. If you approve of him, pray push forward the election and do not let so valuable a man withdraw from his Country, at a time we meet with so great difficulty to find proper characters for the public service. We shall go on to do all the good in our power, tho' I expect our measures will be highly censured by some. My object shall be direct, and I leave the rest to Heaven. I think I have already made some discovery touching certain characters here, and am most firmly persuaded of the propriety, nay the necessity of appointing some members of Congress constantly to attend the principal army, and especially all their councils, if you wish thoroughly to know your General Officers. With my present information I can't but lament the new expedition into Canada. Keep a strict eye upon new institutions,(2) or I fear some capital difficulties will arise. Do not let Congress throw away their authority; 'tis hard to repossess it. I am extremely anxious that Colo. Palfrey, after waiting so long, shou'd be sent off with so small a sum. He must speedily be supplied with at least 500,000 more. For God's sake attend to the affairs of the Treasury. I hope the business with Mr. Rittenhouse which I left in charge with Mr. Hillegas is in a good way. Don't play at small games, yet cover your design. You will understand me. You know my sentiments upon this subject. I am JANUARY 29, 1778  confirmed in them. But I forget I am speaking to a great Financier. Colo. Biddle tells me that being much pressed for Cash, Genl. Washington this week drew a warrant in his favor upon the Pay Master for 10,666 2/3 which he endorsed to Colo. Bayard who will expect to receive the cash, or perhaps Loan Office Certificates at York Town. It was for so much cash borrowed by Colo. Biddle as he says (upon consultation with Genl. Washington) of Colo. Bayard. Biddle desires it may be charged to Colo. Palfrey, and that the Treasury wou'd inform him of it, who will then charge Biddle with it. He thinks it may be answered by certificates. Please to give my best regards to Mr. Ellery & Mr. Lovell & any other my good friends. We are too closely employed to admit of my writing them. I have receivd a letter from Mr. Ellery and beg you wou'd acquaint him that his daughter is much better.(3) As to Mr. Lovell's request abt Mr. J. Adams's Chest I know not at present how to come at it, or where to send it when I find where it is. I shou'd be glad of some further directions about it. Mr. Adams goes it seems.(4) This matter is no secret. I was told of it at Lancaster as coming from Mr. Morris. What do you think of my going Secretary?(5) Good night to you. Your's &c.  F.Da____ ""

  Sir January 29th 1778 We having agreed to employ the Pinnace and Barges belonging to the Frigates and the Barge taken up by Captain Josiah in the River Delaware on a Cruize in Said River under your command We hereby empower you to receive such war-like Stores, Provisions & other Stores from the Navy Board, and to employ such Continental Navy Officers not in Actual Service and to collect such a number of Men as you shall think necessary for officering, manning, victualling and eqquipping said Boats.(1) As you will have frequent occasion to land on each Side of the Delaware during your Cruize you will take effectual care to restrain your officers & men from plundering, insulting or in any way treating ill the Inhabitants of the Country. Humanity, good Policy and your reputation demand that they should be treated with kindness-you may want supplies from them and their assistance in moving to a place of safety such effects as you may capture. You will therefore attend particularly to this Instruction. We have directed the Navy Board to furnish you with every thing necessary for equiping your little fleet and with money to procure supplies for your Crews as occasion may require. You will take account of all goods of every kind which you may Capture and prevent their being pilfered. As it will be necessary that you should take with you or appoint on Shore some honest faithful persons who are well acquainted with the Country and will undertake to procure waggons for the speedy removal to a place of safety and take care of such goods as you may Capture-you will attend particularly to this necessary point and employ such persons. You will give immediate notice to General Washington of such stores as you may Capture which are necessary for the use of the Army. We would have you Sink or otherwise destroy the Hulls of all such Vessels as you may take which cannot be removed to some place of Safety. The Vessels which you take and preserve and the goods which you Capture must be libelled in the Court of Admiralty in the State into which they JANUARY 29, 1778  are carried-you will therefore employ some suitable Attorny to libell for the same.  The Success of your Cruize depending upon your dispatch, activity, prudence and valour we hope you will exert the utmost of your abilities on this occasion.

We desire that you would deliver to him such War-like Provisions and other necessarys as he may think necessary for equiping and victualling the Said Boats.

As Captain Barrys station cannot from the nature of the business be fixed and he may occasionally by his distance and situation down the River want supplies, we would have you furnish him with such sums of Money as he may want during his Cruize.

  Sir York January 30th. 1778 We have received your favours of the l9th, 22nd, 23rd & 24th instant (1) and returning thanks for the Contents we shall reply to them in course.  In Answer to yours of the l9th, We received the Letters Sent down to you for your Opinion, and think with you that Mr. Steward is a very honest active Man. We have wrote him to have the Brigantine chartered by Mr Lux Surveyed,(2) and should she be deemed insufficient to perform the Voyage, of course the Charter party will be void. We have taken Steps which we hope will prove effectual for procuring Materials for the New Brigantine at Baltimore, and as Capt. Thomas Read has taken the command and undertaken the fitting of her out, we expect she will soon be got ready for the Sea.(3) In due Time we shall order Mr Steward to Load her with Tobacco.  We shall be glad to receive the Account of the Tobacco on hand in Maryland & Virginia.  As you concur in Opinion with us that the Building of Small fast sailing Vessels for Commercial purposes would be an eligible plan, we wish to have your sentiments, as to the Burthen, Construction, Rigging &c of those Vessels, keeping in mind that the principal design is to ship with some degree of safety Tobacco from Cheseapeak Bay. We think they might be built at the Continental Ship yards out of the small Timber that will be left from Ships of war.  Before receipt of yours of the 22nd, Mr. Lux had advised the arrival of Capt Buffington and his having taken measures for bringing the Goods up to Baltimore. Mr Lewis being now there (4) he will give directions to have them sent forward. We have given the Board of War an Account of Captain Lambs Cargo, and we think it would be proper in future to furnish that Board with Lists of all articles that may arrive, suitable for the army, and they to communicate the same to the Officers of the different Departments.  We approve of your selling the Eight casks Indico taken out of the Brigantine Andrea Doria and brought up to Lancaster if you think it best so to do.  To yours of the 23d we shall only say that we shall do justice in everything respecting Mr Sargentons Brigantine.  We come to reply to yours of the 24th. We agree that it is of much Importance to furnish Mr. John Ross with the means of repaying the Money the Commissioners at Paris have advanced, as well as for his own advances, and for that purpose we fully approve of your altering the Bills of Loading of Some of the Cargoes of Tobacco now on board Vessels in Maryland and Virginia (formerly consigned to Mr Thomas Morris) and taking New Bills of Loading Consigned to Mr Ross or his order to be disposed of by him and the proceeds applied to the JANUARY 30, 1778  purposes afsd. This we Authorize you to do, and as Mr. Ross has transacted his business in A Satisfactory Manner, you will please to write and Sign a Suitable Letter to him (which we will also sign) directing him to dispose of those Cargoes &c and should any balance remain in his hands to invest the same in Goods suitable for the army, and Ship them for the Continent, observing to him also that the Vessels which carry the Tobacco and are chartered to return to the States should bring back salt.(5)  By Express yesterday we had account of the arrival at Edenton in North Carolina of Two Vessels with 129 Bales of Cloths, Blankets, Hose, Shoes &c shipped by Monsr. Currabasse at Cape Francois; and Captain Morrison from Martinico touched at Edenton and landed 9 Bales of goods shipped by Mr Bingham. The Brigantine Success which we ordered round from Boston is also arrived at that port. We can see no better way than to order the purchase of Cargoes of Tobacco for those Vessels even at the high price it now bears, as waiting on that to be transported from Virginia would occasion great delay.  We are Sir, with much respect, Your Most Obedt servts,  William Ellery James Forbes P.S. Inclosed are the Coppies of A Letter from General Hand, of an Estimate of Provisions of Colo. Morgan and of A Letter from Mr Willing. The originals have been laid before Congress who were Startled at the Expence, which is like to arise on this Voyage or expedition and have postponed the Consideration thereof. As we were not in Congress when this Adventure was undertaken and know nothing about it excepting what appears by the Letters to the Governor of New Orleans & Louisiana to our Agent there and the Instructions given to Mr Willing and are no Judges respecting Colo. Morgans estimate of the Provisions we should be glad to have your Sentiments on this Matter as soon as possible.(6)  We hope you will be able to compleat the Books of the Secret Committee in A Short Time so that they and the papers may be laid before Congress, and a Commercial Committee appointed upon the Plan proposed by you or one Similar to it, for we are fully convinced from the little we have seen that such A plan is necessary and that we are unequal to the Important business Committed to our charge.(7)  William Ellery James Forbes ""

I have just passed my Eye over them again & determined imperfect as they are to submit them to your candor. I could add a long & affecting paragraph on the Subject of Non Representation, I could tell you truly the House has been reduced to nine States represented in Units-that we have Sometimes been Stagnant from a want of Members & oftner running whole days into weeds of unmatured conversations from a want of able Members. I could tell you that thousands & Millions have been wasted & are wasting, from a want of proper Men & sufficient members to attend the affairs of the Treasury, most amazingly in Arrears. Hence, peculators in all the Classes have gained time to learn & have now the audacity to boast, that Congress fall short of coercive powers for compelling them to fair reckonings. I could tell you of consequences infinitely worse than the loss of Money, aye, than the loss of as many millions as we have Issued. We have lost the opportunity of driving the Enemy from Philadelphia this Winter, but if what I have already said will not awaken you, you will not be persuaded by all the tellings & all the exhortations I am capable of.

While I was confined in Bed by the Gout your several Letters of the 3d & 4th November public, & 28th private,(1) were brought to me, & just now are come to hand one of the 11th & three of the 12th December.(2)  My confinement was no impediment to the progress of the first mentioned. They were duly presented to Congress & referred to the Board of War, where they have lain asleep upwards of a Month. I shall embrace the first proper moment for presenting all that is public of your New Commands. I have such a multitude of papers to lay before the House as will engross two or three next Meetings, & as I mean by the force of what you have now charged me with to raise the former from the dead I must not make the attempt in a Croud.  I perceive My Dear General you scold a little, you have reason, but direct your resentment properly, it will not light upon the present Epitome of a shadow of a proper Representation of the Magnanimous, Free & Independent thirteen United States of America, consisting very often of less than thirteen Men.  I have scarcely patience to go one step further. No my Dear fellow Citizen, it will rise into the highest reproaches against those August States, who have acted, & possibly may be whipped, like Children. It has been impossible for the present number, & God Wot the present abilities, to go through more businesses than have been accomplished for two or three Months past-much of it you will allow of the highest importance, some very well done & an infinite deal more than appears at once in your Sothern Latitudes. I am often angry with these Scholars of mine but I cannot allow anybody else to be so. I think they have performed wonders-much however, from a want of proper numbers & proper Geniuses, has been left undone, a little to the mortification of your self & other honest Zealous Individuals-much to the diminution & detriment of our Treasury-to the distress & death of our poor Soldiers & to Speak plain & melancholy truth I am prepared to hear & to bear the addition of the Route of our Army, where we have not above Six thousand effectives altho we are paying upwards of 20000 & the Marquis Fayette assures me if General Howe comes out of the City & attacks our Camp, General Washington must quit it precipitately & give him the Country or be cut to peices & leave it. All these & many more concomitant evils spring from a neglect of Representation latterly, & from shameful Idleness, caballing & party plotting before they left Philadelphia. Chide therefore, fellow Sufferer, Chide the 13 United States, all fallen asleep & wrapped in Golden dreams-and in the keenest terms let us reprove the Country which we call Native. Now for God's sake do not be in a hurry & run into the other extreme & JANUARY 30, 1778  send Men only in quantity. Have the Strictest attention to quality- search for Men of vigilance, diligence, integrity, fortitude, knowledge (& address-and you search long in So Carolina for such-I think not-but you may be long searching for persuasives to induce them chearfully & heartily to leave their plans & schemes & pursuits for adding House to House & feild to feild.  I lament in the present moment for my Country's sake my own deficiency in those necessary qualifications for an able Delegate, but while you Command me to stay here, such powers as nature & Industry have vested me with shall be exerted in the Characters of Delegate & President for the benefit of our great Cause & I will particularly attend to your Concerns & give them motion & bring them to effect with all possible dispatch of which I shall have the honor of writing again in a few days-nor will I be inattentive to the article of Rank.

  Dear Sir, 30th Jany 1778. I have been in possession of Your Excellency's very obliging favor of the 29th November full forty days & it has not been in my power to make an earlier acknowledgement & even now, driven by regret & mortification from reflecting upon so long a delay, I am forced to Snatch a minute & write in a hurry without hope of paying all that respect which is due to it.  I have in a public Letter assigned several reasons which have occasioned the extraordinary detention of my present dispatches; to these I may add two-which considered together will reflect highly on the thirteen United States for their continued inattention to their most important Interests, but with most severity upon So. Carolina.  I had long waited for a determination upon several important articles contained in Letters from Major General Howe, for the appointment of a Brigadier in Colo. Isaac Huger & latterly I have been from day to day amused by expectation of a Report from the Board of War on Capt. De Brahm's application for Rank, in hopes of transmitting a Majors Commission & retaining that valuable Officer in our Country.(1) I may go on waiting a Month longer for aught I know with equal effect & therefore I dispatch the bearer Philemon Bristol a Light Horseman (2) with such papers as are ready & promise your Excellency to follow him by another as soon as I can collect sufficient matter.  I will not say the Board of War could not in all this time have finished the businesses alluded to, but considering the multitude of important affairs which they have transacted I dare not reproach them with neglect. Consider Sir, the Circumstances of Congress, left to reap the fruits of former shameful Idleness & dissipation of time & to correct the effects of some very gross & some very wanton errors of these times with the aid of about 21 Members, often 15, sometimes barely 9 States on the floor represented by as many persons. I need say no more to your Excellency who are so well acquainted with business to shew that these are not sufficient men in number to perform the ordinary drudgery of Committees. The Mornings are filled up till 10 or 11 o Clock in those Circles-if we can then make a House we sit till 1 or 2 & never take more than two hours respite, then again till 8 or 9. What time will this allow for refreshment, recollecting & dispatch of business out of Doors-to me very little more than what I delve out of the Night, because my Mornings are unavoidably expended in giving answers to incessant applications. From such deficiency in Representation much more Evils arise than the delay of Commissions. The Respondents for \""he to be accountable\"" have been so long in Arrears as to have learned & in some Instances so impudent as to boast Congress have not power to Compel  JANUARY 30, 1778  them to Accot. From this & some other circumstances connected with the Treasury, Millions of Dollars appear to have been misapplied & lost for which the honest Citizen must by & by be severely Taxed, but even peculation & Squandering are not the most pernicious effects of a want of full & able Representation. Our Treasury is exhausted & we have neither time nor genius for replenishing except by continued Emissions Million after Million & the demand for Money is become so enormous the Press can scarcely keep pace with it-the Commissary's department, the Quarter Master general's, the Commercial Committee, the Clothier general's & in a word almost every department ill conducted or in distraction-& it is too visible that Congress itself from its number & quantity is very lightly esteemed, this alone comprehends all Evils.  Our Army has been long in the most alarming State on the point of disbanding from a want of provisions, more than once, not a \""hoof\"" as General Washington expressed himself nor a Barrel of flour in Camp. Eight & forty hours have passed over without a Ration Issued, & we are but now beginning to lay up Magazines for next Campaign. Our worthy General has been treated with slights which are shocking to Men of feeling & gratitude which he has borne with a fortitude only to be found in a determined Patriot.  I could fill all these pages with complaints of Evils which might have been averted by a full Congress-or half the Number of sensible diligent Men. Even the most alarming of all our distresses a dissention in the Army, particularly between the Commander in Chief & the president of the Board of War heightened by the intrigues of General Conway might have been healed before this day. Philadelphia or New York might have been again in our possession-now the recovery of the former is talked of as a possible event to happen in the Month of April. In the mean time the total dispersion of our Army reduced to 6000 Men is held as a probable event either by an attack from the Enemy or from a want of provision.  Having intimated the unhappy jealousies subsisting between General Washington & General Gates, let me afford Your Excellency the satisfaction of knowing that in conversation with the latter I find him heartily disposed to a reconciliation. I have no doubt but that the same disposition would upon inquiry be found on the other side. Nothing I believe is wanting but proper persons to interpose for establishing harmony the effect of which would soon fall heavy upon the heads of our Enemies, but where are the men for this delicate & important service, not at present in Congress, a conclusion which fills me with grief.  Had Congress been but half full, but I will trouble your Excellency no more on this disagreeable subject. I will sum up the whole with this observation, that a proper Representation of the States, would probably have produced us on this day a near prospect of peace &  Independency. The shameful deficiency has reduced us to a low Ebb, we are become the Contempt of Tories the Treasury is too much the prey of designing loose Men, the Public loaded with an immense debt, peace appears at a great distance, Independence beyond it, the Road perplexed & stained with blood.  Nine Brigadier Generals have made an humble Representation of injury which they feel from an undue promotion of General Conway; an humble Petition has also appeared from eight valuable meritorious Colonels complaining of this promotion of Lieutt. Colo. Wilkinson to the Rank of Brigadier.(3) Both are treated with the Contempt of lying on the Table, such a display of Wisdom & Justice may provoke a resentment exceedingly detrimental to the service.(4)  ""

  Sir, York Town Jany. 30th. 1778 This day a Letter from Genl. Washington to the Board of War was before Congress, respecting their detention of the British Officers and Waggons of which he disapproved, as it was a measure stipulated betwixt him & Genl. Howe;(1) nor does he disapprove the number of men in the escort, although it exceeds the Stipulation, as he thinks they were as few as might be expected on the occasion, therefore they are ordered to proceed with their charge. The Letter was returned to the Board of War with Instructions to enquire into the Conduct of the Escort in our State, and I suppose you will be applied to. This brought on some debate and a Resolution approving your conduct, but as it did not touch the main point, the indecent interference of the two Members of Congress, they being absent, the plaudit was at least suspended by the previous question. However the sense of the House was very apparent, particularly respecting your procedure against the three Waggoners, who it was hoped would be brought to condign punishment, and it was the earnest desire to the Delegates of this State, that you should be acquainted therewith, therefore I  JANUARY 31, 1778  am so particular in this relation, although I think it unnecessary. Our State opposed the Resolution, informing Congress we sought no Compliment but justice. I hope you will not forget to furnish me with a copy of the Letter found on the Serjeant. I must not omit mentioning that your Letter on the Subject did the State great honor and extorted a compliment from a quarter least expected, and the President desired me to allow him to take a Copy. While I write, much interrupted by Congress, I am informed that you have taken up seven retailors of Counterfeit money. This oppy. I hope will not be omitted to do justice to our injured cause, which at the same time will strongly mark the propriety of Congress in the late Resolves requiring the payment of all provisions either in kind or in gold and Silver.

What was the cause or to whom to lay the Charge I know not that the Enemy should make such parade in and out Philada., when our Continental armey was nigh double to that of the Enemy. It is said that a Council of Officers in the Armey has proposed to Genl. Washington to nominate 6 Leut. Genls said Leut. Genls to nominate 12 Majr. Genls. and the Majr. Genls. to nominate 24 Brigr. Genls. It is also said that the said Officers propose that all the solders shall take an Oath of fidelity to their Officers. It is also proposed that all Officers in the armey to be setled on half pay that may not be in actuel levies on the Conclusion of the war, and that all Officers Widows shall have a penson dureing their widowhood, we have some advocates in Congress for the penson. Your prudence will sergest how far to Communicate this Inteligence; JANUARY 31, 1778  shoud be glad to have your and our best formd Oppinon on the Matter.

The Vessel (under French Coullers) was borded by an English friget was obliged to distroy her English papers for fear of being taken, a paragraft of a letter from a Merchant in London in August to a Genl. Officer in New York writes that both public & privet Credit is Greatly sunk, that Bankruptures are frequent and that they would be more so if they ware not supported by the bank, that Subscriptions in the new loan which proposes 5 per cent to the lenders goes on slowly and that the Dutch refuse to Subscribe anything, that bills are already sold at considerable discount 20 3/8 per cent and that every thing there depended on the present campaign being decisive.

I am glad to find Our Assembly have Opened the Courts as well as the Land Office. I wish this measure had taken place sooner; the Taxes also I hope will be soon Collected, this measure of Taxation unless entered into with spirit by the Legislatures of the Several States, must end in the ruin of the prodigious Quantity of Paper money now in Circulation. The Grand Army still remain encamped at Valey Forge; unless a Large Body of the Militia of the adjacent States immediately reinforce them, I have little reason to expect any thing dissisive can possibly be done this winter, as we are told Genl. Howes Lines are exceeding Strong-and should Genl. How be reinforced in the Spring, by a Strong Body of Troops I suppose we shall have warm work-Unless France & Spaine declare War & this, notwithstanding the great preparation made by those Powers, is very uncertain, France finds her Account in Ingrossing the whole Trade of these States without entering into a War with so formidable a Power as G. Britain.  I could have wished Our G. Assembly had fallen upon the Means JANUARY 31, 1778  of Calling in all our paper money Issued under the Sanction of the Crown, great distinction has been made by the dissaffected in this and many Other States, an evil universally complained of, & has been remedied in Several very Effectually, by Calling it all in, at a Certain day, after which it is not redeemable by any future tax, neither is it to be taken as a Tendre. In some States, Treasurers notes bearing Interest are given in lieu of this kind of money, redeemable in One Year.  Congress have a high Sense of the Offer made by Our Country, of marching 5000 militia to the Assistance of the Grand Army, and greatly applaud their Spirit, whether they will be called for, is not yet known. I suppose they will not (having so great a distance to march) unless in case of Immergency. But this is no more than my Private Opinion & not to be mentioned.

  Dr Jay Camp Valley Forge 1st Feby. 1778. Congress have sent me here in Conjunction with some other Gentlemen to regulate their Army and in Truth not a little Regulation hath become necessary.(1) Our Quarter Master and Commissary Departments are in the most lamentable Situation. Opportunities have been neglected last Campaign which were truly Golden ones but omnipotent Fatality had it seems determined that the American Capital should fall. Our Sentiments on this Occasion are so perfectly coincident that I will not enlarge. The mighty Senate of America is not what you have known it. The Continental C_____ & C_____ (2) have both depreciated but in the Hands of the almighty Architect of Empires the Stone which the Builders have rejected may easily become Head of the Corner. The free, open and undisturbed Communication with the City of P_____(3) debauches the Minds of those in its Vicinage with astonishing Rapidity. O this State is sick even unto the Death and in  FEBRUARY 1, 1778  Sir William they have certainly got a most damnable Phisician. Just before the Reduction of the Forts the Enemy balanced exactly upon the Point of quitting the City & a Straw would have turned in either scale. Our Troops. Heu miseros! The Skeleton of an Army presents itself to our Eyes in a naked starving Condition out of Health out of Spirits. But I have seen Fort George in the Summer of 1777.

  Dear Sir Camp at Valley Forge Feby 1. 1778 The expectation of seeing you at Lancaster has prevented my continuing our Autumn Correspondence. I am now attending the Committee of Congress for the Reform & Re-establishment of the Army an Herculean Work I do assure you in which Difficulties daily occur tho' I hope not insurmountable. It would be much beyond the Limits of a Letter to ennumerate them & indeed in Matters of a general Concern it would be fruitless for a general Evil can only be cured by a general Remedy. But there are some events so immediately  FEBRUARY 1, 1778  interesting to this State & within the reach of its Assistance that I think it my duty to mention them. The intercourse between the Country & the Town has produced all the consequences foreseen by many in the beginning of the Winter. The Supply of provisions to recruit and refresh our Enemies I count the least pernicious. The Minds of the Inhabitants are seduced their principles tainted & opposition enfeebled-a familiarity with the Enemy lessens their abhorrence of them & their Measures. Even good Whigs begin to think Peace at some Expence desirable. The Currency for 20 Miles round the Town stagnates. The Hope of getting to market with their Produce induces them to keep it back and deny they have it. The hope of checking it by continental Troops I give over they are so few in number so much in need of Refreshment & those upon the Duty have in many Instances proved so corruptible that we should delude ourselves if we depended upon their Exertions. There needs no stronger proof of this than that the Intercourse on this side the Schuylkill tho on acct. of the River more easy of Interruption is the greatest. I see plainly that unless it is committed wholly to the Militia nothing effectual can be done. I doubt not there will be many Abuses but in my judgment no partial evil arising from them is to be compared to the Extensive Mischief of the present mode. I think it would receive a check if by Proclamation it was notified to the Inhabitants that under some severe Penalty they should not go into the City on any pretense whatever without Leave obtained from the Lieuts of that county or his Deputies-This indulgence to be granted to no Men on any Pretext who had not taken the Oath of the State & when Women made application they must act according to their Discretion. Another check in this case would be that all Papers or Permits should be printed with Blanks for the Name & to be delivered up to the Guard when they have passed. Infantry alone I fear would not be equal to the duty. But this might soon be remedied as I am sure there are a Number of young Fellows of Reputation that would soon form a Corps to act in Conjunction with the Foot. The Enemy have formed a Corps of Country Light Horse under one Jacob James that has already been very mischievous & will be more so. No person conspicuous in Civil & military Life not with the Army or at a great Distance will be safe if some Body of the same kind is not soon raised for the Protection of its Citizens. Horse & Foot should act together to be efficacious & you may depend upon it the Continental Horse & Foot Militia will not harmonize. That you will come into it after some Time I have no doubt but if you delay it I have no Doubt in the course of this Spring you will lose some of your best Citizens. This has been the case in Jersey where some of their Members of the Legislature are now languishing in the Gaols of New York. Fifty with a proportion of good officers will be quite sufficient. I have not  been able to think of any new Regulations for the Militia which are practicable in our present situation. The System in the main is a good one. Defects in my opinion do not proceed so much from the plan (except the choice of officers) as from the want of Competent Persons to Execute it. While our state is the Seat of War & I fear it will be so for some Time the Militia will be called for frequently & largely. It improves I think every Day & I am persuaded will in Time be as good as any of its neighbours. You must not judge of it altogether by the Report of Continental Officers. It is fashionable to blame them & it is sometimes carried to a blameable Length.  The State of our Army in respect to the Force & Numbers has kept us much employed. It appeared to me highly reasonable that the Quota of this State fixed before there was any Invasion & with the Capital in Our possession should now be lower'd & I have got it reduced from 12 to 10 in our estimate. I should have got it to 8 if in the Correspondence with the General the Idea of keeping up the whole Number had not been preserved. I intended to have gone farther with this as well as some other Matters if the Gentleman who is to be the Bearer of this Letter did not press me to finish. But I cannot close without suggesting to your consideration the Necessity of forming some plan of executing the Law for supply of Provisions. It appears clearly to me that however well intended the Law will have no Effect if two Persons are to execute it for a whole County. I have thought sometimes a Revival of Committees will have a very good Effect to some purposes. I am sure it will but it may be perverted from its Design.  It is in vain to look for any attempt upon the City under the most favourable Circumstances in other Respects if Provisions are not procured.(1) We are assured that the Army have not now nor ever had more than 4 Days stock before hand for their present Numbers. You will easily Judge the Consequences of bringing a great Body together under present Prospect.  I must conclude or my Paper will not give me Room to say with what Respect & Regard I am, Dr Sir, Your Obed, Hble Servt.  Jos. Reed ""

Though this Declaration had been made without Effect formerly, yet, it had Influence on the 29th of Novr. when his Name was added in a Resolve which was on the point of passing in regard to two other Officers, whose Case, it was asserted, was similar to his.  This Resemblance was true in a Refference of A. to the 4 other Gentlemen promoted on the Day you was chosen a Continental M.G. but it is not true when referred to your former Situation. And this Nicety was not adverted to at all I believe when the sudden Addition was offered & passed Novr. 29th or if adverted to it did not opperate so powerfully as the Influence of the Declaration before mentioned.  You may be assured that your Name and Character is as highly esteemed in Congress at both Camps, than which I cannot find a more honorable Comparison.

  Sir No. 11. Camp near the Valley Forge, Feb. 3d. 1778 Your Committee in yesterday's Conference with the General took into Consideration the Memorial of the Council & Assembly of this State, proposing an Attack upon the City of Philadelphia.(1) The happy Consequences resulting from a successful Attempt of this Nature, not only to the inhabitants of this State, but the general Interest, are too many & great, not to excite our warmest Wishes, & most earnest Anxieties. We have therefore weighd every Circumstance with the minutest Attention, & when military Judgment has been requisite, we have endeavoured to supply it with the best Advice & Information. We find it, Sir, universally admitted even by those unacquainted with its Wants & Distresses, that the Continental Army is not equal to the Enterprize in point of Numbers, & it is proposed to supply this Deficiency by a large Collection of Militia from this & the neighbouring States. Such a Collection we presume, as making all due Allowance for the Advantages of Discipline & Experience, will enable us to cope with the Enemy. The Practicability of this Measure seems also to be grounded on a Passage over the River on the Ice, a Supply of Arms, & some Species of Provisions from the Stores of this Army. Any one of which Circumstances failing all Prospects of Success vanish. It is with Sincere Regret Sir, we are obliged to state, that the Continental Army has during the whole Campaign depended upon daily Supplies. No Magazines having been formed, it has not at any Period had 4 days Provisions in Advance. Its late Necessities Congress are acquainted with. When we say they do not now suffer, we say the best the Case will admit. But we need not enter into a Detail of FEBRUARY 3, 1778  Difficulties, which have called for the most vigorous Exertions of the States, both collectively & separately to remove. We would only suggest, that if such is the Situation, & such the Prospect when confined to the smaller Scale of the Continental Army, what can be expected, but extreme Famine & Distress, when this Number is doubled & trebled. We cannot from our best Inquiries entertain a rational Hope of subsisting them, during the necessary Preparations. The difficulty of doing it on their March is equally obvious. We may farther add, that coming in from different Distances, & at different Times which the utmost Activity & Circumspection will not prevent, they must suffer every Hardship, & Fatigue which are inseparable from the Want of cover & the Inclemency of the Season.  The State of the Arms is equally unpropitious to our Wishes. The Legislature of this State will alone require for their Militia a greater Number, than can be procured for the Occasion. There would be a Deficiency of many other Articles essential to the Service & equally unattainable But we need not trespass longer, Sir, on your Time. The course of this Season has furnished the clearest Evidence, how little we can depend upon the Passage of the Schuylkill. Tho twice frozen with every Appearance of continuing so, a sudden Change of Weather has shewn the precarious Footing on which such an Enterprize must stand. This Uncertainty every Day increases-every Person acquainted with this Climate & these Rivers must feel the Weight of this Difficulty.  We need not dwell upon the Consequences of engaging in this Attempt without prosecuting it, or failing in the Execution. They appear to us many & great. The Wisdom & Discernment of Congress will easily perceive them, & make it unnecessary to be more particular.  We shall therefore close the Subject by saying that it has been canvass'd by the military Gentlemen, & has appeared impracticable not only to those who have no immediate Attachment to this State, but those who have, and are influenced by every Motive that is dear to the Heart of Man, to promote & encourage a Spirit of Vigour & Enterprize.  We cannot therefore so far suffer our Wishes to prevail over our judgment, as to recommend the Prosecution of a Measure attended with so many Difficulties, & from which there is so small a Prospect of Success.

  Feb. 3. [1778] Being disappointed in sending this forward at the time expected, I cannot help mentioning to Your Excellency very Shortly a Matter which hangs heavy at my heart. Whilst all the States are fortifying every Creek & Inlet where Vessels can possibly enter, I fear Our State have Neglected Cape Lookout Bay & Cape Fear River. The Latter is such a harbour, as may at all times be safe for the Enemy to Enter, & ravage the Country at will more especially at this time, when all our Continental Troops are at the distance of 600 Miles from that place. FEBRUARY 3, 1778  Cape Look Out is one of the finest Harbours on the American Coast, & would be a noble Asylum for the Continental and Private Ships of war to wood & water, as also a Place of Security for Trading Vessels Chaced by the Enemy. I am distressed beyond Measure to find Our Sea Coast so much neglected, to please (I fear) a few Individuals who may be interested in the Matter. I am as befor Your Excellys. Most Ob &c &c &c Cornl Harnett  [P.S.] I am confined to my room by the Gout, & therefore can not with that Accuracy I could wish, answer your Queres in regard to Major Genl. Pay &c.

I could wish Your Excellency would fall upon ways & means to procure all the Salted Pork in your State for the use of the Continental Army. Congress have every reason to believe the Army will be greatly distressed for that Article, I hope none will be Suffered to be Exported. Your Bills will be answered.  ""

  My Dear son, York Town 3d Febry 1778 I wrote to you the 28th of the expired Month by Barry.  I could if time would permit write a Page full of intelligence, but Monsr le Marquis (1) will relate to you in less time & better.  You will receive under the protection of the Marquis's retinue two Camp Shirts, I am promised two more for you very soon. You never acknowledge the receipt of any article, which exposes us to loss, by the worst means, fraud.  In conversation with General Gates without seeking on my side, I discovered an inclination in him to be upon friendly terms with our great & good General, it cannot be doubted but that there is the same disposition on the other side. What would I not give to see a perfect & happy reconciliation.(2)  Talking of General Conway's Letter which has been circulating as formerly intimated, & of which General Gates declared both his ignorance & disapprobation, I took occasion to say, if General Conway pretends sincerity in his late parallel between the Great F____ & the great W____ (3) he has, taking this Letter into view, been guilty of the blackest hypocrisy-if not, he is chargeable with the guilt of an unprovoked sarcasm & is unpardonable. The General perfectly acquiesced in that sentiment & added such hints as convinced me he thought highly of Conway. Shall such a Man seperate freinds or keep them asunder? It must not be.

  3d Febry. [1778] We cannot tell on what Credit we are at the Court of Versailles, not having received any intelligence from the Commissioners since May last. A person lately arrived Express from there delivered me a large packet which being opened presented a Charte blancke, it contained about 40 folds of clean coarse white Paper-the Packet intended for Congress, supposed to have been stolen & this Counterfeit put in its place, the person who brought it, informed me that two  FEBRUARY 3, 1778  packets preceeding that delivered to him had been intercepted by a Merchant at Harve de grace & sent to London, he supposed the one spoken of above, had fallen into the same snare. However we have taken this chap into Custody, several parts of his behaviour having exposed him to suspicion & we are too well convinced of carelessness in Mr. Dean's part with respect to public dispatches.(1) Your Excellency knows that Mr. John Adams is appointed to succeed Mr. Deane, Dr. Franklin is very old & therefore I am persuaded that abilities in addition to his are extremely wanted.  Congress have projected an Irruption into Canada, & had appointed Marquis delafayette 1st, Major Gen Conway 2d, & Brigadier General Stark 3d in Command.(2) The Marquis came from Camp to York, discovered a noble resentment for the affront offered to his Commander General Washington, to whom his appointment had not been intimated by Congress, said he could not go without a General Officer of the Rank of \""Major General\"" in whom he could put confidence, & therefore demanded General McDougal or Baron Kalb & that their appointment should be through his General.  Congress & the Board of War hesitated, the Marquis said if he was disappointed he must immediately go to France to account for his conduct, & that every foreign Officer would accompany him. Had an Irruption of this nature taken place, the World at large must have been informed of the unmeritted insult offered the General & Commander in Chief, & Censure must have followed both on Congress & the Board of War. Ignorance perhaps might have accounted for the conduct of the former, although they were warned against the unjustifiable step. A good deal of struggle was made to elude the Marquis's demands. He was firm & Succeeded & this Morning he took leave of me & proceeded to the Camp in order as he Says, to receive the Commands of his General, to take either General McDougal or General Kalb with him & go rapidly forward to Albany.(3) He speaks of G.C.(4) in the most unfavorable terms, who will be much mortified by this new arrangement.  I count it a misfortune that I do not approve of this Canada expedition because I am almost single in opinion, however there is no Man in our Army so likely to succeed in it as this young Noble Man. He is skilful in the Art of War, is sensible & brave & will have great Influence in Canada with the Noblesse, the Church & the Commonalty. He takes in his suite some eight or ten prime French Officers in order to raise Companies in that Country.  I wish our utmost strength of Men & Money had been collected to the one point for driving the Enemy from this quarter that we would hedge securely in our own proper territory. Canada as well as East & West Florida must in a few years fall into the general Union without loss of Blood or expence of Treasure on our part-& the diversion  which we pretend will be made of the Enemy's forces is by no means, according to my judgement, an equivalent for the risque we take by diverting our own forces in the present State of affairs. Hence Your Excellency will perceive how totally So. Carolina & Georgia are effaced from our memory. The Enemy will not be ignorant of our weakness & I am informed by two Men who have made their escape from the Enemy on Delaware that the common talk there was an Expedition against So Carolina in the Spring. These Men are Jeremiah Vane, a Native of Charles Town & Richd. Aislep a Seaman. I supplied them with Sixty Dollars to assist them on their return to our Port, presuming the public of So. Carolina will admit the charge, otherwise it shall be my own expence.  There lies on the Treasury here, 100000 Dollars returned by Mr. G A Hall & upwards of 14000, which had been left in my hands by Mr. Middleton & Mr. Hayward, all the property of South Carolina.  I have the honour to be with great Esteem & Respect &ca.  [P.S.] I have heard it avowed in full Congress that we have sustained losses of several hundred thousand Dollars in the Passage from the Board of War to distant departments, not in my time thank God.

  Sir Camp near the Valley Forge, Feby. 5, 1778 In Obedience to the Orders of Congress, we have taken into Consideration the Reduction of the Number of Battalions, the necessary Reinforcements for the Cavalry, Artillery, & Infantry, the Mode of obtaining them, & the necessary Regulations of that Part of the Army.(1) Upon the first of these Heads, we have to observe that the Number of our Army must depend upon the Force which in all Probability will be opposed to it, the Operations which it is intended to effectuate, & the means of procuring Subsistence. The Force opposed will be very far from inconsiderable, or it will be nothing, for we cannot suppose that Great Brittain will prosecute this War with inferior Numbers to those hitherto employed, when she has such good Reason to believe in the Strength of this Continent.  Considering the Situation of our own Affairs, it will doubtless be expected from our Army that they should cover such Parts of the Country as are exposed to Depredation from the several Posts which the Enemy hold; secure that very important Pass on Hudsons River which Reason & Experience demonstrate to be the Key of America, & at the same Time to act with Efficacy against their main Army now at Philadelphia. The great & increasing Difficulty of procuring Subsistence is perhaps the strongest Reason why our Continental Troops should be numerous. For when it is considered that where they are defective, a much greater Militia must be called into the Field, at an increased Expense of Money, Provisions & military Stores; & that each Success of the Enemy is a fatal Stab to our Resources, by operating thro the Opinions of the People upon our Paper Currency, the Truth of the Position will appear with the strongest Evidence.  Our present Establishment of Infantry, from New Hampshire to North Carolina inclusive, allowing only seven to Maryland is 81 Battalions, which with the 16 additionals is ninety seven; if to this be added the two State Regiments of Virginia & Pennsylvania, the German Battalion, Hazens & James Livingstons Canadian Battalions, Warners Regiment, Armands Corps, & Rawlins's, the whole will amount to 103 complete & incomplete. These we would reduce to FEBRUARY 5, 1778  Eighty eight (exclusive of the Regiments of Warner, Hazen, & James Livingston, of whom Mention will be made hereafter) upon the Establishment inclosed & marked No. 1. In Consideration of the Loss of a Part of Rhode Island, we would for the present reduce their Quota to one Regiment, & for the same Reason, would we in like Manner reduce that of Pennsylvania to Ten. The State Regiments of Virginia & Pennsylvania we propose to incorporate into the Continental Regiments to be completed by them respectively, & to consider the German Battalion, & so much of Rawlins's as have been raised in Maryland, as a Part of the Eight Battalions to be completed by that State. Armands Corps & the 16 Additionals we would reduce to nine, & of Hazen's & James Livingstons Canadian Regiments form one upon the new Establishment, & reduce Warners to the same Standard, to be filled up if possible by voluntary Inlistments.  We would continue our Establishment of Artillery, which is four Regiments, in the Manner marked No. 2. And that of our four Regiments of Cavalry, which in the Opinion of your Committee is of the utmost Importance, especially in the open Country of Pennsylvania, we would place on the Footing mark'd No. 3. Our daily Information of the great Pains taken by the Enemy to increase their Cavalry demonstrates the Propriety & even Necessity of putting ourselves in a Situation to meet them with a decisive Superiority.  It will be essentially advantageous for the Care & good Discipline of the Army to add a Provost Corps. The Establishment of which is in the Inclosure No. 4. The Army we would propose to complete would therefore in the whole Infantry, Artillery, & Cavalry amount to 53,822 non commissioned Officers & Privates as will appear by the Inclosure No. 5.  The Reinforcements necessary for this Army will from what we have already said be very considerable, as may easily be determined by a Comparison between the Numbers above stated & the Returns of the Army filed in the War Office. Copies of such Parts of these Returns as relate to each State ought to be sent forward to each respectively with the utmost Expedition together with the Resolutions of Congress for obtaining Recruits. The General has already notified the States of the Deficiencies of such of their Regiments as are now on this Side the Delaware. Upon the Subject of recruiting, we must beg Leave to observe to Congress, that from the great Havock made among the human Species by Sickness & the Sword during the present War, from the Disrepute of our Paper Money, the Disaffection of many Inhabitants of America, & the Arts of the Enemy it hath become utterly impossible to raise any considerable Number of Men by voluntary Inlistment. The Hope of accomplishing this by any Increase of Bounty, Experience hath shewn to be vain & groundless; & to rely upon it will be fatal to the Army & hazard the Safety &   Freedom of these States. No Resource therefore remains, but that of Draughts which in the Opinion of your Committee ought to be adopted as speedily as possible. For if we have any Advantage over our Enemy it arises from that Circumstance of Distance; which as it cannot be removed, so we shall allways be enabled if not wanting to ourselves to make that Use of Contingencies which they seldom can. And this Advantage in the present Instance is of the utmost Importance, because if the Successes of our Arms to the Northward be properly improved by an early Draught so as to have our Army in the Field before the Enemy can obtain any Reinforcements, it is highly probable that something may be done which will go near to terminate the War in our Favour. The Impropriety of giving any Bounty to the Drafts considering the State of our Finances is so apparent, that we need not enlarge upon it. Let us however be permitted to observe, that unless Congress earnestly recommend the contrary, there is great Reason to believe that some of the States may go into that pernicious Measure. By the Resolutions which we do ourselves the Honour to submit to your Consideration,(2) & List of Quotas No. 5, Congress will perceive that including those already inlisted the several States will be called upon according to our Plan for 54,668 Men, which allowing for the Deficiencies that will arise by Death, Desertion & the Train of unavoidable Accidents which take place on such Occasions, will probably give us an Army of effective Men which tho inferiour from these Circumstances to the Establishment of No. 5, may still be capable of acting with Honour & Success.  We have, Sir, as you will perceive by a Perusal of the Resolutions referred to, endeavoured as far as we could to provide against the many Frauds which are practiced to elude the public Service. We cannot hope that these Provisions will be quite effectual but we expect that they will have a considerable Influence in forwarding the full Proportions of continental Troops.  The Regulations we propose for these Troops will partly appear from the several Papers inclosed. Such others as we have conferr'd upon we shall communicate from Time to Time, as they may be completed, but we have placed this great Object of Recruits in the foremost Point of View, as it is the Basis upon which every Thing else depends, & without which all other Regulations would become meer waste Paper.  With the greatest Respect we are Sir, Your most Obed. Hble Servts. Fra. Dana per Order  P.S. We have thought it best to explain more fully the Nature of the Above Arrangement so far as respects the Difference of Numbers between the old & new Establishment. On the former the Complement of a Battalion was 692 non commissioned Officers & privates-the  present 553. Difference 139 with which we propose to fill up the Artillery, Cavalry & complete the 9 additional Battalions having Respect in the Disposition of them to the several States where they have been originally raised. And we shall think it a very happy Consequence if the States so exert themselves that the Surplus should prove an adequate Fund for the above Purpose; as the 9 additionals are officer'd by Gentlemen of approved Character & the Cavalry & Artillery are too important not to require the greatest Attention. In this old Establishment there were 40 commissioned Officers in a Battalion-in the new but 29 tho an Addition is made of one Company of light Infantry.  ENCLOSURES No. 1.

  Sir York Town in Pensylvania 5 Feby 1778 Your letter from Paris of Octr. 6th last year,(1) being read in Congress, afforded much satisfaction, as it signified acceptance of the Commission which has been sent by Capt. Young; and also held up a prospect of your obtaining a loan of money in Italy. Our apprehensions of danger to our liberties are reduced to one circumstance of the depreciation of our Currency, from the quantity which we have been obliged to issue. The different States are sinking their own emissions, and are going largely into taxation for continental purposes, but it will require more time than we wish before the good policy of taxation can have full effect upon the currency; therefore Congress have given in regard to you, the same instructions as to the Gentlemen at the courts of France and Spain; and we doubt not of your best exertions. We wish you Success in the business of the enclosed resolves,(2) as well as in every other undertaking for the good of the public, or for your own personal felicity. We must leave you very much from time to time to receive intelligence of our affairs from the other Commissioners to whom we shall have a more ready channel of conveyance than to you.  We are with much regard &c. Signed  J. Witherspoon  J. Lovell ""

Proper care shall be taken of Monsr. Valfort's Letter & the disposal duly notified.  There will be an excellent opportunity for writing to France about 10 days hence from Baltimore.  The little Note was destroyed the Morning it was delivered to me. Unless the New Monsr. Lanuville will follow Your Excellency's fortunes as a Volunteer I have no prospect in his favour.

  Dear Sir. York Janry [i.e. February] 5th. 1778. Your favors of the 15th & 23d of January came yesterday to hand.(1) I am exceedingly pleased with the proceedings of your General Assembly. I hold them out in all my letters to the eastward as a fine example.  I shall send you the oath of Allegiance which passed in Congress yesterday as soon as it comes from the Press.(2) It is our Business to FEBRUARY 5, 1778  Reproduction of Oath of Allegiance, February 3, 1778  take measures with all continental officers whatever. The states will take care of their particular citizens. Maryland besides excluding nonjurors from offices &c makes them liable to a treble tax; which I think falls well in with your idea of making it as inconvenient as possible for such vermin to exist among us.  I ought to have informed you that Mr. J.A. has accepted, and that I constantly forward to him letters & papers for F_____ &_____.(3) Mr. Iz____ also accepts for Tu____ , and speaks of the probability of obtaining a Loan in I____ y. I have therefore obtained a Resolve (similar to that passed on Decr. 3d) for 1,000,000 stg. upon an interest to accumulate (if it can be obtained) during the war, afterwards to be paid off annually.(4) You must have heard from your Brother of the great disappointment we met with about our dispatches from France. I have no doubt the robbery was committed on the other side of the water, and by a person near the Commissioners; as besides the main packet, one for you was changed which was under a cover among Gazetts, while a very considerable for the President of Congress, another for me and another for Barnabas Deane and a 4th for R Morris were untouched. But then, all these were upon private concerns, tho their Directions were more tempting than yours could have been. I have the satisfaction of remarking to you that my Letter from Doctr Franklin as well as Genl. Roberdeau's, and all for other Gentlemen from the Doctor or other friends were written with an air of ease & pleasantry which I should not expect to find if the public packet had been quite the reverse.  It is well reported that Howe is paying the Quakers of Chester Co. &c for Horses and other Articles, upon slight vouchers; but I cannot find whether this is in consequence of a remonstrance from them or of news from England or whether it is a stroke of good Policy to make them well affected towards his Usurpation.  I am in hopes that we shall get our army both cloathed and fed by the good care of the several states and our own afterwisdom in regard to certain systematic attachments. I think we grow more & more practical daily, I wish we had not waited for the teachings of woeful Experience.  I have not recd. Letters from Boston for a long time. Our good Friends Adams were well the 7th of Janry. I am glad they are in the way to advise Heath in his present difficult task with Burgoyne. I wish you had been present in our debates upon that Subject, I think you must have approved the step of detaining him upon the grounds which appeared for such a procedure.  I am affectionately your humb. Servt. James Lovell  [P.S.] The Committee on the Tyconderoga affair have reported, and the Attorney Genl. of Pensylvania, Sergeant, & he of Jersey, Patterson, are to assist at the Court martial.(5)Thus Congress have done every   thing the enraged People could expect, but from the Papers collected Minds ought to be prepared to rest satisfied with the ruin of Burgoyne & his Army.

  Sir Camp near Valley Forge Feb. 6th 1778 In our Letter by Col Fitzgerald on the Expedition against Philada. we slightly touch'd upon the State of this Army in Point of Provisions.(1) But it is a Matter of so much Importance, & the Prospects are so truly alarming that we think it our indispensible Duty to be more particular & submit our Sentiments thereupon to the Consideration of Congress. We have conferred with every Officer in the Provision Department from whom we could expect to receive Information, the Result of which is, that we find this Army has been fed by daily Supplies drawn from the Country at large-seldom or ever having more than four Days Advance; that in some few Instances there has been a total Failure & on one Occasion Necessity compelled the Soldiery to disperse in the Neighbourhood & take indiscriminately the Provisions laid in by the Inhabitants for the Winters Support of themselves & Families. The pernicious Consequences of which we need not enumerate. Of the several Species of which a Ration is composed, we find the Commissary has never been able to furnish any  FEBRUARY 6, 1778  but the capital Articles of Beef & Flour, the Quantity of which has been increased beyond the stated Ration in Lieu of Vegetables which cannot be procured. We are happy to acquaint you Sir that there seems little Doubt of obtaining an ample Supply of Flour. But the great & almost inconceivable Consumption of Flesh in a Country which never raised sufficient for the Subsistence of its own Inhabitants, has so exhausted that Space laying between the Potomack & the North River, that we cannot depend upon a farther Supply than the inclosed Paper intimates. From the Character of Col Blaine the present Deputy Commy. of Purchases & his Success in the Article of Flour we have Reason to believe equal Industry & Attention has been shewn to the procuring Meat & therefore must ascribe the Deficiency to a real Scarcity.  From the very large Issues we had presumed that there must have been some Mistake or Fraud, a Detection of which would have enabled us to make a considerable saving, but upon a Scrutiny & Comparison of the Provision, & Brigade Returns, we do not find any considerable Difference, the large Issues being satisfactorily accounted for, in the Number of continental Troops to be fed (tho' many of them are unfit for Duty thro Sickness & Want of Cloathing) in the Militia, & long Train of Waggon Masters, Drivers, Artificers, Clerks, & other Retainers of the Army.  The Prisoners of War at Boston & in the several Eastn. States, Burgoynes Army, the Guards & Garrison there, & the Forces stationed for the Protection of Rhode Island will we apprehend amount to 12, or 14000 Men. The Troops destined for Canada, & stationed at Albany along the Mohawk & Hudsons Rivers, with those at Fish Kill, Artificers, Retainers &c may be Computed at least at 6000, making in the whole 20,000 Men to be fed with Meat from the East Side of Hudsons River. New Jersey, Pennsylvania & the Delaware State are exhausted. From this collective View of the Subject, & taking it for granted that the Army under General Howe is the first great Object of Attention, we are induced in the first Place to recommend a Perseverance in the Exertion of every Person to procure supplies in every State, not excepting those at a Distance firmly persuaded that after all we have done, or can do, there will be little or no Surplus. And in the second Place, to adopt every Expedient of Economy in the Application of them. Among which we beg Leave to suggest the immediate Dispersion of General Burgoyne, & all the other Prisoners, in such a Manner as to require few or no Guards, & to be easily fed from the neighbouring Country. Other Considerations will concur to demonstrate the Propriety of this Measure. We find the Generals Mind impressed strongly with Apprehensions of Danger from keeping such a Body of Officers & Men collected after they suppose the Obligations of personal & national Honour are dissolved.(2)  We think every Nerve should be strained to collect such a Supply of Meat as will feed an Army of 30,000 Men early the next Spring, & are compelled by the inevitable Force of Evidence to say, that the very Existence of this Army depends for its Resources in a great Degree upon the Eastern Country, which failing it must disband, live upon free Quarter in the Country-or perish The Operations of the next Campaign so immediately depend upon some Measures of this Kind, & upon the Wisdom of Congress in forming & executing them that we beg Leave to urge it in the strongest Manner. Should we neglect any prudent Precaution in providing, or divide the Supplies & Resources of our Country into a Number of separate Channels, we very much fear our Efforts will be lanquid & ineffectual in every Quarter, while General Howe with his collected Force will ravage the middle States with Impunity.  We are Sir with the greatest Respect & Regard, Your most Obedt & very Hbble Servs, Fra Dana per Order  ""

  My Dear son, York Town 6th. February 1778. Your favor of the 2d Inst. came to hand late last Night.(1) As you have filled six Pages on the Negro scheme without approaching toward a Plan & Estimate-& as you have totally overlooked every other subject on which I have addressed you in several late Letters- the conclusion that your whole mind is enveloped in the Cloud of that project, is unavoidable. If any good shall arise from a prosecution of it, the merit will be solely yours. For now, I will undertake to say there is not a Man in America of your opinion. Nay you will not be of your own opinion after a little reflection. 'Tis evident you want to raise a Regiment, as evident you have not digested a Plan. Admitting, which I admit only for argument, you have a right to remove a Man from one state of Slavery into another or if you please into a state of servitude which will be esteemed by him infinitely worse than  FEBRUARY 6, 1778  Slavery-what right have you to exchange & Barter \""Women & Children\"" in whom you pretend to say you have no property?  The very same observation may be made with respect to the Men- for you have either property in them, or you have not. Admitting the latter which you seem to acknowledge, upon what ground of justice will you insist upon their enlisting for Soldiers, as the condition of their infranchisement? If they are free-tell them so-set them at full liberty-& then address them in the Language of a recruiting Officer to any other free Men-& if four in forty take your inlisting bounty, it will be very extraordinary. This small number will do it through ignorance & three of the four be returned as Deserters in a very short time. All this by no means intimates that I am an Advocate for Slavery-you know I am not, therefore it is unnecessary to attempt a vindication.  The more I think of & the more I have consulted on your scheme, the less I approve of it. Wisdom dictates that I should rather oppose than barely not consent to it. But Indulgence & friendship warranted by Wisdom, bids met let you take your own course & draw self-conviction. Therefore come forward Young Colonel, proceed to So Carolina. You shall have as full authority over all my Negroes as justice to your Brother & Sisters & a very little consideration for my self will permit you to exercise-& so far do what you please & as you please without regard to St. Mary Axe.  You want a Regiment that's certain, go to Carolina & I'll warrant you will soon get one. I will venture to say, sooner than any other Man of my acquaintance-you will have many advantages-in raising a Regiment of White Men.  On the Journey you may think fully & converse with many worthy sensible Men, on your favorite Idea. When you arrive in Charles Town you will have further advantages, if you are disposed to receive them, from the sentiments of your most judicious friends. Your own good sense will direct you to proceed warily in opposing the opinions of whole Nations-lest without effecting any good, you become a byeword, & be so transmitted, to Your Children's Children. Give me a day's Notice previous to your appearance here in order that an apartment may be provided for you if possible-for it is barely possible to obtain one.  My Dear Son I pray God protect you & add to your knowledge & learning, if it be necessary, discretion. Henry Laurens  [P.S.] Your friend Fleury this moment takes leave of me & in pouring freely a thousand good wishes, drops a few to you in particular & desires I would tell you so. With some difficulty he obtained leave to pursue the Marquis but failed in his attempt to Climb Rank.(2)  The bearer of this will deliver two more Camp Shirts, I sent two &  a piece of Scarlet Cloth lately by Barry. It gives me some little trouble to collect & send forward these things, why will you not be so kind as to take the very little which is necessary barely to acknowledge the Receipt of them. I have often requested this & have assigned such good reasons for the necessary Check as I should have thought abstracted from the Idea of humoring an old & good friend, would have made a proper impression upon a Man of so much accuracy as I perceive you are when you transact business for or correspond with any body but poor me.

  Dear sir Febry. 6th. 1778 I will not make so little use of your many friendly professions, and your knowledge of the perplexing multiplicity of affairs which naturally lay before Congress, as now to make any other apology for not before answering your very obliging letter of Decr. 29th than by telling you that there have been very few Delegates and very many Foreigners at York Town for some time past. I hope the inclosed Resolve will prove a sifter to many vermin who are eating continental bread.(1) Virginia is acting with her wonted Spirit in filling up her Quota and furnishing 5000 volunteers to open the next Campaign besides providing for the army both Cloathing and Food. They have also a Test. Maryland not only excluded Nonjurors from Office but subjects them to treble Taxation. This last is peculiar to Maryland, but I think it a very good Example for other States. You will have seen what we have done in regard to the affair of Retalliation which you mentioned; and also how far we have exceeded your hints about Burgoyne. It is high time that we should show that we feel Independence as well as profess it. We long ago instructed our Commissioners to show under the authority of our Signature that we had not treated nor would ever treat with Gr Br upon any other footing but our Declaration of July 4th 76.  France is playing a lucrative Game, but it is by no means the highest she has in her power to play; and I think by every account from the West Indies she has already cut the Cards for Dealing. We have been robbed of our Dispatches of Octr. either in France or on the Passage. But I am sure from Doctr. Fr Letters to myself that there could be no bad news in the public packet.

Generals McDougle, Conway & Stark attend him. The men employed will go from Albany and New Hamshire. The reputation we have acquired in taking Burgoyne, and the dissatisfaction of the people against the English, make me hope for something Clever, besides it will rouse us a little which we want & distress the Ministry in their Councils, they will be at a loss where to send reinforcements if they have any. I informed you that Burgoyne & his whole Army were to be detained untill the Convention is Confirmed by the Ministry.(1) Burgoyne wrote to Gen.

  My dear Sir York in Pennsylvania Feby 7. 1778 I cannot longer deprive myself of the Pleasure of writing a Letter to You, altho on other Occasions my Mind sometimes recoils at the Ideas of Pen & Paper. The Business of Congress in the winter Season is greatly increased on account of the necessary Reformation Plan & Preparation for a succeeding Campaign, & at this Time there is half the number of Members to transact it. Few can stand it as well as our FEBRUARY 7, 1778  friend Mr Lovell; he writes Morning, Noon & Night, sickens once a Fortnight, and devotes a Day to Sleep, after which, like the Sun from behind a Cloud he makes his Appearance with his usual Splendor.  The Department of the Commissary General of military Stores is now Under the Consideration of the Board of War, your Letter relative to Major Ayers, shall be communicated to General Gates, who is very attentive to the Business.(1)  The Commissary of Provisions has made frequent Applications to Congress for their Assistance in conducting the Business of his Department;(2) indeed, We have had little Assistance from his Appointment, neither could it be expected from a better Officer whilst the Regulations prevented him from appointing his Deputies, but You well know from whence this Part of the Plan originated, & for what Purpose it has been obstinately supported. It's advocates have finally given it up, after distressing the Army, Congress, & the Continent with it for six or eight Months. I wish We may be successful in Measures to correct the Errors, but it is easier to prevent than remedy an Evil.  The Baron de Steuben is in Town, & is much esteemed as a great Officer & accomplished Gentleman. His proposals will be complied with by Congress, & he expects in a Day or two to repair to the Army. Great Benefit may be derived from his abilities, unless the mistaken Notions of Honor, which mislead our Army, should prevent it. I inclose You some Resolutions of Congress relative to the Tryal of the Officers concerned in the Loss of Ticonderoga: the last Resolve was omitted to be copied at the Secretary's Office, & was not attested, but is correct, & compares with the Journals. I wish that they may be published, to convince the people that Congress are in earnest in probing this Wound, & Officers, that Misconduct of the Army will not pass unnoticed.  By a Vessel arrived at South Quay in Maryland, We are informed that our worthy Friend Doctor Franklin is dangerously ill of a Wound which he received in his Bed from an assassin supposed to be employed by Lord Stormont. The Master informed Mr Samuel Purviance, whose Letter to a Gentleman in this place I have seen, that he left France the 8th Decr., that the News arrived the Day of his sailing, & that advices were received of the Surrender of General Burgoyne's Army, & loss of the Philadelphia, at the same Time. He has brot the King's Speech, which Mr. Lovell will inclose You, it is the Index of a melancholy & desponding Mind.(3) By a vigorous Exertion the ensuing Campaign, & the Smiles of divine providence, I hope We shall be free of the rage of this weak & merciless Tyrant.

  Dear sir York in Pennsylvania Feby 7. 1778 I have not yet been able to make any Discoveries that can justify a Suspicion of a Plan's being formed to injure the Reputation of, or remove from office, the Gentleman hinted at in your Favour of Jany the 4th. And the Alarms that have been spread & Jealousies that are excited relative to this Matter appear to be calculated rather to answer mischeivous than useful Purposes; at least, I fear this will be the Consequence.(1) It is essentially necessary to the Authority of an Officer that those who are under him should have a Confidence in his Abilities, & Pride in his Character; & certain it is, that those cannot long exist, where these are frequently called in question. How then can we account for such groundless Rumours, at a Time when the Character of this worthy officer is high in Congress, & when there appears to be an Intention of the Members to support him, but by considering them as the Effect of a party Spirit that is dangerous to the Cause in which we are engaged. I am exceedingly distressed at the Dissentions that begin to prevail in the Army, they augur ill, & whilst uncorrected are of themselves sufficient to reverse our Affairs. I know your firm Attachment to the Cause, & express myself without Reserve, that We may cooperate in preventing an Evil that has frequently involved in Ruin mighty Empires; an Evil that, if not timely prevented, cannot be remedied. How frequently do we find in History, that an artful General has spared no pains or Expence to accomplish such purposes in the Camp of his adversary; & When We consider, that We are at War with a Nation which for Centuries past has been FEBRUARY 7, 1778  trained to the Business, that our former Connections with her expose us to Dangers from Intrigues, which otherwise could not be carried into Effect, surely too much Caution cannot be used to guard against internal Dissentions. I know not the Source of the Uneasiness which We are speaking of (& being a Friend to both parties shall for the Interest of my Country side with neither) but it would not be any Ways surprizing to me to find the Enemy at the Bottom of the Dispute, & If they did not originate it, they will certainly promote it, unless the officers of the Army should wisely prevent it. The Disputes relative to Rank have probably had some share in exciting this Spirit, but here I must condemn (a great Part) some of the officers in opposing a constitutional Exercise of the Authority of Congress. A Resolution was after the most mature Deliberation entered into in Feby 1777 to appoint General Officers upon three principles, which Respected their former Rank, their Merit, & the proportion of Troops raised by the States to which they severally belonged.(2) This was necessary to give satisfaction to the States, was considered as a wise & politick Measure, & I have reason to believe will be invariably pursued at all Events. But What has been the Consequence of every appointment of General officers made by Congress? If it did not suit the whole Army, Opposition has taken place, & reduced Congress to the necessity of asserting the Rights of themselves & their Constituents, or consenting to give them up in a Manner that would sap the foundation of Liberty. I have ever tho't that such an opposition has been the Effect of Inadvertance, & of not recurring to first principles, but the Injury which the civil Liberties of America derive therefrom is the same as if a premeditated Attack had been made against them. It appears to me that the Army have generally mistaken Notions of Honor, when they suppose that a foreign officer of great Experience cannot be introduced to high rank without disgracing all below him. I have as great prejudices in favour of my Countrymen as any person, perhaps on Earth; And will readily grant, that with the same Degree of Experience & under similar Advantages, no Officers whatever will exceed them in skill & prowess; but can any person suppose that a Year or two in the service of the united States will qualify an officer as well as ten or twenty years service in the armies of Europe? & has not our Cause been almost ruined, does it not at this instant suffer greatly from the want of experienced officers (to introduce Discipline into the Army)? Under these Circumstances then is it not evident that the Honor of an Officer who readily consents to promote the service of his Country by giving place to Experience, is established; whilst those who oppose this do it at the Expence of their reputation.  I know of no Promotions of any Consequence that have not been made on the purest Principles, & a full conviction of Merit in the Officer appointed; but such are the prejudices of each Person in   Favour of himself that it rarely happens, when he exercises a Judgment on his own Cause, that he can divest himself of Partiality in every Respect, whence the Necessity of Decisions in all Cases of a legal or publick Nature by disinterested persons.

Fleury.(1)  This Gentleman notwithstanding the aid of some able advocates in Congress has failed in his pursuit of a Colonel's Commission, you FEBRUARY 7, 1778  will wonder less, when you learn that the preceeding day I had strove very arduously as second to a warm recommendation from a favorite General, Gates, on behalf of Monsr. Failly, for the same Rank, without effect. The arguments adduced by Gentlemen who have opposed these measures, are Strong & obvious. We are reforming & reducing the Number of Officers in our Army, let us wait the event, & see how our own Native Officers are to be disposed of-& besides, there is a plan in embrio for abolishing the Class of Colonel in our Army, while the Enemy have none of that Rank in the Field.  Some difficulty attended obtaining leave for Monsr. Fleury to follow your Excellency. Congress were at first of opinion he might be more usefully employed against the Shipping in Delaware & formed a Resolve very flattering & tempting to induce him, but his perseverence in petitioning to be sent to Canada, prevailed.(2)  Monsr. Fleury strongly hopes Your Excellency will encourage him to raise & give him the Command of a distinct Corps of Canadians.(3) I am persuaded you will adopt all such measures as shall promise advantage to the Service & there is no ground to doubt of your doing every reasonable & proper thing for the gratification & honour of Gentlemen of whom your Excellency Speaks & writes so favorably.  The King's Speech of the 21st November which I presume you have seen at Camp, according to my reading & interpretation, is intended as harbinger to propositions.

I had the honour of presenting in due course Your Excellency's favours of 31st Ulto & 3d Inst. to Congress,(1) the former, which introduced General Foreman's Memorial on Salt Works remains unconsidered & no day appointed. The latter was sent immediately to the Board of Treasury.  I have at present no other Commands from Congress but to transmit-  An Act of the 5th Inst. adopting a plan for filling the Offices of Quarter Master general in the Army.  Another Act of the same date for the trial of the General Officers who were in the Northern department when Tyconderoga & Mount Independence were evacuated. These Your Excellency will find under the present Cover.  The 14th Inst. I transmitted an Act of Congress & divers other papers relative to Baron Stuben.(2) It may not be improper to intimate  FEBRUARY 7, 1778  that the Baron arrived at York two days ago & intends waiting on Your Excellency Some Six or eight days hence.  P.M. Since writing as above Congress have passed a Resolve directing the Committee at Camp to \""consult with your Excellency,\"" & \""Report to Congress the proper Officers for filling the Several departments of the quarter Master general,\"" (3) by which I presume is to be understood to recommend or to nominate proper persons to be appointed for the Several departments. The Secretary has sent me only one Copy of the Act which I have transmitted to the Committee who will lay it before your Excellency.  Congress have consented that Leiutt. Colo. Fleuri shall follow the Marquis delafayette on his intended expedition into Canada, having been assured that he had first obtained Your Excellency's permission.  I have the honour to be with Sincere Regard & Esteem &ca.  ""

  Dear Sir York-Town Feby. 8th 1778 I received yours of the 13th Ulmo in which you mention the decline of your health, a bad cold and Jaundicy habit. A deccoction of strong soot with the Yolk of an egg repeated a few mornings will relieve you of your Jaundice, as I have found by repeated experience and a long ride not to expose your self to Storms or Night Air is the best relief for a fix'd cold tending to a hectick disorder however you must Consult self on the latter. It gives me much concern that a meer unthought of mistake & accident should give the Governor or you on his Account so much Sollicitude as am Absolutely Certain there was no design in the direction. The letter was Circular, some Assemblys have no upper house. I have often before rectified mistakes of that kind but believe was then Absent or Inattentive but can give the Strongest assurance that it was a meer Accident. But when an Unhappy jealousy prevails there is no wonder of a misconstruction but unhappily at this time many concurrent circumstances tended to Strengthen the suspicion. But the President has since been directed to assure the Governor how it happened (1) and that the supposed Neglect or affront was purely FEBRUARY 8, 1778  Accidental and I am Warranted to say there is neither Governor nor President in any of the United States who is held in so much Esteem by Congress as Govr Trumbull, tho there has been a party in Congress and on some occasions I have no doubt some of his family have suffered by it. Yet it is now gone, the same as to you. Tho there has no doubt been some who were Vexed to see the new plan they were so fond of turn out with all the mischievous Consequences of which they were foretold were Vexd, & Chagrind, and ready to Impute the misfortune to any thing & every thing & upon you among the rest rather than their mighty Widome & Judgment should be Impeached, is not this Natural? & Why then such mighty Stress to be laid on such feeble dispairing efforts, of an expiring faction; why again so much alarmed on your not recieving an Answer from a Body to your letter of exculpation, when Congress as such were entirely satisfied & it is rather unusual to direct answers on such Occasions & when the suspicion if any, arose from Individuals; if the body had passed any Censure most certainly they ought to have taken it of when the Occasion was removed, or they better informed but there had been no Censure from the body. Beside the Amazing croud of business has prevented attention to many things, as Answers to letters & the like, which were rather matters of Complaisonice, Congress the Country & Army have suffered sufficiently for this Imprudence of their New regulation, and they are enough sick of it, and if they can possible relieve themselves by New men or measures they are ready to Adopt them: they therefore as well as Genll Gates & board of Warr most ardently wish your attendance, I with them, & nothing but your want of health has excused you in my View, for the security of our Country in no measure ought to be Neglected on Account of any real or supposed affronts or Injuries Whatever, this I must hold, to Vindicate my own conduct, as I never should have seen this place, & sacrificed my Intrest, & the Comforts of my family had not I valued my Country & held my self superior to reproach, Ingratitude or Calumny. I trust it will be no pleasure to you when I tell you that by the New Commissariate plan & the Ignorance, inattention & sloth of many of those employd, our Army has been at times starving, and many advantages over the Enemy lost for want of provisions & at length many of our Army dispersed in the Country & suffered to return home on furlow, & what is worse the most advantageous oppertunities for Attacking the Enemy this Winter & driving them out of Philadelphia could not be taken nor a force called in for that purpose for want of Stores & Magazines of Provisions necessary for that purpose, & fear we may be as destitute in the Spring. The flower most certainly is to be had in this Country yet much doubt where a sufficiency of the meat kind can be provided; they hear much of Capt Wadsworth, the eyes of the publick, the Army, & Congress, are mostly on him, Next to you, as they are told no Inducement will   be sufficient to Induce you to Undertake Again in that Department. I dare say Mr Wadsworth might have any terms & moddle the plan as he pleased with your Advice if he would undertake, but I dare not Assure them he will, I wish I knew.(2) Coll Thos has wrote for liberty to resign in the Army on account of his Infirm state of health. I laid in his Memorial to Congress for that purpose but instead of granting his resignation, they have on report of the board of War to which it was referrd lengthened out his furlow to 1st of April & if then not fit for service, he has liberty to resign. Coll Chandler has since applied for a dismission, Complaining of want of health-attended with the Gravel & conclude it will be Granted.(3) A Comtee from Congress has been for sometime attending at Head Quarters for the purpose of regulating the Army &c. It is high time for the several States to be fitting Up their quotas in the Army, or the enemy will be Aforehand of us in the spring. My affectionate regards to family & am Yours,  E Dyer [P.S.] I hope you will not forget to settle your old Long Island affairs in these good times.  ""

  Dear Sir Febry. 8th. 1778. Yours of Janry. 9th is before me. Deane had inclosed to Congress a long minute corresponding history of what you sent me. He doubted whether Mr. R M had communicated to us what had been sent of the kind formerly therefore he wrote to him lately with Flying seals under cover to the President. Mr. R M had been indiscreat in remarking to T. M. upon the Conduct of the Commissioners as not acting candidly in their Representations; for which he has made through Congress so very lengthy Apologies, and totally discarded his infamous brother. I am not able to write minutely to you but I endeavour to send Papers which speak for themselves.(1) The long and short of Affairs is that if we can [gain] assistance to meliorate our currency we may laugh at Britain.  Poor Weeks is gone to the Bottom of the Sea with a very valuable Cargo and every Soul but one who was preserved by a floating Ladder 3 Days before he was taken up (2)  Burgoynes affair was known in France and the English ministry concealed the proceedings about Philadelphia. It does not appear by the Kings Speech that Auxiliaries are coming. The Detention of Burgoyne will disconcert the ministry most horribly. An Incursion into Canada is making by Fayette, Conway & Stark. I think the prospect is good. You will take minutes of any intelligence worth notice written to Mr. S A or other Friends. I fear to keep Packets open as Posts & Expresses are altogether uncertain, depending upon information obtained about the River.  I have directed Mr. Dunlap at Lancaster to put up Sheets of the 2d Vol of Journals, and forward to you under Cover to the Navy Board. I hope they will be delivered by the Bearer of this. Your Chest shall go by the first Carriage of Money unless Bat Horses (3)are made use of. I suppose you cannot want the Contents except for your Children though I have not been the less industrious to send them upon that supposition. But I should risk a total Loss if I sent them to any Stage short of the east side of Hudson's River. If I can get the Chest on to Hugh Hughes, I am sure he will push it to Boston.  I have written to Mr. Dana (4) to contrive at Camp to get yr. other things forwarded from Mr. Sprouts home wherever it may be. The Baron Steuben has been most cordially received by Congress. If he should be so received at Camp it may tend to introduce many advantages into the Quarter Masters Department at least. We had determined upon the following arrangmts. before his arrival. 1. the military duties as laid down in Books. 2. Forage Master. 3. Waggon Mastr. \""to purchase & direct Horses, Carriages &c. 4. Agent for the purchase of Tents Tools &c.(5) We have also taken the purchasing business from  FEBRUARY 8, 1778  the Director Genl. of Hospitals and made the Dy. Drs. act as Purveyors. The Dr. Gl. with the Ph[ysicia]n & Surgn. Genl. to order the Invoices, and the two latter to publish in the Hospitals forms of Receipts which are to be the vouchers for all Expenditures, acquainting the Treasury with the forms by immediate duplicates.(6) We hope to save thousands & ten thousands of Dollars by having appointed Auditors for the Camp accounts, but how we shall secure what is due from Paymasters & other Officers who have quitted the Service I cannot tell.(7) Exchequer Courts would allarm the People.

  Dear Sir (1) York Town 8th. Feby 1778. Your favor of the 12th of January has at length reached me, and gives double pleasure as it assures me of your health and at the same time mentions several things which in your good judgment would essentially benefit the public cause which things had actually received the approbation of Congress. Establishing a fund in Europe for the purpose of sinking our quantity of paper more expeditiously than it can be effected by taxes, tho' not more prudently, unless we lay great stress upon the gain of time-making due distinction between internal friends and foes many of the latter now actually eating our bread, vile vermin as they are. The public officers being sifted, each State must look to its citizens. Virginia is going on vigorously in this work as well as in recruiting, clothing and feeding the Army. Maryland besides excluding Nonjurors from office is laying a treble tax upon them. Retalliation is another thing you mention. You know where the main clog has been;(2) but he as well as Congress seems now determined. You are not the only one of my correspondents who give me information about our commercial matters in France. Mr. J FEBRUARY 8, 1778  Adams who succeeds Deane, has sent me an extract of a letter from that little judicious man McCreary, who gave us a pretty account of what he had heard and seen in France last year.(3) He sends a striking picture of the infamy of T.M., but his brother R. had done it before and had totally discarded him from private as well public affairs. Congress had in October sent directions to the Commissioners to suspend Agents. The Baron (4) whom you mention arrived here two days ago. Congress had sent a very complimentary Resolve to Boston which did not get to his hand before he set off from thence.(5) If Genl W should be able to make use of his talents as a Qr Mr Genl it would be of eminent service. We have divided the system into 4 parts. 1st A military genius to perform the scientific parts as laid down in military books. 2d a Forage Master. 3d Commissary for purchasing and regulating stores [i.e. horses] and waggons. 4th Agents for purchasing tents and other military utensils. We have also taken the purchasing part from the hands of the Director General of Hospitals; the Deputy D.G. is to act as Purveyor in consequence of the plans of the D.G. and the Ph. and Surg. Genl conjointly, and the orders of the two last with such other vouchers as they shall direct and report to the Treasury from time to time are to be produced in proof of expenditures. Rush has resigned, there being a mortal enmity between him and Shippen.(6)  As to winter's plan I am egregiously baulked. Howe will rest quiet, but an incursion is making into Canada, in which many foreigners are employed with Stark. The Marquis de la Fayette may greatly influence the Canadian Noblesse.  I rec'd your list of tickets and Mr Thos Smith has undertaken the check of the books. I wrote to Mr. S. Adams to have the advertisement altered; I wonder you did not upon seeing the first publication. The Lottery is absolutely to be drawn the 1st of May.  I am truly your friend & humble servant, J.L.

  Dear Sir Norriton,(1) Feb. 8. 1778 I received your Favour (2) reminding me of Mr. Montgomery & shall not omit any Thing in my Power to serve him, but the Appointment of Chaplains depends so much on the Inclinations & Attachments of the Officers of the Brigades (& very properly in my opinion) that other Interest is of little Consequence; he belongs to Genl. Smallwoods Division, with whom I have some Acquaintance & to whom I will write, tho I have every Reason to believe Mr M. stands exceeding well with them.  I came over from the Committee last Evening. The Reform & Establishment of an Army when so many Circumstances concur to introduce & support Disorder & Confusion is no easy Task. We shall therefore most probably spend more Time here than may be thought necessary by those unacquainted with the Nature of our Business. But from the little Observation I have made during three Years Connection with the Army (3) I have thought more Intercourse between it & Congress & a longer Stay of its Members in Camp when attending military Business would have prevented some Errors & Mistakes which have happened. It is true it is not very agreeable to Gentlemen accustomed to the Conveniencies of domestick Life; but it gives great Satisfaction to the military to think that their Wants, Fatigues & Inconveniencies are known & felt in some Degree by those upon whom they depend for their Honour & Support. A longer Residence in Camp & an Exchange of Sentiments with some Degree of Confidence between Congress & the Army seems at this Time particularly necessary; for believe me we are in a critical Situation & I think are hastening fast towards that Rock upon which opposers of established Government have generally made Shipwreck of their most favourable Prospects. I mean Dissention between the component Parts of our System. Your Acquaintance with History & good Judgment will suggest to you many Instances of the fatal Consequences of a Division in Councils & shew how the jarring Interests of ambitious Men have blasted the fairest Hopes of political Happiness. God forbid that this Country should furnish History with another Instance of the political Suicide. The Danger of trusting to Paper Matters of this Nature prevents my dessending to Particulars; but it is too plain that a general Idea prevails thro the Army & Country of a Want of Harmony between the principal Characters in our political Drama. I should be extremely happy to be perswaded that it was groundless but some Events have happened & they seem to multiply so fast that as a Lover of my Country & feeling an Attachment to its Interests superior to all other Considerations I cannot but perceive & lament it. And the more so as Experience shews how difficult it is to heal such Breaches, FEBRUARY 8, 1778  tho much Time is lost & irreparable Injury often done the publick Interests in the vain Attempt. A decided Line of Conduct on such Occasions is certainly the best, & when Facts are once established, Wisdom & Policy I think should determine us to give our Confidence & Support to that Character which is the most meritorious, without ballancing between the contending Parties or vainly trying to reconcile them. To you & me & a great Majority of this Country it must be perfectly immaterial by whom its Salvation is wrought out; our only Ambition being to secure its Liberties & rest its peaceful Citizens. Let us therefore early guard against any Designs incompatible with these Veiws from whatever Quarter they may come & whatever their Pretensions, for we cannot suppose our Country should not furnish Characters in this Respect like Caesars Nil actuon reputans, dum aliquid superisset agendum: Who will think no Degree of Honour attained while any remains unattained. Our former Difficulties have been surmounted by Vigour & Firmness. The Power & Strength of the Enemy & common Danger with a Sense of the Justice of our Cause has enabled us to struggle thro' them. The last great Evil, clashing Interests & sinister Ambition only remains; that conquered, Victory is most certainly ours. But I am very clear, it requires more Wisdom & Prudence to combat this than all the others. And that State must be in imminent Danger, when Persons possessing its Confidence in a great Degree have lost Confidence & Harmony with each other. I need not say to whom I refer, when I make these Reflections, nor should I have ventured them on Paper, if I did not see that I should be detained from Congress on this Committee a considerable Time, & that some Measures have been lately adopted calculated in my Opinion to serve other Views than those of Patriotism & which Congress have sanctified without sufficiently attending to their Consequences. I must acknowledge the Unacquaintance of the Committee with some important Facts surprized me, & as I suppose other Gentlemen in Congress are equally uninform'd, I cannot but feel the greatest Anxiety least an unsuspicious Confidence in Men should lead us to the Brink of a Precipice before we perceive our Danger. I am not insensible that some unfavourable Events, & perhaps unimproved Opportunities have made their Impression on some Minds with respect to a very high Character; they have been stronger as those who entertained them have been distant from the Scene of Action; but let these be what they may, that Policy & Wisdom must be very defective which shews its Designs without a reasonable Prospect of accomplishing them. To permit Power to remain in any Hand upon which much depends & at the same Time to adopt Measures to thwart & enfeeble its Exertions I can never agree to-either change the Hands, or support them with your greatest Weight. I observed early last Summer a growing Disgust among Characters   who figure high but trusted to Events to soften or crush it. Those Events have rather cherished it as they have raised one Scale, & sunk the other, so as to bring Parties nearer to a Ballance, & unmask'd Men & Measures much sooner than ordinary Occurrencies would have done. But however they may cross each other in Ambitions Road, I apprehend our Path is plain, to take Care the publick Interest does not suffer in the Justle. In the Course of Events, the Enemy have become possessed of this Intelligence. It is publickly talk'd both in New York & Philada. that our leading military Characters are hostile to each other, & they draw no small Degree of Consolation from the Circumstance. Congress till lately seemed to stand neuter, but some late Appointments, & the new Expedition have countenanced an Opinion that they mean to throw a Weight into one Scale. Of the Propriety & Justice of the first I shall not say any Thing. The Characters of Men are too delicate to discuss on Paper, it is sufficient for my Purpose that such Promotion must wound, & very sensibly too, the Man with whom while possessed of supreme military Powers it is our Duty as Members of Congress to be on the most harmonious Terms. I look upon the Expedition considered simply, as pregnant with immediate Ruin to this State, & extremely pernicious to the general Interest. I cannot think it wise to prosecute a foreign Expedition, when we find it so difficult [to] oppose the Enemy in the very Heart of our Country. I know in some Instances it has been found politick to transfer the Seat of War into your Enemy's Country, but that can only be, when you are able to carry it on there, which I fear in the present Instance will not be our Case. A Want of hard Money alone will prove its Bane. I need not tell you what indifferent Prospects of Union there are between the Characters engaged in it. They have entered upon it with such different Veiws & with such Sentiments of it, & each other, that I am exceedingly deceived if its very Commencement will not be attended with very inauspicious Symtoms. If it should prove a Part of a systematical Plan to lessen a great Character, by drawing off the necessary Supplies of Arms & Provisons, & render his Exertions feeble & ineffectual, while every Attention is paid to that Demand, tho' Success should attend it equal to the Wishes of those who patronize it, we shall have no Reason to approve it, but if which I really beleive will be the Case, by attempting to support an Army here, & carry on an Expedition there, we starve & fail in both we shall never forgive ourselves or be forgiven by others. I have had the Grounds & Motives of this Expedition fully disclosed to me by a Gentleman who voted for it, but has since seen his Error: but they prove no more to me, than that an Object wholly unattainable is very desirable. If it be possible, therefore, my dear Sir, let me beg you to use your utmost Influence to get this unadvised Measure recalled before it begins to operate on our  Army here, for I am clearly of Opinion that if it is proceeded in, it will enlarge beyond its now professed Limits, & swallow up the Resources of the Army here, the certain Consequences of which will be a disbanding of this Army & a great Recruit to the Enemy's. I know some delicate Feelings will be hurt by a Retraction, & very probably this may be urged against it, but the Interests of our Country & State, the Safety of ourselves, & Families are too dear, & valuable to be sacrificed to Punctilio.(4) Whatever may be thought by some Gentlemen, the Attachments of this Army to its Commander are extremely strong, & very natural. A long Connection, winning Manners, unspotted Morals, & disinterested Views cast a Lustre round him which a Want of Success cannot obscure. They are even strengthned by that Circumstance of Character, which some deem a Blemish: I mean a Diffidence of his own Judgment & Reliance upon that of his Officers. In supporting him, they support their own Opinions & are interested in vindicating the Measures which they have advised. You must be sensible, I have during this Campaign had the best Opportunities of discerning the Springs of many of our Movements, & I do assure you there has been a remarkable, & in some Cases I have thought, an unhappy Unanimity of Councils, but surely so general a Concurrence of Sentiment, in the great Transactions of the Field will go far to justify a General to every considerate Mind. Those who are bold enough to think of a Change, would do well to reflect upon these Circumstances & fix upon a superior Character in all Respects. Untill they do this we are bound by every Principle of Honour, Interest, & Gratitude to discourage every Attempt to lessen his Character, & weaken or counteract his Measures. If there should be any such System formed as I have hinted, & any farther Marks of it appear, let me intreat you, my dear Sir, to oppose it with your best Interests, you can never serve your Country more effectually. In urging this I am not moved by personal Attachment, but a Regard to the publick, & a full Conviction of the pernicious Consequences of Discord, between our deliberative & executive Powers in the military Department. Some perhaps may think it expedient to ballance these Parties, & that it will secure the Scale in the Hands of Congress, but this I fear will be an over reaching Policy, that will defeat its own Purposes. We are yet under no Necessity & from certain Circumstances I think never shall be to seek for this Security. It is fixed in the unchangeable Order & Nature of Things, but if it were not, this is no Time for trying Experiments when a great, & I may say a victorious Enemy is in the very Bowels of our Country. As I have never known the Powers, & Duties of the Board of War. I confess myself very incompetent, to judge of the Nature & Extent of the Evils, which will flow from Division between it and the Commanders of our Armies, but it seems pretty clear that its Influence & Utility must be  FEBRUARY 9, 1778  very limited, if the publick Cause will not be much injured by such a Conflict.  I have troubled you with this long Scrawl tho perfectly ignorant of your private Sentiments, on this important Subject, but if I had been sure they were unfavourable to the Character I mean to support I should have said as much, depending on your Candour & Discernment to see & pursue the Measures I have suggested upon publick Ground only. My respectful Compliments to our Colleagues; I trust to your Prudence & Discretion to make Use of this free Letter which I should never have wrote if Events did not seem to require it.  I am with much Esteem, Dear Sir, Your very Obed. & Affect., Hbble Serv. Jos. Reed  P.S. I shall be much obliged to you to call at the Post Office in York Town & forward any Letters to me you may find there. Expecting to have attended Congress before this I desired some of my Boston Friends to direct to me there.  Genl. Howe has confirm'd the old Cartel of Exchanges (5)-so that we now hourly expect Gen.

My Duty is at present to convey the several Acts recited below Vizt.  29th December 1777 for bringing to punishment when practicable such of the Inhabitants of these States as have joined or shall join the Enemy.  26th Jany 78-expressing the approbation of Congress of the measures adopted by Your Excellency & the Council of Connecticut for providing public Stores & provisions &ca.  3d Febry-for compelling persons holding Commissions & appointments under Congress to qualify themselves for acting in their several Offices by taking & subscribing to certain Oaths therein prescribed Your Excellency is requested to cause this to be made public throughout the State of Connecticut.  Your Excellency will also find inclosed a Warrant on the Loan Office of your State for two hundred Thousand Dollars.(2)  Colo.

When the paper abovementioned was sent to me I was in extreme pain confined in Bed. I perceived it had escaped Congress in an unusual dress & bespake a new Channel of Correspondence in almost all the States & that there were also some roughnesses in the Composition which required amendment. I therefore requested a sensible Member of Congress whose Sentiments I found to be consonant with my own, to present the piece to the House for a review. This Gentleman, as he informed me, pointed out the objections alluded to, in the House, & proposed a reconsideration, but Congress being deeply engaged in other affairs of great moment declined receiving it, saying in general, the president would send it in a proper manner. Under this intimation I judged it proper to pass the Address through Your Excellency's hands in the manner abovementioned, in order that the Contents might be previously known to your Excellency & the Council. I am persuaded Sir, there was no design in Congress to overlook Your Excellency & I beg Your Excellency will be assured it is impossible for me to attempt the smallest degree of disrespect towards a Character which I have long held in the highest Esteem-under this declaration I have the honour to subscribe with great truth, Sir, Yours &ca.

  Dear Sir York Town Febry 10th 1778 I receivd your kind favour a few days since. Am Extreemly sorry for the unhappy jealousy that has arisen in the mind of the Govr. & Some of his family on Account of the supposed Neglect of Congress in their address to the Speaker of our Assembly Instead of the Governor. Unhappy I say for when jealousies once arise every thing is Construed into Design & Intention of an affront when no such intention is had as was the case in that direction. It was purely a mistake, as the letter was Circular & some States have only a lower house, & it really gives Congress much concern that it happened & that Govr Trumble was so sensibly Affected with it. They have desired the President to excuse the matter to him. I can give the strongest assurance that there is no Govr. or President on the Continent who has the Esteem of Congress equal to Govr Trumbull. He stands with them In the highest point of light as does the late Commissy. Genll. & Pay master Genll in the Northern department. There has Indeed been in time past sometimes & unhappy party or faction in Congress arising from two or three persons. Some of Govr Trumbull family have it is true had their rubbers, but in Genll highly Valued & Esteemed in whatever department they have Acted. They have now & then had a Squib from Individuals but I think they lay too great Stress upon them. There is now no party in Congress. Mr. Trumbull had the Vote of every Individual in Congress in his Appointment to the board of War, they greatly regret his Non attendance. Nothing but his Indisposition excuses him in the opinion of his best Friends, hope he may yet come forward. He seems hurt that he had not receivd an Answer to his letter wrote to Congress exculpating himself from the false & Injurious Aspersions which had been cast upon him that he had obstructed the progress & success in the Commis[saria]te since the New plan was adopted. This might be & doubtless was from some Individuals Vexed, Chagrind and dissapointed that their New plan had succeeded not better that all the ill Consequences which had been foretold & more had come to pass. They would there FEBRUARY 10, 1778  fore attribute the misfortune to every thing & every person, rather than have their great skill & Wisdome Impeachd. It was the Natural effect of disapointed Malice but is this to be minded or regarded When the safety of our Country comes into question-by no means. Congress being entirely satisfied, & as they had never accused him, it has not been usual to give an Answer. Congress see their error and are sufficiently Mortified therein; they are now willing to resume the old plan or any they can be advised to Effect the great purpose of Supplies to alter & Change men & measures & to do any thing & every thing to that end, they have been Advised to Apply to you in their difficulties as they are assured Mr. Trumbull will never again engage in that department. They have wrote you requesting your Attendance at this place on matters of Importance.(1) I hope you will not fail to attend & that you will bring Mr. Trumbull along with you. A long ride may be most beneficial to his health. If every thing should not be agreable when you come hear I dare say you will be generously paid for your expences & Trouble. Express waiting, excuse inacuraces. My respects to all Friends & am, with sincere Esteem, Yr Hle Servt, Elipht Dyer  ""

  Sir, Moor Hall 11th Feby. 1778.(1) We lately did ourselves the Honor to write to you upon the State of the Commissary's Department; since which the Marquis De la Fayette hath favored us with a Visit on his Way to the Northern Army. Altho it may be Presumption in your Committee to give their Sentiments upon a Subject of so great Magnitude, especially after it hath been stamped with your Concurrence, yet Sir the deep Concern which, in common with other Americans we cannot but feel upon every Occasion of public Importance, forbids us to be silent.(2)  It is not unknown to us how much you wish to prompt our Armies to a Spirit of Enterprize, nor have we overlooked the Influence of such a Spirit upon the Complection of all our Affairs. We feel and acknowlege that Caution may at Times wear the Appearance of Timidity; especially with the ignorant or the invidious Part of mankind. But Enterprize without the constant Eye of Prudence is at all Times hazardous, and even the most brilliant Successes frequently teem with Destruction. Let us then be permitted to examine the  FEBRUARY 11, 1778  Canada Expedition in two distinct Points of View; first in itself, secondly in its Connection with other Transactions.  As to the first. It cannot be disputed that it is of Importance to give an Alarm to the Enemy in that Quarter, since it may tend to repress the hostile Intentions of the Savages. If an Incursion should be attended with the happy Consequence of destroying those Vessels which it hath cost them so much to build, and of seizing and destroying the Post of St John's, it would cast a Lustre upon our arms in the Eyes of Europe, and perhaps distract the Attention and divide the Force of our Enemies during the Course of the ensuing Campaign. And on the other Hand if a slight Incursion should fail of Success, our intestine Enemies would have little Cause of Exultation. But to carry on this Enterprize upon a large Scale demands a very serious Attention; for then it is no longer one of those Minutia wherein a false Step may be easily remedied, it may involve the most serious Consequences. If successful, so far as to gain Montreal and rouse the Canadians, have we Money to prosecute the War in that Country? A Country already drained during three Campaigns, and where the Abundance of Specie hath considerably reduced it's Value. Canada never produced Flesh sufficient to feed an Army at any Time, much less at present; so that of Necessity it would require an increased Number of Men, and a vast Increase of Expence, to send thither that single Article even if we had it in the utmost Abundance. If after our Success the Enemy should send thither a greater Force than they have at present, would it be consistent with the Ties of Honor a second Time to abandon those unhappy People whose zeal may have prompted them to enlist under our Banners or whose Credulity may have tempted them to entrust their Property to our Promises. If we have too much Regard to the Sanctity of public Faith to desert them, where are the Resources by which we are to maintain a large Army for their Protection? And if we could draw those Resources from the very Lap of Abundance, where are the Men to compose such an Army? This Sir would be our Situation should Success attend the Expedition.  Let us then turn our Eyes to the other Side of the Question, and see what would be the Result, if a considerable Expedition should fail. It would produce Desertion among the Troops particularly the Canadians many of which taken at Bennington have since enlisted, perhaps with a remote View of returning to their Families. It would produce Disgrace to our Arms, and all its Consequences upon our Money, upon our People, upon our Friends in Europe, and upon the Enemies we have in our own Bowels. But above all, our Weakness fairly manifested would draw on an Indian War in all its Horrors, dissipating the Force of our frontier Settlements and whelming them in Blood. These are the certain Consequences of a Defeat. And on what do we build our Hopes of Victory? Have not Montgomery and  Burgoyne demonstrated the Imprudence of distant Expeditions across an inhospitable Wilderness where there is but one Road by which to advance or retire? Is not the very Season against us? Our Troops are unprovided against it's Rigors and when it abates which will probably happen by the Time they have crossed the Lake, then they will be deprived of the Means of accomplishing a Retreat. To these Considerations let us add that those Troops cannot be fed. The Provisions are (it is said) at Albany, and this may be true, but they cannot be transported in any great Quantity. The Country from Albany to Montreal is already drained of Forage, very small Quantities of which were ever produced in it. To subsist two thousand Men with the several Retainers and Followers of an Army will require at least four Tons of Provisions per Day. Forty times this Quantity must be transported two hundred Miles. That alone will employ about four hundred Horses during Forty Days and the Forage for them must be carried above fifty Miles and that across Mountains being only to be had upon the Grants, if there. We will not pursue this Consideration but cast one View upon the Business as connected with other Affairs.  And first the want of Arms for our Soldiers next Campaign deserves a serious Notice, for Neglect in those whose Business it was to take Care of such as have been from Time to Time put in the Hands of the Militia, or the Impracticability of preventing Abuses even with the utmost Attention, or both, have so exhausted the continental Magazines that we shall not have enough by a third at least. So that every Musket carried into Canada will be in Effect the Loss of a Man to the main Army; notwithstanding which we are informed that the arms now at Albany are to be sent thither for the Purpose of arming the Canadian Militia. Secondly the Article of Provisions is among those which hath made the most serious Impression upon us. In a former Letter on that Subject we have assigned the Grounds of our Conviction, that Recourse must be had to the Eastern States for Supplies of Flesh, and that even with their Assistance and with all the Magazines we may now have we shall have the utmost Difficulty to subsist this Army if it should be of sufficient Strength to operate successfully against General Howe.  But should the Enemy gain Possession of Hudson's River next Spring (and if the greatest Exertions are not made to prevent them they certainly will) these Eastern Supplies would be quite cut off, and then to subsist an Army in Pensilvania would be impracticable; besides which the Army in Canada tho crowned with Laurels must in such Case undoubtedly starve. On the other Hand, if these Veterans instead of being sent against Montreal were stationed at Fish Kill in addition to the Force now there, they might perhaps keep open that Communication. Or if their Services should not be necessary at that Post, they would certainly be an essential Reinforcement to the main   Army, by which it is expected that the capital Efforts of the Enemy will be defeated. And should General Howes Force in Philadelphia be destroyed all their lesser Posts would inevitably fall. But should he be able to ravage the middle States, and drive our army before him (which from the want either of Men, Arms or Provisions may too easily happen) the great Depreciation of our Money (an Evil which first took Rise in a Canadian Expedition) might effectually ruin every Plan either of Offence or Defence during the next Campaign, and so lower our Reputation in the Eyes of Europe that none could be found either to trust or assist us.  We pray Sir that Congress will excuse our Freedom upon this Occasion. Not perhaps so well informed as they are, it is possible that our Opinion may be ill founded; but you will pardon us when we add that it is possible it may not.  We have the Honor to be with the greatest Respect, Sir, Your most obedient and humble Servants, Fra. Dana by Order  ""

  Sir Moore Hall Feby. 11th. 1778. The travelling is so bad that we wish you wou'd not attempt to meet us while it continues. We shall employ ourselves in that part of our business which can be done without your personal attendance.  We have been considering General Howe's letter which you was pleased to lay before us yesterday, and seem agreed and confirmed in the opinion that he hath some latent meaning in those parts of it FEBRUARY 11, 1778  Reproduction of Commissary Reforms Broadside, February 11, 1778 FEBRUARY 1 1, 1778  which were then pointed out. We flatter ourselves you will not take it amiss that we express to you our sentiments upon the proposition of a general exchange made at this time, by General Howe.(1) We think he wou'd not do this, but for very cogent reasons, and altho we are not able to conjecture what they are with any very strong probability: yet this is clear that he confines his proposed exchange to Officers and Soldiers, and is totally silent as to Citizens. As the latter were expressly comprehended in the original Cartel proposed by himself, and agreed upon between you; and as he has been called upon by Congress, if not by yourself, to explain certain passages in his former letter which you laid before Congress, and explictly to declare in what light he held the faithful Citizens of these States, who by the fortune of war, or other accidents had fallen, or shou'd fall under his power, yet he has never deemed proper as we can learn, to make any reply at all, much less a full and satisfactory answer on that subject. We cannot but think that he affects to consider every such Citizen as a rebel unexchangeable; and answerable to the Laws of England, and therefore treats them, if possible, with more rigour and cruelty than those whom he is pleased to say, properly fall under the denomination of prisoners of war. Impressed with the manifest injustice of such apprehensions which if well grounded, we deem a breach of his faith plighted in the Cartel, we cannot but think the present a happy opportunity of drawing forth from General Howe the most explicit declarations on a subject of so great importance to every mere Citizen of these States, and making a renewal of the Cartel, the sine qua non of an exchange.  We are Sir, with much esteem & respect, your obedient humble Servants, Fra Dana by Order  ""

  Dear General, 11th Febry 1778. I have before me the several favours which you have honoured me with under the 1st & 7th Inst. The former importing your sentiments upon the propriety of suspending the embarkation of Lieutt. General Burgoyne & his Troops affords me singular satisfaction.(1) Convention's & suspension's are new articles in the American War & perhaps there is not an Instance in History of a General's having so completely betrayed himself the Dupe of his own policy. Mr. Burgoyne's duplicity will be quoted as a precedent by future Writers, while the resentment of Congress will be recorded as an example of Sound policy. In these Ideas & under a consciousness of having passed my own Vote from conviction of the rectitude of the measure, I rest content within & assured that Congress will be vindicated in every disinterested Court in Europe.  I shall have the pleasure to deliver to morrow Morning a Commission of Lieutt. Colonel to the Chevalier Dubuysson,(2) whose impetuosity had nearly rendered his journey fruitless, a hint from you on this head without intimating the notice I have taken, may be of particular service to a Young Gentleman by leading him to reflect that hurry & urgency, which may be extremely necessary in a quick March, are exceedingly disgusting to a deliberative body of Representatives particularly so, when the application is for Grace & favor. Congress had not promised Monsr. Dubuyson the present Rank until he should be returning to France. Had I been as rapid in presenting your Letter as the young Gentleman was vehement in his desires, he would have returned a Major owing to his Minor judgment.  I wish you Dear General a good Campaign, that you may Succeed in the intended enterprize, & return with Glory.(3) Believe me to with very great Esteem & Regard.  ""

  Sir Camp near the Valley Forge Feb 12. 1778 We had flattered ourselves that before this Time the Pleasure of Congress would be made known to us respecting the Qr. Masters Department.(1) We fear our Letter upon this Subject has miscarried, or the Consideration of it yielded to the Pressure of other Business. You will therefore pardon us, Sir, when we again sollicit your Attention to it as an Object of the last Importance, on which not only the future Success of your Arms but the present Existence of your Army immediately depends. The Influence of this Office is so diffusive thro every Part of your military System, that neither the Wisdom of Arrangement, the Spirit of Enterprize, or favourable Opportunity will be of any Avail, if this great Wheel in the Machine stops or moves heavily. We find ourselves embarassed in entering upon this Subject, least a bare Recital of Facts should carry an Imputation (which we do not intend) on those Gentlemen who have lately conducted it. We are sensible great & just Allowances are to be made for the Peculiarity of their Situation, & we are perhaps not fully acquainted with all their Difficulties. It is our Duty Sir to inform you, it is not our Intention to censure, & be assured nothing but a Sense of the Obligations we are under to postpone all other Considerations to the publick Safety could induce us to perform this unpleasing Task. We find Sir, the Property of the Continent dispersed over the whole Country Not an Encampment, Route of the Army, or considerable Road but abounds with Waggons left to the Mercy of the Weather, & the Will of the Inhabitants. Large Quantities of entrenching Tools have in like Manner been left in various Hands under no other Security that we can learn, than the Honesty of those who have them in Possession. Not less than 3000 Spades, & Shovels, & the like Number of Tomahawks have been lately discovered & collected in the Vicinity of the Camp, by an Order from one of the General Officers. In the same Way a Quantity of Tents, & Tent Cloth after having lain the whole Summer unnoticed in a Farmers Barn, & unknown to the Officers of the Department, was lately discovered & brought to Camp by a special Order from the General. From these Instances we presume there may be many other Stores yet unknown, & uncollected, which require immediate Care & Attention.  When in Compliance with the Expectations of Congress, & the Wishes of the Country, the Army was thrown into Huts instead of FEBRUARY 12, 1778  retiring to more distant & convenient Quarters, the Troops justly expected every Comfort which the surrounding Country could afford; among these a provident Care in the Article of Straw would probably have saved the Lives of many of your brave Soldiers, who have now paid the great Debt of Nature. Unprovided with this, or Materials to raise them from the cold & wet Earth, Sickness and Mortality have spread thro' their Quarters, in an astonishing Degree. Notwithstanding the Diligence of the Physicians & Surgeons of whom we hear no Complaint, the sick & dead List has increased one third on the last weekly Return, which was one third greater than the Week preceding, & from the present inclement Weather will probably increase in a much greater Proportion. Nothing Sir can equal their Sufferings except the Patience & Fortitude with which the faithful Part of your Army endure them. Those of a different Character desert in considerable Numbers. We must also observe that a Number of the Troops have now been some Time prepared for Inoculation, but the Operation must be delayed for Want of this & other Necessaries, within the Providence of this Department. We need not point out the fatal Consequences of this delay in forming a new Army, or the Preservation of this. Almost every Day furnishes Instances of the Small Pox in the natural Way. Hitherto such Vigilance & Care has been used, that the Contagion has not spread, but surely it is highly incumbent upon us, if possible, to annihilate the Danger. We need not point out the Effect this Circumstance will have upon the new & draughted Troops if not carefully guarded, they are too obvious to need Enumeration. In Conference with the Forage Master on this Subject (which tho in Appearance trivial is really important) he acquaints us that tho out of his Line, he would have procured it if Waggons could have been furnished him for that Purpose.  The Want of Horses & Waggons for the ordinary, as well as extraordinary Occasions of the Army presses upon us if possible with equal Force Almost every Species of Camp Transportation is now performed by the Men, who without a Murmur patiently yoke themselves to little Carriages of their own making, or load their Wood & Provisions on their Backs. Should the Enemy encouraged by the growing Weakness of your Troops, be led to make a successful Impression on your Camp, your Artillery would now undoubtedly fall into their Hands for Want of Horses to remove it. But these are smaller and tolerable Evils, when compared with the imminent Danger of your Troops perishing with Famine, or dispersing in Search of food. The Commissaries in Addition to their Supplies of live Cattle, which are precarious, have procured a Quantity of Pork in New Jersey, of which by a Failure of Waggons not one Barrel has reach'd the Camp, tho Orders were given for that Purpose as early as the 4th Jany. In yesterdays Conference with the General he informed us, that some   Brigades had been four Days without Meat & that even the common Soldiers had been at his Quarters to make known their Wants. At present Sir there is not one Gentleman of any Rank in this Department tho the Duties of the office require a constant & unremitted Attention.  In whatever View therefore this Object presents itself, we trust you will discover that the most essential Interests are connected with it. The Season of Preparation for next Campaign is passing swiftly away-be assured, Sir, that its Operation will be ineffectual either for Offence or Protection, if an Arrangement is not immediately made, & the most vigorous Exertions used to procure the necessary Supplies. Permit us to say, that a Moments Time should not be lost in placing a Man of approved Abilities & extensive Capacity at the Head of the Department who will restore it to some degree of Regularity & Order, whose provident Care will immediately relieve the present Wants of the Army & extend itself to those who must be satisfied before we can expect Vigorus Enterprize or Success.  When your Committee reflect upon the increased Difficulties of procuring Waggons, Horses, Tents, & the numerous Train of Articles dependent on this Office, without which your Army cannot even move, They feel the greatest Anxiety least the utmost Skill, Diligence, & Address will prove insufficient to satisfy the growing Demands. All other Considerations vanish before this Object and we most earnestly wish Congress may be impress'd in a proper Degree with its Necessity & Importance.  A Report has reach'd us that Col Lutterlogh is a Candidate for the Office of Quarter Master General. We have therefore been led to make some Inquiry into his Character & Conduct. We would be far from doing Injustice to his Abilities & Experience in a subordinate Line but exclusive of the Danger of intrusting so confidential an Office to a Stranger whose Attachment to this Country must be light & transient, & whose Interest may be so easily distinguished from ours we cannot find that he possesses Talents or Activity equal to the Discharge of this important Office. We find that in the Course of the Campaign necessary Tools & Stores have often been wanting-important & seasonable Movements of the Army delayed, in some Instances wholly frustrated & favourable Opportunities lost thro the Deficiencies of this Department. The rapid Marches of our Army & unforeseen Disasters which attended it during the Summer justly claim some Allowance, but that Disorder & Confusion prevail thro the Department which require some able Hand to reform & reduce, is a certain but melancholy Truth.  Unacquainted with the Resolution of Congress with Respect to Genl. Schuyler we have hesitated what farther to propose. Time is so extremely precious, that we are unwilling to lose a single unneces-  sary Moment, & have therefore been induced to extend our Views to the Disapprobation of this Gentleman & make some Provision for that Event. A Character has presented itself,(2) which in a great Degree meets our Judgment & Wishes; we have opened the Subject to him, & it is now under his Consideration. When we are at Liberty we shall introduce him to your Notice, but Delicacy forbids our doing it, until he has made Up his Mind on the Subject, & given his Consent to the Nomination. Another Gentleman of extensive Connections, great Activity, & comprehensive Genius, but intirely in civil Life, has also been proposed.(3) As he is at a Distance we have not been able to consult him, & are restrained by similar Motives of Delicacy from making his Character & Name a Subject of Discussion without his Consent.  By the Time we are favoured with the Determination respecting Genl Schuyler & he should not be approved we hope to be able to announce both these Gentlemen for your Consideration.

  Sir, [February 12-25? 1778](1) Maturely reflecting upon our Situation & Circumstances relative to the great Article of Provisions the lamentable Defect of which presses so sorely upon us and comparing our probable wants with the natural Resources of this great Country we are convinced that if the proper Measures had been used the present Evil would not have been felt.  Permit us then Sir a little to investigate the Causes by which we feel ourselves reduced to the present Situation. We place the Depreciation of our Money in the foremost Point of View and add that it hath in a great Measure arisen from the Giving of Commissions upon the Price of Commodities to those employed in Purchases. The second  FEBRUARY 12, 1778  Cause certainly arises from a Want of Genius & Activity in the Head of the Commissary's Department, added to a total Ignorance of our Resources or the Means of drawing them forth with Ease and Expedition A third Cause flows from a Want of the Means of Transporting the several necessary Articles to Camp. A fourth is the total Neglect of every Thing but the immediate and pressing Emergencies which arise without looking forward to provide for or rather [prevent?] such Emergencies for altho it may be impracticable to point out the precise Theatre of the War Yet if Magazines were laid up in the several probable Places the worst which could happen would be a little additional Expence in Transportation. The last Cause is a plentiful source of this and numerous other Evils, the Want of Money which presses so hard that we are told on good Authority that private Persons buy Wheat in the Vicinage of this Camp two shillings per Bushel cheaper than the public Agents.  To consider these Things in their Order we observe first that the Allowing Commissions which Congress have altered long ago we cannot suppose will be revived for Reasons the most obvious and as to the general Depreciation complained of the wise Measure of Taxation will probably prevent it from increasing Notwithstanding the proposed Regulation of Prices on which we shall say Nothing submitting the Propriety of it to those great Tests of political Wisdom, Time & Experience. Our Sentiments upon the Head of the Department we have already communicated and suppose that the Attention of Congress will be called to it in a Manner becoming its Importance.(2) And as to the want of Waggons & the like We cannot but believe that the Assistance of the Legislature of this and the Neighbouring States, if properly applied to afford to a prudent and provident Quarter Master Genl. (and such a Man we expect soon to recommend), will remove this Evil.  The fourth Cause demands a little more Consideration. And first let us consider the now immediate want for the next Season and then what is of more Importance perhaps the Means of obtaining Supplies for the Campaign of the Year 1779 and the Winter preceeding it. On the first Head Nothing seems to be left but to urge the Husbandmen of Virginia, Pennsylvania & New Jersey immediately to prepare as many Cattle as they can for the next Summer forthwith, to procure all the Pork which can be had in the Eastern and Southern States, to have large Supplies of Fish laid up from the Rivers of Virginia particularly the Potowmack in the ensuing Spring and to get all the Cattle which can be bought in the Eastern States. Flour is out of the Question as there can be no want of that Article if the smallest Attention be paid to it.  As to the Magazines for the Winter and Campaign succeeding the next the first Measure will be to contract immediately for as many  fat Cattle as can be had in Virginia and North Carolina to be delivered at convenient Places in September next and forwarded on to the Banks of the Delaware or Hudsons River there to be killed and salted up. A considerable Quantity of Pork may be had in like Manner in those States and the State of Maryland, the Hogs to be driven to the Places where they are to be salted up and of the Fish put up as aforesaid a large Quantity should be kept as a Reserve for the Winter. Dried Fish also should be purchased in the Eastern States during the Course of the next Summer as also all the salted Provisions which may be brought in by the Cruizers and which being laid up in the best Manner can be depended upon. Pork may be had also to the Eastward perhaps in the mutilated State of New York in considerable Quantities especially as the Article of Salt now begins to grow cheaper and tho that which is made by boiling will not preserve Pork yet if the Hogs be driven alive to Places where Stores of blown Salt and Nitre are laid up the public Agents may preserve that which is bought for the Army in the greatest Perfection. The large Beeves in the Eastern States salted next Fall should be stall fed and not killed untill the Spring 1779 and then Salted up for the Use of the Summer as great Waste happens from the killing of Cattle in the hot weather besides which the Troops are not so healthy on fresh as on Salt Provisions. Contracts should be immediately made from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania inclusive for very great Quantities of Vinegar An Article the most necessary of all others to the Health of the Troops. Pease for the Winter Season should be contracted for in Maryland and Virginia for the Summer following in the northeastern Parts of the State of New York. Onions should be contracted for on Connecticut River, other Vegetables in the different Parts of the several States which may probably be near the Seat of Action. Old Corn should be bought up & Kiln dried in the Southern Parts of New Jersey which will there answer well for Indian or Mush Meal so as to prevent it from souring. We recommend Salt Provisions particularly because greater Waste and greater Villainy will prevail in the Distribution of fresh besides which the Beeves being killed at particular Places their Skins and some Hogs Skins can better be preserved for the public Use than at the various Encampments & at a much smaller Expence.  It will add much to our Resources to reduce the cumbersome and unweildy Staff of the Army. This hath been partly attempted already. We shall pay such farther attention to it as we can and also to the Detection of Frauds many of which we are too sensible must prevail tho it is we fear very difficult to point out the particular Villains.  The Want of Money is perhaps as inexcusable as any other Want. The Means of obtaining it on Loan are certainly inadequate to the End. Pardon us our Freedom but judge of our Feelings when we hear that very great Sums might be had in the Neighbourhood even of this   Camp were there any Persons duly authorized to receive it. This probably is the Case in many other Places. It is true Congress have now the cheapest Mode of procuring what they do borrow but certainly with a little more Expence they might borrow much more and the Difference between Purchases for Money and Credit is such as will greatly overbalance the Expence of procuring Money. We shall not debate further but beg Leave to recommend this Matter to the serious Attention of Congress. We are Sir &c.  ""

  Sir, York, February 12th, 1778. Your favor of the 29th of December did not reach me until the 24th of January, when, duly reflecting upon every circumstance, I thought it my duty to come here, though, I confess, I am almost tired of serving my country so much at my own expense. I left home on [the] 29th of last month, and went into Congress next morning, where I found only nine States represented, and, including myself, but eighteen members, though five, now at the camp, and some others are expected in a few days. I hope General Rodney and Major Van Dyke will come as soon as possible;(1) but don't tell them that I lived in a little Dutch tavern, at an enormous expense, for ten days, before I could get other lodgings, and that I still am on sufferance. FEBRUARY 12, 1778  The situation of Delaware gives me constant anxiety. The choice of representatives in October, 1776, and their choice of officers, have occasioned all its misfortunes. Nothing but effectual laws, vigorously executed, can possibly save it, and there seems to me not the least prospect of the former, and when I learn that not a single step is taken towards collecting the fines under the present inadequate militia law, or to punish the most imprudent traitors, or even the harboring of deserters, I despair of any law, tending to support the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of the State, being executed, especially in Kent and Sussex. The conduct of the General Assembly, having neither imposed a tax for reducing the paper bills of credit, nor passed the laws necessary even in times of profound peace, much less for competing their quota of troops, putting their militia on a respectable footing, etc. etc., is too conspicuous not to cause the disagreeable animadversions I am obliged continually to hear.  I shall endeavor to procure the account against the State, from the Auditor-General, as soon as possible. The votes of Congress, since January, 1776, printed by Aitken, are not yet come to hand, though they have been sent out of Philadelphia. I shall send you all that can be got, not knowing to what time they are printed up.  Who can I propose in exchange for the President? Do inform me, if you can think of any one. None occurs to me but Governor Franklin, and hearing a gentleman say that he could do more mischief than the President could do good, and for other reasons, which will readily suggest themselves to you, I have little hope of success from that proposition.(2) I was told the other day that he lodged at widow Jenkins's, along with his old friends Robinson and Manlove, and seemed very happy; these observations, and many others, from different gentlemen, whenever I name him in private to any member, almost discourage me; however, after I hear from you, I shall attempt to have him released (though I could wish my colleagues to be present and assisting), lest it should be thought that I was indifferent about the event.  Notwithstanding all the diffidence you so modestly express of yourself, the State of Delaware think themselves happier, and I am sure they are in wiser hands than those of your predecessor  In answer to your favor by your brother you will receive ten thousand dollars to be expended in recruiting only,(3)as Congress have lately purchased clothing, to a very great amount, at Boston, etc., and the battalion will be furnished by the Clothier-General. If more should be wanted you will be pleased to write to em again, but I should advise that the recruiting officers should first render you an account of the expenditure of this sum. No letter from General Smallwood has yet appeared in Congress; when it does, I shall attend to it. The whole affair, in my opinion, respecting the schooner, rests with  FEBRUARY 13, 1778  the Judge of Admiralty in the first place, and must be decided upon the resolves of Congress (there being none but what you have relating to this subject) and the laws of England. An appeal lies to Congress. The case is undoubtedly in favor of the State, and not the first possessor, whether a wreck or dereliction.  I have no news but what Major Read can tell you, and, therefore, shall conclude with my best compliments to Mrs. Read.  Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, Thomas McKean  MS not found; reprinted from William T. Read, Life and Correspondence of George Read, a Signer of the Declaration of Independence . . . (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott S; Co., 1870). pp. 298 300.  1 Read returned this discouraging reply to McKean's inquiry about the attendance of Delassare's other delegates: \""As to the presence of your- colleagues on this or any other occasion, shortly, you are not to expect it. Mr. Rodlley is very necessary here, and as to Mr. Van Dyke, the situation of his family will keep him for awhile.\"" Ibid., p. 306.  2 Despite episodic discussions in Congress of the question of President John McKinly's exchange, Congress did not agree to exchange McKinly for William Franklin until September 14, 1778.

  Sir Camp at Valley Forge Feb. 13. 1778 We have had the Honour of composing a Committee of Congress appointed to confer with his Excellency General Washington on the Affairs of the Army & concert with him such Measures as might enable him to open the Campaign with Spirit & Vigour. we were proceeding on this important Business when the critical Situation of the Army in the Article of Provisions was disclosed to us. We are extremely concerned to find Sir, that after subsisting our Army a long Time by casual & almost daily Supplies, they are now in Danger of experiencing a total Stagnation. Some Brigades have not tasted Flesh for four days & the Commissaries give us little Hopes of Relief beyond what we are about to suffer. We need not enlarge Sir upon the alarming Consequences of such a Situation. To break up the Camp at this Season of the Year when every Officer & Soldier supposed himself settled for the Winter, the Baggage Waggons dispersed & every Conveniency of March removed would be extremely distressing. But such Circumstances are comparatively trivial with the Effect it would have upon the General State of our Affairs. Should the Army from their present Distresses mutiny, refuse Obedience to their Officers, spread thro the Country on free Quarters or disperse with an Intention to return to their several States your Excellency can be at no Loss to FEBRUARY 13, 1778  judge what Matter of Triumph & Exultation it would afford our Enemies of every kind & proportionably distress Liberty & their Country. Be assured Sir we are not drawing an imaginary Picture. Very alarming Prospects open upon us & oblige us to sollicit your Attention & that of the Gentlemen in Authority about you to our situation. They inform us that they have purchased considerable Quantities of Pork in your State which they cannot forward to the Army for Want of Waggons. They excuse themselves by charging the Quarter Masters with Neglect-who transfer the Blame to the Constables & other Civil Officers. In the mean Time the Army suffers. Permit us Sir, to ask another vigorous Exertion of that Zeal of which you have so often manifested on other Occasions. On An early Transportation of Provisions to Camp the Continuance of the Army depends & there has never perhaps been a Period when it stood in greater need of the faithful Assistance of the civil Powers. The Provisions to which we refer have been collected in the Western Part of your State. They appear to us to be considerable when compared with Exportation of former Times. If any Plan could be adopted to turn the Surplus beyond the Necessities of the Inhabitants to the Supply of the Army it would prove a most seasonable Relief.  We would also beg Leave to ask your Excellency's Aid in another Matter of great Importance tho not of such pressing necessity. We consider the remounting our Cavalry as a Matter of the greatest Moment. Its Utility to the Army & the Protection it affords to the Inhabitants not only by checking the plundering Spirit of our Enemies, but preserving our faithful Citizens from their mean kidnapping Designs are too obvious to need a further Illustration. But unhappily the Duty of the last Campaign has left us few Horses fit for service. If there is any one State more able to satisfy than another this capital demand it is New Jersey where for many Years the Inhabitants have bestowed peculiar Care in the Raising of a Breed of valuable Horses. We find ourselves much embarrassed with this Branch of our Duty. And shall think ourselves extremely happy so far to intrust you in it to call your Attention to this Subject. We have thought long that if some Gentlemen of Character & of Knowledge in this Business would thro you favour us with their Opinion what Number of Horses might be procured in New Jersey for the Cavalry (1)-at what Prices & in the best Mode still having respect to the Conveniences of the People & the demand of the service it would have a very happy Effect & perhaps guard us against some Measures which our deficient Knowledge might lead us to pursue. General Heard, Mr Wilson Hunt of Hopewell, Gershom Lee of Arnswell, are Persons upon whom we are informed dependance may be placed. We could wish their sentiments in writing & pointed as much as possible to the above Inquiries. Should we be so happy as to obtain your Assistance   you will be pleased to forward the Result to the General to be further communicated.  We remain with the greatest Respect & Regard, Sir, Your most Obed & very Hbble servts  ""

  Dr. Sir, York town Febry. 13th 1778. I received your letter seasonably, and have sent its enclosure to Mr. Marchant. I have been under much concern for my good old landlord and his family; but my solicitude is relieved by his appointment to the office of a hospital chaplain in the middle department; an appointment for which he is greatly indebted to our worthy friend President Witherspoon.  When I left Philadelphia I fully expected to have returned to it- to have spent many useful and pleasant evenings with Mr. Sprout and you, ln untying some metaphysical Knot, in attending to your solution of some mathematical problem or physical question, and catching by snatches some knowledge of the French Language-but alass!- instead of this pleasure I am condemned to drag through the winter amidst a people who have but one idea, and whose manners are as different from the English as their language.  You, it seems, have leaped out of the frying-pan into the fire of business What think you of leaping back again? Mr. Rush hath resigned, and the office of Dep. Sec. is now vacant.(1) But you are become a parliament man and are immersed in politicks; and perhaps, mounted in the chariot of glory, look down upon so low an office with disregard. Come then a delegate.(2) I should be exceedingly glad to see you here in any shape. I received a letter from Mr. Channing a few days ago. He and his family and mine were well when he wrote. Your kind Inquiry after their health, and your wishes to see my Spectacles are very obliging. I should rejoice to speak to you and your good lady face to face as a man speaketh to his friend.  We have not taken Rhode-Island yet. Inglorious Expedition. We have lost Philadelphia! But this would be nothing if avarice and peculation did not rage irresistibly. The Love of country & public virtue are annihilated. If Diogenes were alive, and were to search America with candles, would he find an honest man? I knew an honest man once in office. Believe me to be his Friend.  William Ellery FEBRUARY 13, 1778  P.S.

  Sir, Moor Hall 14th Feby. 1778.  The Distresses of our Army we cannot paint if we would. We would not if we could, since it would answer no Purpose to give you the Pain of reflecting upon this which you cannot perhaps alleviate, tho indeed a careful Appointment of certain officers may prevent them in future. Without entering into that Detail at present, we have to observe that Distress in an Army always furnishes Materials for factious and designing Men to work upon. Those who know Mankind know that such Men exist, and according to the common Chances of Humanity, it may well be supposed that our army is not without them. But be this as it may, there are a Kind of Men in the lXlorld, who from the Pride of Opinion do great and lasting Mischeif. If for Instance, a Person of this Cast should (possibly from an Unwillingness to be situated in the Enemy's Neighbourhood) have assigned, among other Reasons against the Post we now occupy, that the Army would be distressed for Want of Provisions & Forage; he would now, to vaunt his own Judgment, dwell upon the present Sufferings in the pernicious Stile of Exageration. Whether soothing Language would not lend more to inspire the Soldiery with patient Fortitude, no one can be at a Loss to determine.  Without troubling Congress with any Application of these Ideas, We take Leave to observe, that as there is a Want of General Officers in the continental Line at Rhode Island it might not be improper immediately to send one thither. We do ourselves the Honor to recommend to this Post a Gentleman from that State, Brigadier General Varnum whose Character and Abilities are so well known to Congress that we shall not presume to dilate upon that Subject.(1)  We are Sir with the deepest Respect, your most obedient & humble Servants, Fra Dana, by Order  ""

  Sir York Town Feby. 14th 1778. Congress a day or two ago took up the appointment of commercial agents, and concluded to refer the same to the commissioners in France. Mr. Ross and your Brother were in nomination. If you have an opportunity it would be well to write to Mr. Johnson.(1) I do not at present know in what part of France he resides, possibly upon inquiry, I may be informed. At this time I do not know of an opportunity, but as soon as there is one I shall write to him myself.  Besides our accounts lately from the W Indies, we are informed by a Letter from Richd. H. Lee to his Brother, that there is a large Snow arrived at York Town 42 Days from Bourdeaux loaded with salt and dry Goods. The Capt. and Supercargo say the Number of Troops sent to the W. Indies, is certainly very considerable. Among them are a very powerful body of Artillery and too thousand dismounted Cavalry. What the latter can be for puzzles me. These Gentlemen say that altho the utmost care is taken to quiet the Minds and Suspicions of G.B. that a war will most certainly take place in the Spring. They further say the Spanish Ambassador, the Duke de Choiseul and Dr. Franklin have had frequent and long conferences.  The State of our Army is critical. Four month pay, if not more are due them, and no Money in the Treasury to satisfy their just and reasonable Demands. The press is at work, and attended with all vigilance and care, and has been for some time past; near a Million a week is now made, and yet our Demands are greater than we can answer. They come in from all parts of the Continent. The avarice of our people and the extravagant prices of all commodities, joined with the imperfect management of our Affairs, would expend the monies of Chile and Peru.  For the want of pay, of cloths, and provisions our army is decreasing every hour, not by one or two at a time, but from seven to twelve. By a Letter from Col. Smith (2) he tells me some of the troops have been eight Days at different Times without meat and only a bare allowance of flour. The State of Pennsylvania has passed a Law appointing certain commissioners in every County of the State, with full power FEBRUARY 14, 1778  to purchase or to seize at stated prices all provisions necessary for the army. These Men are subject to the orders of Congress as to the quantity of each article of provisions to be purchased or seized.(3) Besides this the Board of War have authority from Congress to purchase twenty thousand Barrels of flour and other provisions necessary for the army. From these resources I expect fifty thousand Barrels of Sour and quantities of other provisions, but to what amount is uncertain. Our commissary Genl. does not at this time I am informed, know that he has five thousand Barrels of pork or Beef-upon such foundations the existance of our army depends. At whose door this prospect of ruin lies, time will discover.  What think you of Dr. Franklins assassination; with some Gentlemen here, the tale has the appearance of probability, with others it is esteemed a fact. I hope both opinions are groundless. His death will stagnate our system in France and probably shatter some of the Doctors flattering hopes of serving his country through the sides of France.  Will the Test go down? (4) Will the Law for recruiting our quota of Troops succeed. The Committee at camp I understand will recommend measures for filling the Army, which I expect will not be very agreeable to our people.  N. Carolina has agreed only to part of the Confederation, the other States I believe have done nothing with it as yet.  Virginia, New York and Massachusetts Bay is unrepresented.

  Sir. Camp at the Valley Forge 16th Feby. 1778  We have the Honor to compose a Committee of Congress appointed to confer with the General upon the Affairs of the Army & with him to concert Measures for opening the Campaign with Vigor and Activity. During the Progress of this important Business the critical Situation of the Army on the Score of Provisions hath filled our Minds with Apprehension and Alarm. Fed by daily Supplies and even those uncertain we have to fear a total Want. Some Brigades have not tasted Flesh in four Days and the Evil great as it is seems rather to increase than diminish. The Commissaries inform us that they have not only met with Great Difficulties in Purchasing Provisions in your State but that they cannot even transport what they have purchased for the Want of Waggons & the like. Whether these Apologies are justly founded we will not presume to say but this is certain that upon an early transportation of large Quantities of Provisions to this camp from the State you preside over the very Existence of our Army depends. Let us then intreat you Sir to exert the full Influence of your Abilities to forward such Supplies as may have been already bought up and also to obtain by such Measures as you may think most adequate to that Purpose as much as can be spared by the Inhabitants from their own particular Consumption.  We have the Honor to be, respectfully, Sir, your most obedt. & humble Servants,  Francis Dana Jno. Harvie Nathel. Folsom Gouv. Morris ""

  Moore Hall, Camp Valley Forge My Worthy Friend Feb. 16, 1778.  Your favour of the 8th instant (1) I had the pleasure of receiving on the 13th, and am much obliged to you for the variety of matter it contains. Before I pay a particular attention to it, I will give some account of the state of our army, which demands a most serious consideration. A great proportion of the soldiers are in a very suffering condition for want of necessary clothing, and totally unfit for duty: but even this evil would have been patiently endured had not another, irresistible in its nature, taken place, the want of provisions. Congress will wonder, when we acquaint them, that the army, or any part of it, have wanted bread, since but a short time before we assured them that there was no probability of a deficiency in that article, and that there was a sufficiency already purchased and engaged. We founded this opinion upon the information of colonel Blane.(2) Several brigades complained they had been destitute of flour two, three and four days. We reexamined colonel Blane, who assured us that if such a want took place, it must be owing to neglect in the issuing commissaries or quarter-masters, as flour was deposited in the magazines. An enquiry was instituted at head quarters, the result of which was a general blame; but such is the dependence of the army, even upon some scoundrels, that they dare not proceed to punish the most negligent at present, lest the sufferings of the army, instead of being relieved, should be increased. I yesterday mounted my horse and rode into camp and passed through several brigades, some of which were said to have been destitute of flour several days, enquiring separately of all the officers I knew, of different ranks, and am satisfied that by comparing their accounts I learnt the real state of these brigades: indeed the accounts were not very different. For flour they had not suffered; but upon an average every regiment had been destitute of fish or flesh four days. On Saturday evening they received, some threefourths and others one half pound of salted pork a man-not one day's allowance: nor have they assurance of regular supplies in future. We do not see from whence the supplies of meat are to come. The want of it will infallibly bring on a mutiny in the army. Sunday morning colonel Brewer's regiment rose in a body and proceeded to general Patterson's quarters, in whose brigade they are, laid before him their complaints, and threatened to quit the army. By a prudent conduct he quieted them, but was under a necessity of permitting them to go out of camp to purchase meat as far as their money would answer, and to give their certificates for the other, and he would pay for it. The same spirit was rising in other regiments, but has been  FEBRUARY 16, 1778  happily suppressed for the present by the prudence of some of their officers. But no prudence or management, without meat, can satisfy the hungry man. In plain terms, 'tis probable this army will disperse if the commissary department is so damnably managed. Good God! how absurd to attempt an expedition into Canada, when you cannot feed this reduced army! All the meat you have in magazines or can purchase in any part and transport here, will not be more than sufficient to satisfy the daily wants of this army for months to come. This consideration induces me to set my face against that expedition, which I think I foresee will be extending from time to time, till it becomes a great object. I lament it was not confined to its original limits. Is it yet too late to reduce it? The passes on the North river must be secured, or without question this and the neighbouring states of Jersey, Delaware and Maryland must be evacuated by our army. They cannot be fed with meat but from beyond that river. But more on this subject when I have the pleasure of meeting you.  Your's, F. Dana.(3) But to return to your letter. I am sorry Congress have divided the Quarter Master General's department; for upon a critical examination into the causes of the failure of supplies seasonably arriving in Camp, we find they arise principally from the scandalous neglect that has taken place in that department. That this neglect cou'd have been in a good measure remedied by the Quartr. Mast. Genl. being of the Line and constantly attendant upon the army, and thoroughly acquainted with its wants. His orders must be obeyed thro every branch of the department upon the peril of life, and untill some villains are hanged or quartered great will be the obstructions in it. Baron Steuben has not yet arrived in camp.(4) I hope he will answer your expectations. Remember what Chatham said, \""confidence is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom.\"" I joined in recommending Genl. Schyler with diffidence; it was therefore I stated the objections for the particular consideration of Congress. Press on the appointment of Wadsworth vigorously. As to the Field Deputies, I am fully convinced of the expediency of their appointment. Guard against intrigues & cabals as effectually as possible. The utmost caution shoud be used in pitching upon characters. Speaking of intrigues and cabals I am naturally reminded of a certain Brigadier General. We have presumed to point out a station for him.(5) Don't let this movement be delayed. I shall give you a surprising ancedote or two, of another General Officer, who, among you, has the reputation of a man of courage. I was much releived by your information respecting the treasury. Go on vigourously by all means, much yet remains to be done in that line. I had heard of the infamous attempt upon the venerable Doctr. Franklyn's life, before the arrival of your letter. I  hope he will survive it. I did not receive the letter from our friend J Adams, which you say was inclosed. You must have long since seen our proposals for reinforcing our army by drafts from the militia, and arrangement of the new Battalions. I think it is an oeconomical plan & hope it will be acceptable. The appointment of Gentn. of the law to assist & cooperate with the Judge Advocate in a certain tryal is not a very pleasing thing in camp.(6) It is I believe a novelty. I hope the committee have been industrious in collecting evidence. Genl. St. Clair is gone to Boston, perhaps to Cambridge. As to my going to France I shou'd have no objection to go as Secretary; in any other character, I am sure I shall never have an opportunity. If I had, I shou'd think it my indispensable duty to decline it. I have a passionate desire to visit Europe once more, and am firmly determined to do it when this Storm is over.(7)  Please to present my regards to Messrs. Ellery & Lovell. I will write them both as soon as possible. Inclosed I shall send a letter from our friend J. Jackson to me and another to Mr. Rose. You will please to execute his desire in my stead.  I am, with much esteem, your friend &c. Fra Dana  Austin, Gerry, 1:24548. ""

We find ourselves interrupted in our Progress to form an Arrangement & make the necessary dispositions for the ensuing Campaign by a most alarming Scarcity in the Article of Meat. The Course of the Enemy thro this State & the continued Draughts of our own Army have exhausted a Country which never raised sufficient Flesh for its own Consumption. Your Excellys. Discernment  FEBRUARY 17, 1778  will easily point out to you the variety of melancholy Events which such an Evil must produce & how affecting they must be to the Interests of the United States. Mutiny, Desertion, a Spirit of Depredation, & Plunders ending at last in a total Dissolution perhaps of the Army, a Subject of great Exultation to our Enemies & Depression to our Friends will be the immediate Consequences of this deplorable Failure, unless some Remedy can be provided. Some of the Troops have been 4 days without Meat & the Prospects of the Commissaries are so light & precarious that Necessity obliges us to disclose our Situation & call most earnestly for your Assistance. Our limited Knowledge of the Resources of your State & its present Condition forbids our pointing out any precise Mode in which this important Business of Supply can be effected & it is the less necessary as the Zeal & Judgment manifested so frequently by your Excellency & the Gentleman in Authority with you will so amply supply our Deficiency. We could only hint that if from the peculiar Circumstances of the State of New York it can afford us little [or] no Relief in furnishing this necessary Article of Subsistence it may possibly do much in the Transportation of it from other States. Our Situation obliges us to call for Help of every kind & from every Quarter & we flatter ourselves it will have its due Effect in animating the faithful Inhabitants of your State to the most vigorous Exertions.

  Dear Sir York Town 17th Febry 1778 I most sincerely thank you for Your two last clever long letters & not too long. I feel my self in some measure relievd in being joined by two Colleagues (1) but the distresses of our diminished Army the little prospects of Magazines being laid up sufficient for an Increase equal to our demands fill me with much Anxiety. The southern States say you must not depend upon us, when we turn our eyes eastward they say we must not depend upon them. It is in the meat kind we principally fear a failure; as to bread we trust we are in a way to be Supplied. Indeed there is considerable quantityes of pork laying up to the southward as far as North Carolina but it seems almost impossible to get it transported here in season. The Navigation is Obstructed by the Enemy, Waggons almost worn out & the cost amazing. There is no Stop to the Continual Cries for money from every quarter & every department, it is made & Issued as fast as possible but that with every other resource falls much short of the Increasing demands. But why do I dwell on the dark side? We have put our hands to the plow & must not look back but persevere & Trust in the Almighty for deliverance. I hope the Governor before this time is somewhat pacified & his jealousies removed, as all was meer Accident without design or the least Intention of so much as Neglect.(2) Am very anxious for Mr. Trumbull on Account of his ill State of health tho am glad to find his resentments in some measure abated & that if his health permits he will attend the board.(3) His presence there is much desired but it seems Providence denies us his help when to Appearance it is most wanted. The Commissary & Qtr. Master Department is in a most ruinous State but on report of board of Warr the qtr master Department is divided up into 3 or 4 branches which is agreed to.(4) Their is now the military part which requires a person of skill & abilities in that way, a forrage Master part to procure forrage, Another for Waggons, & Another to Collect Tent, warlike Stores & the like & we are now looking out for persons proper to head each. Congress are quite sick & discouraged on their late plan in the Commissary Department & of the persons employd in the Execution, &  FEBRUARY 17, 1778  we have lately received a letter from the Genll & other Genll Officers recommending Coll Wadsworth as the only Gentn they can think of whose abilities & exertions can under Providence relieve us & Tho Congress have not yet dismissed Buc____n yet they have Unanimously sent of an express to Coll Wadsworth to come forward immediately to Congress;(5) And dare say if he comes he may have almost his own plan & Terms if he will only undertake as they entertain the highest Opinion of his Abilities & think him the only person Next to Mr Trumbull who can effect their purpose. I hope he will not fail to come forward soon. He will be well rewarded I trust for his trouble even if he should not undertake but hope he will as I know he loves his Country & is Zealous in her cause. Why in the name of common sense could you the most averse to Frenchmen after we had been plagued beyond measure to send one the most Insignificant of all upon us and recommend him to me who could not speake a word of French nor he of English. I received the letter & that was all & sent him to Mr. Lovell but he can have no birth and seems to have no Claim or any thing or quality to recommend him. You doubtless before this will have Various rumours of a Canada Expedition & may wonder among our many wants we should undertake this wild plan. The Truth is Genll Gates had laid the plan & made every preparation for Genll Starks with a party under him at the proper season to make an irruption into Canada as his Accounts were the Garrison at St. Johns & Chamblee were Very Weak, the Canadians highly dissaffected to the Britons, large Stores for the Indians in Montreal, & that by a sudden push they might soon fall into our hands & if not we might burn or destroy their Navigation on the lake which would Intirely prevent the Enemy from Anoying us from that quarter for a year or two. Beside the report of our forming a discent on Canada again would reach the Court in Great Britain and must perplex their Counsells in carrying on the Warr for the Ensuing year & would divide their forces as they would doubtless send a considerable post to Canada. We imagine it will have that effect even if we do not succeed & we expect our forces to return again before the lake breaks up & will be ready to give their assistance on the North River. There is, it is true a Considerable Number of French Officers gone that way viz Marq. Fiatte, Genll Conway, I believe Baron Kalb, Cols Young, Fleury & several others of spirit to Convince the French in Canada that France is really engaged on the side of America which may prevent their joining or giving any assistance to the few British Troops now in Canada. I have many letters to write & no room or place to write in being dislodged of my old lodgings by the sickness of Mr. Spongler with whom I lived of a Violent pleurisy of which he died about 2 days agoe.

  Sir. Camp Valley Forge 17th Feby. 1778. This half private half public Letter arrives to tell you that an American Army in the Bosom of America is about to disband for the Want of somewhat to eat. We write to you as Governor from the Committee a general Letter.(1) To your private Ear and for your particular Information let me say that our Troops have been upon the Point of disbanding three times. One dangerous Mutiny quelled with Difficulty. The neighbouring Country twice laid under military Contribution to little or no Purpose. The sly broad Brims (2) who do not take Arms against us in great Numbers are assiduous in the Task of undermining our Resources and when we are starved from a Piece of Ground Howe need but appear and it smiles with Abundance. I know our State can furnish little or no Provisions but Something or other may perhaps be done and if so let it be done.(3) Not a Word of Politicks. I know none and from the State of New York I can hear none. Yes one Piece of News. Howe is so fearful that the World should know his situation or his Army know what passes in the World that he examines every Letter of every Body going to or coming from any Place and all this under very severe Penalties on those who shall presume to smuggle. Desertion prevails in his Army, Resignation among the Officers of it. Ours is not without both of these Diseases. But when you consider that the Poor Dogs are in an Enemy's Country without Cloaths to wear, Victuals to eat, Wood to burn or straw to lie on the wonder is that they stay not that they go.  Let me intreat that I may immediately have a Return of the Officers in Gansevoorts, Van Schaicks & Dubois's Regiments containing their merit that is to say let the best Captain be put on the Top of the List, the next best next and so on for each Regt. Those Officers who are worse than indifferent marked with an asterisk * those very good with a Star ®. Let me at the same time have a Copy of a Rank Roll made out for the late Convention by their Committee of Appointment and on it the Vacancies which have since happened. Secrecy in this FEBRUARY 17, 1778  Business as far as conveniently practicable without too great an Affectation of it will be of Advantage. The Returns I have mentioned are necessary for the new arrangement of the Army and with Expedition. I have no time to sport with my Pen nor even to write to my other Friends as the Express who is to carry this Waits. For Gods Sake let me hear that you are raising at the very least Farthing a Tax of half a million Dollars. Pounds would be still better. Taxation will raise, feed and Clothe an Army better than any thing human or all Things human beside it. I have said let me repeat it when our Confederation is fixed, the several Governments organized, heavy Taxes laid and levied and civil and more especially criminal Proceedings regularly rigidly had then and not till then the American War will end.(4)  My Respects to all who deserve them; to Jay & Livingston my Love.

  Gentlemen, Manheim Febry. 17th. 1778 Agreable to my promise you will find inclosed herein a Manifest of all the Tobacco that has been bought by the Secret Committee shewing what has been exported, what quantity arrived, how much taken & lost and what remains except that it is not in my power to ascertain the exact quantities in the hands of Mr. J. H. Norton of Williamsburg, Mr. Benjn. Harrison junr., Carter Braxton Esquire, Messrs. James & Adam Hunter and Thos. Pitt Esquire. The latter I think did send me an Account of his purchase but if he did it is mislaid. This Gentleman had not the money sent him, time enough to lay the whole out before prices rose above his limits, he therefore must account for the Balance in Money unless you choose to order him to  FEBRUARY 17, 1778  Invest it now in Tobacco, the other Gentlemen have Tobacco to nearly the Amount of their balances as the deficiency only arises by the breach of bargains they made for it, several not delivering the full quantities they agreed for. I have employed myself a few days in entering up & adjusting a very long accot. between the Committee & my House W[illing] Morris & Co. which was employed to Conduct their purchases & find a balance in their favour of about £5000 Curry. Several articles of account however are not included therein as I cannot at present ascertain them exactly but when the whole are included I believe the Committee will be still more indebted to them, besides £6000 they are to be paid for the ship Lord Camden taken on her Return from France & Insured by the Committee.  Enclosed herein you will receive a letter I have written to Mr. John Ross which I have signed agreable to your desired by which you will see I have directed 142 hogsheads Tobacco on board the Snow Speedwell, Capt. Kent (indeed this was ordered to him last spring) 120 hhds per the Brigt. Braxton, 476 hogsheads per the Brigt. Governor Johnston, & 269 hogsheads by the Brigt. Morris, Capt Gunnison, to be Consigned to him or his order on accot. of the United States Amounting to 1007 hogsheads in all & if it arrives safe will over pay his advances, but we cannot Count upon the whole to arrive, I have desired each Vessel to [set] out the first opportunity. There Remains  492 hogsheads on Board the Chase } under care of Steph. 117 hogsheads on Board the Snow George } Purviance  ditto on Board the Ship Virginia, under care of Mr. Braxton ditto on Board the Brigt. under care of Steph. Steward ditto in the hands of the Gentlemen mentioned in the general Manifest all unappropriated and of course I suppose will be applyed towards satisfying the demands or Claims of Monsr. Francy. You will also find herein a paper of Entries proper to be made in the Books of the Commercial Committee for the purpose of transferring the balances therein ascertained from the Books of the Secret Committee wherein I have made Correspondent Entries and did intend to have continued this practice as fast as I settled any Accounts therein, had I been left to pursue this business agreable to the offer made in Congress. I thought it essentially necessary to settle these as the foundation of your present operations & would now send you the Books but the Crossing of Susquehannah is yet too dangerous before they shall wait your orders which you may depend shall be instantly complyed with.  The Charter Party for the Brigt. Governor Johnson is amongst the Committees papers but as her Voyage is transferred to your care had  best be deposited with yours. The Brigt. Morris belongs to the Continent, she was bought by Jno Langdon Esquire in New Hampshire & her Cost & charges must be transferred to your Debit. The Snow Speedwell, Capt. Kent, was valued at £2000 Virginia Curry by persons appointed for the purpose, she is my property & no Charter party has ever been made but the Committee must in this as in all other Cases Insure the value of said Vessell, in proportion as their part of the Cargo is to the whole, and the same with the Brigt. Boston in which I am interested with Mr. Braxton & Mr. Ross, this Brigt. might have been sold both before & since she loaded for £3000, which I deem her salvation and should be glad you would either order Charter parties to be made out for these Vessells or Enter on your Minutes that you are Insurers thereon against all Risques untill the Cargoes are landed, at the Valuations I have mentioned in the proportions that your part of the Cargoes bears to the whole on board. The letting these Vessells take in Goods for the public has been of great prejudice to the Owners as they could long Since have sold them if disengaged to good profits but instead of that they have been long detained on heavy expenses, part whereof they think you should pay & respecting which I shall speak to you when I come to York.  I am now at the l9th Febry & find myself disapointed by Messrs. Hunters of Fredericksburgh who promised our Accot. Currt. with them by the last post but it is not come, therefore I will leave the Sum a blank for the present. That they are accountable to you for, it is however above £9000 this Currency & soon as I receive their account the proper Entries shall be made in the Secret Committee Books for transferring that balance also to you. I must observe however, that a part of this balance has come into their hands from the Sales of Goods saved from Ship Esther & Brigt. General Mercer since that price of Tobacco was above the purchasing limits, consequently these Gentlemen will have some Money & some Tobacco to accot. for, they are Men of honor & good Merchants and will deliver every hogshead of the Tobacco they bought. I have ten Hogshead of Tobacco on Board the ship Chase & ten Hogshead on board the Snow George for which I was to pay Eighteen Guineas per Ton freight, but as it is probable the destination of these Vessells must be altered and that the Cargoes will be assigned to Monsr. Francy, you may have these twenty hogsheads also at the first Cost & charges if you choose it. If not they may go forward on my account as first intended and you'l please to give me an answer to this offer. I have just received a letter from Mr. J Brown dated the 15th Inst. desiring me to return Messrs. Hewes & Smiths letter to the Committee, this I did by Monsr. Francy. He also says you wish for an extract of their letter to me on   the subject of the Pattys Cargo of Salt & it shall be enclosed herein. I cannot help remarking that Colo Aylett seems fond of raising his own reputation at the expense of other people, he made last Summer several attacks on Colo. Braxton by insinuation as he does now on Mr. Hewes & I believe both these Gentlemen to be Men of as much honor & honesty as Colo. Aylett or any others upon Earth.(2) I believe at the same time that Colo. Aylett is an active Commissary but he seems too full of Suspicions & too free in writing them and Congress should guard against giving in too readily to the belief of such things, or they will not get any Men who value their Characters to serve them. On the 13th November last I wrote Messrs. Hewes & Smith (3) if any Salt arrived there belonging to the Public not to Sell, but Store it untill they should receive the Committees order as it would all be wanted for the use of the Army &ca. They acknowledge the receipt of this letter in theirs to me of the 11th December from which the enclosed extract is taken by which you'l find they had sold the Pattys Salt previous to the Receipt of my orders & that Colo. Aylett himself was in some measure the cause of it.  Soon after the Patty arrived in North Carolina with her Salt on Public Account, a Snow Nancy, Capt. Forster, belonging to Mr. Ross & myself arrived there also with a Cargo of Salt on our Account & Messrs. Hewes & Smith with equal precipitation & without orders proceeded to make Sale of it for which they justify themselves in the Same manner as they do for the Sale of the public Salt, however this Cargo arriving latter then the Pattys they had not sold the whole of it when my orders respecting it reached them. Soon as I heard of this Snows arrival in No. Carolina I offered the Cargo of Salt to Mr. Buchanan (not respecting Messrs. Hewes & Co. would make any sale untill they heard from me) and he told me Mr. Aylett being Deputy Commissary of purchases in that Department he would buy it, but Mr. Aylett being distant from me & the price of salt low in No. Carolina Compared to what it was here I determined not to lay mine & my Friends property at his mercy.  Therefore I wrote to Messrs. Hewes & Smith (4) proposing that they should measure the Snow Nancys Cargo of Salt, value it at the then Current price & then make a large purchase of Green Pork on the best terms in their power, Cure & Barrell it, ready for Sale to those that should want, and the concern in this Pork to be in thirds, one of which their Accot., 1/3d Mr. Ross & 1/3d mine. By this mode Mr. Ross & myself gave up one third of our Salt at a low price for the Sake of being 2/3 as interested in the Pork, this proposal reaching Mr. Hewes & Smith before all the Nancys Cargo of Salt was sold but long after the Pattys was gone, they adopted the plan & executed it as far as the remains of the Nancys Cargo enabled. I have mentioned this matter in order to clear Mr. Hewes of any unworthy Suspicion being con-  fident he does not deserve them and I hope Congress will never countenance them by gratifying Colo. Aylett with orders to make the enquiry he offers. What I have mentioned about the Nancys Cargo of Salt & the Pork scheme may probably be remembred by Mr. Brown, by Mr. Gerry, Mr. Peters & some others in York as I told them last Winter the orders I had given and added that I expected the Pork to be put up in consequence would some day or other prove a seasonable supply to the Public. The Price of £18. per Barrell is very high but I should have made more of the Salt if it had not been so applyed for I Sold another Cargo that arrived since for £7 this Curry per bushl. and the purchaser is gone down from Pennsylvania to receive it there & bring it up at his own risque & expense, whereas the Nancys Cargo Sold at 60/ to 70/ that Curry per bushel & the Green Pork Cost 100/ to 120/ per 100 lb besides Barrells, Salt, Cooperage &ca &ca and you well know that all kinds of charges are raised to a most enormous pitch, Mr. Hewes also writes me that if Mr. Aylett had not wanted that Pork for the Public Service he could & would have had above £20 Virga. Curry for every Barrel of it.  Mr. Brown says you have wished I would recommend Mr. Ross for one of the Commercial agents in Europe.(5) I have told you Gentlemen his deserving Character but I am too sick of recommending agents ever to do it again, he says also that Colo. Harrisons plan is approved except the Commissions of one per Cent on return Cargoes in which I agree with you & think if instead of one per Cent he were allowed one quarter per Cent on a certain sum on every Cargo that returns to him for his care & trouble herewith it might do very well.  I think there is no points mentioned in any of your or Mr. Browns Letters that this and my preceeding Letters has not answered.  Last Night I recd. a letter from Mr. Willm. Wilkinson of Wilmington of which I take the Liberty to inclose you a Copy and if you were not previously informed the arrival of those Stores you will now give the necessary order respecting them or rather let the Marine Committee do it as these articles are more properly in their department. With much Respect & Esteem, I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedt. humble Servant. Robt. Morris  P.S. I am this moment informed by a Gentleman that saw a person lately from the City of Philadelphia that the report of a Riot in London is well founded as he heard Bill the Bookseller read an Account of it in an English paper. He says General Howe offers (in hand Bills) free passages in the Transports to any persons or Families that desire to remove to England.  ""

  Sir, York Town Feby. 17th. 1778 My Colleague Mr. James Smith obtained a warrant for 300,000 Dollars to be remitted to you for the purchase of Provisions, reserving as he informs me 52,000 which he has put into the hands of the Commissioners for this County and Cumberland. The low state of the Treasury has occasioned since a devision of the 300,000 Drs., one half to the Board of War & Ordinance, and the other half for this State, both being for the same purposes, the Bal[anc]e of your moiety vizt. 98,000 will I expect be ready this day, to go under the care of someone of the members of Assembly who may be passing through. As Mr. Smith undertook this business in my absence, being at the Treasury, when the Grant obtained, I shall leave the whole to his management.(1) I shall urge forward the supplies of Cash as you shall from time to time advise to be necessary, and I beseach Council not to put too much confidence in any Servant under them, lest some wheel in the machine should rust or clog to the injury of the cause which now labours in the Article of Provisions. The exuberant care of the late board of war in providing Superintendants over the Commissioners in the respective Counties, and the delegacy of their choice, has occasioned a good deal of perplexity. Last evening a modest request came before Congress to indemnify the Superintendants in violation of the provision act, in having given more than the stipulated prices, this is refered with the depositions concerning Mr. Hooper to a Committee.(2) You will see by the resolve of last Saturday that a new System has been contrived to accommodate the appointment of Superintendants to the late law of the State and to prevent any interference.(3) Mr Smith informs me he will transmit the System which prevents me. I beg Council will urge the respective Commissioners to the purchase of live Stock; as to flour, I have no fear of a plentiful supply, but through the lack of meat provisions our army is even now greatly distressed, and without the most vigorous exertions I fear the consiquence. If any thing prevents our Capital being speedyly regained it will be the want of provisions. Virginia is ready to supply 5000 Volunteers and No. Carolina as many with their Governor to march at their head besides their Quota of Continental Troops, but FEBRUARY 17, 1778  they cannot be called for without provisions, therefore let me beseech Council to strain every nerve of exertion and make timely applycation to Congress for Cash from time to Time. Next to the want of provisions there is no one thing so distressing to our publick affairs as the want of the aid of Mr. Rittenhouse, on whom the Treasury has depended for a little work in his way, to help forward a speedy emission which is always most necessary at this season, but especially so on account of the enormous prices of every article of supply to the army. I have urged his comming forward again & again hitherto in vain, therefore I beg the interposition of Council and that that Gentleman will be entreated not to delay his coming here, a moment longer. With respectful Salutations to Council I am, Sir, Yr. most obt. huml. Serv. Daniel Roberdeau  ""

  My Dear, York Town 18 Febry. 1778 I arrived here the 15 Well after having been detained about Two Days by the Susqhennah. I performed the Journey with much less faticuge than I expected and my Horse held out bravely, and has suffered Nothing. I am Now with Mr. Huntington at a publick House well and in comfortable Circumstances. We hope soon to get into private Lodgings, but We do not know where and find that they are Not to be had but with the greatest Dificulty and Expense. The latter is so great that I understand that a single Man exclusive of Hors keeping cannot probably live under at least ten pounds per Week. Every thing here bears an enormous price. The Town is much more pleasant than Baltimore but publick and private Virtue I suppose is much the same here as there.  We have no European News. An Exchange of Prisoners between Washington & Howe is agreed upon. Govr. Clinton is impowerd to secure the North River which has been totally neglected.(1) Genl. Putnam will douptless be soon ordered to join the Main Army and Genl. McDougall will probably Command on that Station.(2) An Order has gone to the States requesting them to fill up their Battalions-Measures taken to support a large Force in the spring, but FEBRUARY 18, 1778  to get Provisions of the Meat kind is difficult.

  Feby 19. 1778 I have this day seen a letter from Genl. Gates as president of the board of war directing general Mifflin to inform the commissioners appointed by the board to superintend the purchasing provisions &c that Congress had determined that the measures pursued by the State of Pensylvania were adequate to the supply of the army on the east side of Susquehannah and had therefore directed that they no longer pro- FEBRUARY 19, 1778  ceed on that business, but lay all their accounts &c before Congress.(1) Just when the resolution came to hand a considerable supply of provisions & forage was forwarding to head quarters by the persons appointed by the board of war & a great number of teams impressed for this purpose. The order of Congress has put a stop to the whole, so that all prospect of keeping the army together is now at an end and you may expect every moment to hear of its dissolution. The former letter I sent you from Genl. Washington painted to you their critical situation.(2) Since that time about 1000 barrels of flour have been sent down by water from this place by Col Bird. But the river is now fallen & there is no probability of procuring an adequate number of teams in time agreeable to the laws of this state.  This you may declare to Congress as a fact that warrants have been out agreeable to the laws of Pensylvania for a month past for procuring teams for the use of the army & that none have as yet been procured in that way. The consequence of which is that all the horses in the army are now famished for forage and a mutiny has already arisen for want of a timely supply of provisions. It will be more than we have a right to expect, when the army disbands, which I think in a few days it must, if a great part dont join the enemy. A few nights ago thirteen of the Artillery (the best corps in the service) twelve of whom were sergeants deserted in a body to the enemy. This you may rely on as fact.  ""

  My dear Sir, Yk l9th Feb. [1778] I have only time to give you the Anatomy of French Politics as they stood Sepr. 10th 77.(1) America undertook war of her own motion upon great provocations given by England and without consulting France, though doubtless depending in a degree upon the political Interests of that Nation. Complaints therefore against her while she pursues what she judges to be that Interest are unjust. She did not FEBRUARY 19, 1778  foment your Divisions nor was she consulted upon their probable consequences. Will you force her to take an open part? Is it not her wisest line to aid you secretly. In which case Britain must either see & not see or else must begin hostilities against France. In the former Case you will have every necessary article to enable you to support your rising Independence. In the latter France will be justified by all her Neighbours in vigorously repelling all attacks of the English. At present, should his Christian Majesty declare War, he must endure the Charges of boundless Ambition in taking an unprovoked Opportunity to assault Britain during the Moment of her greatest Embarrassments. The Threat of your Reunion with Britain unless France openly unites herself with America is impolitic as the bare possibility of such a Reunion should make France cautious of any hazardous step Shall it be said \""join us, & we will never reunite?\"" Will it not be answered \""prove that you will never reunite & I will openly assist you\"". Convince the World that no Extremity is capable of making you renounce that Independence which you have not seditiously & tumultuously declared but calmly & methodically adopted.  And now Dr Sir you and I will not quarrel with such Politics as these, if, instead of leaving us to depend only on the natural Greediness for gain which is the commercial Punctum Vita Monsieur Louis will lend us the sine qua non to provide Bait for carrying on that Shark Fishery.  Shall you be able to defend yourselves against Burgoyne and at the same time draught without giving bounty to fill up the continental Quota with 12 months or 9 months men very early this Spring? No other remedy is left I think for all our Evils.  It is said as the Term of the German Auxilaries is expired they refuse any Obedience to Howe. Perhaps this has brought on the general Exchange, as England must pay for all that are lost.  Adieu, be happy. JL  ""

  Dear Harvie, Moore Hall 19th Feby. 1778. I write to you at the Request of my Brethren. You have forgotten two or three material things which you ought to have taken with you.(1) In the first Place the Memorandums extracted from the Papers sent to Genl. Washington from Reading.(2) They are as follows. 1. Congress have directed 30,000 Blls. and the Board of War 20000 more. 21y. 21/2 Per Cent is allowed to the Superintendants of Purchases & 2 1/2 to the Purchasers. 31y. 7 Clerks & 7 Storekeepers at 7 different Magazines; on this Note that only 5 are charged in our Estimate owing to Negligence in making the Calculations. 4thly. Each Superintendent to have an Office and a Clerk with as many Assistants as he chuses to employ, the wages of which are discretionary. 5thly. The Purchasers of Grain & Flesh to be seperate. 6thly. a House and Clerk to be kept at Allen Town. 7thly. The Price of Wheat to be limited at 12/ and eight Bushels to be processed for one Bushel of Flour. 8thly. Waggons to be employed at Discretion. 9thly. Millers to be allowed £4 per 100 Bushels for grinding &ca. and 4d per Barrill for putting on a Lining Hoop. 10thly. 2 Millers, 3 Coopers & 2 Woodsmen to be inlisted for a Year for each Mill & exempt from Military Service. llthly. Millers to Employ Teams to haul Timber for Staves & Hoop Poles at Discretion & Sheds or Stores to be built at their Mills if necessary. 12thly. Coopers to be allowed 18d. per Barril for making, It owed to Coopers, Wages of Woodsmen not settled & Millers allowed for boarding them 15/ per Week. 13thly. It is observed that the Prices fixed by the Assembly for Oats, Spelts, & Corn are not sufficient (Remark that these People complained not long ago & the Truth is that the Assembly fixed the Prices higher than they were before) the Deputies of the Superintendants, Millers &ca are desired to purchase grain for Forage and draw on the Superintendants (not Quarter Master whose salary is fixed) and to allow for Rye 12/ Spelts & Oats 7/6 & Corn 9/. 14thly. The Millers are to be allowed 8d per Bushel for the Oats they may purchase and are to grind the other Grain as before. Lastly it is to be observed that they acknowlege Meat is not to be purchased.  You neglected also some Articles which we computed to be purchased in different Parts. I run them over to you as follows: first 18,000 Barrils of Fish which will require 20,000 Bushels of Lisbon or Bay Salt to be laid up in the State of Virginia as many of them as possible Shad and the Quantity to be governed by the Quantity of this Salt which can be procured. 2d. 20,000 Barrils of Pork in the Southern States requiring 10,000 Bushels of common Salt & 5 Tons of Salt Peter the Salt to be merely Dissolved in Water and the Salt Peter mixed with it and poured cold on the Pork packed close. The FEBRUARY 19, 1778  Pork should be cut into Pieces of 4 lb each and 60 such Pieces put into each Barrill. This will save greatly in dealing it out and prevent Roguery The like should be observed with respect to all Provisions put up and that will prevent the Necessity & Expence of Inspectors &ca. 3dly. 7,000 B of Pork should also if possible be bought in the Eastern States. 4thly. All the Prize Cargoes of Salted Provisions should be carefully purchased for the public Use, also a great Quantity of Cod Fish. 5thly. 40,000 Busllels of Pease should be immediately contracted for in the middle or southern states for the Consumption of the ensuing fall and Winter, also 30000 Bushels of Pease in the County of Tryon in the State of New York for the Use of the Summer 1779 and Onions on the Banks of Connecticut River in the Township of Wethersfield particularly. 6thly. 10,000 Beef Cattle to be bought up in Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina and forwarded from Time to Time untill the first of September & 7000 in like Manner in the Eastern States.  I enclose you also a Calculation I made this Morning on what the Flour ought to cost and compared it with what it will cost if these Gentlemen go on. Adieu. I wish you Health and Pleasure.

Your Govr. is invested with all the powers that General Gates had, for securing the passes on the No. River, and is requested by Congress, to take effectual means to have that Important service done as soon as possible.(2) General Putnam will be removed from the Command he now holds. Will not General Parsons do under General Clinton for some time.

This I believe has induced Genl Howe to agree to a general exchange, officers for officers, soldiers for soldiers & citizen for citizen, so that our poor fellows will soon be released from their Captivity.(4) We are endeavouring to relieve the wants of our Soldiers. I am persuaded nothing will be omitted that can be done by Congress.  Do prevail on Mr. Duane to return to Congress as soon as he can, indeed his presence is absolutely necessary.

Almost every Day produces some Instances of the pernicious Effects of an Influence which I described in a former Letter & the one I am now going to mention is perhaps as extraordinary as ever happened. Under the Idea of purchasing 50,000 Bbbls of Flour a System of Power & Extravagance is formed which will surprize you. It at one Stroke demolishes the Militia Law, Waggon Law, regulating Law & Provision Law, erects an arbitrary Power over the Property of the People to be exercised by a Sett of Gentlemen in avowed Opposition to the Authority of the State. The enormous Profits or if I may so express myself the Jobbing Part of it Col Harvey will explain to you. We have made a Calculation on the System here which that Gentleman will shew you. It is founded on their own Plan of Instructions ramified into a Number of Particulars & appears to be formed as a Provision for Dependents, establish an Influence subversive of the Government & fix a Precedent for future Peculation.  Col. Cox has been sent for but is not yet come to Camp. Perhaps my long Acquaintance & Connection with him may mislead my Judgment but I profess I do not know a Man whose Versatility of Genius, Activity, Readiness at Expedients & Acquaintance with the Country better qualifies him to fill the Qr. Master's Department. Green will not accept but on Condition Cox is joined with him & agrees to give up what is called the lucrative Part, this perhaps may have some Effect upon our Friend who has some profitable Schemes on the Anvil. Green only goes in it from public Motives; he is not an interested Character. He thinks he might be of some Use in the military Part of this Office but disclaims what may be called the civil Part.  I was very sensible that the Service on which you have appointed us is very difficult, but my dear sir, I have no Idea of declining or evading any Duty which this great Cause requires tho Life itself should be hazarded. This Principle strange as it may seem has I believe hurt my Preferment & injured my private Interests, but as I am not ambitious, nor interested beyond a certain Degree & that I hope limited to moderate Bounds I feel perhaps less Mortification than most Men & have the Happiness of believing that Time will discover my Enemies & those of the publick to be the same.  The Papers that will give you a perfect Insight into the Contract I have mentioned you will find at the Board of War & consist of Instructions from the Board of War, to the Superintendants-their Plan of conducting the Business as framed by Falconer, Mifflin & Hooper-their Instructions to the Millers, their Letter to the Board of War.(1) A Letter wrote by R.L.

  Sir, [February 20, 1778] (1)  We inclose you a Letter of Introduction to Govr. Johnson.(2) Upon the Subject of Fish we have to observe that from our Accounts of that Business your Informant must have deceived you as a Barrell will hold more than eighty probably more than one hundred Shad. The Quantity of Salt he hath not exagerated as it requires a great Deal and of imported Salt too for that which is made in this Country will not answer. The Fish ought to cost very little per hundred say three or four Dollars; for this they may probably be purchased especially in the River Potomack tho' that is out of your present rout. The Cost on the whole will be great but [the army] must not starve. We are Sir &ca.  ""

  Sir, Camp near the Valley Forge, Feb. 20th 1778. We are to acknowledge your Favour of the 7th Inst., received the 13th inclosing the Resolves of Congress on the Qr. Master Gens. Department. The Subject is very important, & we only wait for some farther Information when we shall do ourselves the Honour of laying FEBRUARY 20, 1778  our Sentiments before Congress on the material Alteration proposed in this Office.  We now, Sir, beg Leave to submit to your Consideration, a Proposition of employing a Number of Indians in the American Army.1 We have fully discussed it with the General, & upon the maturest Deliberation are induced to recommend it to Congress. We are of Opinion no Measure can be adopted so effectual to break off the pernicious Intercourse which the disaffected Inhabitants of this Country still hold with the Enemy, from which they derive the greatest Advantages. Exclusive of the wholesome Supplies of Provisions by which they refresh their numerous Sick, & check the Advances of the Scurvy, it is the most sure & certain Source of Intelligence. Thro' this Channel they are constantly apprized not only of every material Transaction of our Army, but of the Quarters of our Troops & Situation of such active Whigs as are either occasionally passing, or yet reside within the Reach of their Excursions. Hence almost every Day furnishes an Instance of some Surprize & Capture. From repeated Successes they grow confident & venture in small Parties a considerable Distance, carrying off with them such straggling Officers, Soldiers, & incautious Whigs as they find in their Route. Their Progress in this Business is the more alarming as they are now joined by a Number of Tories perfectly acquainted with the Country, well mounted & equipp'd, who not only serve as Guides to the British Horse, but venture upon separate Expeditions The Terror of these Excursions is so great, that it will, unless seasonably check'd, endanger the Communication of the Army with its Supplies & absolutely deprive us of all Assistance from our Friends in the lower Parts of the three Counties of Bucks, Chester, & Philada.2 We can foresee but two Objections to employing the Indians on the Flanks & Advance of the Army. The Danger of indiscriminate Injury to the well & ill affected, & Prevention of Desertion from the Enemy. But his Excelly. is of Opinion both may be obviated by proper Precautions, or at least so far guarded as to justify the Expediency of the Measure, & render the Experiment less hazardous than it may appear at first View.  But we do not, Sir, confine our Ideas to the present Moment, we think the restless Spirits of the Savages will not allow them to remain inactive If we do not find Subjects to employ them on, we fear our Enemies will, & we have only to chuse whether these shall be British Troops or the Inhabitants of our defenceless Frontiers. As it is in Contemplation to form a Flying Army composed of light Infantry & rifle Men under the Direction of Officers distinguished for their Activity & Spirit of Enterprize, it is proposed to mix about 400 Indians with them; being thus incorporated with our own Troops, who are designed to skirmish, act in Detachments & light Parties, as well as lead the Attack, we hope their Irregularities will be restrained & any   Excesses prevented. We fear a greater Number would rather injure than promote the Service, as they claim Access at all Times & on all Occasions to the Commander in Chief & expect Cloathing & Douceurs which we fear our scanty Supplies will not afford but in very moderate Quantities. The Number therefore we propose we flatter ourselves may be easily procured, their good Humour preserved & sufficiently answer the Purposes we have in View.  Nor do we think ourselves less warranted to say that there is great Reason to believe the Novelty of their Appearance in the Field, the Circumstances of Horror & Affright which attend their Attack, will have a great Effect upon the Minds of Men wholly unacquainted with such an Enemy. Upon the foreign Troops we doubt not it would operate in a high Degree, & when we consider upon what trivial Circumstances the Fate of Battles often turns, & the constant Attention shewn by the nice Observers of the human Heart in the military Line to every Thing which can discompose & terrify it, we trust we shall not be thought visionary or chimerical.  Upon the whole, Sir, by the Request & Desire of the General we beg Leave to recommend it as a Measure of Policy & Utility worthy the Attention of Congress. If it should meet your Approbation, Col. Gist a Gentleman of much Acquaintance & Experience with the Southern Indians will most chearfully receive your Commands & is recommended to us by General Washington as a Man of approved Spirit & Conduct, in whom the greatest Confidence may be safely reposed.  The Situation of the Oneidas to the Northward is such, that perhaps it will be found our truest Interest to take them into Service, even if little is expected from them. They are threatned by the surrounding Tribes & declare that unless we can protect them, they must however reluctantly take up the Hatchet against us or be intirely cut off. We cannot protect them unless we take the Nation into our Country, which may be done by setling their Wives & Children for the present in the State of New York, as the Commissioners may think proper, and bringing their Warriours to the Army, for whose Fidelity & Perseverance we shall then have the best Pledges, without the Odium of demanding them.  We are, with the greatest Respect & Regard, Sir, Your most Obedt. & very Hbble servts. F. Dana by order  P.S. Having communicated this Letter to his Excelly. he wishes to add that no Time is to be lost in coming to a Resolution & dispatching Col. Gist, as the Distance is very great & the previous Ceremonies & Preparations will take up some Time-And that Col. Gist being now detached with a Party of ficticious Indians upon the Lines cannot  attend Camp so soon as was intended, but will set out in a very few Days if the Plan is approved.  ""

Your description of the miseries of the Army affected me beyond common feeling, altho' I thought myself prepared by having perused it at home, I could not go through the reading your Letter in Congress. Deep sympathy for the poor Suffering Soldiers blended with as deep indignation against the infamous delinquents who have been the authors of their distress, forbid utterance.  You say you will learn Characters, I think Sir, from the slight acquaintance I have had the honour of making with you, You have too much fortitude & integrity, either to be flattered or frighted by any Character & that when you have fully investigated, you will tell your Country in the presence of their Representatives where originated the Evils complained of.

Soon after that Messenger departed, Congress confirmed the Inclosed Act of the 19th for seperating & placing the Troops included in the Convention of Saratoga in such manner within the State of Massachuset as shall be most convenient for their subsistence & security.(2)  The Inclosed piece of Paper which I writ in Congress this Evening & slipped into the hand of a Member of the Treasury Board will shew you Sir that I have not been unmindful of your Calls for Money.

We acknowledge the Receipt of your favours of the 7th, 8th, 12th and 17th instant.(1) In answer to that of the 7th respecting our misterious Commerce we laid it before Congress together with Monsr. Hortalezs Letters (one of which was a highly finished Political performance) who have added two members to the Commercial Committee to take the same into consideration.(2) They will enter upon the business this afternoon, and when Congress Shall have determined upon this important matter, we will give you the Result.  In answer to that of the 7th respecting the New Brigantine at Baltimore &c we have some Time Since ordered her to be loaded with  FEBRUARY 21, 1778  Tobacco for France. She is to go as a Packet to be armed and Commanded by Captain Read.(3) We have ordered the Two Vessels which last arrived at North Carolina from Hispaniola to be loaded with Tobacco and Consigned to Mr. Carrabasse. The Brigantine Success, Captain Harris, now at Edenton, was ordered before her Sailing from Boston to proceed from Carolina to Bilbao to the address of Messr. Gardoqui & Sons. Congress have ordered General Hand to send Provisions to the Arkansaws.(4) In Answer to the 8th would observe that we think Mr Duer would have been very illy employed in telling you any thing that might have passed in Congress in which you were concerned; especially we think him highly culpable in representing to you that the Commercial Committee had complained to Congress that their not having the Books in their possession was a grievance to them; because it was a gross misrepresentation Messrs. Forbes & Ellery who were the only members of the Commercial Committee then present, laid before Congress General Hands Letter &c respecting the Rattle Trap. Some of the Members were dissatisfied with that undertaking and asked a Multitude of questions about it. The Instructions given to Captain Willing were read; but still they wanted more light, when accidentally it was mentioned that the Books and Papers of the Secret Committee were in your hands. This occasioned a Conversation about them, which, if we could, we should think it not worth our while to relate. Let it suffice that so far from complaining against you on account of the Books, the Members of the Committee were for your retaining them 'till they should be settled.(5)  We laid this Letter before Congress who desired us to inform you that they would have you still keep the Books in your possession and settle them as soon as you could.  We have asked your advice frequently and freely, and have as often and as freely received it and shall continue to trouble you while we remain of the Commercial Committee (which we hope for reasons we have already mentioned to you will not be long) (6) whenever we find ourselves embarrassed.  In answer to yours of the 12th we leave the disposition of the Indies intirely to you.  Yours of the 17th is now before Congress and will be answered in due Time.

We depend on your Care & accustomed Zeal to have this Business done to the best Advantage. The Vessels that carry the Tobo. are all chartered except the Brig Morris, Capt Gunneson, which belongs to the United States; you must therefore supply the Captain what may be necessary for the Ships Disbursements and also with a Cargo of Salt with which you will order him back to any safe Port he can make in these States consigning the same to our Order & transmitting us a Bill of lading FEBRUARY 21, 1778  for the Salt and his Receipt for Amot. of Supplies to the Vessel.

In conformity to your request, I wrote to York town concerning any letters for you, & directed them to be sent down. Tomorrow, I expect, I shall go over myself.  It gave me real pleasure to find your sentiments on some important subjects so perfectly coincide with my own. In many instances I have dreaded the effects of measures, tho' at the same time a principle of charity, & a confidence in the zealous attachment of those who favored them, almost forbid any suspicions of undue motives. The Generals conduct on occasions truely affecting to a man honor, evinces how much more infintely he prefers the good of his country to any personal considerations. If in any instance Congress has seemed to favor an FEBRUARY 21, 1778  adverse party, it ought not to be resolved into a design of injuring him; a concurrence of untoward circumstances have impelled to these steps which appear most exceptionable, & the tendency of which I foresaw & dreaded. If an individual or two are unhappily under the influence of an undue impression, the effects, it is to be hoped, will be very circumscribed, & the evil will carry in itself its own remedy. At the same time, something should be done to prevent the body of the people, especially of this state, losing their confidence in the Commander in Cheif. Rectifying the conduct of the different departments & putting an end to the impositions, & irregularties of some of the agents, would do much towards accomplishing this important end. If it were possible to avoid seizures & acts of force except in particular cases many disaffected persons, more of the indetermined, & all real whigs would be with us.

You have much to do, & however anxiously I wish to have your aid & counsil in Congress, yet I cannot wish you from your present post 'till the important business shall be well done.

Indeed I ought to write two or three for one because in the first Place one of your Letters is intrisically worth more than mine and would be so valued even by a Bookseller. In the next Place I can only satisfy the idle Curiosity which may arise in the Breast of a Man of Leizure about what is going forward in a foolish World which he says he wishes to retire from. You can inform me of what I love and value most in the World for you can satisfy those Yearnings about the natale Solum which forbid us to be immemorous of it, you can give me a Map of that political Spot which hapless Wanderer as I am I must travel through, above all (excuse a Republican for laying so great a Stress here) you can send me Tidings of the Friends I love and value more than the world. Pray remember me to them all of every Sex, Age and Complection. While I write a Dispute is going on at my Elbow about Taxation which like every other political Subject Every one is as you know a perfect Master of. The Contest is whether Bonds should be taxed. A Gentleman from Massachusetts contends that they should, One from Jersey that they should not. Both may be right. I, as you know, hate disputes but I love the State I was born in and as I am confident this Measure will be followed among our neighbours from a mistaken Policy of the landed Men and possibly from some Propriety in it under our present Circumstances which indeed I cannot see It is my wish to Advantage aliena insania. Let me intreat that nothing of this kind may take Place among us. Thank God our Government is such that the true Interests of the State can be pursued. I have no Money, all the little Property I have is in Land, I therefore speak freely, per- FEBRUARY 22, 1778  haps my Sentiments may from that Circumstance have Weight with those who suppose me interested (with what Propriety or on what Grounds I know not) and who will acknowledge that I have not always judged wrong. If the several States N York excepted tax Money N York will be inhabited by all the monied Men on the Continent & consequently raise a Revenue from all the Rest which indeed greater political Abilities as well as greater Sufferings in the common Cause intitle them to. Besides this such immense personal Property in the Country will add vastly to the Value of Lands and of the Produce of Lands. At the same Time it will give such a Spring to Commerce as will necessarily render our Merchants Carriers to the other States (and our Farmer's Sons may be Merchants if they will) thereby adding a further Increase to the Property of the State. By these Means shall we become the Bankers of America and consequently regulate Exchange in our own Favor. To all which I add that of Necessity immense Stores of Merchandize will flow in to make the great Ballance of Trade which as you know cannot be all in Money and indeed ought not. These carried up Hudsons River will form vast Magazines in the Heart of America: the true source of Victory. Hence shall we derive a splendor to our arms (which our Neighbours will oblige us to brighten or I am much mistaken) and a controuling Influence in the Councils of America. Great Things depend on small more than small Men think for. And however little Wits may laugh let us not forget that this is the Seed time of Glory as of Freedom. Adieu again I say remember me to my Friends particularly Jay. Remember me very particularly to Mrs Livingston. When you see your Mother and Sisters assure them of my faithful Remembrance.  I am Dear Robert, yours sincerely, Gouvr Morris ""

  Gentlemen Feby 23d. 1778 The French Ship Flamand now in Portsmouth New Hampshire is directed by the Committee of Commerce to proceed forthwith to Charles Town in South Carolina there to be laden'd with Rice &c for France. This Ship mounts 18 Six pounders and is navigated with 70 Seamen and fast sailes. The Committees intention is to give this Ship a Commission in expectation of picking some Prizes on the passage to Charles Town, and for that purpose you are requested to send out of your department a Captain and two Lieutenants in the Continental Service who have not at present an Actual command together with Eight or ten Seamen in order to conduct any prizes that may be taken into Port. In navigating the Ship as a Merchant Ship the French Captain is to have the command, but in giving chase or in an engagement the Continental Captain and his officers are to have the sole direction. The Captain & Officers apptd. to this service should be persons who have some knowledge of the Carolina Coast. They are upon their Arrival at Charles Town to return as soon as may be to their former station in your department. Should they be so fortunate as to take Prizes on the Passage, One half will be set apart for the Continent. The Continental Captain and his Officers will draw one eight and the French Captain and his Officers and Crew will be intitled to the other 333/8ths. If you should or should not be able to procure a suitable Captain, officers and seamen, you will give seasonable notice thereof to the Continental Agent at Portsmouth that the ship may not be unnecessarily delayed.(1)  We have given Orders to our Agent in Maryland to purchase 2000 Barrels flour and 30 Tons bar Iron and to have the same transported to the Inlet of Senepuxent on the Sea Coast in Maryland about 50 Miles to the southward of the Capes of Delaware.(2)  You will immediately on receipt hereof dispatch the Continental Schooner at Bedford, and charter as many small fast sailing Vessels and dispatch them for that Port as you shall think will be sufficient to carry the above quantity of Flour to such Ports or places in the  FEBRUARY 24, 1778  Eastern States as you shall think proper to direct. Our Agent William Smith Esqr. will give the necessary orders for having the Vessels loaded immediately on their arrival. You will endeavour to get Masters for those Vessels who are acquainted with the Coast and Inlet above mentioned and if you cannot Charter Vessels without Insureing them we empower you so to do having them properly valued.

And I mean to afford you the further satisfaction of assuring you the Resolves of Congress which you intimate have affected an individual, Mr. Jackson, were certainly not intended to apply to him or personally to any other Gentleman & that they were grounded upon general information of the exhorbitant demands which had been made for such Merchandize as you had attempted to purchase for the use of the Army.(2)  The Letters which you wrote on that occasion to Congress are at present in the Secretary's Office & at this time of Night not accessible, therefore I cannot possitively say, the name of Jackson is not mentioned in them, but my memory which in such Cases is not deficient, assures me it is not, & you may, if it be needful, Safely aver to that Gentleman that neither his name nor conduct were animadverted in FEBRUARY 24, 1778  Congress, this would probably have happened, had your Letter exhibited either or both in an unfavourable light.

  Dear Sir Moore Hall Feb. 24. 1778 It gives me much Concern that our Business proceeds slower than Congress seem to expect. I trusted that our private Communications would at least have softened the Violence of Expectation. We attribute most of the Peculation, Waste, & Derangement of our Affairs to an injudicious Choice of Officers. With these Sentiments you must not be surprized to find us cautious & slow, especially in a Department of so much Confidence & Power as that of a Qr. Master General. When we see Confusion & Disorder reigning thro the whole Army by the Defects of this Office & unaccounted Millions, we think we cannot be too cautious & esteem it Time well spent to look out the most worthy Characters, & draw them into the publick Service. I hinted to you that we had a Design on Col. Cox. We sent for him & he is now with us. But you know he is a Man of too much Sagacity to engage without due Consideration of all Circumstances. He is employed in very extensive Concerns both of Iron & Salt for which he has made great Preparations the Benefit of which he must lose & alter his whole Arrangements. You will not wonder therefore if he takes Time & I FEBRUARY 24, 1778  believe you will agree that if he can be brought in we shall have a Prospect of bringing Order out of this Confusion. I presume you understand from what I mentioned before than Gen. Green is to be at the Head of the Department, Col. Cox to stand second, & they are to have the Appointment of their Subs. Be not misled, my good Friend, with Utopian Ideas of dividing Departments & Offices which the Practice & Experience of all Nations shew us ought to be united. Wander as far as we will from established Rules & Systems we shall find sooner or later we must return. A Dislike & even Rage against every Thing English has precipitated us into a Labyrinth of Error & Expence from which the wisest Heads will find it difficult to extricate us. We are resolved not to be Parties in plunging you deeper; if we cannot raise the publick above Water we shall at least let you feel your own Way. Characters fit for the Department are not to be found in the Army; if they were your Affairs would not be in the wretched Condition they now are. If we have the World to chuse out of; Congress can select better than we can; their Knowledge is more extensive & should they err they will not have the same kind of Responsibility. I know you cry out precious Time is wasting, it is so but great Haste is not often the best Speed. Experience must tell you how easy it is to put a Man in Office & how difficult to get him out. There has been to use an odd Expression a Cullibility (1) in Congress that has surprized me. How many rash Appointments have been made which we all lament & the Consequences of which we feel thro the whole System.  You will therefore my good Sir, oblige us if you will in a Way of which you are very capable vindicate us from the Imputation of causeless Delay.  I am anxious to hear whether you have received a long Letter I wrote you about 10 Days ago.

  Sir Camp near Valley Forge, Feby. 25. 1778 Agreeable to the Promise made in our Letter of yesterday, we FEBRUARY 25, 1778  have in Concert with the General, compleated the Arrangement of the Quarter Master Generals Department; which now only waits for the Fiat of Congress. By your Resolutions of the 5th Inst.(1) we find that it is the Intention of Congress, to divide the Quarter Master's Department into four capital Branches. The Quarter Master properly so called: The Commissary of Forage; the Commissary of Horses &c, and the Agent of Purchases. Permit us, Sir, to represent that so many independent Officers without a controuling Chief, must necessarily involve Interference with each other, infinite Confusion, & a Variety of Controversies, which must be terminated by the Commander in Chief, or in other Words, that the General must be, what he has been during the last Campaign, the Quarter Master General of the Army. Besides this, we have to observe farther, that each of these Officers must necessarily be empowered to draw publick Money, & of Consequence, that the Chance of Frauds, & Amount of Expenditures will be greatly increased by so many separate Departments. Add to this, that when any Abuses, & more particularly when any Deficiencies shall be felt, it will be easy for these Gentlemen to shift the Blame from one to the other, rendering it impracticable to detect either Ignorance, Indolence, or Inequity. Many additional Reasons might be adduced to shew (2) 'how dangerous such an Experiment may prove; but the Wisdom of Congress will doubtless supply them, & upon reconsidering this Business in all its Connections, & Dependencies see a Propriety in placing this very executive Department, under one controuling superintending Power, whose Activity, & Influence may regulate, pervade & animate the whole System.  Let us now, Sir, cast our Glance upon the Administration of Affairs heretofore. We mean not to censure or commend, but it is our Duty to inform. We hesitate not to say, that the Abuses which have crept in are such, that no Finances can support a System like the present. Men without Morals, without Character, & without Property have been, & are intrusted with the Disposal of publick Money, & private Property. The Number of little, piddling, pilfering Plunderers in the Character of Deputies, & Deputies Assistants is sufficient almost to form an Army, & does form a kind of Army, not indeed to act against the Enemies, but against the Friends of America; to sour the Minds of the People, & exhaust the Resources of the Country. And not only is the Expence almost infinite; the Neglect is as great perhaps as fatal. This may appear to be the Language of Exaggeration, but whatever Ideas arise from a View of the general Complexion, they fall much short when we examine some particular Features. We are told, Sir, that in some capital Purchases, the enormous Commission of 5 per Cent hath been allowed: We know that the publick pay 21/2 per Cent upon every Ounce of Forage consumed by this Army. We fear that publick Teams have been employed at the publick  Expense, to transport private Property from distant States, while publick Property has there lain neglected, & our Troops been left to suffer for Want of the usual Camp Transportation. We are also obliged to add that at this Moment, not a Horse, Waggon, Tent, or intrenching Tool, as we are informed, is purchased for the next Campaign, & every Gentleman who rides thro' the Country will see it strewed with publick Stores perishing from Neglect. Such being the melancholy Situation to which we have been reduced, it hath become indispensably necessary to call forth Characters, of known & approved Abilities, to introduce a thorough Reform, & make the necessary Provision for the ensuing Campaign. Genl. Schuyler appeared to your Committee best adapted to these Purposes, but (3) least he should not be approved, we have cast our Eyes upon other Persons. It might well have been supposed that on this Occasion, we were not inattentive to the Merit, which it is said Baron Steuben possesses. If it were practicable to divide this Department without great Injury to the publick Cause, & if that Gentleman really possesses the necessary Qualifications; we cannot but think, there would be a manifest Impropriety in trusting a Foreigner for whose Attachment we have at best but a very slender Security, with a Power to accelerate, impede, or obstruct at his Pleasure every Movement of the Army, & to dispose of large Sums of Money, in such Manner & for such Purposes as he may think proper, (for large Sums he must have the Disposal of, tho' it be only to defray what is called petty Expences of an Army) such Expences amounting annually to a very considerable Expenditure under the Name of Contingencies. Young Men, Sir, fired with a Love of Glory, may indeed seek Honour at the Hazard of Life, in our American Wildernesses; but Men who make a Trade of War, are seldom animated by or act upon such enthusiastick Principles; neither can their Education, their Profession, or the Form of Government they have lived under, inspire such Veneration for the Rights of Mankind, as will lead to a Conduct purely disinterested. With Respect to these Gentlemen therefore, it must be evident, they are either sent hither for the particular Purposes of those by whom they are sent; or they come hither for particular Purposes of their own. If the former of them be the real Motive, it is unwise to trust them too far, because it is not possible allways to discover the sender; or even then what are his Intentions. If on the contrary, they come from the latter Motive, they come to make a Fortune, & they will make a Fortune at the Expence of their Employers; & having made it they will at an enormous Exchange send their Money to Europe, or at an enormous Price make Purchases of Land here, & in either Case go home, & wait with Indifference the Close of the Contest. Some Circumstances countenance an Opinion that Instances of this kind may be found.   We proceed now to state the Arrangement which we propose to make, premising that it is upon the Characters of Men principally, & not upon Paper Systems that our Success must depend. We propose Sir to have a Quarter Master General, & two Assistant Qr. Masters General appointed by Congress, & that these three be allowed for their Trouble & Expence one per Cent upon the Monies issued in the Department, to be divided as they shall agree & including an Addition to the Pay of the Waggon Master Gen. & his Deputy which is absolutely necessary. The Gentlemen we have in View are Genl. Green, Col. Cox, & Charles Pettit Esqr. the two former of whom have consented to take the Department on these Terms, & upon these only. The latter has not been consulted, but we have Reason to believe he may be prevailed upon to serve. The Arrangment among them is as follows: That General Greene as Qr Master General shall perform the military Duty, attend to all the Issues, & direct the Purchases. That Col. Cox (who we will venture to say is perhaps the best qualified for that Purpose of any other Man) shall make all Purchases, examine all Stores, & the like, which his Knowledge of the Country & of Business will enable him to do with Advantage to the publick. And that Mr. Pettit shall attend to the keeping of Accounts, & of Cash' which is not as heretofore to be instrusted to any Deputy. A perfect Harmony & good Understanding among these Gentlemen, will we apprehend render it unnecessary by any Resolutions to mark out the Bounds of their several Departments, which at best would be attended with no good effects, & in all human Probability would leave something to be done which it would be no Body's Business to do. Forage Masters, Waggon Masters &c must of Necessity be in the Appointment of the Qr. Mastr Genl. who is, or ought at least to be responsible for their Conduct as forming a Part of the general System. Great Abuses have already prevailed from the multiplying such Offices, of which we shall say no more at present, it being a Task at once tedious and disagreeable.(4)  We have had great Difficulty in prevailing with these Gentlemen to undertake the Business. They object the advanced Season, the Confusions of the Department, the Depreciation of our Money, & exhausted State of our Resources, as rendering it almost impracticable to do that essential Service which they conceive their Duty to require of them. Besides which, each has private Reasons of his own. Genl. Greene was very unwilling to enter into this large Field of Business, which tho it will not, & indeed ought not to exclude him from his Rank in the Line, will of Necessity prevent his doing the active Duty of a General Officer. Col. Cox whose private Business (5) is known to be very lucrative, was unwilling to quit it, & break off Engagements which he hath largely entered into for the manufactory of Salt & Iron, and to accept a Compensation much short of it, for doing publick  Business to a much larger Amount, & with increased Labour. Mr. Pettit now Secretary to the State of New Jersey an Office which will make a genteel as well as permanent Provision for his Family, cannot be expected to quit it without an adequate Compensation. In short, Sir, we are confident that nothing but a thorough Conviction of the absolute Necessity of straining every Nerve in the Service, could have brought these Gentlemen into Office upon any Terms. To give a Commission upon publick Money is doubtless a Temptation to the Officers to peculate, & should in general be avoided. In the present Instance however the general Position we believe admits of Exception. Every Man has his Price in a good Sense, that is to say no Man will undertake great Labour without the Prospect of some proportionate Gain, & whatever fair Promises People may make every one will have the Price at which he estimates his Labours, by Right, or by Wrong. To pay such a Price as a Salary to the Officer, would in one Point of Veiw, be preferable, but would produce most dangerous Effects in the Army. Upon raising the Salary of one Officer, every other would expect a similar Increase, & when once the Mode is begun, no one can tell where it will end, unless indeed in publick Bankruptcy. It is true that a Commission is a Temptation to enhance the Price of Articles purchased; & it is possible enough that this Temptation will have its Effect. Let us then suppose a Quartr. Master Genl. inclined to defraud the Publick of 1000 Dollars, would he do it by giving 200,000 for that which ought to be purchased for 100,000, thereby giving an Alarm: or would he charge the publick with the Loss of Articles in his Department to that Amount, or the like; for which a thousand opportunities would daily present themselves, without the Possiblity of Detection. The Fact is that in this particular Department, if those at the Head of it are not vigilant & honest, the publick may, nay, must be defrauded of immense Sums by an Infinity of Ways, in Spite of every Check which the Ingenuity of Man can devise. And of all the Means of defrauding, the swelling of Commissions by greater Expenditures, is the most liable to Detection & produces the worst Consequences to the offending Party himself. There is therefore no Possiblity of obviating Peculation, but by drawing forth Men of Property, Morals, & Character-these are the only solid Basis of Security, & if such Men watch each other, which would be the Case according to our Proposed System; we have all the Precautions which the Nature of the Case will admit. The Commission of 2 1/2 per Cent now paid on Forage alone, will we believe exceed the Allowance of the new Establishment. There will be a Saving then even here, but that from which we hope most, is the Sagacity, & Knowledge of Business which these Gentlemen possess, & which will provide that we are not destroyed by the Insects of the Office.   Upon the whole we must submit this Business to Congress, who are alone competent to a final Determination. If they conceive our Plan, & the Persons we have named to be proper they will confirm it; & if not we have to intreat that they will lose no Time in adopting such Men & Measures as shall appear more adequate to the Objects we have in View. The Delays of the Committee have arisen from the Necessity of consulting the Gentlemen, prevailing on them to accept, & knowing their terms. To trouble you with the whole of this Detail would be tedious & useless, but we beg Leave to assure you that not a Moment hath been spent unnecessarily, as we were under a Necessity to look thro' the widest Circle of Acquaintance & Character, to find some of those very few Men who are capable of filling such important Offices, and it is with Pleasure we add, that in the Opinion of your Committee their Researches have not been in vain.  Nothing now remains but to express to Congress our anxious Wishes that their Resolution may be speedy. Every other Preparation for a vigorous & decisive Campaign will be ineffectual & vain if this great Department remains much longer unfilled by suitable Characters & we hope to be favoured with your Determination by an immediate Express.  We are with the greatest Respect & Regard, Sir, Your most Obedt. & very Hbble Servt. Fra Dana, by Order  P.S. We had almost forgot to add the great Necessity there is of immediately calling for a State of the Preparations for the next Campaign in the Qr. Master Gens. Department specifying what Articles are in Readiness, where deposited, where engaged & in what Quantities. Let the Arrangement be what it may, such a Return is indispensably necessary to enable the Gentlemen mentioned above or any others who may be appointed to proceed without farther Loss of Time, or unnecessary Expence.  While the above Dispatch was preparing the Enemy with their whole Horse & a large Body of Foot came out; the latter halted about 10 Miles from the City on the other Side the Schuylkill, while their Horse proceeded 15 miles farther up passing several Waggons with Pork on their Way to Camp of whom they took no Notice but pressed on to a Drove of 130 Cattle on their Way from Connecticut which they have carried into Town with them together with about 30 Militia whose Times were out & were returning home without Arms. The nakedness of the Troops & Difficulty of subsisting them on the East Side of the Schuylkill, together with the reduced Condition of our Cavalry prevents the Army from covering that Country as could be wished, & is a Subject of serious Concern to every one who duly reflects upon the advantageous Consequences of it to the Enemy in almost every Point of View.  We understand Dr. Parke & a Son in Law of James Pemberton (named Morton) have without any Permission from Head Quarters passed thro' on their Way to Winchester, we beg Leave to submit to Congress how far such Freedoms ought to pass unnoticed & whether it will not be adviseable to prevent their returning.(6)  We have been much surprized lately to find that the Resolution of Congress passed last October empowering a Court Martial to try Persons other than of the Army who shall be found carrying on an Intercourse with the Enemy, will not reach those Villains who come out to kidnap & deliver to the Enemy the active Friends of their Country.(7) There are a Number of these Offenders now in Custody who must either escape with Impunity (the Court martial having declined passing upon them) or they must be executed by the special Authority of the General. An Authority which he will not exercise but in Cases of the last Necessity. We submit to Congress whether it is not necessary to revise the above Resolution & also to give some Direction about these Criminals whose Discharge will greatly dishearten our Friends & give just Cause of Alarm & Discontent to the faithful Adherents of these States. Besides the great Encouragement given to these Practices if no Punishment can be devised for those now in our Hands, we fear it will bring any farther Resolution of Congress on this Subject into Contempt & in a great Degree countenance the dangerous Intercourse carried on between the City & the dissafected of the Country.(8)  ""

  Dear General. 25th Febry 1778. Although I missed the opportunity of paying my respects to you this Morning by Major Rogers because I had intended to have taken a leisure minute in the Evening, yet I am reduced to the Same dilemma which his Speed would have placed me in. The Cry is, Susquehanna will be impassable to morrow & therefore the present Messenger must be hurried away at a moments warning. You will from this Consideration excuse brevity.  Your favour of the 14th (1) I had the honour of receiving last Night & have delivered the largest packet for Versailles which it had inclosed to Baron Holzendorff-the other shall go by some other good conveyance. I was rejoiced at the perusal of your Certificate in favor of the Baron. I had always reserved a design in case of need to have made a tender of Acts of kindess to that unfortunate Gentleman, but FEBRUARY 25, 1778  if he can by claims of right obtain the necessary relief, the great purpose will be answered & himself not unnecessarily subjected to obligation. The latter I mention, only in reference to the feelings of every Gentleman, not from my own estimation of such Acts which are indispensably our duty when such occasions call.  I beg you will Dear General, do me the honour to present me in the most respectful terms to the Marquis,(2) I have nothing worthy his notice at this moment otherwise it should be employed in paying my devoirs to His Excellency. 'Tis not impossible but that something may accompany or speedily follow this, which may veil the gay prospects of the Duplessis, the Fluery's &ca &ca.(3) If any such thing shall happen I shall sympathize with those ardent Sons of Mars, just so long as Wisdom & sound policy will countenance their Mourning. I bear a grateful remembrance of their merits & they are always included in my good wishes.  I had almost forgot to inclose under this Cover the Letter you sent for Monsr. delaBalme, he left York a few days ago & probably will be with you before this Address. Dear General, excuse the unavoidable effects of being hurried by Rivers, & be assured I am with the most perfect Esteem & Respect.  ""

  Dr. Sir York Town Feb. 25th. 1778 On arriving at this place I find myself indebted to you for two letters.  I wish the idea of employing Genl. Schuyler in the department referred to could have met the approbation of Congress.(1) Besides the objections arising from his present situation which founded the declared impediment, I found on conversing with gentlemen privately that they feared the ill effects of an intrigueing mind; a temper unfriendly to the dispositions of officers in the army & its peace; & that out of the sphere of his particular influence & knowlege of the country he would not be able to conduct the great business. This last objection I own was counter to every idea I had formed of the man. Colo. Cox will be an happy acquisition to the public in any line. But in the line intended I beleive he may be peculiarly useful. His veiws & schemes of his own are many & extensive; however I hope he will  FEBRUARY 25, 1778  find himself able to reconcile his private with his public duties, especially as your interposition with him cannot fail to have great weight. Whether Genl. Green will not be too great a loss to the Line, I am not competent to determine. He is certainly one of a very few who made the art of war a study, & are become acquainted with its principles. As to dividing the department you must long ago have recd. the opinion of Congress on the subject. Tho' it carries an idea of a distribution, yet does it not exclude that of one Genl. head. Your veiws of this are just. Unity of action in no one department can be maintained on any other principle than that you mention.  The several transactions respecting the laying up provisions of flour &c. in this state are truely unaccountable, unless one should give way to some very disagreeable reflections. The State feel themselves truly uneasy. Last Monday Council received a Letter from the board of war informg. that the purchase of flour on the East side of Susquehanna was now unnecessary & that the Commissioners were directed to stop their hands in purchasing that article & to confine themselves to the purchase of meat. Council have directed a copy of the several papers on this subject to be sent to them & yesterday I procured an order of Congress for this purpose.(2) I wish the order of Congress, & the application of the delegates of a State had been met with rather more attention at the board than they were. However the copies are making. I beleive the assembly & Council will very seriously address Congress on the subject. Not many days ago Congress stopt any purchases by the superintendents on the East side of the River, & the money was sent to the Council. An additional 20,000 bbls are ordered to be procured, & the State Commrs. are now directed to discontinue their purchases of flour on the East. The tendency & effect cannot be doubted, even if we unwillingly admit the seeming principle of this proceeding. But is not the whole plan? Why collect flour? Can it not at any time be found in the mills? Will not these magazines be tempting objects to the enemy, both for distressing us, & helping themselves? Or should adverse circumstances take place, as last year, is All this flour collected, to be again & again transported, & finally dispersed again thro' the Country nobody will know where, till suffering the violence of all weathers, the injuries of moving & want of care, & the poison of unseasoned casks, it will be lost & perish. At this very time our flour may be found in farm houses & feilds havg. lain there 8 or 9 months, 30,000 & 20,000 bbl. purchased under the directions of the board of war & 50,000 by Mr. Blaine; the whole in the middle department cannot be necessary. I do not think it proper. This article can never be wanted in this Country if the Quarter Masters department gives due assistance.  Congress yesterday passed thro' the plan for reinforcing the army with drafts from the militia.(3) I fear it will have a tendency to draw  us back again to 3 months men. Nor does it appear to be practicable in this State, Delaware, perhaps Jersey & I am told not in Maryland. As the body of the people are so circumstanced that the loss of one year must be the ruin of their families or at least their very great distress, those who return in the winter will find unprovided families, & with them become a burden on the public, instead of being a source of its strength & riches. A few repetitions will render the evil general & perhaps decisive if the experiment should succeed. But the trial made with the flying camp forebodes the event, especially as that was for 5 months only, & this for 9 months. The disadvantages arising from having to redeem persons from captivity who are to yeild no future services by an exchange of others who are to serve during the war are manifestly against us; & the danger of meeting an enemy disciplined & hardy with new troops every campaign is alarming. Perhaps the Committee had good reason to think this mode was the last resource. I am truly sorry for it. Sure I am these things & many more could not have escaped them. Their propositions have suffered no alteration that I remember except that in the first proposition recommending to reinforce the army by drafts, these words are admitted immediately following or in such other manner as shall be effectual.(4)  I observe an exchange on the old cartel is likely to take place. Can Nothing be done for our freinds who are cruelly confined in the goals of Britain & who are sent to the East Indies? Of the last circumstance Congress has undoubted testimonies.  Genl. Burgoyne has had the resolutions to detain him communicated to him. Genl. Heath writes that the officers are affected with concern & dissappointment rather than with sulleness or resentment. He has required the officers arms to be deposited with him till they imbark. B. says he will collect them but that they must remain in his own hands on honor not to distribute them again. An aid from B. is now in York Town on the subject of his detention.(5)  Feb. 26.  Not having an opportunity of forwarding the above, I have to thank you for yours of 24 Inst. which came to hand this Evenning. I have heard no complaints concerning the slowness of your proceeding. Indeed such is the importance, multiplicity & delicacy of the matters you have to do, that time, much time, must be necessary to do it well. Of this I have reason to beleive Gentlemen here are fully convinced. However taking it for granted that you have had hints on this head, I shall omit no opportunity of giving my sentiments freely. Much dependence is had on your proceedings. The consequences of doing Your business thoroughly may be great. If the army, or if the Congress should be disappointed the effects may be fatal. Indeed it  FEBRUARY 26, 1778  may be a matter of some doubts whether the continuance of a Committee in camp would not be productive of great advantages. The several letters I have the pleasure of from you are of Feb. 8 from Norriton, which I suppose the long one, as you call it, & which I consider as confidential.

  In Committee of Congress. Sir Moore Hall, Camp. Feby. 28th. 1778  The Cavalry of our army requires the most vigorous exertions to be put on so respectable a footing as to enable us to meet the Enemy the ensuing Campaign on equal terms.(1) Experience hath so fully demonstrated the value and importance of this Corps, not only to the ease and security of the Troops in the Field, but to the protection of the faithfull inhabitants of the Country, whose persons and property are exposed to the depredations of the enemy, that we are of opinion there is no part of our establishment which so strongly applies to the feelings of the People and calls for greater attention. Under every disadvantage which a new raised Corps always labours, and especially in a service intirely new, this Body hath performed the most essential services during the last campaign. What may we not therefore now expect from them when experience and acquaintance with their duty has qualified them to discharge it? When we are become better acquainted with the character of Officers, and the Men are more familiarized to Danger and Discipline?  We promise ourselves Sir the greatest advantage from a decisive superiority in Horse in the open Country where the Scene of Action will probably lie, and are the most anxious on this subject as the Enemy are evidently increasing their number by every means they can devise, purchasing and stealing Horses for the purpose whenever they can be found. They have already two Troops of Tory Light Horse who are cheifly employed in kidnapping those civil Officers who are distinguished for their activity in executing the trust reposed in them by Government. The consequence of this to our infant States are too obvious to need enumeration. We are sorry to say they have lately had such successes as will probably encourage their progress in this mischievous business, and extend it very far unless they meet with some seasonable check. We apprehend therefore your Excellency  FEBRUARY 28, 1778  and the Gentlemen in Authority with you will fully concur with us in the propriety and necessity of recruiting this Corps with all possible dispatch, and favor us with your best assistance in so doing. The Regiments are nearly completed with Men Natives of the Country whose time of Service in the Infantry having expired, readily enlisted in the Horse. These Men inured to fatigue, danger and discipline have only to learn the special duties of that Service, and will form excellent Dragoons. The great difficulty under which the Service labours is the want of Horses and Saddles to mount them. On the one hand to wait the Tedious process of collecting Horses in the common mode by purchase either by Officers or Agents uncontroled by any immediate Authority will occasion great fraud and delay. On the other hand to use force in any degree appears oppressive and leaves such lasting discontent in the minds of the sufferers as not only sours and disaffects to the general Interests of the Country but to the particular State where the exertion is made. We have been therefore extreemly solicitous to find some expedient to reconcile these clashing Duties, an expedient which may provide for the present exigence of the service without wounding too deeply those feelings and attachments which all Men have for their property in a greater or lesser degree. At length Sir, as the safer and more effectual mode we have concluded to rely on the wisdom and public spirit of the Gentlemen in Authority in this and the neighbouring States, and to request their exertions in the following mode. We have made calculations of the number of Horses and common country Saddles and Bridles proper for the Cavalry which may be had from Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pensilvania & New-Jersey respectively. The State we suppose will then calculate what number the several Counties can furnish by a reasonable assessment, and then appoint proper persons in the Country to purchase them on the best terms they can, allways attending to the following description. That the Horse be sound and clean limbed not less than Five years old this Spring, nor exceeding Twelve years-Geldings at least 14 1/2 hands high and not less than one quarter blooded We do not limit any price either as a purchase money, or a compensation to those employed in the business, because we presume they will be men of integrity and property who besides the Interest they have in common with us that the public expences be not causelessly enhanced will have a due regard to their own characters. In order to provide for payment it is proposed that a number of Loan Office Certificates be lodged with the Executive Authority of the State to be paid on the First Day of May under such Limitations and Checks as will most effectually guard against Fraud or Mistake, The whole amount to be finally settled between Congress and the State when the business is completed. We must request that the persons who may be appointed to make the purchases, be directed  from time to time to make returns of their doings in this business to yourself, and that you wou'd please to order a general return to be made to the Quarter-Master-General, and also to the Board of War. The number of Horses, Sadles and Bridles estimated for this State is Two hundred and fifty which we beleive will not appear by any means too large for its resources. We doubt not but on this occasion your Excellency and the Gentlemen of the Legislature will favor us with a continuance of those exertions, the beneficial effects of which we have already experienced. We greatly regret that this business has been so long delayed, and fear the service will suffer in consequence of it as some time is necessary to train the Horses before they can be brought into the field. We hope therefore it will receive all possible forwardness from the Gentlemen who are to take it up as the utillity of the measure will depend greatly on dispatch.  We are Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servants, Fra Dana, by Order ""

  Sir York Town March 1st. 1778 The reason why I have not wrote to you for some time past is, because nothing particular respecting either our State or the army hath taken place; and the general resolves of congress are printed in news-papers or transmitted by the President.  France still persues her old equivocal line of conduct. Sometimes, with a peremptory tone, she orders our Trade from her ports; at another she connives at, and even countenances our armed and commercial Vessels. She is intirely governed by the principles of policy and interest. She says that she ought not to declare herself, until she is led to it by an open rupture of the English, of which we shall soon be the pretext or the subjects; that we shall obtain her alliance by continuing to solicit her secret friendship and succours; until we convince her that no extremity is capable of making us renounce that Independency we have adopted, and by contenting ourselves with an assistance as underhanded as it is efficacious, and thereby leaving the MARCH 1, 1778  English to retard the alliance of France with us by their pretending not to see what they endure or to hasten the period by hostilities which France is determined to repel vigorously.  This is the language of France; from which it seems that we must fight our own battles; unless Britain should come to an open rupture with France, which, I think, is not much to be expected. To enable us to fight them successfully it is indispensably necessary, that our continental battalions should be filled as soon as possible.  By a resolution of Congress on this subject, which you will receive by the express who carries this, you will see that we are to complete only one of our battalions, the two, considering our circumstances, having been reduced to one.(1) The number of recruits that we shall have to raise, as by the return, is eight Sargeants, nineteen corporals and one hundred and thirty nine privates; which I hope will be collected at the place of rendezvouz early in the spring. I am informed that Col. Green is gone to our state to raise a regiment of blacks. I wish that (they) He may not be encouraged to recruit, until our continental battalion and State battalions shall be completed, and the Enemy be removed from the State. It appears to me very inconsistent that we should be required to fill up only one battalion, on account of our exposed, perilous situation, and that recruiting, for another purpose than for our defence, should go on.(2)  The late Resolution of Congress authorizing and requesting the Executive council of Massachusetts to remove and separate Genl. Burgoynes troops, and place them in such parts of the State as might be thought proper,(3) and the information I have received, that a number of the militia from thence and Connecticut have arrived in our State, have in some measure relieved me from the anxiety I have long endured; but still so long as the enemy's troops continue on  Rhode-Island, and their fleet in the Bay, nothing but a force sufficient to awe them can secure our long-extended shores from ravage and devastation. In my humble opinion we have not a man of any colour to spare, Our Towns, our Shores, our fields require every hand to defend and cultivate them.  We are about obstructing and fortifying Hudsons River, in order to secure the communication between the southern and northern states; altering the System of the commissariats and quarter-master, which departments with the Clothiers have been most miserably executed the last campaign; calling public officers to account, and taking every method we can devise to fill up and supply our Army, and correct Abuses. I hope they will prove efficacious; but so great, alass! is the corruption and avarice of the people, that it is extremely difficult to find persons, to fill the public offices, who will, by their honest exertions, give efficacy to public measures.   Congress have directed Genl. Washington to send a proper Major Genl. to fill the place of Genl. Spencer.(4) It is not yet determined who is to pay the expence of the R. I. Expedition.(5) I have not urged a determination; because Massachusetts hath been a long time and is still unrepresented, one of her members (6) being of a committee now at Head Quarters. There are so many and such large demands on the treasury for supplying the great departments of the army, that an application for a considerable Sum would be ineffectual. I opposed the last Warrant being issued on our Loan-Office, but in vain. So soon as those departments shall be supplied, our State may have a chance. If the Assembly should think proper they can send forward an Abstract of their Accounts against the United States with directions to their Delegates to apply when a good time shall present. If Loan Office certificates would answer it would mightily facilitate a Grant.  Some of the citizens of this state having been lately kidnapped and carried into Philadelphia, Congress have resolved that all offenders taken within 70 miles of the main army or any detachment or post, under the command of a General, shall be tried by a court martial and suffer the pains of Death.(7)  A certain northern expedition is for good reasons laid aside.(8) Several Vessels have lately arrived at the Southward from the W. Indias with Cloths, Blankets, Tents &c. Those from Martinico were convoyed clear off the Island by a French Frigate. Some Loads of Salt have also arrived, but still that article is scarce. Could not this Article be made in Charlestown and Westerly in great abundance? And may it not be adviseable to encourage this necessary manufacture?  By the fifth Article of confederation no state shall be represented by less than two members. I submit it, whether it will not be adviseable to chuse four or five at the next election, and keep three upon the spot that the State may be always represented. If only two should be present, One may fall sick and the State for a considerable time be unrepresented to its great Detriment.(9)  I expect soon to see a colleague with orders for a ratification of the confederation.(10) Most sincerely praying for the perpetual establishment of the Sovereignty, Freedom and Independence of the United States of America, and particularly for the deliverance of the distressed State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations from her Enemies, I have the honor to be with the highest respect, yr Excellency's most obedt hble Servant, William Ellery  P.S. Two hundred and eighty six dwelling houses & a number of Stores in Charlestown So. Carolina have lately been destroyed by Fire.  The Resolution last hinted at, and another desiring the several  States to send forward their accounts of supplies to prisoners &c I see are in the Paper which I now inclose.(11)  I find that I have made a mistake in the number of Sargeants & Corporals wanted to complete our Battalion. The number I have mentioned is the number wanting to complete two battalions.  ""

As the case now Stands, to morrow is mortgaged & it will be difficult to bring the MARCH 1, 1778  business upon the tapis before Tuesday, however I will make an attempt & if not baulked by some Six-deep Orator will get it in edgeway in the afternoon.(2)  Upwards of 750,000 Dollars have been lately Issued for the department in the present hands, these I should therefore hope have Supplied you very amply or have provided large Legacies for their successors.  In obedience to your Commands Sir I will transmit another quarter of an hundred Commissions & their proper Companions to Mr. Avery. You may Smile when I tell you that I yesterday granted two Commissions for Cruizing on the Ohio & Mississipi.  A Resolve will go to General Washington by the present Messenger which will probably reach those partizans whom you were afraid would escape justice,(3) & there is one upon the Anvil which I parted with yesterday every Stitch Crimson, it will return tomorrow probably with small white facings.(4) We are vex'd I assure you sir, & we shall roar when we come to hear the story of the Connecticut deserters. This I am determined to keep a secret to the very proper moment for disclosing the melancholy subject.  An Act upon your Resolves for filling up the Continental Battalions will also now go to the General.(5)  I will not rashly assert that we perform a great many good things, but truth will witness that we work hard. I can seldom begin to sit at this Table before 9 oClock at Night & as Seldom rise from it before 12 & at it again before day light.  There was a time some 12 or 13 Years since when I abandoned the means of pocketing Thousands per Annum under the Idea of retiring from the hurry of business. If this be retirement, I most devoutly wish to go to work again.  The loss of the Cattle is horrible, I begin to dread the Enemy's driving the Army into the City & Sending a detachment for your humble Servant & Company, I have in the mean time been calculating how to repair the lack of so much Beef. This may be done by a Recommendation from the Committee to the Army to observe Lent which will begin on Wednesday by three Pan Cake days in each of the Six Weeks, but upon my seriousness Sir, if we are not more watchful, if we cannot or will not recover that affected or real virtue which ground our first Steps into this dispute our Lent will be extended far beyond 40 days, but if I am to fast & choose my Spot, let it be at Mount Tacitus (6) where I am certain of a constant supply of excellent Trout & Bream. I am weary of the [levities?] of York Town.  You intimate good sir, that most of the Evils which have attended our Camp flow from gross neglect & abuse in the department of Qur. Mr. general, if it be so, & I am inclined to beleive it, why are we so Courtly & mincing? Is there a name under Heaven that shall sanctify   the peculator or Screen the man whose neglect of Duty has brought thousands to misery & Death? Forbid it torpid patriotism of 1775. No! let the Offender be dragged forth, & the people told, this is the Man! God awaken us. I am with very great Respect.  ""

  My Dear son, York Town 1st March 1778 I beleive I have not writ you a line since that by Baron Stuben, to which I have received your answer under the 24th.(1) I am anxious to know whether he will find amusement & employment in your Camp & whether he is likely to be a valuable addition to the Main Army. It is remarkable that your General has kept a profound silence on that Officer's name although I have had occasion to announce it to His Excellency in three several Letters.  Beleive me my Dear Son the present times present us with a variety of modes which contribute to, & effectuate, the equalizing Estates which though very wicked are still infinitely preferable to burning a whole Town. I received last Night a further account of that accident from a Travelling Officer who happened to be an Eye Witness, but even this person cannot relate to me such particulars as ought from authority to have reached us fifteen days ago, either authority has been very dilatory or its Messenger is so. However according to this Gentleman's report the destruction is as great as the most apprehensive mind could have figured upon a first impression. 11 Houses on the Bay of Charles Town, & no more South of Queen Street were left standing-& there are strong grounds for suspecting the Fire was kindled by Emissaries of our Enemies. Four Men of War were close in with the Bar all the day of the Fire & the Night following continued false fires as if to conduct persons expected from on Shore. The Randolph, another Ship & three Brigantines were equipped, well MARCH 1, 1778  Manned & lay ready to Sail on the 28 January intended to attack the little Squadron of the Enemy which consisted of a Frigate of 28, one of 20 Guns & two Armed Brigantines. We shall soon hear the Issue of this enterprize; if good, it will be more than I expect. We out reckon the Enemy in Guns & Men, but their experience & discipline made an overmatch of two to one against us. If we are beat the loss will be felt severely in the 1st & 2d Regiments which have contributed large Officers & Men for the expedition. I hope their bravery will be rewarded with success.  What shall I do for my Dear son reduced to Breeches, there is not an Inch of such Cloth as you want in York. Tames made one search & a Taylor upon whom I can depend, a second, & both returned empty, our hopes of a supply from Charles Town are cut off. I must write to Baltimore & to Boston, why had not my Dear Son laid in a larger stock. He will find the Doctrine of equalizing altogether inconsistent with Military uniformity. Here's a fragment of Blue Cloth just enough the Taylor says to make you a Coat.  I would give the value of ten pair of Breeches rather than learn or think & I shall now be continually thinking so-that you are confined to one pair dirty or tattered. You will learn in time to make better provision for your self.  I suspect that some in your Army supply themselves with necessary articles from the City (2) & hold it no more criminal to do so in the present state of affairs than it was of old for a Religious hungry David to eat the hallowed Bread of Ahimelec when there happened to be none other. Indeed in all the States the Resolve against purchasing British Manufactures in cases of extremity hath been dispensed with-& it is a moot point in my mind whether we ought any longer to adhere to the Rule.(3) There is much to be said in favor of a Repeal.  The article of Powder was promised by my Hair Dresser but he has not brought it in. James will go & enquire for it, if he succeeds you will receive it by the bearer of this.  We hear repeated Accounts of advantages gained by the Enemy in small parties making Prisoners daily of Officers & Men from your Army-that the Major of a Colonel Stuart, together with a Company of Taylors & all the Clothing intended for the Colonel's Regiment were taken at New Town by a party of twenty Light Horse & the Major at the head of the Taylors beyond doubt, paraded into the City-that desertions are numerous & continued every day-& in a word that Your Camp is in the power of General Howe & that he may compel you to fly from it when he pleases & leave your Baggage & Artillery, or give you the Choice of being Prisoners of War or cut to peices.  I was just going to ask, are these things so? when a L[etter] from the Committee came to hand,(4) which informs me of an irreparable   loss which you had suffered of 130 head of Cattle turned by the Enemy's light Horse into the City. I am apprehensive these give a true description of your helpless state nor shall I be very much surprized however much I may be affected by it, to hear that you are routed by the Enemy's Army & feel that Congress are seized upon by a detachment. The prospect is gloomy indeed. There are a few villains who have brought us to this precipice who deserve to be hanged but they have powerful Advocates. Give me your sentiments fully on our deplorable situation.(5)  An Officer who came in here a few minutes ago gives me hopes of procuring buff Cloth for your present necessity. You see how I patch a Letter together, exposed to continual interruptions & diverted from the most important & serious subjects to Buff Cloth & Breeches.  I had intended to have spoken to you again on the subject of your black Regiment but I have not time at present, however let me tell you you mistook my meaning in some parts of the last Letter on that affair.(6) I did not even intend to insinuate that you were possessed by illaudable ambition. It is evident you wished for a Command; speaking of you honestly as a fellow Citizen, & you know partiality is not to be found in the Catalogue of my vices, I think you would not, young as you are, disgrace a Regiment. I intended to have recommended you to a practicable Road & to draw you off from a pursuit which in the opinion of every body would prove fruitless & which I exceedingly feared might soil your excellent character with a charge of singularity, whimsicality & Caprice. This however I have ever taught you to despise when set in competition with Duty & with honourable Acts.  Your scheme, with respect to your own progress in it would have ended in essay, but you would not have heard the last jeer till the end of your life, meaning if you had gone precipitately into the prosecution. An attempt of that magnitude may originate with an Individual but must be extended after very mature deliberation by the Collective wisdom of States. I wish for an hours serious conversation with you on these points.  I suppose you to be strongly attached to General Washington & I do not wonder you are so every Gentleman loves & Esteems that great & good Man but when the proper time shall come that you feel an inclination to retire from that Army & turn your attention to your own Country I hold it probable that you may obtain a Commission & soon raise a respectable Regiment. From such Ideas & reflections I was led to write in the terms which I perceive you misapprehended, but we will postpone the subject for discussion on some future day.  I know not what my Country Men are about nor why they have so shamefully neglected to fill their Representation in Congress. I have been long striving to shame them into the performance of their duty. As the Assembly met at Charles Town on the 5 January I hold it  probable that Delegates were chosen among their earliest Acts & that the Men, whoever they are, will soon be at York & bring me permission to return, which I am determined to do immediately after I can meet & take leave of you. You will make such use of this intimation as you shall judge necessary.  I feel a strong inclination to send into Philadelphia & New York about an hundred Guineas to be applied to the relief of some of the most necessitous of our Soldiers who are Prisoners there. Tell me your thoughts. If Rich Men would open their hearts & their Purses freely what infinite advantages would be gained to our Army & to our cause in general.  My best Respects to Monsr. le Baron Stuben.  My Dear son, Adieu. Henry Laurens  ""

  Sir Moor Hall 2d March 1778. We did ourselves the Honor to write to you some Days since upon the Propriety of taking Savages into the public Service, to act as light Troops upon out Posts, advanced Parties and the like.(1) In Conversation with Baron Steuben upon the Subject, He observes that the Austrians always use the Coats (a Kind of white Indians) for such Purposes and to so good Effect that the King of Prussia imitated them by enrolling a Body of Irregulars to Cover in like Manner his Army but without answering the End, as new Soldiers too frequently desert which is fatal when very great Dependence is placed upon them.(2) Colo. Gist who is made the Bearer of this Letter will do himself the Honor to satisfy Congress in such further Enquiries as to the Utility of this Corps as they may think it expedient to make. Colo Gist will be happy in rendering every Service to the Continent which is in his Power consistent with that Attention which Justice requires to his private Affairs. In a former Embassage of this Kind he involved himself in a very considerable Expense so much beyond the Extent of his Funds that he was obliged to mortgage his Plantation for Money which has been applied to the Public Service. Public Honor requires that the Account he will deliver for this Expenditure should be speedily and satisfactorily adjusted. And Prudence will lead him to provide that Monies be advanced him for his personal Charge, and the Maintenance of the Indians with him. This Gentleman hath also a farther Demand upon the public for Goods which he promised to seventeen Savages who were employed usefully last Summer upon the Eastern Shore of Maryland and altho these Goods were not specificated in any Bargain with them, yet what he says to them in future will have little Influence unless they see some Kind of Performance to follow on such general Promises.  In Order that no Mistakes may arise in future upon this Subject and also inasmuch as it may flatter the Vanity of these People (which  MARCH 2, 1778  is not taking them by the strongest Side) he suggests the Propriety of making out the Terms upon which they are to be taken in Service and this in Writing from Congress but how far this may be proper we will not pretend to say, submitting it entirely to your superior Discretion.  Colo. Gist also expects the Liberty to take with him a faithful Assistant, who is to provide for the Indians upon their Route, a Business which it is impracticable for the Principal to attend to, his time being taken up in the Management of those whom he conducts, preventing or adjusting little Differences which arise between them and the Inhabitants and the like.  When the Savages shall have arrived it will be necessary to have with them Interpreters, as there would be Danger in permitting them to go out in detached Parties without the Power of making themselves understood. Indeed there would be great use in having a few Men from their Neighbourhood to serve as Irregulars with them which would prevent perhaps Mistakes which might be fatal. For these Reasons the Colo. thinks it would be proper to employ some few Interpreters and also to enlist for the special Service about fifty Men, of which as many as possible are to understand the Indian Language.  Upon the whole sir we cannot but think that much Good would arise from employing these turbulent Borderers as they would certainly keep the Enemy Compact, prevent Desertion in our Troops, make us Masters of Intelligence and give us Pledges of their Fidelity.  We are, sir, respectfully, your most obedient & humble servants. Fra. Dana, by Order  ""

  Sir York Town 2d March 1778 The Committee of Secret correspondence, which almost a year ago was denominated the \""Committee for foreign Affairs\"" stands indebted to you for many letters both of interesting advice and ingenious political speculation. Happening to be the only member of that Committee at present in York Town, I now take up my pen, not to form apoligies for their long past silence so much as to make a begin- MARCH 2, 1778  ning of the act of justice due to you. I really fear that the collected ingenuity of the members will be put to it to offer, for a main excuse, any thing better, than that they relied upon your getting frequent intelligence of the state of our affairs from the commercial Committee. In short, Sir, I am so deeply concerned with the gentlemen in this affair that I know what they ought to do; and I am so well acquainted with their just manner of thinking that I will venture to confess in their name, that their past omission of corresponding with you is, in a considerable measure unaccountable. It is certainly better to step forward, towards a man of candor, in the straight line of honest confession than in the Zigzag tract of awkward apology.  Your letters, exclusive of their intrinsic Merit, have been more particularly acceptable to Congress from the Circumstance of our having [been] deprived of the satisfaction of receiving intelligence from the hands of our commissioners in Paris, since May last year. Besides those of their dispatches which have been lost at Sea, We know One has been examined and culled by some perfidious villain who substituted plain sheets of paper for the real letters of our friends. This was probably done in Europe before the bearer of it, a Capt. John Folgier, embarked with it for America.(1)  Your Ideas of the policy of the Court of Versailles appear quite just from the corroborating testimony of whatever information we can collect in any way.  The Course of gazettes which accompany this will so well communicate our home affairs that I shall not enlarge upon them. I will only say in brief that you may rest assured Independence is so absolutely adopted by America as to leave no hope for Britain, that we shall ever relinquish our claim. It must therefore be only to delude her own Islanders and her neighbors that She pretends to expect the contrary.  In addition to the misfortune which you mention respecting the Lexington we are told of a greater and one which will more intimately affect you respecting the Reprisal which is said to have foundered on the 1st October. Your acquaintance with Capt. Wickes will lead you to lament greatly the loss of so valuable an officer, and so worthy a man.

  Dear Sir York town March 2, 1778 Mr Francy is here. He hath offered the Flamand to Congress; but we have not purchased her. We were informed by Mr Langdon to whom we had written on the subject that she was unfit for our service.(1) She is ordered to South Carolina for a load of rice.  I take notice of what you say respecting the 74 gun ship. I was against building such huge ships, because I thought it would be very difficult if not impossible to man them. But would not the timber now prepared be too large even for such a frigate as you mention? And would not there be a loss in hewing it down to a proper size? I shall lay this matter before the Committee (2) when they can be got  MARCH 2, 1778  together which is as difficult to accomplish now, as it was formerly. I wish we could collect a number of our frigates together and give the British ships a drubbing, which now block up Chesapeake and the entrance into Charlestown South Carolina. Nicholson hath made two attempts to get out, but was so narrowly watched as rendered it impracticable. A gentleman who lately arrived here from thence, tells us, that Biddle and three State vessels were to go over the bar that day after he left Charlestown with a determination to attack the British ships who were of about equal force. I am anxious for the event.  France preserves her old equivocal line of conduct. We are constantly receiving supplies of one kind and another from Hortalez & Co. Several vessels have lately arrived from the West Indies with necessary articles and more are expected; but not withstanding this, and the unremitted exertions of Congress, so miserable is the conduct of every department that the army is not supplied with any one necessary article. We are altering the commissariate plan and are looking out for a new Commissary General. We have chosen General Green Quarter Master General in the room of General Mifflin resigned, and a Col Cox and a Mr Petit two very good characters assistant Q.M. G's so that I hope things will go on better in that department than they have done.(3) That of the Clothier General wants rectifying. Avarice and corruption run through, disorder and confound the execution of all our measures.  What effect the regulation of prices will have I cant say. I wish it had been universal, that a full experiment might have been made of its efficacy; although I was never fond of the measure. Unnatural restraints eventually do no good.  I delivered the account you enclosed to Mr Penn who promised me that he would send it to their government, such characters ought to be carefully watched, for they are capable of doing and disposed to do much mischief.  General Howe is upon the kidnapping plan at present and hath been not unsuccessful. To prevent this evil Congress have subjected all marauders and kidnappers to suffer death by a Court Martial, that are taken within 70 miles of the main army or any detachment under the command of a General.(4)  Before this reaches you, you will have heard that the executive Council of Massachusetts are authorized and requested to remove Genl. Burgoynes troops, separate and place them in such parts of that State as they may think proper. Malititular General hath wrote a letter to Congress, endeavoring to exculpate himself from the charges on which the suspension of the Convention is founded and desiring Congress to recede from their resolution. Upon which it is resolved that nothing therein contained is sufficient to induce Congress to re-  cede from their resolution. Imagining that he might fail in this application he hath by one of his Aids laid before Congress another that he might with his suite be permitted to go to Britain on their parole. This is committed. What a strange reverse of fortune this vain glorious man hath experienced!  The Reverend Prelate's letter was an old story when I got here.(5) The virtuous gentleman you inquire after was allowed by his State, six month's absence from Congress, that he might settle his private affairs about which and the adjustment of the accounts of the Secret Committee I suppose he is employed at his place about twenty miles from this place.(6) It is true that S.D. is recalled and J.A.(7) appointed in his room and it is true that I am with much respect, Yrs,  Wm Ellery [P.S.] Folsom is well at Camp as a Committee Man.

  Sir. York Town March 2d 1778. The inactivity of both Armies, arising from the Season of the year, affords little intelligence worth communicating.  The wants and distresses of our army no doubt has reached your ears, to recapitulate them would give you unnecessary pain as it is out of your power to afford any relief. They have rec'd a short temporary supply. How long it will continue I do not certainly know, but I have great reason to believe but a few Weeks. The causes which have produced these Evils, I trust will be a subject of serious inquiry. It is highly necessary they should, if no other views were to be answered by it, than the prevention of such mischiefs in future. Where men are virtuous and active, and properly supplied with money it appears to me, unaccountably strange, in a country like this the very lap of plenty, that an army like ours should be on the very  MARCH 3, 1778  brink of distruction for the want of common necessaries. And what is beyond measure astonishing, many of the soldiers for the want of a little straw to ly upon are daily droping into the grave. I wish for better times, and I am sure we have a right to expect better Men and management. Many of the officers in the great civil Departments I am firmly persuaded are highly criminal and I expect will be found so.  One of the principal subjects for which our Assembly stood adjourned to this Day,(1) has not yet been taken up in Congress. The Confederation will be generally approved by the states. Virginia has acceeded to it and some other states. No Carolina has agreed to part only. In the principal point on which your Delegates are instructed, I despair of succeeding in.(2)  The Success under our late recruiting Law I am unacquainted with. The necessity of filling up our Batallions agreeable to our quota, will appear by some late resolves of Congress which have been transmitted to our Governor to be laid before the General Assembly.(3) The mode principally recommended is the last effort that should be made. Whither it is to be embraced at this Time, is left to the wisdom of the Legislature.

  Sir, Moor Hall 3d March 1778. When we did ourselves the Honor of transmitting to Congress the Plan of an Arrangement for the American Army we omitted that of a Corps of Engineers,(1) the Utility of which was and is equally evident with that of others though our Ideas upon the Subject were not at MARCH 3, 1778  that Time entirely fixed and since that Period a Variety of other Researches have prevented so far our Attention that we have not yet submitted it to your Consideration. Enclosed is the Arrangement we determined on for that Corps together with their particular Duty on which we have only to add that the Officers should be Men of warranted Integrity and if possible great Mathematical Genius to the End that we may not in future be necessitated as at present to employ Officers of foreign Birth and Connections in this very confidential Part of our military Operations.(2)  On the Subject of Engineering we are further to observe to you that there is a Want of Assistants in this Line since every considerable Detachment ought not to be unprovided with a Person tolerably skilled in it. To supply this want, a Monsieur Murnan warmly recommended to us by General Portail offers himself to us and wishes to serve the Continent with the Rank and Appointment of a Major. Comparing his Pretensions with those of the Herd of his Countrymen and estimating them in the Scale of Abilities his Request appears to your Committee moderate and ought in their Opinion to be accepted since in this Department we must employ them on their own Terms.  A very alarming Circumstance draws our Attention at this Time and renders an immediate Application to Congress absolutely necessary. Want of Discipline in our Army from Causes which it is needless now to travel through occasions in most Instances a Relaxation of the Attention due to the Orders of the General. In Nothing is this more evident or more dangerous than in the Furloughs given by Colonels to their Men By Reason whereof our Numbers suffer a daily Diminution leaving only the Skeleton of an Army. True it is by the Articles of War only two Men are to be furloughed from any Company but this Article if strictly complied with would reduce us greatly the Companies being very numerous and but few men in each. How much greater then the Evil when by Pretence of the Article and in Defiance of general Orders this Privilege is extended according to the Disposition of the Colonel and the Importunities of his Men. We have therefore to request the immediate Repeal of this Article and that in future the Commanders of the respective Departments be invested with the sole Power of granting Furloughs.(3)  We have the Honor to be with great Respect, Sir, your most obedient humble servants, Fra Dana, by Order  ENCLOSURE An Establishment for a Corps of Engineers, Artificers &ca. to consist of 2 Battalions of 8 Companies each, 100 Men to a Company including   Feild & Staff Officers Pay per Month Their extra Allowances in each Battalion in Dollars per Month in Dollars 1 Colo. or Chief Engineer 60 15 for a Clerk 1 Lieut.

I have lately had one of the Severest fitts of the Gout, I ever had in my life, I have been confined to my room these 5 Weeks unable to help myself, having it in both feet, one knee & my right hand & arm, it is with great pain that I am able to hold a pen in my hand this day. I am sorry to hear Meridith is taken, I wish the fact could be Assertained in regard to his being put in Irons &c. Jackey is not yet with me; Mr. Mitchel promises to send him as soon as the weather will permit. I think I shall bring him home with me, as we are likely to have Warm work the Next Campaign, you may for the present send him to Mecklingburg School. In yours of the 26 Jany.

  Sir, 3d March 1778 Yesterday I had the honour of sending forward a Letter written the preceeding Evening as a private to yourself to which I beg leave to refer. Congress upon my presenting the Committees Letter from Camp dated the 25th Febry, entered upon the subject without hesitation & confirmed divers Resolves which you will find in the Inclosed Act of yesterday's date by which you will be pleased to govern your future proceedings relative to the department of Quarter Master General. MARCH 3, 1778  A duplicate of this Act I shall transmit by the bearer of this to Major General Mifflin. All the present Members of Congress entertain the most Sanguine hopes that the department will now be conducted with the greatest propriety & benefit by Major General Green & the Gentlemen his Coadjutors. It occurs to me that in your long Letter you omitted one capital article, Money; from an assurance that the important business cannot be conducted without the aid of that necessary, I will take the liberty at our meeting to day to introduce the Subject (1) & I make no doubt but a proper grant will be immediately Resolved. The late Qur. Mr. general was Supplied with upwards of 300,000 Dollars a very few days ago, from whence some benefits will no doubt arise in the new arrangement.(2)  Congress have directed the Board of War to give orders for apprehending those Excursors from Philadelphia towards Winchester & if taken to imprison them.(3)  I have the honour to be &ca.

  My Dear son, York Town 3d March 1778 Permit me to refer you to what I had the pleasure of writing by the Light Horse Man, Sharp, yesterday.(1) The bearer hereof is another Light Horse Messenger. He will deliver a bundle containing 1 1/2 Yards of yellowish Cloth enough the Taylor reports for 2 pair Breeches or a Wastcoat & Breeches. This I obtained as a very great favor & at the very moderate Sum of 48  MARCH 3, 1778  Dollars. You wrote only for Cloths but where are materials for making up. Mr Hair Dresser recommends to you to substitute flour until he can by his art procure a better article for your hair.  In my last dispatches I forwarded a miniature of the General to Mrs Washington from Majr. Rodgers which he packeted in my presence & requested my care of. I think I have seen a performance of yours which discovered superior skill; maybe I am mistaken, but be that as it may, if you have materials, time & inclination you will do me a singular pleasure by sending me a half length of your draught.(2) The Major says the General has a remarkable dead Eye. This did not strike me in either of the three or four times when I saw him. Once I had as good a veiw as Candle light could afford & I am seldom deficient in such strictures.  General Burgoyne has transmitted to Congress a long remonstrative Epistle on the Suspension, to which we shall return a very laconic & decisive answer. This event must have been preconceived by the unfortunate General, who had therefore put into the hands of his Aid de Camp a Messenger Capt Wilford a No. 2 to be delivered after the receipt of our answer, but without waiting, he enabled me to report it yesterday. This contains a request, that himself & certain Officers chiefly of his family may under proper restrictions embark for England. I have communicated to several Members my sentiments and I believe a vote will pass in his favor Nemine Contradicente. I think good may be produced from this Political condescension. However let me say the representation he has made of the state of his health & private affairs including his Character is an appeal to humanity-or in the General's own term to our Generosity. I shall be exceedingly mortified if we neglect the opportunity of contrasting American liberality to British Cruelty. Should the favor be abused we have subjects enough remaining for full retaliation. The General may adopt any Motto, he has now learn'd that derivative is not higher than original honour & power, his Addresses to Congress in the name of their President are decent & unexceptionable. This is paving the way to a right understanding.  I mean to trust a plain Letter or two by Capt Wilford who will probably pass through your Camp & apply to you.  I write now as I am generally driven to do in my Addresses to you, in haste. God Bless & protect you. Henry Laurens  ""

4983,dg009161,1778,Henry Laurens to the Marquis de Lafayette,"""Henry Laurens to the Marquis de Lafayette
  Sir, the 4th March 1778. I am much honoured by the receipt of your Excellency's Letter of the l9th Febry.(1) which was delivered to me by Colo Kosciuszko in person, but not early enough by 24 hours to prevent my troubling Baron de Kalb to say \""I had nothing to offer the Marquis delafayette on the 25th except respectful Compliments & good wishes.\"" (2) This would not have been true, had Your Excellency's favor been delivered to me soon after the delivery of a Letter dated the 20th Febry & signed by your Excellency which was sent to me by the Board of War uncovered for the information of Congress.(3)  I had read this last mentioned Letter to Mr. Lovel before the meeting of Congress & remarked to him that from the Stile & tenor, it must have been intended for the president of Congress. This sentiment which scarcely required further aid, was confirmed beyond all doubt, by the preface of your Excellency's private Letter. \""I intend to write to you as president of Congress,\"" but unluckily this was not presented to me till the afternoon of the 20th. It was then the Colo. introduced by General Gates, did me the honour to call at my little apartment. I can account in no way for the miscarriage of the Letter intended for Congress, but by concluding an error in the superscriptory, & the omission within, of the customary direction, for it cannot be beleived the Board of War would otherwise have made so unbecoming an appropriation; & their hurry of business apologizes for the want of that nice attention which was necessary to discover from the contents of the Letter that it was manifestly designed for Congress. From this mistake, if it be really one, it follows that I have no Commands on me from Congress directed to your Excellency, who will hear from the Board with whom Your Excellency apparently corresponded.  Nevertheless, as it is neither out of the Line of the presidents Duty nor inconsistent with his Right as a Delegate, I shall do myself the honour of conveying a Copy of the Act of Congress of the 2d Inst. passed upon Resolving to suspend the intended Irruption,(4) meaning from thence to prove that Congress maintain an high opinion of your Excellency as a Soldier & a Gentleman & you may depend upon it Sir, the approbation contained in that Act, is genuine, not merely complimentary. Admitting the phraseology to be not quite unexceptionable, I should be criminally silent were I not to declare, the intentions of Congress respecting Your Excellency's honour & merits, are altogether so. I will in this case presume to answer for each Individual Member. I love to walk in the Light & to dwell on these bright scenes. Your Excellency, I flatter myself, will indulge my silence on some particulars alluded to in your Excellency's Letter of the l9th.  MARCH 4, 1778  I might be led to disclose sentiments which might seem unfavorable to a Gentleman,(5) whom I esteem a Man of good & upright intentions, whose mistakes are more the effect of credulity than of turpitude of mind or principles. Those who mislead him will be dragged forth at length to public veiw. Methinks they are in such hands at present as will not Spare them. You Sir, who are a Bystander are best qualified to judge, & most likely to judge impartially.  My wish is, that we may detect & punish all peculators, projecting, insidious, mischievous Knaves, & that no Name under Heaven may screen the villain. But I would deal gently with those whose errors are of the head, whose general tone speaks the public good. And at all hazards & expences I will to the utmost of my abilities Support & defend the disinterested patriot-at the same time most sedulously avoid every whisper which may tend to fan the flame of party. Hence your Excellency will perceive my motives for touching certain Subjects with caution. When I am clear, no Man will Speak with more chearful boldness, but by casting at an object in a Mist, I may wound an Innocent, or a friend.  If ever Man stood on a firm Base, you do My Dear General, you are possessed of what Bacon calls the \""vantage ground of Truth\""- from whence you may look down upon the Crooked vales & paths below.  My hopes are sanguine that from the American patriotism of Marquis delafayette & from his native virtue a power will be raised which will effectually repress the Monster, party, now ravaging the fairest Characters in this Country. God forbid Sir, you should entertain a thought of leaving our United States at this juncture.  \""My opinion Dear General of your situation,\"" is, that you are at Albany & often in very good Company, & very far from the inglorious precipice which you seem to suggest. The notoriety of your whole conduct & the Resolves of Congress shield you against every possible unfavorable insinuation. Your Excellency will find that Body, Congress, however it may, by artful Men, be sometimes a little Bamboozled, to consist of honest well disposed minds and if \""Wisdom is justified of her Children\"" I appeal to their Acts in general. Fall the blame of the late abortion where it ought, or where it may, or by good maneuvring on one side & tameness & acquiesence on the other, let a thick veil be drawn over it, not the smallest spark or speck of Censure can possibly light on Marquis delafayette; that General has performed every thing which had been prescribed to him. He has overshot the expectation of some who presumed to beleive & assert that he would be deficient in \""activity,\"" & the intended expedition \""some days advanced before his appearance at Albany\""-in a word 'tis but just that I should repeat, your Excellency is spoken of by Members in Congress with Respect & Admiration. The Air around  the Marquis is serene & his own Breast tranquil; a Blunder, not his own, has afforded an opportunity for a display of Wisdom which has gained him the confidence of the people, hence my Dear Sir, you will perceive that you may with very great propriety & decency, return to your late Miltary Post.  I shall add to the Act of Congress above mentioned one of the 24th Ulto. which by three last words added at my particular request injoins you to report the reasons of your Conduct \""to Congress.\"" (6) Your Excellency may possibly think this anticipated by the Letter of the 20th Febry-& if the Board of War shall have transmitted Copies of these Resolves the present Inclosed will appear to be superfluous, I have however confined my self within the sphere of my Duty, relying upon Your Excellency's indulgence to excuse me for making an Address which is altogether private, the Vehicle for two public Acts.  I know not what to say relative to General Putnam's Command, it appears to me that Gentlemen wish him away, & at the same time are loth to offend the good Man-if it be from his unfitness their wishes arise, the sacrifice is very politic & unwarrantable.  I remarked in a late Act by General Gates he retained the stile of Commander of the Troops in the Northern department, I know of no Resolve by which he has been divested of that Command & I have heard it said lately that there would be a necessity for his taking the Field again in the Spring.  Your Excellency having now a proper opening to correspond with Congress may if you shall judge it proper suggest a plan for employment of such troops as are at present under your Command & such as may be collected. I feel the utmost confidence that Congress will pay becoming attention to every thing your Excellency shall be pleased to offer.  I have the honour to be with the Highest Esteem & Respect.  P.S. I should not like our correspondence to be talked of by everyone who calls himself or who may seem to be friend. I am afraid of nothing but lies & misrepresentation.  A Note in the Margin of your Letter \""I beg you will engage Congress to read over all the papers I send to them,\"" is a clear proof the Letter of 20th Febry was intended for Congress altho' it might have been by mistake directed to the Board of War. I had not perceived this Note till the present Moment.  ""

  Sir, Moor Hall, 4th March 1778. I take the liberty of writing to you upon a subject of the utmost importance to our State. By following so much of St. Paul's advice as to become all things to all men I find clearly from the very best authority that without nice management we shall certainly loose the State of Vermont. The Eastern States are determined that they shall not be oppressed to use their phrase. The prejudices of the people are against us so are their interests. Designing men take advantage of these circumstances to forward their own private views. Tis absurd to reason against the feelings of mankind. Neither is it much to the purpose whether our claim is right for if it be, the most which can be said for us is that we have right without remedy. What are their claims? Occupancy, settlement, cultivation and the Book of Genesis. What their plea? Their mountains their arms their courage their alliances. Against all this what can we produce? Why forsooth a decision of the King in council and a clause in the confederacy. How ridiculous for wise men to rear any edifice of hope upon so slender a foundation. But how are we to act? to give them up? No! We must go to the mountain if the mountain won't come to us. They complain that the capital is too far off: carry it nearer not merely for their sakes but for our own. They complain of our impeachment of their title. Give them good title; we want subjects not land. They complain of the quit rents: abolish them. We cant have more of a cat than the skin. A good government, a free one I mean, will always command the wealth of its people. Hudson's river ensures us that of Vermont and Vermont ensures us Hudson's river. For Vermont must be fortified all over and vast magazines of military stores must be laid up in Vermont and when any body presumes to attack us from the eastward we shall know what to do. All this is not yet enough: you must apply to their feelings. Suppose for instance the legislature should take up the case of Vandyke, Ethan Allen and other our subjects and make very pointed resolutions for the liberating of them. Suppose for his services and sufferings a part of Kemp's land should be given to him and that part if any such there be which eastern gentlemen claim. Apply yourself to Warner's weak side. Baily is still a considerable man among them. Let splended acts of justice and generosity induce these MARCH 4, 1778  people to submit early to our dominion for prejudices grow stubborn as they grow old. This business my dear sir hath long pressed upon my mind with a weight and impression which I cannot describe. It is under heaven the great thing needful to us and though I laugh whenever Vermont is named yet I cannot almost use the poetical language intended for another occasion and say \""tis laughter swelled with bursting sighs.\"" (1)  MS not found; reprinted from E. P. Walton, ed., Records of the Governor arzd Council of the State of Vermont, 8 vols. (Montpelier: J. & J. M.

Beckman of Flatbush, N.Y.\""  1 Ironically, Morris' conciliatory approach to the problem of establishing New York's authority over the area that later became the state of Vermont proved to be unpopular among New Yorkers and was an important factor in the state legislature's refusal to reelect him to another term in Congress in August 1779.

  Sir Camp near Valley Forge, March 5. 1778. Col. Baylor who commands one of our Regiments of Cavalry being on his Way to Virginia, we avail ourselves of the Oppy. to lay before you what we have done, & what we propose to do, with Respect to that Corps. Our own Judgment so perfectly coincides with that of the military Gentlemen, on the Necessity of placing it on the most respectable Footing, that we have made it one of the principal Objects of our Concern & Attention. We have been happy to find, that three of the Regiments are nearly completed with Men recruited from those Troops whose Terms of Service expired this Fall, & readily inlisted in the Horse, tho totally averse to continuing in the Foot. But a large Supply of Horses, Arms & Accoutrements will be essentially necessary to enable them to take the Field with Effect. After forming a Variety of Plans to make this necessary Provision, we were obliged to reject them as too burthensome & oppresive, upon the People, or subjecting us to the most dangerous Frauds. At length Sir we adopted the following as most reconciliable to the Demand of the Service, & the Feelings, or Prejudices of the Country. We estimated the Number of Horses necessary for the Purpose, over & above those which have been & may be taken from the Vicinity of the Enemy; of which we quota'd a part on the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland & Delaware, the Remainder to be procured in Virginia & North Carolina. We wrote to the respective Governors of the three first States in the most pressing Terms stating the Importance & Urgency of the Service,(1) & requesting them by the most early & vigorous Exertions to procure the Number assigned, together with com- MARCH 5, 1778  mon Bridles & Saddles, in such Mode as would be most easy to the People, & effectually guarded against Fraud, Mistake, & Extortion. We did not limit any Price, because we were fully convinced the publick Service was last Year materially injured by this false Oeconomy. In the Rate of Purchases being fixed below the current Price of a good Horse, the Officers to whom this Business was intrusted were obliged either to leave their Men dismounted, or purchase those of an inferiour Quality, In many Instances totally unfit for the Service, & the Money thereby intirely lost. And we have no Doubt from the concurrent Testimony of all the Gentlemen with whom we have conferr'd on the Subject, that had a generous Price been then given which an Addition of a few Pounds would have made, we should now have had a very respectable Number of good Horses, instead of those little, wretched, useless Animals which disgrace our Service, & consume our Forage. It is expected that the Gentlemen appointed by the States will not only conform strictly to the Description we have sent, but be Men of such Character & Knowledge, as to give the best Security against Fraud & Imposition; & acting under immediate Controul & Authority they will perform their Duty without adding to those discontents which the unnecessary, arbitrary Seizure of Property justly creates. These Letters we have Reason to believe, will find the Legislatures of Jersey, Pennsylvania & Maryland sitting who will we trust take effectual Measures to execute this Business with Dispatch, as the only probable Means to ward off the Necessity of using Compulsion. As to the Delaware State, the Debility of its Government, & indeed the Dereliction of Power by the executive Officers, had induced us with the Concurrence of the General to put the Business so far as relates to them, under the Direction of General Smallwood who commands at Wilmington, untill some proper Authority shall intervene. With Regard to Virginia & North Carolina, from which we expect very great Assistance the Assemblies having lately adjourned, & their vast Extent of Dominion rendering it extreamly difficult to diffuse the necessary Information & Powers we have concluded to recommend to Congress to make Use of Col. Baylors Services. His Judgment in Horses, Knowledge of the Country, Fortune, & Character are such as induce the fullest Confidence, & more especially as his own military Character & Interest are so intimately connected with a faithful & honourable Discharge of the Trust. It is proposed to furnish him from the Treasury with 50,000 Dollars or more if it can be spared, & to enable him for the Remainder to receive from the Loan Officer of Virginia from Time to Time Certificates the Appropriation to be accounted with him when the Business is completed. With due Attention & Accuracy we think the Mode may be so guarded that the Publick will be exposed to no other Danger than that of the Loss of the Interest Money on the Certificates while on Hand, & even   against this if it should be thought of sufficient Consequence, we conceive a Provision may be made. Upon the whole we beg Leave to assure you, Sir, that our Determinations have been the Result of much Deliberation & there has been no Subject on which we have had greater Embarasments. We flatter ourselves that when we have an Oppy. of laying our Reasons more largely before Congress we shall be able to remove any Doubts which may arise of the Propriety of the Mode we have adopted, & be favoured with your full Approbation.(2)  We must refer you to Col. Baylor for a particular State of the Cavalry at present who will answer such Inquiries as may be thought necessary.  We are with the greatest Respect & Regard.

  My dear Friend Reading March 5th 1778 ......(1) I should imagine my dear Friend, you can be no Stranger to the present critical Situation of our Army, and the late Embarassment which the Ignorance and Faction of a thin C____so have thrown in the Way of forming Magazines for the Army. The Consequences will in my Opinion, occasion its Dissolution very Shortly unless both they, and the State of Penna. cease to interfere with the Military Departments. This Circumstance, the Necessity of attending to our Finances, in order to supply the Exegencies of the next Campaign, and the means for bringing a force into the Field, and introducing in it, Discipline, and a Spirit of Enterprise call for the immediate Attention of every Lover of his Country, and particular[l]y of you who (without Flattery which I abhor) possess Talents to serve it at this Juncture, and whose Connection, with a State which is likely to be made a sacrifice of, demand in a peculiar degree all your Exertions. Let me my dear Sir conjure you to attend Congress on the Return of the Committee from Camp. I am sensible private Convenience cannot operate upon your mind at this Crisis, provided you have a Prospect of being useful. Mr. Lee writes me from Congress that several members are daily Expected.(2) Mr. Hancock will be there in a few days,(3) and if my Presence can induce you, I will after I have secured my Baggage at Coryell's Ferry (for w'h I set out this day) return and stay one month. Perhaps my dear Friend, the Joint Exertions of some [of] us may save our Country, and revive the Expiring Reputation of Congress, at least it is our Duty to try it.  I write in a great hurry, and in much anxiety of mind: which must plead my excuse for Incorrectness. Let me know by a letter to Reading whether you will attend Congress; if you do I will immediately pro- MARCH 5, 1778  ceed to Manheim on my Return from Coryell's (4) and go with you. Write to Colo. Jos Reid to attend I am sure that his and your Presence will give a Right Turn to the Votes of Pensilvania and Delawar without which the endeavors of the other States will be useless. God bless you and your Family to whom I beg to be particularly remembered. Wm. Duer  [P.S.] This Letter will be delivered to you by Dr. Stringer of Albany an Acquaintance of mine whom I take the Liberty of recommending to your attention. W.D.  ""

  Sir York Town March 6th. 1778. Col. Samuel Smith arrived here yesterday and acquainted me with the difficulty he met with in the recruiting Service, for the want of the continental Bounty. Upon his solicitation and the prospect of advancing the public Service, I have procured from Congress ten thousand Dollars to be transmitted to you, to be distributed in such proportion among the recruiting officers as you may judge most proper.(1) Col Smith has undertaken the carriage of this money, which I hope you will receive in a few Days. It is the earnest request of Congress that the Battalions from each state, should be filled up as  MARCH 6, 1778  early this spring as possible. Maryland I hope will not be backward. The draught of the Militia recommended by Congress I fear will meet with many obsticles in the Legislature. Should that measure fail, I am at a loss to discover what expedient can be fallen upon. The Expedition into Canada is suspended. Genl. Burgoyne and two of his officers upon his earnest request to Congress is permitted to embark for England.

  Sir York Town. 6th March 1778. I feel myself very happy Dear General upon reflecting that the Letter which I had the honour of writing yesterday has nearly anticipated the necessary answers to your Excellency's favor of the 23d Febry which I am honoured with this afternoon (1)-had not Major Brice been detained by the Board of War my said Letter would have been one day's Journey advanced. Were I to attempt an intimation of the public opinion of Your Excellency, the whole would end in repetition of what is contained in my last.(2) I may nevertheless add by way of anecdote the remark of a Sensible candid Man, when he had heard your Letter of the 20th Febry read. \""I,\"" said he, \""was averse to this Irruption into Canada not because I thought badly of the scheme but because I feared the Marquis being a Young Man full of Fire would have impetuously rushed our Soldiers into too much danger-but his present conduct convinces me he is wise & discreet as well as brave, I now esteem him a worthy valuable Officer.\"" Once more, be assured you have gained great reputation in this Country & that there is not the Smallest ground for your apprehensions of the contrary.  I know not how to account for the Ideas of those who planned & announced the intended Expedition, it is probable if they are ever called upon they will be at as great a loss in that respect as I am, a MARCH 6, 1778  Subject this, which I wish not to dwell upon. With regard to you Sir, it is clearly evident, that the part which Your Excellency has acted will be known throughout America & spoken of with applause. I dare not predict the Sentiments of Congress respecting a seperate Command, however, I am persuaded every Individual holds you equal to the trust. If you are pleased to propose an eligible plan I may say with confidence it will receive a respectful consideration & tis my private sentiment there will be little hesitation upon availing the public of your Excellency's offers of service.  I submit to you Sir, in such Case, the propriety of corresponding directly with General Washington & procuring his opinion to be transmitted to Congress & also with General Gates as an Officer & a patriot not as part of the Board of War.  I am sensible of the distress the Northern department has been in from a want of Money, of late there have been large remittances & such further sum will immediately follow as the Treasury Board assure me will afford complete relief. If we all followed your Excellency's example & attended business at all hours until it was finished our affairs would be in much better plight than they are.  I do not know who promised Monsr. Failly a Colonel's Commission, I know Congress refused him one, altho' he applied under the strongest recommendation from General Gates. I cannot, even with Mr. Brice's aid, decipher the name coupled with that of Monsr. \""Failly. \""(3)  If it shall be determined that your Excellency shall remain in the Northern department it will become necessary in a proper part of some one of Your Letters to Congress to require Blank Commissions.  When a proper opening invites, I shall with great pleasure intimate Your Excellency's attention to the Interests of these States demonstrated in pledging your own in Support of the public Credit,(4) which I am persuaded will be gratefully received & acknowledged.  I have ordered 6000 Dollars of my own funds to be packeted & delivered to Major Brice for which I have taken his Rect. to deliver the same to your Excellency.  I shall put that Gentleman in the way to enquire the course of Exchange in Lancaster. If he finds it at 400 per Cent or upwards Bills for about the value of One Hundred Louis d'or each set may be transmitted & made payable to me. I will endorse them to the purchasers-there ought to be at least five Bills to a set.  Major Brice will inform Your Excellency how closely I am confined to this Table at all intervals from personal attendance in Congress & plead an excuse for all my errors & omissions.  I am just closing dispatches for Leiut General Burgoyne who having found a pen capable of writing Congress properly has obtained leave to embark himself & family for Great Britain. I will in a few   days transmit to your Excellency the particulars of this negotiation. At present I am obliged to conclude, which permit me to do by repeating that I am with the most Sincere & respectful regard & attachment, Sir, Your Exsy's ob'liged & Obt. Servt.  P.S. I have this moment a hint given me that the Board of War mean to recommend the recall of your Excellency & General deKalb to join General Washington & that General Conway will remain where he is-- -do not Dear Marquis suffer this to discompose you.(5)  I shall expect---I was going to say---that Congress will well weigh this point---but that Inst. General Gates came in, I put the question to him, he says it is intended to make it agreeable to your Excellency because there is no Command yonder worthy of you.  ""

Mr. Francy's business was taken up last evening.(2) The Committee reported that all the Consignments should be made to Hortalez & Co. and a Contract made with their House for large supplies in future.

  Dear Sir York Town 7th March 1778. You may remember the anxiety which I expressed upon hearing of the Portuguese Vessel being carried into Boston as prize, neither you nor I knew then who were Owners of the Captor, I am sure I did not. Congress two days ago received a Memorial on that affair from the Honorable Robt. Morris Esqr. which exhibits after much candid narration, a Prayer, \""that Congress will cause a fair & public Sale to be made of the Vessel & her Cargo, that the charge & expense arising on the Sale be paid & the remainder or Net Proceed be invested in Loan Office Certificates bearing Interest for the Benefit of the true & Lawful proprietors of said Vessel & Cargo.\""(1)  The Ideas of the Memorialist are, that from this very partial restitution of original property-\""The original Owners will obtain JUSTICE & REPARATION,\"" in which from the prejudice of my Education I have the misfortune to differ extremely.  That \""the Owners of the Phoenix will be relieved of all their difficulties.\"" This sentiment precisely accords with my own, but unfortunately I cannot from any consideration unite with any set of Men in an attempt to dupe Congress into a participation of the Crimes or follies of those good Owners. Then closes the pious peroration- \""thus, the National Fate & Credit of these Infant States will remain MARCH 7, 1778  Inviolate.\"" Had this been intimated by any Man of less understanding & Virtue than the Memorialist I should have been prompted to pronounce it-\""Matchless impudence & Ignorance.\"" Now I suspend a sentence.  This Phoenix Memorial is however Committed to five & had pre-engaged strong Advocates.  The Memorialist altogether pleads ignorance of the orders given to seize Portugueze Vessels (2) & adds his renunciation of the Act sometime after the Vessel arrived at Boston. These might have made a different impression upon my mind, had it not been hardened by a retrospection to three or four antecedent circumstances k by the present definition of Private \""Justice & Reparation\"" And of public \""National Faitl & Credit.\"" I now perceive these calling aloud for a thorollgll Investigation of the (Crime committed, & that it is necessary if the Laws are defective for punishing Pirates & the prompters of Pirates that we ought by doing complete Justice to the Injured Original Owners, & by affixing a Public Stigma upon the Offenders, display to the World that we entertain a just sense of, S; that we are determined to keep Inviolate \""the National Faith & Credit of these Infant States.\""  I have spoken these things freely Sir, in the confidence which you have heretofore been pleased to vest in me. This is a public matter & will be followed with great consequences, it is in the Power of the People R: tis their Duty by wise determinations to draw them to contribute to, I should say to establish the Honour of the American Union, without regard to private considerations.  I am to request of you Sir if the Proceedings in Admiralty are not very prolix to obtain a Copy of & transmit them by the bearer hereof who is furnished with Money to pay the Office Fees & I shall flatter my self with hopes of your sentiments in addition.

I spoke again this morning to General Gates on the subject of recalling Your Excellency to General Washington's Army & although we differed in opinion I really beleive he means well. However when the recommendation came before Congress, I could not consistently  MARCH 7, 1778  with honour & Love to my Country, forbear intreating Congress to hear my Sentiments. I marked out the good your Excellency was performing in the Northern department & the effect which an Order of recall from the Board of War, might have. The House agreed to postpone the Consideration of that Report & nothing will be done until we hear from Your Excellency.(1)  When Your Excellency writes to Congress You will certainly take no notice of the above. You may ask us how you are to be disposed of & so forth, in which Your Excellency needs no hint or information from me. Permit me to intreat you Sir, if you speak of or refer to the Letter of the 20th Febry, avoid disclosing that kind of resentment which may bring on disagreeable altercation.(2) I dread the Consequences of keeping up the flame of party by disputes among ourselves & so far as I feel myself affected or affronted I am willing to make a sacrifice to peace by passing quietly over the bagatelle. If there was any design in the forestalling that Letter, Major Brice has said enough to inflict ample punishment upon the offender. The dread of being detected & brought to light will be no small degree of punishment.  The stream of Tallow Candle which just now fell on the paper will show your Excellency that I am writing when many other people are fast a sleep or otherwise amusing themselves in Bed & Upon my honor I have not time to Copy again. I know Your Excellency's goodness will accept of a sincere inclination to wait on you, in atonement for these imperfections.  Your Excellency desired to have News Papers. I may have some to send by the next Messenger, some five or six days hence, at present I am without any. I do not account the inclosed York Print to be a news paper.

General's & the Commissary of provisions departments that the payment of those Accounts must be for sometime postponed;(2) It may be necessary to inform you that Congress has lately passed a Resolve, that all the States from New Hampshire to Virginia exhibit their accounts relative to prisoners of War on or before the 15th day of April next, on failure, to be excluded, from payment,(3) this Resolution has been sent out to the several Governors by Express; The two last articles charged in your Account, has the appearance of Abitary enties and may require an explanation, this I hint at for your government, when you furnish an account of such articles as were omitted in the former.  The Northern Expedition under the Marquis de Fiette, is by Congress deemed impracticable, therefore set aside.  By a private letter received yesterday from Mr. Clement Biddle a Commissary, we are informed, that Genl. [Wayne] who went over to the Jerseys with a party in order to distroy the forage engaged a party of the British light Infantry whom he totaly routed, and the major part of them were killed or taken prisoners.  I herewith send you a pamphlet,(4) reprinted at Lancaster, together with this days Pensylvania Gazette for your perusal having nothing more material to add but that I am still the only member here representing our State.  I have the honor to be with great respect, Your most Obedient & Humble Servant, Fra Lewis  ""

  Dear Sir (1) [March 8? 1778] (2) A close Attention to our Business & some Engagements abroad have hitherto prevented my answering your Favour of the 25 February. Nothing could give me more Pleasure (because I am sure it would redound to the Honour of the State & the common Interest) to have its Powers vigorously & effectually exerted in every Thing that respects the Supply & Accomodation of the Army. My Opinion was against its taking this Position, because I feared the Difficulties which have ensued. But the great Apprehensions & Anxieties of the People to which so great a Regard was shewn as to detain the Army on this Spot seem to me to have been improperly expressed, if the utmost Attention is not shewn to render their Situation supportable; comfortable it can never be. The Troops certainly have a Claim upon the Authority of this State & I know no Circumstances more likely to prove fatal to this Government than to press so earnestly for the Cantonment of the Army here & then to fail in its Attempts to furnish the necessary Supplies. The General & many others are very sensible that the Operations of the State have been enfeebled & frustrated by the Interference of Officers in various Departments who have made their military Power an Instrument of Offence against the State. They are therefore not only convinced of the Propriety but wish the Powers of the State to [be] fairly tried & if they shall be found in all ordinary Cases equal to the Demands I believe the most effectual Measures will ever be taken to repress either the malevolent or ambitious Procedures of any of its Enemies so far as they are attempted under the Colour of military Authority. The Presidt. very properly transmitted to the General a Copy of Mr. Young's letter on the Transaction mentioned in your Letter. We do not at present hear of any Scarcity of Provisions in Camp, but we only live as the vulgar say from Hand to Mouth. The Affair of the Waggons mentioned in my last was much exaggerated. The Desire some Persons have to avail themselves of every Circumstance unfavourable to the State led them to speak much larger than the Truth would admit. There were but a few Horses & only one or two Men drowned by their Rashness & Folly. We now have a Body of Continental Troops posted from Barron Hill as far as your Place which keeps that Country in some State of Security & has very much broke the Intercourse which notwithstanding the Risque of Horses & corporal Punishment the vile & disafected still persisted in. The Fellow apprehended on Justice Knox's Account was executed at Bartholemew's Tavern & left hanging as an Example to other Offenders of the same kind-he acknowledged the Justice of his Sentence & hoped his Fate would be a Warning to others. I was very apprehensive he would have escaped from the Lenity of our Officers MARCH 8, 1778  but the Committee remonstrated to [them] so strongly upon the Subject that I believe he was executed by the General's special Authority. Two men of the same Gang will soon share the same Fate as also a Person apprehended for purchasing Horses for the British Army.  The Success of the Party at Newtown in Bucks was very Alarming & occasioned a very general Inquiry wllere Lacy was; as we do not know precisely his Strength & Situation in other Respects we ought not to censure what perhaps on a Knowledge of all Circumstances we should approve. But I think one Thing is clear that the publick desire no Benefit from his Command & therefore I hope it is not attended with any Expence. Pray what do you design to do with the Galley Men. They are very burthensome wllere they are, k from all Accounts there is very little Prospect of getting any Service from them. And at all Events they ought not to be a State Charge any more than the Defence of Hudsons River, our Circumstances now rendering them of little other Value than to preserve the Communication of the Delaware; in every other Point of View they are now of more Consequence to New Jersey than Pennsylvania. From Gen. Howes State of the Defence of the River they did very little Damage to the British Shipping.  The Congress have now passed a Resolve comprehending fully the Case of these Kidnappers.(3)  The Commissioners for Exchange were to have met the 10th Instt. but some Circumstances have happened which I believe will postpone it. I saw the Generals Letter making handsome Mention of your Son,(4) but no Notice was taken of him in the Answer or in any Letter since.  We have engaged Col. Cox in the publick Service upon Terms that we think liberal to both but from the long Delay of the Answer from Congress I very much fear it does not go on smoothly there. We shall I believe return to York Town next Week at least some of the Gentlemen, it being necessary that one should stay to receive the return Expresses & forward the Dispatches. This I suppose will fall to my Share. However I mean to go up to Congress as soon as possible tho the Circumstances of my Family will not admit of my staying long. I have been lucky in getting a very good House at Fleming Town New Jersey about 40 Miles from this, & 27 from Trenton 12 Miles from the Delaware in a pleasant healthy Country. Mr. Cox & Mr. Pettit will be in the Neighbourhood & I have Reason to think you might also be accomodated if you are not fully resolved upon Bohemia. If you relish it let me know & I will write up to my Friend in that Country.  Pray make my Complimts. to the Gentlemen of my Acquaintance with you & believe Me with real Regard, D Sir, Your Affect.

Cox first Assistt. & Charles Pettit second.(5) The latter has been brought in contrary to my Inclination, but there was no getting Cox without him. He would not engage his Character & Fortune without some suitable Character in whom he could confide to manage the Books & Accounts. I hope & believe this Choice will be acceptable to New Jersey & this State where the Operations are most likely to be.  ""

5014,dg009192,1778,Committee at Camp to George Washington,"""Committee at Camp to George Washington
  Sir [March 9? 1778] (1) The Committee at Moor Hall have employed such Time as they could spare from many Interruptions this Morning in a Conference upon the very important Subject of the Cartel now about to be established. And altho they may not be (and probably are not) so well acquainted with some Facts as other Gentlemen, and having perhaps different Feelings upon the Subject may view the same object in a different Point of Light, yet they conceive that the Ideas of Citizens may not be quite useless to Gentlemen of the Army now about to determine on the dearest Rights of Citizens at least of unfortunate MARCH 9, 1778  ones. Neither will it be improper that as Members of Congress they should endeavor to explain and to vindicate some Resolutions of Congress which must in the Course of this Business become Matter of Debate and which (in the Opinion of some Gentlemen not improperly) have been already stigmatized as cruel and unjust.(2) Your Excellency's Request superadded to these Considerations leads the Committee to go into the Matter a little at large, a Measure which on so important a Transaction their Duty seems to require.  Without entering into the Deduction of an historical Train of Facts we shall simply refer to those which apply to particular Propositions but it appears to us absolutely necessary to investigate if possible the precise Situation which the contracting Parties stand in as well absolutely as relatively to each other. For since no Fact can be clearer than this that Interest alone (and not Principles of Justice or Humanity) governs Men on such Occasions it becomes necessary to know our Interest and theirs which can alone be collected from such Situations.  And here because it frequently happens that Soldiers particularly young Soldiers are dazzled with Misconceived or ill applied Notions of Honor it may be well to step a little on one Side and explain our Sentiments Honor mutually pledged appears to the Committee to be the ostensible Security of Compacts prompted and complied with for mutual Ease, Security or Advantage. The Current of History will shew us that this Security is for the most Part only ostensible and were History silent our own melancholy Experience in the present War after the first Cartel settled will evince the Truth of the Observation at least as far as the Business before us requires. But allowing that it were more than ostensible, allow it to be real, we cannot conceive that it hath any Thing to do with adjusting the Terms of the Compact. It is in publick what Honesty is in private Transactions and tho Honesty obliges a Man to pay what he owes, it hardly obliges a Man to run in Debt.  The Enemy possessing Quebec, Halifax, Rhode Island, New York, Philadelphia & Florida are distressed for Men to make a proper Defence at these several Places in the Begining of the ensuing Campaign, they being at present ignorant where the Storm which they suppose to be collecting will fall, and fully convinced that the Loss of any capital Post will do them more essential Injury than the Failure of an Expedition or a considerable Defeat. Besides this it is with Difficulty they can procure Subsistence for their present Force in America and their Supplies of Money begin to run low. They are therefore much affected by the Resolutions of Congress compelling them to send Provision in Specie or pay for it in hard Money at a par Exchange.  Having mentioned these Resolutions it is not amiss to attempt to  clear them from the Imputation of Inequity. And first it must be observed that in every Compact between beligerent Powers to ascertain Money Matters Recourse must be had to a tertium interveniens or middle Rate, neither Party being willing to trust the Honesty of the other seeing that if he did, that other by exercising the allowed Sovereignty of a State might raise or lower the current Coin so as to suit his own Convenience according to the Circumstances and Exigencies which might arise. A fortiori on the present Occasion is such Precaution necessary to us the Value of whose Money is from the Nature of the Case more fluctuating than that of other Nations. Besides which the Enemy deny that it is Money and have not only the Will but in a great Measure the Power too of governing its Value and further have exerted themselves to depreciate it by Methods totally unprecedented among honest Men. If then it were agreed that both Sides should pay for the Subsistence of Prisoners in the Money of the respective Countries, what would be the Consequence but that our Resources must be entirely exhausted in maintaining our Enemies and this by Reason of their Knavery and our Folly. Besides this it would be declaring upon the very Face of the Transaction that our Money is not worth a Quarter of what it is uttered for by Congress, which is the next Step to making it worth nothing at all. With a View to these Inconveniences Congress fix the Medium to be in Spanish Milled Dollars worth each one paper Dollar of the Currency of these States & 4/6 Sterling. Nor does the Objection of Inequity lie so strongly as Gentlemen suppose even in their own favorite Point of View, for it is permitted to them to pay in Specie; & if they can do it cheaper and more conveniently than in Gold they certainly will, but the Fact is their Provision costs them more than ours even on this inequitable Exchange as it is called and we shall have to pay for so much as is furnished to our Prisoners according to what it costs them and not as we might have bought it in the Country. Nor shall we be permitted to replace our Deficiency in Provisions unless they happen to want Subsistence. For this we find was the Case at first, and tho the Liberty of sending in Flour and Wheat as they grew short in these Articles was (on that Principle and for their Advantage) extended to an Amount for purchasing other Necessaries Yet even then they by Proclamation obliged us to sell our Wheat at their Price or in other Words to pay for their Commodities just what they pleased. And tho it may be said that this Proclamation applied chiefly or only to their own Territory, yet when it is known (and the Fact is) that the Inhabitants of that Territory never did raise Wheat beyond their own Consumption the slight thin Pretence only exposes their Conduct.  But to return, it is evident that the Interest of the Enemy now calls upon them loudly for an Exchange of Men And therefore it is by no Means a Matter of Surprize that Genl. Howe after having delayed it  so long is from these Circumstances brought to urge an Exchange with such Rapidity.  On the other Hand the Capture of Burgoyne & the Leizure allowed the United States to breathe from the late Exertions will enable them to bring no despicable Force into the Field earlier than the Enemy can be well supported by additional Numbers; besides this, the Maintaining so large a Number of their Prisoners will bring in considerable Supplies of solid Coin while the Liberty which a Principle of Retaliation now fully adopted compels them to allow our Prisoners will enable us to maintain them with comfort among the Enemy whereas if exchanged they would scatter abroad thro the Country and make little or no Addition of Strength to our Army. At the same Time the Want we feel of good Officers and the Sufferings of our Sailors and Citizens call upon us to establish a Cartel. Our Interest therefore is to push the Exchange of Officers, Mariners and Citizens. The Mariners indeed will not be exchanged on the ensuing Conference but must take their Chance upon the great and useful Retaliation which Genl. Howe with great Propriety condemns because it affects his Interest, which was greatly forwarded by rendering American Prisoners so miserable as to disincline them to the Service of their Country if not absolutely forced to abjure it.  The Exchange of Officers will We believe be admitted by the Enemy tho from the Delays affected there and the parole System adopted there is very good Reason to suppose that they will expect great Sacrifices on our Part in the Exchange of Privates and also some Relaxation in the inequitable Demand of Subsistence. But the Exchange of Citizens they will if possible avoid because it is their Interest to render the Acceptance of civil Offices extreemly dangerous since without civil Officers there can be no civil Government and the Enemy have Discernment enough to discover that civil Governments will be a more effectual Bar to their Claim than any Army upon Earth and this for Reasons your Excellency is so fully possessed of that it is needless to run thro the Detail.  Hence it follows that the Exchange of Citizens should be a sine qua non of the Treaty; it should be made the great Corner Stone, Unless the Enemy will (which they will not) agree to carry on the War upon those benevolent Principles which we set them a fair Example of by Releasing all such of their Citizens as fell into our Hands. The next Part of the Treaty should we conceive be the Exchange of Officers, and here as well as in the Exchange of Citizens we ought to insist that former Agreements be complied with on their Part before we take a single Step further in the Business, The great Security of public Faith being a regular & rigid Exaction of the Performance of every Promise on the Part of our Enemies while we have the Power of   compelling Performance which will be the Case so long as we prudently retain their Soldiers in our Hands.  Another Resolution of Congress presents a very considerable Obstacle in the Way of this Exchange and that is a Resolution directing that the Subjects of the several States found in Arms shall be delivered to the States respectively.(3) The Enemy will doubtless expect either a direct or at least an implicative Repeal of this Resolution but as neither the one or the other can be in the Power of the Commissioners would it not be proper either to obtain a Confirmation of their Authority from Congress or else to instruct the Commissioners to insert a general Clause to the following effect viz. \""Provided always that Nothing herein contained shall be construed in any wise to affect any Acts of the British Parliament or Resolutions of the American Congress.\"" But if it shall be thought most adviseable to obtain from Congress a Confirmation of the absolute Power of the Commissioners we then submit to your Excellency the Propriety of directing them to provide that the Troops raised by the Enemy in America shall be last exchanged and also a special Provisoe that nothing in the Articles contained shall be construed to prevent either Party from proceeding judicially against those who by the Event of this Contest shall appear to have been Rebels. The Reason of which Observation is this, that so long as the Troops raised among us are entitled to the Privilege of equal Exchange the Enemy will be enabled to carry on the American War in a great Measure by the Strength of America; besides this it is no small Inducement to interested Men to join them, that at the worst Great Britain will make it an Article to save the Property of her Adherents in America, and altho Prudence may as it probably will lead us to go a great Way in our Compliances to get Rid of a very burthensome War, yet certainly Prudence will now dictate to hold out a Beacon to the wavering in Terrorem.  Should a Cartel take Place then in setling the Terms, great Attention should be paid to the Valuation which both with Regard to civil and military Characters should be made on Republican Principles, that is the Officers should be estimated very low when compared with the Privates whether Citizens or Soldiers, and besides this they should be exchangeable for each other only, that is to say civil Officers for civil Officers, military for military, Citizen for Citizen and Soldier for Soldier. The Reasons of which considering the disproportionate Number of Officers and those too of high Rank among us are too evident to dwell upon.  In adjusting Accounts we cannot but be of Opinion that the full Value of our Money should rigidly be insisted on and before the Ballance is struck it should be agreed how such Ballance is to be paid, for which a Variety of Modes presents itself. If Neither Gold or Paper  will answer (for if they will not acknowledge the legality and Value of our Money they certainly should not be permitted to pay their Debts with it) then it may be proper for the Americans to pay in Wheat and the English in Cloth at limited Prices which would be for the mutual Advantage of both Parties or to establish some other Mode alike in the Power of both to comply with.  The Enemy will probably make a very considerable Demand of Prisoners taken at Fort Washington, but before a Tittle of this is complied with, for the Sake of the Influence it may have on future Transactions the Question must be settled whether Prisoners on Parole are or are not at the Risque of those who grant the Parole and this must be made an Article of the Treaty; for if they are not then when old Prescott dies Lee should be considered as released because upon calling for Prescott he could not come in and therefore the other would not be bound. But if they are then we are not to account for one more of these Men than are now alive. However supposing the former to be the Rule established which we beleive ought to be the Case, then a manifest Distinction is to be taken between the common Accidents of Nature and other Circumstances. For clearly should the Enemy after dismissing Prisoners on Parole waylay them and put them to the Sword We should not be held to redeem them. Again if their Death was rendered equally certain by previously administering Arsenick the Determination ought to be the same. And surely no good Distinction can be taken between Death brought on by a Detention of the Necessaries of Life and an Exhibition of the Principles of Death. If therefore it should appear that these unhappy Men were by hard Treatment so reduced that great Numbers necessarily died we ought not to be held to account for them and a very favorable Opportunity now offers to stickle for these unhappy People to the uttermost, and in order that the Enemy may find it to their Interest to treat Prisoners better in future they should not be suffered to take the least Advantage of their own Wrong. The Commissioners therefore should be directed to estimate the Number of these Prisoners very low and further to start an Objection whether even any of them are to be exchanged. In as much as the Capitulation of Fort Washington was clearly broken and altho it may not be proper to insist on this Matter yet it will be of Use to raise it because in Treaty the Claim of an Adversary should be opposed on every just and honorable Ground since by that Means it may be much lessened if not totally avoided, besides which the only Security for their future good Faith consists in making them pay for their former Iniquities.  Another Claim they may perhaps set up is that of Restitution for the Men taken at the Cedars but on this Occasion the Case of Fort   William Henry last War is so fully in Point that they cannot say much on the Subject.  On the whole Sir We have to intreat that the Commissioners will not suffer a Headlong Desire of releiving the Miseries of our unhappy fellow Countrymen or a blind Attachment to Principles which the Enemy disregard (they having in Fact nothing to do in the making of Treaties) to lead them into a hasty Acquiescence in the Enemy's insidious Proposals for such their Proposals will and indeed ought to be if they would maintain the Character of able Negotiators. But that on the other Hand they will industriously Consider that on a proper Management & Use of the present Opportunity the Rights and Interests of this Country do most materially depend. And we cannot but wish for many Reasons that they may be careful not to interfere with the Resolutions of Congress which may involve in it very disagreable Altercations.  It is true that by insisting on these various Points the Treaty may become intricate and after all the whole Matter fall to the Ground. But if it should, who will suffer most by the Accident. This is a Question which should be maturely weighed because upon a proper answer to it must depend the Steps to be taken on our Part. And at any Rate should the Exchange be ever so desirable the best Way to bring it about will be by an apparent Indifference whether it ever takes Place.  ""

  Dear Colonel, York Town 9th March 1778.  Your esteemed favor came to hand the 6th instant & am extremely sorry there should be the least uncertainty of your returning to your  MARCH 9, 1778  post.(1) I have no doubt but the Committee will pay the greatest attention to your Business & I am certain the Members of Congress in general have a proper Sense of your Services, so that I have the most sanguine Expectations that things will be settled to your Satisfaction. Tis strange the Auditors are not yet arrived at Camp, the Congress expected the business to be entered upon before this time, as Messrs Clarkson & Clark were appointed as long since as Feby the sixth.(2)  I cannot express to you my feelings for the Comfort & support of our little Army, our prospects are gloomy & distressing, but I hope that that virtue which has been tried by suffering will still persevere & that the Congress will be induced to make proper Exertions against our Enemies early this Spring. General Howe must certainly be greatly reduced in Numbers, otherwise you would have heard more of him during the Winter; by some News Papers procured from New York it appears that their reinforcements will be very inconsiderable the next Campaign & there appears to be very great discontents in London & other parts of England.  Lieutenant Wilford Aid de Camp to Genl Burgoyne has been here with a Letter from the General addressed to the President of Congress.(3) It was referred to a Committee who were of Opinion that nothing contained therein was sufficient to induce Congress to recede from their Resolves of the 8th day of January last, respecting the Convention of Saratoga. The General on account of his ill state of health has leave to embark for England, by Rhode Island, or any more expeditious Route, with the Officers of his Family & his Servants. A Parole is to be taken from the General, Colonel Kingston & Doctor Wood.  Lieutt. Wilford requested permission to go into Philadelphia in order to deliver to Genl Howe duplicates of the Papers by him presented to Congress; but this could not be granted, however he was directed to deliver them to the board of War that they might be transmitted to Genl Washington who may send them by a Flag to Philadelphia.  Our distresses in every department for the want of Money have been very great & alarming; the Treasury board heretofore have acted on principles that do not suit the present Exigencies of Affairs. We are now determined to adopt a different Conduct & I think there will be a better supply of Cash in future;(4) I shall be glad if other requisites for the next Campaign can be so easily procured. Like you I have fears for the disaffection & inactivity of this State.  The Treasury board are now employed in drawing up a Report for the Loan Offices for the Year 1778, Ten Millions of Dollars are to be borrowed on this plan-by a Letter just received from Genl Putnam it appears that he thinks it would be proper to have a Loan Office near that Army.(5) If I remember, you was wishing for something of   this kind at your Camp. I should be glad to hear from you on this head soon.  I have lately seen Doctor Shippen, who has desired me to procure for the use of the American Hospitals two Tons of Bowen's Sago Powder.(6) He greatly approves of it & says it should be used in every Part of the Continent. The greatest difficulty will be to get it here, as there is no sending it by Sea. Mr Harnet for upwards a Month past has been very ill in the Gout, he was glad to hear of you. The Compliments & good Wishes of the Ladies await you-& that you may have an happy Interview with your family is the sincere wish of, yours affectionately, Edwd Langworthy  ""

  My dear Freind Baskenridge March 10th. 1778 I received your Letter of the 30th Jany.(1) at Reading where I had stopt for some days in my Way homewards in Expectation of meeting with my Colleague Mr. Philip Livingston who I had reason to expect would have been at that Place about the 8 or 10 Feby. On the Receipt of your Letter, in which you mention that you had wrote to Morris on a Matter of the utmost Importance to our State,(2) desiring me to open it in Case he should be loitering on the Road, I determined notwithstanding a very Weak State both of Body and Mind to return to Congress at York Town (where the Letter for Morris was stopt) in order to attend to its Contents, in Case I should not find Mr. P. Livingston at this Place, for which I immediately set out. Being disappointed in my Expectation I am just going to set out for Congress (and in Case Mr. Morris should not have returned thither from Camp (where he has been for five weeks on a Come. for reforming the Army) I shall open the Letter and attend to the Matters you recommend. At the Same Time, my dear Freind, It is a Duty which I owe myself to inform you, and by your Means, my Freinds in the Governt. of our State, that I cannot possibly stay there more than three Weeks. It is now near two Years since I quitted home, during which Time I have not paid the least Attention to my private Affairs, which are in the Utmost Confusion-and if not speedily attended to may involve me in Difficulties injurious in the highest degree both to my Fortune and Reputation, especially in matters which I transacted for the Public.  Independant of this Consideration my Health is much shattered by an Intermitting Fever which has been hanging upon me during the Course of last Summer and Fall, and my Mind much Impair'd by a Close Attention to Business, and by an inexpressible anxiety which I cannot help feeling for the State of our Public Affairs which I am sorry to tell you in my Opinion (and I think I am not of a desponding [cast?]) wear a most unpromising Aspect. It would take MARCH 10, 1778  Portrait of William Duer  a Volume to point out the Various Causes to which in my Judgment this is to be imputed, did I think it prudent to enter into a Detail. Suffice it to say, that the Parties prevailing in our Army, and the want of Foresight, and Attention to Business in Congress (to say no More) are the principal Sources from whence Various and Alarming Evils have Arisen. Notwithstanding Common Sense must have convinced any but Fools that betwixt the Close of One Campaign, and the Opening of another, would be the great Period of public Business, a Number of Gentlemen acquainted with the Business of Congress returnd to their homes, and left a few (and very few) Men of Business and real Patriotism to struggle against Men actuated by contracted State Politicks, and render'd impenetrable to all the Efforts of Reason by the Superlative Dint of stupidity. This my dear Freind is no Exaggerated Picture; judge then what have been my Feelings from what your own would be in such a Case.  Mr. Morris was only two or three Days at York before he went to Camp on the Business I mentioned. I wish he had been there longer that he might have a greater Oppertunity than I am sure he has had of judging of the Character of Parties in the Army, and the Views of Individuals in Congress. I am afraid (nay I am certain) he does not sufficiently know this which will involve the Public in my Opinion in a greater Labyrinth of Evils than we are in at present. You know he is like the Elephant in War often times more destructive to his Freinds than his Antagonists.  I am confident from a close Attention which I have paid to the Conduct of Individuals both in the Army and Congress for more than 10 Months past that I am pretty well Master, of their public Character and Intentions, and I may venture to say that notwithstanding Parties run pretty high in the Army, from which have flowed an Inactive Campaign, a Relaxation of Discipline, and all its Concomitant Evils, that a Wise and Virtuous Body could turn even these Parties to Advantage during the Course of the present Year, but this I am afraid will not [be] the Case. I shall esteem it my Duty however to make one last Effort on my Return to Congress, where I am in hopes Mr. Robert Morris and some other Men of Business and Integrity will be on my Return. With this Reinforcement something may perhaps be done to alter the present sickly state of public Affairs.  I enclose a Letter to Genl. Schuyler which you will oblige me in forwarding; likewise one for my Clerk Mr. Archibald Stewart,(3) whom I beleive you will find at Poughkepsie; if he is not there, be kind enough to make Enquiry after him, and to convey this Letter to him; which materially concerns my private affairs. God bless you my dear Freind, and all your Connections, and beleive me though a remiss Correspondent, Your very Sincere and affectionate Freind. Ask your self whether they are incompatible Characters. Wm Duer  [P.S.] The Hurry I am in has made me write in Hieroglyphics; I hope you will be able to expound them.  ""

Hope no one this year will stand upon Terms but join heart & hand for his Country. Am with Sincere Esteem Yr Hle Servt, Elipht Dyer  ""

  Dear Sir, York Town March 10th 1778 I receivd your kind favour per Mr Torry, and am really much Oblidged to you for the repeated favour of your Correspondence MARCH 10, 1778  since you left this place. Mr Trumbull being sick have been deprived of that repeated Intelligence I Used to have from him of my family, & sincerely rejoice that a kind Providence has so far restored him to health but yet much fear for his full recovery, as the Symptoms of his disorder appear to me of a dangerous kind, but hope for the best. Our Diminished Army have lay Very quiet this winter, the detachments from the enemy have ravaged the Country round about them & lately came out upwards of twenty miles and carried off unmolested 130 head of fine Cattle sent by Coll Champion Between Delaware & Schuylkill (1) & it has been with the greatest difficulty that our Army have been supplied from day to day. Indeed we have no fear for Flower in the Country, but the army has been much distressed for the want of forrage. Their Waggon horses many dying for want of food & the difficulty to procure Waggons has much distressed the Army & we are still in great Anxiety how to supply them with meat till the summer fed cattle may relieve them, especially as we wish for a large reinforcement as early in the spring as possible to take the first advantage to break up Hows Army, before he can be reinforced, which requires every Exertion of every State. The Scarcity of Provisions, of forrage, of carriage, the excessive prices, our exhausted finances & every Circumstance attending our affairs instead of discouraging ought to Animate us to a more earnest, early, spirited, & most Vigorous Exertion. Congress are doing all they can, they are diligent & attentive & we seem very Quiet since D____r (2) went away. We have called upon & requested the Govrs & Councils of the several States to give all their aid & assistance in procuring necessaries, much in the same form as we had Govr Trumbull & his Council, & hope it may have a good Effect. We have regulated the Qr Master Department, appointed by Recommendation of Genll Washington & our Comtee at head Quarters, Genll Green, Major Cox & one Mr Pettit of the Jerseys to head the Various branches of that Department but I fear we have not persued the best plan for the purpose. We have been waiting for the Arrival of Coll Wadsworth to make a new plan & regulation in the Commissy Department to form it so as to be Agreable to him, but at present are disappointed, the principal and main business of Jones the Express was to carry letter to him, tho we had some letters for Boston. Am surprised at his failure in delivering the letters by which means are Obliged to proceed in our plan without his advice, but believe if Gain will Tempt him we shall put it on as favorable a footing as he could desire, beside he will have the Appointment of all to Act under him. I hope you will forward him here with all speed, all the purchases will be on Commissions as also his pay. Am rather sorry our Assembly when they passed the Regulating Act did not postpone the time for its taking effect till, at least till they were Informed the other States came into it. The operation must be   suspended till abt middle June at least as to price of fat beef. I conclude the president has sent the resolution for building barracks in Connecticut which passd some time agoe, as also a resolution Authorising the Executive of every State to suspend all Continental officers behaving unworthily &c.(3) The news of Burgoynes defeat & surrendry gave a Shock to the Parliament house but resumd Courage after a few days & are determind to attack us with redoubled Vigor the coming season, hope we may be too soon for them & that the Almighty may deliver us, have now 6 or 8 letters to write & must conclude by assuring you that I am with sincere Esteem & regard Yr Hb Servt,  Elipht Dyer [P.S.] The Disturber, I mean B____ke (4) has just come after Inducing Nth C____na to dissent from Confederation [or?] a great part of it, is now in Congress to the Universal sorrow & of every member.  Soon after I finishd my letter Brown Arrivd with yours of the 4th Instant. Congress wish our Assembly had lengthned out the time of the regulating Act taking Effect at least with respect to Beef till the middle of June & have by their resolve recommended it to the Consideration of our Assembly.(5) Champion must be supplied or our Army will fail. It is Impossible to supply them wholly from the Southard. We have not received Accounts from the other States whether they have adopted the report of the Comtee regulating prices. Yrs,  E D Be assured there is not the most distant thought of removing Genll Washington, nor ever an expression in Congress looking that way, is a Tory lye from the beginning.  ""

  Dear Sir York Town March 10th. 1778. Upon the representation of Col. Samuel Smith who was here last Week, I obtained from Congress ten thousand Dollars for the recruiting Service. I sent it by him to you, and I expect you have received it before this Time. If that Sum will not do, I beg you will be kind enough to acquaint me.  I am informed the Committee of Congress at Camp have among other States, applied to the State of Maryland for the purchase of a Number Horses for the purpose of forming a Body of light Cavalry.(1) If you should approve of the plan or should you lay it before the Assembly, and it is adopted by them; I trust some estimate of the expence will be made that the money may be forwarded from this place. Should the recruiting service require a greater number of Dollars I believe they may be had.  I believe you need not intertain any fears of the expedition against Canada going forword. The advanced Season of the year, and the feeble preparations in that department have effectually put an end to it. I most cordially join with you in opinion, that it is the interest as well as the true policy of this country to collect their force to a single point by strengthening the hands of Genl. Washington. But this I fear will not be the case. It is the opinion of some, and they have weight with a certain class of Men, that the whole force of the Enemy will be turned towards the East the next campain. A military Gentleman in high office supports this opinion. Should it prevail in Congress I think it will injure the Middle States in a high degree, as well as the common cause at large. The Virginia Frigate is ordered to make another attempt; if she fails the measure you propose I expect will be adopted.(2) Virginia will this afternoon offer to ratify the confederation. No other state is prepared. I shall take this opportunity of stating the objections to it, from Maryland, tho I have little hopes of this matter being soon determined. I fear it never will in our favour.  We had intelligence last night of one of our armed vessels in the Delaware, near Cristeen having taken two Ships and a small sloop of war. We have not heard the Cargoes. I beleive this news may be relied on.  Enclosed you have some of the Debates of the House of Lords and Commons. They will amuse you. Twenty thousand additional Troops for the Service of 1778 is voted without a division.  With great regard I am sir your most obedt. and very hble. Servt. J Henry Junr.  ""

  Dear Sir,(1) 10th March 1778. I am sorry you have not enabled me to acknowledge the Receipt of a single Line from my Neighbor Zahn since we parted in June last. Although I am not under the dominion of a very anxious mind & that I repose the utmost confidence in your judgement as a Planter & attention as an Attorney & Friend, yet from various considerations it would have given me pleasure to have received an account from yourself, reflective & prospective, of affairs at Mount Tacitus. Persuaded as I am that every thing is going forward under your usual good management, you will nevertheless admit, that a desire of knowing whether we can afford to expend & to give fifty or Five hundred, is not a criminal passion-especially in a Man who while his usual income is greatly straightned is exposed to such exorbitant charges for common, I should say, very mean subsistence as are Sufficient to impoverish a very large Estate. Only think of paying £11.7.6. Carolina Money for a pair of shoes, Negro shoes, for George, & articles in proportion .  Our Neighbor the Revd. Mr. Turquand is now in York Town transacting business for the Society at Red Stone with whom he is connected,(2) he informs me the families are all pretty well except the old Gentleman who has lost the little patience he carried from Sante. Poor old man he discards his business with me in this part of the World to be quite of a different nature from that he used to talk of in the piaza, he has found it necessary to accept of Services from me, when I might not only have witheld them, but have put him to great inconvenience. To do him acts of kindness when the opportunity was fair, gave me the most pleasure & satisfaction.  Mr. Turquand desires his Compliments.  This will probably be delivered to you by Mr. John Christian Senf an ingenious, sensible, Young Gentleman, who in the last summers Campaign was taken prisoner by General Gates's Troops. He had been a Lieutenant Engineer under General . Sometime after he had been Captured, he determined to abandon the infamous Cause into which his Prince had plunged him without his own consent, & to become an Inhabitant & Citizen among a free people. General Gates was so well pleased with his whole behavior as to give him the  MARCH 10, 1778  Rank of Captain of Engineers & to recommend him strongly to me. I have for several reasons which this Gentleman will explain to you if you converse together, advised him to seek his fortune in the Southern Climates.(3) If he has health & a few friends I am of opinion he will find it there. He is an excellent draughtsman & equal to every kind of surveying business. These with other qualifications which he is possessed of, will enable him to go through the first efforts in a new Country with tolerable ease; & after a little experience he will be competent to helping himself, in the meantime I request all my freinds to shew him countenance. Perhaps we may soon employ Capt. Senf if he does not obtain better business to resurvey Mount Tacitus. Your Civilities to him will not be thrown away.  I say nothing of my private affairs under your direction being confident of your friendly attention in every respect & flattering my self with an assurance of hearing from you very soon.  General Burgoyne having learned to address Congress in a becoming Stile & having earnestly requested leave to go to England for his health & for the vindication of his conduct Congress have consented.  Our public affairs in general are not in so good a train as I could wish, but every defect is owing to a Langour in the States. Consider Sir, what is the Cause & what may be the consequence, of Congress's being reduced to the number of 13 to 17 Members. The States are off their Guard & fallen a Sleep--- was not our Enemies as weak as our selves we should be ruined, but they may make a grand effort & destroy us. It is our duty to make a great Stroke & drive them out. This might easily be done were we half so animated as we pretended to be in 1775.  You will smile when I inform you I have granted Many Commissions for Cruizing on the Delaware, Cheesapeck Bay & even on the Ohio & Mississipy. On the Delaware many valuable prizes have been made, I have just now an Account that four of our Armed Boats had taken two ships & an Armed Schooner & were in pursuit of several more who were coming up the River. The Men of War had retired for the Winter to Rhode Island. The Enemy lately lost near New York in a Snow Storm two Frigates & several Armed Vessels. From the King of Englands speech to His Parliament & their Answer & debates I think it would not be very hazardous to prophesy that terms of accomodation will soon be offered. I am for preparing every means in readiness for an early blow as the best posture we can be found in for receiving propositions for peace.  I am with very great regard.  ""

  My dear Sir March 10th. 1778. It was mortifying to hear the Delegates from several states this day assert that they were instructed respecting the Confederation, while the two Cyphers from Massachusetts could produce nothing. Our State is expected to be found in the Fore-front upon such Occasions. I think the determination of the States upon this point must have a great effect upon the ensuing Campaign and I therefore wish to hear from our Assembly.(1)  I think it not amiss to say that whenever Congress sends a Recommendation to the States its but right & fit that regular public Returns should be made whether the Recommendations are fully or partially complied with or rejected. How otherwise can future plans be properly laid, or the general continental works carried on? Connecticutt, modest Connecticutt is exemplary in her attention to the Propriety which I have hinted at. I fear the States are insensible of the Hazard which our Cause runs this Spring for want of an Army early ready for action. The Enemy have been nursing their Horses, preparing Carriages and refreshing the Soldiers, While everyone of these things has been neglected on our part. You had cause to expect a degree of ruin in the Commissary's line, but you hoped the Quartermaster's would be properly attended to. Alas, it is worse conducted than the former. I am suspicious that regulating acts have been attempted for the last time. The States which feeling strong in their own Virtue shall attempt it will be sacrificed by others, which are less virtuous, and can produce easily from history anecdotes against the measures. I think I shall never again consent to such a Remedy even in a desperate Disease.  I have received a long letter from Mr. John Amory upon the subject of his Exile. Mr. Payne forwarded it to me from Providence. I would have you converse with Brother Appleton upon the Subject and tell him to write to me. He was a great Friend to Mr. Amory and knows how things were conducted at the late visit. I am willing the Gentleman should have the fairest chance. But when he addressed  MARCH 10, 1778  his Letter to me he addressed it to one who has resigned Father & Mother, Brothers and Sisters with many Friends male & female. He desires me to put a Memorial into Congress for him, as he was surprized into an Oath of Allegiance which binds his conscience.(2)  ""

At the Rate our Letters usually travel I think it very far from improbable that I may see you as soon as you see my Letter for immediately upon my Arrival at Congress which I hope will be in a few Days I intend to endeavor to procure {an adjournment to Hartford}.(1) This Measure will I trust be attended with very beneficial Effects. It is very advantageous to be in a good Neighbourhood. Mankind are less apt to neglect Things immediately under their Eye. Tis true it may tend to throw Obstructions {into Hudsons River}-but I know many in the World who do not consider this as an Object quite undesirable. Should this my Intention take Place we may immediately and in future have a much freer and readier Communication of Councils which I trust will produce neither public nor private Dis Advantages. You may probably ask why I dislike my present Situation. I answer that I think it in every Respect too remote. I would wish to be within Ken of every Scene of Action from whence you may gather something in Favor of my Curiosity. The greater Part of the People of this Country to their Honor be it spoken are {wicked tories}. They are not of a very active Disposition. Indeed the Propn. of Germans and Quakers cannot well be supposed to be so. The Irish are true Irishmen. When I consider all Things together the State of Things here appears {gloomy} so that there is Room to beleive the State will be cleared of it's Tories. A Set of Scoundrels at the Head of whom are {Gates and Mifflin} are very busy in an Attempt to ruin the {General} of America.(2) I will not promise them Success, but what will surprize you is that they have made a fool of Duer}. This hath been effected by making use of a strong Affection for {foreigners} which has not escaped your Observation. {Profusion} prevails to a very surprizing Degree in all the {public offices}.

Hartley to the board of war on the subject of recruiting his battalion; & the boards letter to Congress on the subject; both which were referred to the delegates of this State.(1) As not to comply with the proposition made might appear an unnecessary obstruction to reinforcing the army on one hand; or on the other a compliance might involve consequences not expected, the delegates advised with the Committee from the state now here, & finally take the liberty of referring to your directions, as they did not conceive themselves authorized to interfere .  The states are severally called upon to raise their old quota of troops. The number of this state regiments is diminished to 10.(2) The supernumerary men are to be transferred to the horse, artillery, & other unconnected corps. Of the 16 Regiments (so called) 9 only are to be kept up; &, I suppose, will be alloted to particular states, & filled up as above. Colo. Hartleys will probably belong to us as its natural connexion. To concur with his proposition, will give him the men more immediately; & allowing him to employ his officers may expedite the recruiting service; perhaps be the means of procuring recruits, either from connection or attachment, which others would not pick up. He has expectations from the borders of Maryland; filled his regiment formerly with quick success, & appears to be sanguine now. With respect to the money he appears to be prudent & cautious. But as we may perhaps not foresee all the effects, or its full connection with the state of Pennsylvania, we beg leave to sollicit your earliest advice & direction, as no time ought to be lost. We beg MARCH 10, 1778  leave only to add that the complement of each battalion is also to be reduced; & that though some states have discountenanced these unconnected regiments, yet some others have given them the benefit of their state bounties.

  My Dear Sir, 11th March 1778. Sympathize with me when I complain that near four Months have elapsed since the date of the last public or social Letter to me from Charles Town-consider how I must appear & what I must feel when publications have been made in all the American papers of a wasting Fire in the Capital City of the State from whence I ascended & I am left as unable to answer enquiries into that Calamity as I am ignorant, when our State will be represented? when our State intends to Ratify Confederation? when I expect Instructions to defend against Arthurs Appeal? questions which distress me every time they are asked.  Concerning the Fire I have learned enough to make me feel deeply for my fellow Citizens. Let me entreat my worthy friend Mr. Manigault & Yourself to charge my Brother's Estate & my own with ample Sums in contribution to the relief of the necessitous. On such an occasion be not so cowardly as to fear even the reproach of ostentation. You will see what other people give & go rather beyond proportion in subscribing for me-when I learn particulars I may say more on the subject.  Baron Holzendorff is now returning to France by way of Chs. Town, he will have a lamentable & pitious tale to relate. I think he has too much ground for complaint, but it is not proper for me to expatiate on the subject at this time.(1)  I have lent him 400 Dollars to help him onward after I had learned MARCH 11, 1778  that he had been reduced to make sale of his Silver Mounted Sword & the Epaulets from his Coat. Do not conclude from hence that he is disliked, on the contrary except one or two, he enjoys the esteem & respect of every Body, but there is a Spirit in this World which will tyrannize and refuse to do justice-when it is in power-& at the same time submit to be bullied out of Millions.  The Baron had proposed to publish in Philadelphia & had receiv'd great encouragement to do so, an Essay on the Prussian Tactics but our being obliged to abandon that City, defeated his design. I wish he may receive encouragement for the work in Charles Town. He will inform you pretty fully & clearly of all our intelligence from the Army.  I presume my House has received some of my distressed neighbors lately burnt out otherwise I would chearfully consent to his request of lodging there until he can obtain a passage. I do not say a word about him to the President (2) because I reserve many things as more proper for private conversation but be assured he is respected by General Washington, General Gates, General deKalb & I may add what is abovementioned on this head, & I wish the courtesy of some of us Americans, may soften his resentment against others-which if added to that of many other disappointed & complaining French Men, may represent us in very unfavorable coulours in Europe a circumstance which Seems to be treated by certain persons with a contempt which discloses a want of knowledge of the World.  This will be delivered to you by Captn. John Christian Senf, lately a Lieut. & Engineer in General Reidesel's Hessian Troops. This Gentleman was made prisoner in the action of the 19th October near Saratoga. General Gates countenanced him & from reflection upon the Cruelty of his late Master in compelling him to engage in the present War he determined to change Countries & breathe in the Air of Liberty. General Gates Commissioned him to be a Captain of Engineers but here are so many foreigners, the pay allowed by the public so small & every article of subsistence so extravagantly Dear I have after receiving a very warm recommendation of him from the General advised him to try his fortune in a more Southern Latitude. He is an ingenious Sensible Man, & may be made very useful in public life as an Engineer or in the Service of Individuals as a Surveyor. You will soon discover his abilities & so far patronize him as to direct him how to apply them to the best purposes; I am sure he will be found of great benefit in directing & superintending any of our public Works. I have lent him 150 Dollars for expenses on his journey & should he remain any days unemployed I request you to advance him a farther necessary Sum on my account. Capt Senf is a Saxon & speaks a tongue which you have no aversion to. I shall therefore refer you to himself adding only, that considering him a modest & ingenious  Man I shall rejoice to learn that I have pointed a Road which may lead him to honour & Independence.  I have taken up so much time on behalf of these Strangers scarcely a moment remains for my own affairs but what can I say respecting them. I confide in your Self & my other friends that you will do all you can in my absence to save me from ruin & exert your endeavors to obtain leave for me to return & take the burthen from your hands.  I beg you will introduce Capt Senf to General Howe & excuse me to the General for not writing by this opportunity, tis impossible. Colo. Holzendorff & Capt Senf will relate to you how I am excercised except half an hour which I sometimes hammer out to Sixty minutes drinking Tea & chatting with the very pretty Ladies in this House. I am perpetually 19 or 20 Hours in the day going round like a Mill Horse. Congress have had so much business before them & I believe were never more in want of proper powers for transaction.  The Chief Justice (3) will expect a Line from me, I will do myself the honour of writing next opportunity & several other friends I hope will give me a little further Credit.  I thank Mr. Loveday for his Letter & intend very soon to write to him. I know he will proceed without being offended by my silence. I had almost forgot to say I am willing to give Mr. McCullough every reasonable Indulgence for his debt-let him have an opportunity of attempting to improve for his own benefit the Talents put into his hands. I believe him very honest & am desirous of befriending him.  Adieu My Dear Sir. Present me with respect & affection within your own Walls & in proper terms to all of our friends.(4) ""

  Dear Sir, 11 th March 1778 I had the honour of writing to Your Excellency 30th Jany. continued to 3d Febry. by the hands of a Mr. Gray who received from me a large consideration for promised care & dispatch.  I am sorry to say our public affairs are not a whit mended since the gloomy account in my last.  Repeated daily clamors from every quarter for want of money & provision-the Quarter Master General's, the Commissary General & Clothier General's several departments in the most wretched situation particularly the former two.  The necessary works on North River extremely backward & strong fears expressed that we shall be in no State, when the River is navigable, to defend the Passes, in that Case Albany & all our Stores will be demolished.  The Army under General Washington mouldering away & still in danger of disbanding for want of provision.  The New Board of War has hitherto wrought nothing beneficial, have been bickering with the Executive Council of the State (1) & not run very smoothly with Congress.  The intended Irruption into Canada ended before it commenced. In this business the Marquis de Lafayette has acted with wisdom which has gained him much reputation-but he is seriously chargrined with the planners of that amusement & if I have the honour of any Influence it shall be, I may say it has been exercised to dissuade him from resentment at this critical juncture.(2) Your Excellency may recollect I regretted being almost alone in opposition to that MARCH 11, 1778  indigested romantic Scheme. You Sir, who know the world so well will not be surprized when I add, I can scarcely find a Man in Congress, now, who favoured it. Except my own I do not remember three dissenting voices-now-well \""I never liked that Canada Expedition\"" is unanimous. I am extremely glad we have not sacrificed our Men. The want of Members in Congress is still to be deplored, were my Countrymen sensible of the daily waste of time, when affairs of the utmost importance demand attention & are neglected or slovened over, partly from a want of Numbers & partly of abilities, I am persuaded some of them would fly to remove the reproach which wais particularly severe upon our State.  I have been strongly tempted to resign the Chair in order to gain an opportunity for offering my sentiments upon subjects, which, tho' of great moment, came within the narrow Circle of my understanding. I am apprehensive of being under the necessity of transmitting a proof of this in three of Colo. Kennon's Bills sanctified by Your Excellencys testimonial which I fear will nevertheless, after certain illiberal remarks upon Your Excellency's Certificate, be returned protested to Charles Town. Had I been upon the floor I am persuaded this would not have happened-if the House is so unwise as to refuse payment tomorrow I shall think it my Duty to accompany them by a Special detail of the causes.(3)  I had lately the honour of a correspondence with the Renowned General Burgoyne, which Your Excellency will be well informed of by perusing Copies of our Letters & of the Acts of Congress upon that occasion which will be covered with this. If I had wanted confirmation of my sentiments on the Acts of Congress of the 8th January I should have received it from the General's Letters.  Our Commissary is now extremely busy in exchanging prisoners, 'tis said General Lee is actually on his way to Valley Forge but I suspend belief until I receive an account of his arrival. Tis very evident from Sir William Howe abating of his former demands which had put a stop to exchange, that he is in great want of Men & entertains no sanguine hopes of a speedy reinforcement from Great Britain. The Exchange will augment his Ranks about 1200 hearty fellows. We shall have a large remainder not less than 7000 including the Troops of Saratoga-but the Enemy outnumbers us in Officers. From accounts I have received we have not enough to meet theirs by 200-it seems we have had sad Rubbish under the guise of Officers.  I had little apprehension in June last that I was coming to this part of the World in order to grant Commissions for Cruizing Ships on the Delaware, Cheaspeak Bay, & even on the Ohio & Mississippi. Upon Delaware from whence the British Ships of War had retired to Rhode Island we have been amazingly successful, many Vessels have been captured & some very valuable. I have just received an Accot. of   Captn. Barry's taking two Ships chiefly laden with forage, an affecting stroke to the Enemy-a schooner Armed with 8 4-poundr. & 12 4-pound howitzers, having I Lt. Engineer, 15 Artificers & several Officers Wives & some Cargo on board; the Schooner a remarkable fine Vessel, all this effected by Armed Barges.  In Company with the bearer of this will go a young Gentleman (4) who had been a Lieut. in the Hessian Troops under General Burgoyne, was taken prisoner & after mature deliberation detested & abandoned the Cause in which he had been involuntarily plunged by his Prince. General Gates was so well pleased with him as to give him a Commission of Captn. Engineer, & recommended him very warmly to me. The public have no employment for him here, I have therefore encouraged him to seek his fortune in South Carolina where a Man of his abilities cannot be long out of business. He is said to be a good Engineer & is certainly an excellent draughtsman. If Your Excellency should have room for him in public Service he will prefer it, otherwise he means to offer himself as a Surveyor of Lands, a profession in which after a little experience he will become eminent, admitting his integrity equal to his ability, which both General Gates & myself think there is room to believe.  We have this very Evening received an intimation of a most horrid & dangerous conspiracy. If the secret information shall prove grounded, it will appear that Sr. William reduced to play a desparate Game would aim to be better acquainted with Congress. However, with all the air of probability, the tale is yet mysterious, we are pursuing measures to unfold it.(5) Great Britain would chearfully return to the Year 1763, but with difficulty will be brought to address America in the stile lately observed by her Northern Generals.  I condole with my friends & fellow Citizens Sufferers by the late Fire in Charles Town. The particulars I cannot learn, but enough is come to my knowledge to convince me of the great distress of the Inhabitants & that all these States will feel the Stroke in some degree.  I lately paid from the fund of So. Carolina in the public Treasury 20,246 Dollars for your Excellency's draughts in favor of Benja. Farrar Esquire for 14092 & 6154 Dollars. That Gentleman with Mr. Gaillard &ca. are still on the Monongahela & not a little apprehensive of being seized by some American Cruizer when they have reached the British Line on the Mississippi. I have done everything in my power to guard them against such danger, but I am not clear whether the Board of Wars pass will destroy the effect & validity of the presidents Commission by order of Congress.(6)  I request Your Excellency will allow Colonel Gervais to peruse Mr. Burgoyne's Letters & other papers on his affair & that Your Excellency will not permit any Copy or extract to be taken.  I have the honour to be with very great Regard & Esteem.  P.S. I intreat your Excellency to order the packets for Georgia to be sent immediately forward at Continental Expense.  ""

  Sir March 11th 1778 We have received your letter of the 8th instant and congratulate you on the successful commencement of your expedition and hope it will be attended with Similar advantages to the Public and Glory to the gallant Commander, brave officers & men concerned in it, throughout the whole course. The good opinion you have of your Prize Schooner (1)1 has determined us to purchase her for a Cruizer, you will therefore obtain the consent of the Partys who took her, have her fairly valued, and take her at that valuation for the public. She is to be called the Wasp, and as you have represented her to be properly equiped in every particular for an Armed Vessel, you will see that she is officered & manned as soon as possible, take the command of her yourself or bestow it on some brave, Active, prudent officer. You will employ her there so long as you shall think prudent, but should you apprehend there will be danger of her falling into the hands of the enemy you will send her out of the Bay into Senepuxent, Chincoteague or any of the Inlets on the Coast, where you will be able to collect a full Complement of Men if not well manned before. That done let her take such Station off Cape Henlopen as to be able to descry the enemies Vessels coming in & going out of the Capes and to secure a retreat should she fall in with any Vessels of Superior force. We observe that you have advised General Washington of your Success, and expect you have furnished him with Inventories of what was on board your Prizes. Any Articles which he may direct to be kept for the use of the Army you will retain having them properly valued and deliver them as he may direct. With regard to the general distribution of the Prize Money it is our opinion it should be distributed according to the number of Men & Guns in each Boat concerned in the Capture. As to the distribution among the officers and Men in the Continental Boats (If no previous agreement had been entered into)  MARCH 11, 1778  it must be made agreeable to the Continental Regulations, but if those Regulations should appear not to be adapted to the peculiar circumstances of your expedition, we consent that you should enter into such agreement with your officers and Men as shall be most satisfactory to you & them. We approve of your consulting the Honorable Nicholas Vandyke Esqr when necessary and would have you agreeable to your Instructions, put your Prize goods under his care or any other person you may think proper,(2) and continue to pursue the main object of your expedition with all your usual vigour and activity. The Prisoners you have taken or shall take you will deliver to the commander of that Department of the main Army which may be most Convenient to you. We thank you for the early inteligence of your Success-your well known bravery and good conduct gives us Strong hopes of hearing from you often on Similar Occasions.  With the best wishes for your Success, We are sir, Your very hble servts  P.S. Please to transmit to us an Inventory of the effects you have Captured. Enclosed is Lieutenant Cokelys receipt for 50 Dollars which he will account with you for.  ""

  Dr Sir York Pennsylvania March 12th. 1778 I had the honor of addressing you some short time before my departure from home, which was not so early as I expected when I took leave of you in Newbern, owing to unavoidable delays which I assure you Sir I surmounted as soon as it was in my Power. The intollerably bad roads kept me three weeks nearly on my Journey and I find on my arrival here things by no means in such forwardness as I wish. The army is at present much in the same Situation that it has been all the Winter, a Committee of Congress is at Camp in order to Enquire into and regulate the abuses and Insufficiencies therein. The Congress are much alarmed on account of the scarcity of Flesh provisions and many splendid projects are Contemplated but I fancy nothing will do unless the possessors of that Commodity can see prospects of gratifying their avarice. This vile principle if any thing can, will mar our Cause, for though America abounds with provisions we cannot get sufficient for a few Thousand men without spending millions in the purchase of it. The Congress have yet Resolved on Nothing relative to our Militia, indeed I cannot find that they have any Idea of a plan of Operations or System of Warfare for the next Campaign, and are not able to determin whether they will want them or not. I am myself of Opinion that our army will neither take the field early enough or be of Competent Strength when it is Collected, and I fear we shall be able to undertake Nothing against the Enemy,  MARCH 12, 1778  but must act still on the Defensive and prolong the War. This is far from being agreeable to my Ideas of good policy-but without force Sufficient for an Offensive War, it is all that can be done.  Virginia is the only state who has yet wholly agreed to ratify the Confederation. The 24th of this month is assigned for passing upon it again, by that time I suppose all the States will be Instructed. Maryland and Connecticut have produced theirs. The former desires the western boundaries of the States claiming to the Mississippi or South Seas to be Ascertained by Congress, and that all the Country west of the frontiers not granted to Individuals should be Common Stock. The latter desires that no Standing Army be kept up in time of peace by the United States, or Pensioners supported by them, except persons disabled in war, that the quota of the public Expence be in proportion to the Number of People in each State. I shall Endeavour to procure Copies of the Several Instructions, and transmit them to you, but I suppose the next Assembly will not take it up. They will deem it prudent to know the Sense of every other State before they finally determin. I refer you to Mr Penn for Intelligence. I believe I was mistaken in supposing the tenth of May the time of our Election. Mr Penn informs me it was the 28th of April, if this be so I shall return sooner than I expected, for having no powers beyond the day, and hoping the assembly will not require me to serve here any longer my stay would be useless. I hope the Assembly will take this into early consideration. If I shall observe any thing of Importance before Mr Penn's Departure (who only waits for good weather, and the roads being a little settled) I will add it.

  Sir York Town 12th. Mar. 1778. I had the Honor of yours by Torrey & since by M Brown, with the Inclosures. On Colo Champions Letter to M Buchanan being read in Congress, it produced all that Sollicitude & Concern the Subject required.(1) On the one Hand to recommend to the Assembly & State of Connecticut, who, they acknowlege, have ever distinguished themselves, not only in their ready Compliance with the Resolutions of Congress, but in their great Attention to every Thing which tended to the Good of the Common Cause & Interests of the United states- to revoke what they had so lately recommended them to adopt, would discover a Want of Consideration & too great a Fickleness in the MARCH 12, 1778  Representative Body of the United States, & might much lessen the Influence of their future Resolutions. When they first recommended to the several States to appoint Committees to meet at N Haven for the Purpose of Regulating Prices &ca, (2) they found themselves, at that Time, on the Brink of a Precipice-such a rapid Progress of the Increase of Prices on every Article necessary to raise as well as support the Army, the amazing Demands on the Treasury, arising from such an Increase, become beyond all possible Provision for Supplies, or would very soon be the Case-besides sinking the States in such an immense Debt, from which they never could emerge. Congress being sensible that this Rise did not wholly spring from the large Emissions of Bills or a Scarsity of Articles necessary for Consumption, but from a corrupt, avaricious, unnatural, infectious Disease which was spreading through every State, & which Nothing but extraordinary Remidies could check & Controul. That this was truly the Case appeared from the Prices being as extravagant in the States South of this, where the Bills were very scarce, as where there was the greatest Plenty. Therefore as the last Resort, with the other Remidies proposed, a Recommendation for a Regulating Act, in which the several States should unite, was what would effect some valuable Purpose-but at present we have received no Confirmation but from the State of Connecticut, the other States are generally much slower in their motions, & more feeble in their Efforts, but I could have wished, from the critical Scituation of our Affairs with Respect to Provisions, & the absolute Necessity of Supplies of Beef coming from the Eastward, that the Effect of the regulating Act, so far as respects Stallfed Beef, had been suspended 'till about the middle of June. Congress have immediately referred back Colo Champions Letter & their Resolution thereon to our Assembly, which is expressed in general Terms, as they would not appear to give any possitive Directions, which should interfere with the Rights of the Legislature of any particular State, but they really Wish, hope & expect, that the Act, so far as it respects Stall fed Beef, be suspended for a Time, for Ruin will ensue, unless every Obstruction be removed to every possible Supply of Beef 'till Summer fed Cattle can be procured.

  Sir, York Town, 12th February [i.e. March] 1778. I thank you for the justice you have done me in your favour of the 5th February which reached me no earlier than the 8th Inst. The abatement which my past direction of Addresses made to your proper stile, was not only inadvertent on my part, but the effect of misrepresentation from the Secretary of Congress from whom I had enquired in order to avoid error, or giving Offence.(1)  Upon reading the Journal after the Rect. of Your Letter of *. . .,(2) your name & the erroneous Title, of course occurred. I judged this a proper juncture for correcting the mistake. For this purpose I intimated to the Secretary the claim which you had made in a Letter to me, & received a reply so very rugged, as had nearly carried me beyond the limits within which every Gentleman will confine himself in a Public Assembly.(3) I treated the asperity of Mr. Secretary with silent contempt, & appealed by reading Your Letter, to Congress. The Secretary turned to the Journals & produced Resolves from whence he had derived his Resolutions. Other Gentlemen were at the trouble to prove from the same Journal of a subsequent date Vizt. on the 28th July 1775 (4) that you had been appointed Pay Master of the *(5) department. I was asked if I had seen Your Commission? That I was satisfied with your assurance of the fact & would not affront you, or any Gentleman, by such a demand, appeared to me the best reply to so giddy a question. The House happened to be extremely anxious to proceed upon business of the highest importance, & as most of the Members acquiesced in this opinion \""that Colo. Trumbull should be properly addressed\"" & I beleive took it for granted the Journal would be altered, I judged it unnecessary to press the subject any further. I have delivered my sentiments in Public, & also to Colo. Dyer in private conversation, who promises me he will embrace a favorable opportunity for obtaining an amendment of the improper Entries.  General Gates has assured me that he knows you are Commissioned Pay Master General, this happened not from my seeking confirmation, but accidentally in the course of conversation, & I can perceive no impropriety but directly the contrary, in Mr. President Hancock's addition to the Resolve, which was intended to designate Jonathan Trumbull Esqr. to be chief or principal Pay Master within a certain district-and from the Character I have received of that Gentleman, considered with the depreciated value of general in the Civil Line, I  MARCH 12, 1778  cannot be persuaded to beleive that sheer thirst of Title, prompted his present Claim.  I flatter my self Sir, that enough is said to assure you, I am not chargeable either with a want of respect for you, or of attention to my duty, in any of my former addresses; & that I am with great Esteem & Regard, Sir, Your obedient & humble servant,  Henry Laurens.

  Sir Manour Livingston 13th March 1778 Your Excellency's Dispatches of the 25th of February did not reach me 'till I was proceding to attend the Treaty with the Six Nations.(1) The Scene in which we have been employed as well as the Want of a direct Conveyance, have deprived me of an earlier Opportunity of returning an Answer.  I think I informd your Excellency that I set out with the Marquis de la Fayette from this place the 15th of February for Albany: his Instructions referring him to me for Information.(2) I had sufficient Reason to believe that the Enterprize which he was to conduct cou'd not go forward: Unwilling however that the most remote discouragement shoud be ascribed to our State, I resolved to leave him to Judge from his own observations and totally unprejudic'd & uninfluenc'd. He soon discovered the Want of almost every Necessary of which he had been led to expect an abundant Supply.  The Number of men was greatly deficient. They were destitute of warm Cloathing; their pay in Arrear, and both the Officers and Privates visibly averse to the Expedition. If the Army had been in the best Condition, and highest Spirits, a sufficient number of Teams (1300 being thought necessary) coud not have been collected in Season; and to encrease the difficulties, Forage it was impracticable to procure. The Irruption of the Enemy last Summer having prevented the Harvest in the Northern and North Eastern Parts of this State. Excepting Provisions, Ammunition and the Corps of Militia to be raisd in this State, nothing was ready; and the Opinion of the General Officers, as well as the publick at large, was strongly opposed to the Probability of Success had every one of these Impediments been MARCH 13, 1778  removed. The Marquis who attentively examined every Circumstance saw with inexpressible Chagreen the Obstacles which clouded his prospects of Glory, and, after having flattered himself with sanguine Hopes of performing a distinguished Service to this Country, was oblig'd to relinquish the Enterprize without an Attempt to accomplish it. He has, it must be confessed, some Reason to be vexed and disgusted, advised, as he was, to announce to his Court, the Confidence reposd in him by being elevated to the Command of such an Expedition; and not in the least suspecting that General Gates cou'd be deceiv'd in the Circumstances of a Department which he had Just left, and which coud have undergone no material Alteration.  The Plan of Congress, when I was last upon the Floor, was by a sudden Irruption with 3 or 400 Volunteers, to attempt to burn the Enemy's shipping at St John's, and to offer a very considerable Bounty in Case of Success; The Command to be given to General Starke who was supposd to be very popular in New Hampshire the western frontiers of the Massachusetts, & the Grants; and in every other Respect qualified for the undertaking.(3) The adventurous Spirit of the Inhabitants in these parts, the Dangers to which they must now be exposd while the British Vessels command the Lakes, and the prospect of a great Reward, if they shoud succeed in the Attempt, were thought sufficient Considerations to Justify the Proposition. To me it was given in Charge by Congress, to confer with General Starke & deliver him his Instructions and explain their Views This occasiond my repairing to Albany as soon as I coud give him notice to meet me. At first he seemd sanguine that the scheme woud be acceptable and vigorously supported by those over whom he had an immediate Influence: but on examination it was found that a Reward which depended only on a prosperous Issue, was too slender a Motive for the Undertaking A proposal was therefore made to Congress to allow the Volunteers pay at all Events, & the Bounty in Case of Success: But on General Gates's Arrival at Congress the Plan was enlargd into its' present Form, and the Command conferred on the Marquis.(4) Imagining it woud be agreeable to you to have a full View of this Transaction I have been thus circumstantial. I shoud have mentiond to your Excellency when I had the pleasure of seeing you, the original Plan; but as it Depended on Secrecy I was enjoind to communicate it only to General Starke.  Altho' we proposd to hold the Treaty with the Six Nations between the 15th & 20th of February it was not till the 27th that we had notice of their Assembling. We repair'd to John's Town the 28th, but they were so tedious in their movements that the Business was not opend untill Monday the 9th Instant. The Number of Indians was something above 700, consisting of Oneidas, Tuscarores, Onondagoes, a few Mohawks, and three or four Cayugoes: but not a single Senaca   attended. The latter had the Insolence even to affect their Surprize that while our Tomahawks Stuck in their Heads, their Wounds were bleeding, and their Eyes streaming with Tears for the Loss of their Friends at the German flatts, we shoud think of inviting them to a Treaty!  The Speech from Congress (5) was in a Tone becoming the Dignity of Congress and the Spirit and Power of the United States. The generous and upright Conduct of these States towards the Six Nations, and their Ingratitude, Cruelty and Treachery were pointed out, and Satisfaction peremptorily Demanded. The faithful Oneidas & Tuscarores were excepted and distinguished. They were applauded for their Integrity and Firmness, and assurd of our Friendship and Protection.  An Onondagoe Chief spoke for the guilty Tribes. He exculpated himself & the Sachems, threw the Blame on the Headstrong warriors who no longer woud listen to advice, laid a proper Stress on the example of our own internal Divisions and Oppositions, and painted in strong Terms the Influence of the Bribery and Artifices employd by Butler and the other Creatures of the Crown.  An Oneida Chief answered for that Nation and the Tuscarores with a Spirit and Dignity which woud not have disgracd a Roman Senator. He pathetically lamented the Degeneracy of the unfriendly Tribes; predicted their final Destruction; and declard the unalterable Resolution of the Oneidas & Tuscarores, at every Hazard, to hold fast the Covenant Chain with the united States, and with them to be buried in the same Grave; or to enjoy the fruites of Victory and Peace. He fully evinced the Sincerity of these Professions by desiring that we woud erect a Fortress in their Country and furnish a small Garrison to assist in their Defence. This being promisd on our part; He concluded with a solemn assurance that these two nations woud at all Times be ready to cooperate with Us against all our Enemies.  In a private manner they warnd us against the Onondagoes who they lookd upon as our Enemies notwithstanding their seeming Contrition for their passed Conduct: and affirmed that there was not the least doubt but that they, the Senecas, & Cayugoes, woud renew their Hostilities early in the Spring; & that Butler woud take possession of Oswego and get it fortified: For which Events they entreated us to be prepard.  In our Reply we applauded again the Courage & Fidelity of the Oneidas & Tuscarores. The other Nations we observed were not sufficiently represented to Justify our Treating with them. We directed therefore that a Council of their Confederacy shoud be assembled at Onondagoe as soon as possible; that our demand of satisfaction shoud be there publickly made, and from the hostile nations, an explicite Answer returnd: that they shoud be reminded of our upright and  their own treacherous Behaviour: that our Cause was Just; that the Hand of the united States coud reach the remotest Corner of the Country of the Senacas; and that we trusted the good Spirit whom we servd woud enable us to punish all our Enemies & put it out of their power to do us further Injury.  The Inhabitants of the County who attended in great numbers were highly satisfied with the manner in which the Treaty was conducted. I think it will probably have a considerable Influence on the Onondagoes, upwards of an hundred of whom were present. They are much intermaried with the Oniedas & will be apt to follow their example. At Least that Tribe will be divided: But from the Senecas and Cayugoes, & the greatest part of the Mohawks, nothing but Revenge for their lost Friends, and tarnished Glory, is to be expected: especially while our Enemies are so plentifully supplied with the means of Corruption: and we cannot furnish our best Friends with the necessaries of Life even in the Course of Trade.  I hope the Facts I have suggested, which passed under my own Observation, will be sufficient to give your Excellency a competent Knowledge of the Temper and Disposition of the six Nations; and to enable you to take seasonable Measures for the Defence of our Frontier Inhabitants: at least so far as may depend on the Exertion of our internal Strength. I have conversed with the Marquis who was at the Treaty on this Subject. He has already orderd Troops to Schoharie and Cherry Valley, and directed an Engineer to lay out a fort in the Oneida Country. Sure I am that nothing in his power will be wanting for the Security of every part of this State.  As I was on my Journey to John's Town when I was honourd with the Receipt of your Dispatches: it was too late for your Excellency to execute your Trust respecting the Appointment of an Additional Commisr. for Indian Affairs. Before I left Congress it was pressed upon me to accept the office. I declind it, And on my promise to assist the Commisr. at the propos'd Treaty if necessary, the matter rested for that Time. When I met the Commisrs at Albany the beginning of January to fix the Treaty, it Appeard that there was no prospect of General Wolcot's, and no certainty of General Schuyler's Attendance. We concluded therefore to recommend it to Congress to appoint additional Commissioners, which occasioned the power committed to you.(6)  The Reason which inducd me to decline the Office of Commisr when my Acceptance was requested by Congress, is this. The Jurisdiction of this State over the Country of the Six Nations is unquestionable as well as ancient, on it depends the legality of all our Setler's in the Mohawk Country. Apprehensive that the Interference of Congress might one time or other cross the Rights or the Interests of the State, & that as a Trustee for Congress I might be embarrassed and re  straind in supporting our separate & exclusive Jurisdiction, I did not see my way clear to engage in it: As far as I can Judge there is some Weight in the Objection. I am however not the less obliged to your Excellency for the Testimonial of your good Opinion in offering me the Appointment: When I pay you my Respects I shall take an Opportunity of conversing further upon it.  Having now, Sir, finished the Duties enjoined me by Congress on my Recess, in which to this Time I have been employd, I from this day consider myself as entring on that Respite from publick Business with which, thro' your Interposition, the Legislature have been pleasd to indulge me.(7)  I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Respect, Sir, your Excellencys most obedient huml Servant, Jas Duane  P.S. Col. Livingston desires me to inform your Excellency that he will give the Person who is to direct the Construction of the Slitting Mill all the Encouragemt he can reasonably ask. Not knowing how he values his services it is difficult to mention a price: but rather than be disappointed he would allow him 20/ a day; a Sum he mentions at Random.  ""

  My Dear son, York Town, 15 March 1778 While James Custer is Copying a very short Address to Your General, I will employ my self in acknowledging the receipt of your favours of the 28th February & 9th Inst.(1) At another opportunity I may reply specially to parts which at present must lie dormant. MARCH 15, 1778  I will certainly this day, make some provision for those distressed fellow Citizens of whom you speak & address Mr Franklin through your means.(2) There are obvious objections against a proposal by me for more general contribution. I have once or twice hinted such a thing, & made very little impression; tis my Duty Charitably to conclude that every Man does in private as he pleases & that every one does somewhat toward the relief of sufferers in our great Cause. Nevertheless my only sentiments in this peculiar case are, that our Light should shine before Men. Were we possessed of the Spirit of Patriotism which flashed in 1775, there would be Contributions at this critical moment not only for the comforting of sick & Naked Prisoners but for the relief of all suffering Soldiers-for the support, conservation & augmentation of the Army & we should enable Your General that great & good Man to drive out our Invaders-but alas! that virtue now appears to have been a mere fash. Every Man has bought his Yoke of Oxen, has married a Wife & stays to prove them. Often have you heard me ludicrously express my fears that my Countrymen in general would prove only good for the Quarter-not for the Course. The present time too well confirms the remark. From the best accounts, from all Accounts, & I have opportunities of receiving the best, you lie at the Mercy of our Enemies, who may disposses & drive you, & in that Act animate our bosom-Enemies, throw the States into consternation & shake our Independency. Yet alas! although all see & acknowledge the danger is not in fancy only, yet time is toyed away-a Senate of 13 Members, seldom above 17-against whose honesty & good meaning I make no exception-Wisdom is justified of her Children. I have in my own name called & called again upon the States to fill up their several Representations-the Governors & President see & acknowledge the necessity-& there it ends. Men are engaged in private veiws-some are afraid of Expence & coarse fare & others of being exposed in high Characters & dangerous situations- & too too many are labouring at all hazards to add field to field. The Villains of exalted Rank who have been plundering our Treasury & starving our Cause contribute all their force to keep us down & my jealousies that some of these are in contact with Sir William grow strong.  If there are Patriots, Men who love Country more than pelf, let them step forth & cast their gifts or loans into the Treasury, some by Money & some by services without Reward. Others may, because they have ability, give both. I would wish to be in the first Class & subscribe to morrow five or ten thousand Pounds Sterling & if these were found insufficient, all my Estate shall be given for saving the Public- & perhaps there will be found in this proposition much of prudent calculation-give part to save the remainder. Be that as it may, or put me into either Class I am chearfully disposed to proceed provided   I have any prospect of success, but at present I have none. Proper subscriptions by, sure we may find on this continent from New Hamshire to Georgia, 500 wealthy Men, would raise near three Millions Sterling, return your Paper into the Treasury & animate the Middle & lower Ranks of people to adventure Life & fortune in proportion. I have sounded some breasts on this important subject-but all were cold, applaud the scheme-\""if Men would do so it would certainly relieve us\""-& there was all. Can I then believe that Men are in earnest? Yes I see they are in Earnest to plunder the Common Stock. The very manner of our proceeding in the Issuing our Money leads rapidly on to ruin. What complaints has your General been making for many Months past-without the least good effect-how have delinquents not only been skreened-but held up in triumph & can you prevail on me to remain longer among such People? No. I will rather insist upon your abandoning them. But indeed, there, are sometimes my hopes, where you are-A species of Patriotism may at length spring forth from the Army & so far save this Country as to drive out the Enemy & punish sluggish torpid friends. These Ideas have been long in my mind. I may have expressed them in some late uncopied Letter. If they are worth your reflexion, retain my meaning & destroy the Paper record.  I dont understand your meaning where you mention DuPlessis books, neither can James assist me, that Gentleman left no Books here.  Baron Holzendorff is gone to So Carolina exceedingly chagrined by the treatment he met with here. Poor Man, I almost wept when I learned by a mere accident, that he had been obliged to sell his Silver hilted Sword & Epaulets &c. to pay for his Lodging. I instantly put him a step above such necessity-& have given him Letters to Charles Town which will secure him tolerable quarters there & a Passage to his own Country.

  Dear Sir, York Town. Mh. 16th. 1778. On the 11 th instant I received yours of the 5th and Mr. Jno. Adams's of the 6th of February. Two paragraphs of the latter I will transcribe; because I know it must give you pleasure. \""Dear Sir I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 22d of January and beg leave to assure you I shall pay all proper attention to its contents, by rendering to the Gentleman you recommend every service in my power.(1)  \""I had been before introduced to that young gentleman by his father; for whom I have concieved a great deal of esteem, and from what I have seen and heard of the son I think him ingenious and promising; but as I shall have an ample opportunity to become more acquainted with him, I shall be better able hereafter to speak of him from my own knowledge, and you may depend upon it, that nothing shall be wanting on my part, towards recommending him in proportion to his merit.\"" I most heartily congratulate with you on your Sons being under the patronage of so worthy a gentleman, and hope he will be a blessing and an honour to his father and his country. He early treads the great stage of the world, may his steps be directed by unerring wisdom, and boundless goodness!  I read that part of your letter, respecting the 74 at Portsmouth, and a Paragraph of one I recd., about the same time and upon the same Subject, from Mr. Whipple, to the marine committee, and it was agreed to stop the building of her for the present. These huge ships are too costly and unwieldy; and it will require as many men to man one of them, as to man three or four frigates; besides we cannot with all the naval force we can collect be able to cope with the British navy. Our great Aim should be to destroy the trade of Britain; for which purpose Frigates are infinitely better calculated than such large Ships. Mr. Whipple proposes to the marine committee to put the timber prepared for the 74 into a frigate to mount 30 18 pounders on one deck and this proposal I believe would be complied with if our finances were not at present very low and the demands of the great departments of war very high. I wish we may be able to finish, man, and get to sea, in the course of the next summer, the frigates that are now in hand; but I very much doubt it. It gave the marine committee great Satisfaction to find that the Warren had got out. We have since heard that She had arrived at Boston, which we hope will prove true. I hope you will get out the Providence and Columbus.  MARCH 16, 1778  The Virginia hath made two fruitless attempts to pass out Chesapeak. She is order'd to make another. There are four or five Men of war in that bay; but I cannot think it so difficult to pass by them, as it is to pass those in our Bay. Our last accounts from Charlestown So. Carolina were, that Capt. Biddle with three State armed Vessels were determined to go over the Bar, and attack several British Vessels of about an equal force with them. I cannot forbear being anxious for the Event.  The marine Committee lately ordered Capt. Barry of the Effingham to take the four Boats, belonging to the Frigates, which are Sunk in the Delaware, and proceed on a Cruise upon that River.(2) On the 7th instant Two of them, the other two had not then got below the city, joined by five boats, half manned, attacked (near Bombay hook) and took two of the Enemy's transport ships, one mounting six four pounders, the other two swivels; and also a Schooner with eight 4-pounders, twelve 4-pound howitzers and 32 men, properly equipped for an armed vessel. They first boarded the Ships, and, learning from them the Strength of the Schooner, Capt Barry prudently sent a flag to the Schooner, ordering the Capt. of her to submit, and promising that he & his officers, on compliance, should be allowed their private baggage; whereupon they thought proper to strike. As the Ships were loaded only with forage, Capt. Barry, after stripping, burn't them. The Schooner, being a suitable Vessel for a Cruiser, he is order'd to purchase and employ on the Delaware so long as he thinks it may be safe. She had in a variety of useful and valuable Articles. This gallant Action reflects great Honour on Capt. Barry, his officers and the Crews of those Boats. The other two boats have since got down, and in their way took a small Sloop, with fresh Provisions, bound to the City. I expect every day to hear of their further Success. These boats will annoy and injure the enemy more, in my opinion, than both the Seventy fours would if they were built, equipped and manned, at least upon the Delaware.  With regard to the Fish, Mr. Whipple writes. \""I have never been able to procure any fish that I think worth sending to you or your friends. They ask 20 dollars per Quintal for such as I would not, by any means, make use of. I do not suppose it possible to get any of the first Quality at present; when I can you may depend I shall not be unmindful of your order.\""  I thank you for the Stick of Sealing wax. I had been obliged some times to secure my Letters with the Wax taken from Letters I had received.  Please to write to me frequently, and send me all the news you can collect. The two armies are in statu quo. Nothing material hath lately turned up. You will have hear'd, before this reaches you, that the intended Irruption into Canada is laid aside. We are obstructing  and fortifying Hudson's River, collecting men and provisions &c &c for the next campaign. The last will be the most difficult to accomplish. To have subdued both the British Armies in one Campaign was not more than I expected the last; but it would have left us nothing to do the ensueing Campaign.  With the Aid of Heaven we will crush the Serpents head next Summer, and force our Enemies to be at peace with Us! I have room only to add that I am, Yrs, Wm Ellery  ""

  Sir. Camp 16th March 1778. By a Letter from the Committee which the Bearer will deliver to you We have requested your Excellency to assist in arranging or rather paying our Regiments.(1) Let me intreat that the utmost Attention be paid to removing every Officer who is unfit for the Post he fills since upon this will in a great Measure depend the Success of our Arms and not only that but also our Funds which can never be made equal to the horrible Expenditures which become necessary as much from the Want of good Discipline as any other Cause. The Want of Money in the several Departments is a Complaint reverberated to us from all Quarters and arises as much as any Thing from Neglect in those who should have thought a little more of paying while very liberal in contracting Debts. But surely it would be wise in the State immediately to tax very heavily even if it should answer no other Purpose than to pay their own Subjects for what is it after all but this that in the one Case the Continent pay an Interest for the Debt and in the other they do not. The bad Policy of delaying Taxation is so evident that the People ought to take exemplary Vengeance upon those whoever they may be who are Causes of such Delay. For God's Sake is it intended that our Neighbours shall make such Advances during the War as to leave us groaning under an immense Burthen of Debt at the Close of it? Are Gentlemen ignorant that Money is like Water which always seeking a Level runs to the Place from whence it is dipt out? Woeful Experience will demonstrate to them that the State which lays heavy Taxes for ten years will at the End of that Period have as much Money and as many Commodities as the State which has not taxed, but a truce to these Observations. In the Letter from the Committee we neglected (unless I mistake) to send you the Arrangement which shall therefore be done in this Letter. Let me observe apropos that by the broad Terms of our Letter Warner's Regiment is subjected to you.(2) On this Occasion you will not slip the Opportunity of paying him the proper Compliment and at the MARCH 16, 1778  same Time exercise an Act of Authority which will speak very intelligibly.

Virginia ever desirous of taking the lead in this great Contest, was prepared and offered to ratify the Confederation. She stood, single, and enjoyed a secret pride in having laid the corner stone of a confederated world. Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pensylvania, and South Carolina will confederate. The Dele- MARCH 17, 1778  gates of some of these States have not yet received their Instructions, but are in daily expectation of them. New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Deleware, and Georgia could give Congress no satisfactory information of what had been done in their several States, as they had received no authentic Intelligence upon this subject. There can be no doubt but these States will confederate. The Instructions which the Delegates of Maryland received from the Genl. Assembly were stated upon this occasion to Congress. Several of the States being unrepresented [and] few members prepared to combat our objections, produced [but a] short Debate. The matter now stands posponed till the twenty fifth of this month.(1) As to the two first objections, from the present Temper of the House I believe they will meet with very little opposition. But as to the last, which requires Congress to be invested with full power to ascertain and fix the western Limits of those States which claim to the Mississippi or South Sea all attempts will be vain and fruitless; Equally unsuccessful will prove the Efforts made to obtain a right in common to that extensive Country which lies to the Westward of the frontiers of the United States, the property of which was not vested in Individuals at the commencement of the present war. Much has been already said in Congress upon this subject, and the opinions of those who will have the determination of it, has been long made up. The Argument may be renewed but the Decision will be the same. The bare mentioning of the Subject rouses Virginia, and conscious of her own importance, she views her vast Dominion with the surest expectations of holding it unimpaired.  North Carolina has agreed only to the first, second, third, eighth and 12th, the second and third Sections of the fourth, and the last section of 9th Articles which she has instructed her Delegates immediately to ratify. But the remaining Clauses and Articles, which, she believes, contains matters of the highest importance and involving what may materially affect the internal Interest and sovereign Independency of the state and which is not immediately necessary and essential to the success of the present War, ought not to be ratified till there is full time for mature and deliberate consideration.  Connecticut has instructed her Delegates to obtain an alteration in the mode of supplying the common treasury with money by changing it from the value of Landed property to the Number of Inhabitants; if this cannot be done the Delegates are still impowered to ratify.  Congress have with great earnestness, and with a Desire of impressing on the Minds of the several States the necessity of filling up their Battalions, recommended a Draft of the Militias, or other measures that may be effectual. This I know will be a serious piece of Business in our State and dangerous to persue. How it can be effected and at the same time preserve the Temper of the people, I know not. It is  possible the Legislature may fall upon ways and means without adopting the odious plan of Drafting.(2)  The enclosed paper of 7th March you will see a recommendation for the forming a Body of Horse.(3) The advantages are many and great, to be derived from a strong Body of Light Cavalry, in the opinion of your Commander in chief. If the plan alluded to should be so fortunate as to bring forth into the field a considerable Number of young Gentlemen of property and spirit, it cannot fail of producing the most salutary effect. The Legislature will give it every encouragement I hope in their power.  In the enclosed papers you see the reasonings and grounds upon which the Embarcation of Genl. Burgoyne and his troops is suspended. Since this resolution passed, Genl. Burgoyne upon his particular application is permitted to go to England.  We have little News worth communicating. The Success of Capt Barry in the Deleware you have heard. He has lost his schooner after a very obstinate engagement. A large Spanish Ship was lately taken off our Capes. A French Ship said to be worth, as things are now rated, five hundred thousand pounds is arrived in Carolina.  Congress is ex[t]remely thin, which you will discover by a resolve which has or will be soon sent you.(4)  I am sir with great respect your most obedt. and hble. Servt.  J. Henry Junr.  ""

If enlarged & permitted to go into Philadelphia, what mischief may our Enemies doe, under a Colour of their Authority, even without their consent. If permitted to go at large in those parts of Pensylvania in possession of the Whigs, as they are so intermixed with Tories, very mischievous consequences may arise. If confined in Pensylvania for refusing a Test it may occasion discontent & caballing.  Congress have no objection (we are inclined to think) to their being returned, under the Authority of the State, provided it can be done without danger to the State of Pensylva. in particular, or the United States in general.  The Comittee request such Information on the Subject, as your State may think proper to Comunicate, to enable them to form their opinion, and report to Congress, for their determination.(3)  We have the honour to be, with great respect, your Excellencies most obedt.

  Dear Sir York Town March 18th 1778 Since my last we have received no interesting Intelligence from the Army, they remain still in quiet possession of Valey-forge Camp. MARCH 18, 1778  I am apprehensive my Servant has attempted to go to Philadelphia & perhaps is got there. I can however hear nothing of him, altho' I have distributed advertisements all over the Country, & have imployed some of our light Horse to go in pursuit of him, but to no purpose. I expect to set off the middle of April, & I fear, without a Servant to attend me, as not one is to be had here as yet on any Terms.  Jackey is not yet come to me. Mr. Mitchell promised by letter to send him as soon as the weather would permit; indeed we have had no weather fit for any person to travel for two months past. I have again written very pressingly to Mr. Mitchell(1) for the Child & expect every day his answer. He lives now at a place called Potsgrove some where down towards Philadelphia.  It is hoped General Washington will be able to Open the Campaign with some vigorous exertions.  Burgoyns Army is Stopped, You will see the particulars in the inclosed News papers; I was not at Liberty to Communicate this Intelligence sooner.  I shall bring Your Nephew home with me; as I do not think it prudent to leave him at present in this Country; indeed the Schools in general are broke up, perhaps he may be sent to Mecklingburg, to be of advantage to him. If Mrs. Harnett will Consent I will send Neally with him, but this we can conclude upon after my return.  Your Bills I fear will not be paid. I wish you had not been Concerned with them. I ever Cautioned you against having any Connexion with that man Kennon but to no purpose; but it was unpardonable to have no Other Indorser than his Clerk. The business of Congress was taken up the whole day on Kennons Bills on Saturday last, and from the Complexion of the House, I am well satisfied they will not be paid. I shall bring it on again, & if they are not paid, I shall have them regularly Protested, which is I fear, all that can be done at present; & will send them on by Post, to give you an Oppertunity of endeavouring to procure payment from his Executors or Administrators, upon my word you have Acted exceedingly imprudent, to say no worse of it. You will be obliged to Commence a Suit, & throw good money after bad. I think I foresee what will happen on this Wild goose transaction. It is surprising to me that you could not take the Currency of your own Country for what you sold rather than take Bills drawn by a Man whose estate was universally believed insolvent, and only Indorsed by his Clerk. You will give me leave to tell you, that such a transaction Can not be reconciled to Common Sense. You have only lost 3500 Dollars by this prudent Step. Shew this paragraph to Mrs. Harnett if you dare.(2)  I am Dr Sir Your sincr friend & Ob Servt, Cornl. Harnett  P.S.

  My dear Friend Manour Livingston l9th March 1778 When I left Congress I was charged with Business which has kept me abroad and unsettled ever since I came to this State. This has been the Chief Reason of my not doing myself the pleasure of enquiring after your Health & of assuring you that however remote, you possess a Share in my Remembrance and Affections.  I have written a long Letter to Congress (1) by this Conveyance to which I refer you for a full View of the Condition of this Department, the Temper of the six nations, and the Dangers to which we shall in all probability be exposed the approaching Campaign. I flatter myself that you will continue to be a warm advocate for the Protection which is necessary to preserve the shatterd Remains of a State which is equally the Object of British, and savage Malice. From the want of every necessary Preparation in the Northern Department, I am apprehensive that it is concluded that the Victories last Campaign, have placd us in a State of safety. Nothing however is more remote from Truth. The Sencas & Cayugaes the most powerful nations of the Confederacy instead of being humbled by their Defeat are enragd at their Disgrace; have refusd to attend the late Treaty from which I am Just returnd; and openly threaten Revenge. Butler intends to take possessn. of Oswego which will give the British Troops & their savages the greatest advantages in distressing our Frontiers; & I see no sufficient obstruction to discourage the Enemy's Troops & Fleet in the City & Harbour of New York from revisiting Hudson's River and compleating the Desert which they began last summer. They have unquestionably ample Means and to suppose they will not be exerted, if it is only to create an alarming Diversion in favour of General Howe, woud be Folly in the extreme.  While I have Room to feel with Sympathetic Concern the Dangers and distresses of Pensylvania I shoud do my Friend Injustice to doubt his Anxiety for our Safety. I therefore please myself with a full Assurance that he will give all the weight to my Representations to Congress which they shall appear to him to deserve.  There is one subject I have touched upon-the Illiberality of leaving General Schuyler eight months suspended in the Light of a Criminal without Examination or Trial.(2) The justice of such a procedure [is] out of the Question. Do you think, my dear Sir, that the Reputation of Congress must not be injurd, & the publick Service MARCH 19, 1778  prejudiced by so unexampelled a Delay? Will the impartial world be satisfied with the plea that such a Length of time was necessary to find out a Charge of maleconduct, or Evidence to maintain it? Will not Gent. who value their Honour be terrified from hazarding, what is so dear to every good Man, with such austere or such lukewarm masters, who seem prone to suspect a Crime, and indifferent whether the accusd shall ever have an opportunity to vindicate his Innocence? I do not know what passes in other States but here this unreasonable Treatment of officers of high Rank & Confidence is a Topic of general Conversation. Genl Schuyler wants no Office from Congress; He wishes to resign. He can in that Case be highly servicable to his own State; & yet he dare not resign least it shoud be ascribd to his unwillingness to undergo, what he most wants, a publick & impartial Enquiry and Trial. In the mean time the winter has passed away & the Campaign opening when it will be perhaps impracticable for the witnesses & a Court martial to be convend. Is not this sporting with Peoples Reputations and Peace of Mind? You my dear Sir who have an abundant portion of Sensibility, who know how precious a Jewel is a good name, who woud advocate Innocence, as much as you abhor Guilt, will I trust with manly freedom press forward the Trial of General Schuyler without further Delay both upon principles of private Justice & publick good. If Evidence cannot be discoverd in eight months the presumption is violent that none exists-especially after the publick Call which has been given, as well as the personal Applications which have made for this purpose. If it is to be taken up as a principle that there can be no Trial 'till Evidence shall be found; there may never be a Trial or Enquiry, & this after an Accusation and Suspension woud be a palpable Denial of Justice. But I will not enlarge.  I had the unhappiness, my dear Sir, on my Return home to find Mrs. Duane's Health greatly Impaird. The Dangers and Alarms to which she was exposd during the whole Summer joind to the fateagues & distress of a precipitate Flight, and my unexpected long absence, were too violent for her Fortitude and in a manner destroyd her whole nervous System. She recovers very Slowly and it requires all my Care and Attention to keep her in that Flow of spirits which is absolutely necessary to give her any Chance for Health.  Consider my dear Friend what a drawback this is from the Happiness I proposed to myself in rejoining my Family after so long an Absence. May Heaven preserve you & yours that first of all earthly Blessings Health. Your Fortitude will give you Contentment and Patience under all the Calamities we suffer in our persons or feel for our Friends. Present my affectionate Compliments to my dear Mrs. Morris, tell her that we often speak of you & her with unfeignd Regard, & that I am incapable of forgetting the Kindness and Hospi-  tality with which I have been always entertaind at every place which called Mr. Morris its owner.  Do, my dear sir, write me the news. If you have none, write only that you & your family are well; & that you still remember, your truly affect Friend & most Obedt Servant, Jas. Duane  [P.S.] I have expected Mr Duer every day for three months which is the Reason I do not write. I fear the Return of his Indisposition. If he is still with you present him my respectful Complimts as well as to my other colleages & all in whose Remembrance I have a place.  ""

True it is, you have made a great Sacrifice already & therefore should think you justifiable to conduct your future Life in whatever mode might be agreeable; but I cannot but express my Wishes that you would continue to move in that Sphere, in which it is my real Opinion, no Man in America will do better than yourself.

I believe it is happy for the Continent that the Committee were sent to Camp, General Fulsom arrived here yesterday, when will the other Gentlemen return? We decrease in Members every Day; Mr Penn & Mr Harvey return to their respective States this week, so that the Congress will want assistance; Do give Mr Morris a hint of this.

  Sir, York Town March l9th. 1778 Upon an application from the settlers at Wioming or as they call it \""The Town of Westmoreland\"" congress agreed to establish one Company of troops there for its immediate defence for one year. Congress has expressed this in the same terms in which a similar resolution passed two years ago & which I beleive was adopted on the consent of the Delegates from Connecticut & this state.(1) At the same time establishments were formed for the defence of the other frontiers by establishing other corps both with regard to Pennsylv. & Virginia. The house is prepared for the same measures now on application (I believe) for that purpose. But the affair I imagined had been left to the Commissioners now at Pittsburgh at least as far as it respects the Vicinity of that place.(2)  In a letter received from Genl.

The Pertinacity of the English still continues, & their steady persuit of the Conquest of America is their favorite object, for which Purpose they voted a Reinforcement of twenty thousand Soldiers, & in all instances at the opening of their Session the Parliament have submitted to dictatorial Majesty by echoing back his Speech, & without even a Question voting the required Supplies.

  Dear Sir York Town 20 March 1778 I have been laid up with the Gout which has prevented my writing to Your Excellency for some time past having had it in my right hand. Nothing has as yet been determined on in Congress relative to Calling out the Militia of No Carolina. The Army remains still at Valey Forge, & we have been for some time alarmed with the great Scarcity of flesh to feed them. My friend Burke thinks this an Artificial Scarcity; in this we differ much in Opinion, as I am Convinced the want is real, as we have not been Able as yet to lay up any Magazines of Provisions, & have had only sufficient to Supply the immediate wants of the Army; I am firmly of Opinion if we fail at all in the Vigour of our Opperations, it will be owing to this Circumstance; & by that means, I fear the war may be prolonged, and our Army reduced to the Necessity of carrying on a defensive war only. I hope I may be mistaken, many Gentlemen think I am; The Provision not coming on as fast as we wish, may perhaps be owing to the badness of the weather, which has rendered the roads almost impassable; how my Collegue (Penn) will get on, I know not, he is the bearer of this & I beg leave to refer you to him for further information in regard to Congress Matters. General Washington has it much at heart to Open the Campaign with Vigour before the Enemy can possibly receive reinforcements.  Our Committee are not yet arrived from Camp, but are daily expected. It is expected they will, on their arrival, Open a new field for Congress.  I intend to set off on my return home some time towards the middle of April, I shall then have been ten Months from my family, and as Our Assembly pay their Delegates so very Liberally, I have neither expectation or wish to return again, as I am convinced there will be many Candidates for the Honorable imployment, I am not one; 'tho  MARCH 20, 1778  I shall think it my Duty to serve my Country to the best of my poor abilities, in any Capacity, either with or without pay.  I suppose the Genl. Assembly will be adjourned before my return, I am sorry they had not Continued thier Present Delegates until they were relieved by Others, this might have prevented Our State from being unrepresented in Congress for two or three Months at least, which must be the case as matters now Stand.  Virginia has impowered her Delegates to ratify the Confederation. The Members from Massachusets have also private Letters informing them that their State has also done it.(1) I do not hear of any Other States doing it as yet; Connecticut wish the Quota to be fixed by the Number of people in each State; every Other Objection of theirs has little weight.  Every member of Congress seems to wish for a Confederacy except my good friend Burke who laughs at it as a Chymerical Project, it does not strike me in that point of view. I think that unless the States Confederate a door will be left open for Continual Contention & Bloodshed, and that, very soon after we are at peace with Europe. I heartily wish I may be Mistaken. I have the honor to be with the greatest respect, Your Excellencys Most Obed & very hul Servt,  Cornl. Harnett P.S. Upon enquiry I find the Delegates from the several States have power to ratify the Confederation, but are to endeavor to get some Alterations made if possible.

York have agreed unanimously and have by Commission empowered their Delegates.(2) As I have been informed some aspersions have been thrown out to the Prejudice of Mr. Penn, I must in justice to that Gentleman's Character assure your Excellency that his Conduct as a Delegate and a Gentleman has been worthy and disinterested.

MARCH 20, 1778  From the method in which I found Congress habituated & against which I have sometimes remonstrated, it is not the president's province to acknowledge the Receipt of Letters without the authority of a Resolve or special order, nor indeed can he in many Instances even recite the date but by the aid of a good memory, hence I flatter myself Sir, you will be persuaded to beleive, the seeming neglect of your former address is not imputable to me. At the same time tis my duty to declare the opinion of Congress, from the sentiments delivered by Individuals, appeared to be, that an appointment in your Stead would have arrived posterior to the period first assigned for that Enquiry, & that the four other Gentlemen named in the Commission would all have given their attendance to the business.  This Morning the Honble Mr. Lewis put into my hand & I presented to Congress your Letter of the 7th Inst. directed to the Delegates from New York.

  Dear Sir, [March 20? 1778] (1) Mr Dana is likely to be at Camp a Fortnight longer. I will make no Comments upon this. I have mentioned something like it as often to you as if you was the procuring cause of a regulation which has not yet proved beneficial to our state, for which end it was doubtless calculated. I must insist upon it that more than are necessary for a vote ought always to be attending, as a necessary provision against accident.  A small Letter from Bingham with some English news papers having cost us nearly £180 has turned my mind towards travailing  MARCH 21, 1778  charges and the long Etcaetera of washing, botching and patching. The two last multiply upon me, and being the subjects of draughts upon the privy purse, rather than dittos against the public Treasury, I find them as much as can possibly be spared from the appropriations for my Family. How shall I contrive to obtain from the Assembly of our State an Allowance of the 260 dollars which I now totally despair of recovering by advertisement. You know the disposition of the People who alone can grant it. If they are not disposed to do it I must contrive to leave this place upon your return and Jew-like buy & sell Salt till I have thus piously recovered from the poor & needy what was alike piously taken from me by some industrious money getting man in THAT GREAT CITY.  I have wrote to Doctr. Cooper (2) all that was scratching over for our Martinique Correspondent's letter. As to Affairs in this quarter they are just as you would naturally imagine from your former knowledge of the discipline of our Camp. You may tell your acquaintance how that is. I am sure I need not tell you. Pray endeavour that the eastern Recruits should not come forward 5 Weeks too late. Our Dilatoriness will give Howe opportunity to reestablish his Reputation early this Campaign I fear. At present it is much sunk among the Quakers and their Likenesses. New York has sent her Confirmation of the Confederation in a most elegant and formal manner engrossed and fortified with the Great Seal of the State to be lodged among the Papers of the Continent the most precious. Our State is little attentive to such things and yet they are far from improper. I am Sir, affectionately yr humble Servant, J 1  ""

  York Town, Pennsylvania 23 March 78. Nothing of moment having occurred since Col. Lee's last letter,(1) we have only to communicate the earnest desire of congress that our new levies of troops may be sent forward to camp with the utmost expedition. The necessity of pushing this business with vigour arises from the present weakness of our army, and the great probability of the enemy's taking the field early with augmented force, and over running the country, or attempting something decisive against our army before it is reinforced. The next grand object is to secure all the provision that can be engaged for the troops, as many disappointments and difficulties have intervened to lessen the prospect of the abundant supplies that were expected.  Colonel Harrison's regiment of artillery is much wanted at camp, and congress wishes them to march immediately.(2) It is reported, and we fear not without foundation, that the troops at Rhode Island have embarked with an intention of joining General Howe. If this is the case, without the greatest exertions it is much to be apprehended the enemy will open the campaign with great advantage over us. We are with the highest respect.  Your Excellency's mo. obed. Servants. Francis Lightfoot Lee. J. Banister.  P.S. Since writing the above General Smallwood mentions in a letter to General Washington,(3) that a fleet of Vessels, ships &c, amounting to near an hundred, had passed by Wilmington and anchored at Reedy Island, he supposes they are going to forage either up the bay or Potomack.

  Honorable Gentlemen York Town 24 March 1778 (1) I cannot consent to omit this oportunity of addressing a few lines to you, though the state of our military operations affords nothing material.  The manners of the Continent are to much affected by the depreciation of our Currency. Scarce an Officer civil or military but feels something of a desire to be concerned in mercantile speculation, from finding that his salary is inadequate to the harpy demands which are made upon him for the necessaries of life, and from observing that but little skill is necessary to constitute one of the merchants of these days. We are almost a continental tribe of Jews, but I hope Heaven has not yet discovered such a settled profligacy in us as to cast us off even for a year. Backward as we may be at this moment in our preparations, the Enemy is not a condition to expect more success in the coming, than in former campaigns. We have the debates of the British Parliament to Decr 5 and perceive that the old game is playing called RECONCILIATION, but, depend upon it, they are duping themselves only.  Yesterday a private letter from Doctor Franklin, dated Octr 7th was presented containing the only political intelligence which Folgier brought safe with him Viz: \""Our affairs, so far as relates to this Country are every day more promising.\"" (2) This with a letter from Mr Barnabas Deane, who tells us his brother apologizes for his brevity by saying \""he was sending an important packet to Congress\"" is all the explanation we have of the nature of your dispatches, of which we were robbed. I enclose a list by which you will see the breaks in our correspondence. I send a pamphlet which contains, I hope, the general ideas of America in regard to what Great Britain may be tempted foolishly to call her successes.  We think it strange that the Commissioners did not jointly write to Mr de Francey, considering the very important designs of his coming over, to settle the mode of payment for the past cargoes sent by Roderique, Hortalez & Co and to make contracts for future.(3) It is certain that much eclaircessement is, at this late moment, wanting.  But I dare not enlarge, for fear of losing this sudden good oportunity. I therefore close with assurances of the most affectionate respect.  Your very humble servant  (Signed) James Lovell, for the Committee for foreign Affairs.  ""

  Sir, 24th March 1778. I am honoured with Your Excellency's favor of the 12th Inst. by the hands of Colo. Armand.  Whatever had been the design, or if it might have been, as Your Excellency charges, intended \""deception\"" of the Board of War I dare again aver, that Congress were not in the project for leaving General Conway in a seperate Command in consequence of recalling Your Excellency & Baron de Kalb from Albany. I have been more than a little astonished by the freedom of Speech in treating upon that Gentleman's Character-severe & harsh sentiments have not only been whispered but loudly sounded in my hearing, & even one Gentleman in whom I know he had reposed the greatest confidence gave him up by a mild declaration that he was afraid General Conway was too indiscreet a Man to be trusted with a Command. Thus are Men deceived in this Rascally World. Poor Conway beleives quite a different Creed. I have not the least doubt but that he has wrapped himself secure in the friendship of some, who by fair & soft personal addresses have tempted him to a confidence, while he is shy of others from whom he has experienced only Candor & plain dealing. God knows what he is, I have not yet fully heard all sides nor have I very deeply considered what I have heard. But this I will venture to say to you Dear Marquis, according to the Maxim of an ancient Lawyer \""whatsoever a Man sowith that shall he reap,\"" if he is deceitful, he is paid in his own Coin. I protest humanity shrinks at hearing Men traduce the Character whom they have taught to place a confidence in them-to hear ferocity, sheer Courage, eminent qualities in the Brute Creation, acknowledged to be the only virtues in the mind of a favorite. Is it possible for Men to speak of a friend as they do of a Mastiff? Then steps in another Set, who attempt to strip him even of that specious Virtue. In a word the General once honoured me by asking for my advice, I gave it honestly, he literally pursued, but indirectly, most effectually contravened it. I have therefore no great encouragement to become a volunteer Councellor, but should my sentiments be again demanded, I would find room for inserting, \""be advised by me General & return to France where there is a greater Croud.\""  MARCH 24, 1778  Congress have ordered a Letter to be written to Your Excellency which I shall Sign by direction & transmit herewith together with a Resolve of yesterday,(2)Ordering General Conway to Peeks Kill under the Command of Major General McDougall, there had been more than a few opinions for ordering him to York Town.  I trust your Excellency will do Congress the Justice to beleive they had never entertained the most remote intention to give you offence. I add & repeat with great pleasure that Your Excellency is held by each Individual in the highest Esteem & the House very much relies upon the greatness of your Mind for security against groundless exceptions to any part of their conduct respecting yourself. These indeed are Sentiments not dictated by Congress, but I know they are warranted. However your Excellency may retort that my declaration in this case will require a little skill to reconcile it with the total Silence on the Subject of the piracy committed upon the packet of 20th Febry.(3) Even this most extraordinary conduct cannot be fairly urged as an exception to the professed Esteem & Regard for Marquis delafayette, although it may be inconsistent with that Veneration which the Representatives of the 13 United States should ever preserve for their own Character if they expect to escape Contempt throughout the Universe. I should have been happy if your Excellency had passed that affair over for reasons which I had assigned but since it has been talked of & since the parties accused are acquainted with the circumstance, I am made very unhappy by a conduct which will endanger us to be exposed to future & greater Insults.  It is impossible to do anything for the officers mentioned by Colo. Armand until the arrangement at Camp is completed & tis probable Your Excellency will meet the Committee there. I shall then transmit a Duplicate of Mr. Duplessis Commission & of the Resolve upon which it is founded.(4)  It appears to be more & more the wish & purpose of Gentlemen here to return General Gates to his late Command in the Northern department & there was lately the appearance of a pretty little attempt to render that Command Independent of all Orders but those of Congress.(5) This will account to you at once for the silence on that head. How Major General McDougall may approve of being superceded after he shall have gone through the drudgery of Mechanical operations in & about the River is a matter of uncertainty.  With respect to Great Britain, beleive me Sir, Administration was greatly shocked by the Account of Mr. Burgoynes surrender but it does not appear from any hints dropped on their part that they were disposed to terminate the dispute with America by any thing like a Concession to Independence. There may & there possibly will be attempts to treat for peace & accomodation some time before the ordinary course of opening the Campaign, but I do not expect any thing  substantial to follow, but blows. In the mean time the Monied people of England are really alarmed & begin to subscribe for the support of the War. This is a maneuvre which I always dreaded, if the infection spreads our American troubles will not soon be removed. On this side the Water there is too much ground to fear some grand exertion, or some injurious sly stroke, will appear against Valley Forge, Wilmington or perhaps York Town before General Washington is sufficiently reinforced to admit of detachments or even of facing the Enemy with his whole present Army.  I most sincerely wished your Excellency a seperate Command, but since that has not happened, with equal earnestness I wish to hear of your Excellency's safe arrival at Valley forge, where possibly this may kiss your hand & upon that presumption Colo Armand means to take the Camp in his Route.  I dare not detain that Gentleman a moment longer, he is as impatient to be gone as he would be if he was going to be Married, he will admit of no delay. He has experienced none from me as an Individual. I have the honour to be with the most sincere Esteem dr Regard &ca.  [P.S.] Inclosed are two Letters left here for your Excellency.  ""

They inform that all the Women & Children belonging to the British Troops were gone to New York and the Invalids gone to England. That the Troops were making preparation for Embarking, and the Officers had been heard to say that General Howe had given orders for them to be in Readiness to sail for Philadelphia by the 20th of MARCH 24, 1778  March. It is conjectured Genl.

He is a very honest Fellow who has never received any Pay for the Period of his Imprisonment from the 25th of Sepr. 1775 to the 15 of July 1777.

If he should be again under the Necessity of doing it upon the Subject of his Wages, I hope you will consider him as a brave faithful Soldier upon the proof of my knowing his Behavior some months in Prison and hearing Col Allens Testimony of his former Conduct. Perhaps the Colonel will shortly be at Liberty to patronise the Lads who long suffered with him. In the mean time I shall write to the major of the Regiment in which Gray is serving at Lancaster, that your Excellency may not be interrupted by this Subject further unless it should be found unavoidable.(1)  By a Letter from Martinique of the 26th of Janry.(2) it appears that the General there gives the fullest encouragement to the American Cruisers, that the Duty of 1 per Ct. on prize Goods was regularly received at the Custom House, and that the Governor of Antigua is outrageous with the French General and impatiently threatens him with \""the Resentment which may arise in the Breast of his Britannic Majesty\"" when the Affair shall be represented to him.

If they get Possession of this State they may easily keep up their Army. The General says few of the drafts \""Said to have been made in Virginia & Carolina\"" are arrived at Camp. He desires that none may halt on their march under Pretence of getting equipt. The Carolina Troops who marched last fall are not up as far even as this Place.  The Virginia Volunteers would do well to come into Service if a formidable Body can be induced to venture out on this most critical occasion. It is not improbable that Genl. Howe expecting Troops from England either late in the Season or not at all is determined, as he knows the weak State of our Army, to make an Effort against it before Recruits shall arrive to reinforce it.  I thought it my duty to give you this Intelligence before they can reach you 'thro the slow Movements of Congress, that so happily Virginia may be active in rescuing a Sister State perhaps an Army from Ruin. The Signal Service of being instrumental in such good needs not a Comment. I am with every Respect Sir your Excellencys Mo. Obed. Servant, J Banister  [P.S.] Another embarkation is made at New York & I am clear they are drawing all to a Point in which we should imitate them.  ""

  My dear sir York in Pennsylvania 27th March 1778 I am much obliged to You for a particular Relation of the principles upon wch. the Convention at N Haven proceeded, in forming their Resolutions relative to the fixing Prices; Congress have been so much engaged since the Receipt of the Acts of the Convention, as not to have been able to express their opinion upon them, but I have not heard from any Gentleman the least Hint of Disapprobation & for my own part think You have conducted upon true principles of policy.(1) I fully agree with You upon the Salutary Effects wch would  MARCH 27, 1778  result from lessening the Quantity of Money in Circulation, & wish to have your Opinion upon the Expediency of attempting to take from the Continental Currency 15 or 20 Millions of Dollars, by stopping the Circulation & obliging the Holders to invest their Money in Loan office Certificates; this is in agitation & inter nos, I shall endeavour to push it thro. I need not assure You, that nothing shall be wanting on my part, to urge the States to a Compliance with the Resolution of Congress for taking their Money out of Circulation, since I have ever entertained the most sanguine Hopes from such a Measure.  I am glad to find that the Commissioners are in Earnest upon the business of investigating the Causes of the shameful Failure of the Expedition against Newport, & hope that they will be able to give a good account of the Matter. Congress have passed a Resolution relative to the Time & Expence of the Commissioners, Copy of wch is inclosed.(2) It is certainly right that the former should be considered as well as the latter, & the Commissioners must be judges of a Reasonable allowance.  Congress have not received returns from the southern Conventions of their proceedings upon the regulating Business. There is a Delay in the Matter & I am not yet informed of the Cause of it.  With respect to General Burgoyne & the other prisoners of the Convention, the Council of M Bay are desired to make a proper Disposition of them & have full powers for this purpose.  I want to say much more on many subjects but am obliged to attend the House on a Business of Importance & conclude with my best respects to all Friends, yours very sincerely, E Gerry  ""

  27th March 1778. I was honoured this Morning Dear & much Respected Marquis by the receipt of your favor of the 20th.(1)  What branch of any of my Letters, the inadvertent disclosure of which could have occasioned you pain-It is most certain I never intended to communicate & I am persuaded I have not promulged sentiments inconsistent with the Interests of the public nor derogatory to the honor of my Station; & perfectly sure I am from the integrity of my heart that I have written nothing which can be construed into slander. It would be indecent to whisper across a Street & impertinent to read my private correspondences to every Man who calls to see me, but while I am peculiarly careful not to expose what is intrusted to me in the Letters of my friends, I am equally anxious for the fate of my own. I may safely be so since I cautiously avoid every thing inflammatory, every thing like party whisper & every thing that can spread the present deplorable discord.  If I judge truly, the \""little article,\"" which Your Excellency alludes MARCH 27, 1778  to, is the Postscript of my Letter the 6th Inst.(2) I read that to General Gates & the fact was public, therefore the intimation can give no offence. In a word permit me to assure Your Excellency that neither the manner nor the matter of the late disclosure affects me with the Slightest degree of Chagrin, except my feelings for the vexation which that circumstance had given you.  Your Excellency's Letter to Congress is Reported & Committed to a Select Committee. Our business of this nature proceeds slowly, therefore I will not detain the Messenger but return him to morrow Morning with this. Such determinations as Congress may make in consequence of the expected Report from Committee will in all probability meet you at Valley forge.(3) I presume you will commence your retrograde journey soon after the return of the present bearer.  An authentic account from Holland of 25th October assures us the States have demanded restitution for a Dutch Ship taken in the Channel by an English Man of War under pretences of her being American built-that all the capital Houses in Trade (Hope & Comp. excepted) have united in application for Convoys to their West India Trade & that the number of friends to American Independence increased daily in that Country.(4)  Yesterday a Gentleman from Virginia imported a peice of intelligence of extraordinary magnitude-which had just arrived from the French West Indies. France, Spain, Portugal, Prussia & Poland have concurred in sentiments to recognize the Independence of these United States. I will not say this is impossible but have advised the printer to preface the Account by such an apology as will save him hereafter from the charge of forgery.  Your determination Dear Marquis to do nothing which may in any degree injure the American Cause is the fruit of a Noble Heart- indeed were you to retire at this Instant unhappy consequences.(5)  ""

  Sir Providence. March 27th 1778. We did ourselves the honor of addressing you on the 13th Feby. last upon the subject of our proceedings in pursuance of the Resolve of Congress of Decemr 12th for enquiring into the causes of the failure of the Expedition against Rhode Island.(1) We then inform'd your Honor that after spending a Week on the business & not being able to finish it we adjourned to the 23d of March at which time we met & have finished the Enquiry in the best manner we found ourselves Capable; & we hope the manner in which we have executed it will give Satisfaction to the Honble. Congress. We are very sorry the Execution of this Commission has been so long delayed, & we wish to satisfy the Honble. Congress that it has MARCH 27, 1778  not arisen from a want of due attention in us who were honored with the appointment; the severity of the season at which the Enquiry was appointed, the exceeding badness of the travelling, our previous Engagements in public business of great importance, were the real causes.  The business of our Commission is a matter of such great expectation & Concern, that it was with great reluctance we enter'd upon it with a bare quorum of the Commissrs. & nothing but the Idea of embarrassing the Administration of Congress by neglecting their requisition, & the danger of having this matter too far postponed or totally neglected, induced us to undertake it. We hoped for the assistance of Mr Benson on the Adjournment, but have not been happy enough even to hear from him on the subject.  In pursuance of this business we have attended to the Questions pointed out in our Commissn. & have proposed them to every person whom we could judge capable of answering them & we have proposed some other questions which we thought tended to throw light on the subject; we have also collected all the proceedings & determinations of all Councils of War, & the opinions of each member of Council & all other papers respecting the matter which have come within our knowledge; we have also procured a Copy of the Enquiry made by Committees from the New England States, into the causes of the failure of this Expedition, all which we herewith transmit.  In the execution of this business certain expences have arisen, some of which, viz. Waiter, Expresses procured by our order by the Sheriff, Wood & Candles, The Honble. the Council of the State of Rhode Island proposed advancing on Acct. of the United States, but it was thot more convenient the Accounts should be paid by Mr. Tillinghast Continental Agent after they had been examined & allowed by the Honble. Council of War; & accordingly we drew an Order on Mr. Tillinghast for that purpose, as also for 28 Dollars for the Clerks & also for 200 Dollars for the actual expences of the three Commissioners on their first meeting, & we have proceeded in the same manner for the expence of this meeting being 32 Dollars for the Clerks, & 78 Dollars for the actual expences of the Comissnrs. and stated the same in Acct. to Mr. Tillinghast. As the Honble. Congress had given no direction for the payment of these expenses, we thought the method we have taken would be most satisfactory, & hope it will prove so.

  My Dear Son, 29th March 1778. In a very few words let me acknowledge the Receipt of your favors of the 22d & 25th Inst.(1)  General Duportail is a sensible Man & I beleive merits the highest respect-had it been necessary he might have commanded my services. Count Poulaski is gratified by a Resolve of Congress for raising an Independent Corps.  Neither Mr Duplisses nor Mr De Balme have deposited any Books with me, unless there should be some in the Coffers of the latter which he has lodged in this House under my protection.  I listen attentively to your reasonings & flatterings for inducing me to continue in the present appointment. No Man has so much influence over me as my worthy friend my Virtuous Son John Laurens. If after half an hours conversation he will confirm his present advice, I will be governed by it, but I think he will then veiw things in a different light. However I am not determined-you know I never do determine until it becomes necessary. When Mr. Drayton & Mr. Mathews arrive I shall make an arrangement for an interview with you provided I determine on a Journey Southward.  Present me respectfully to Baron Stuben, he has always my warmest wishes & I will express them in a Letter in a very few days. The Brevets to his Aids de Camp were intended to intitle those Gentlemen to Rank, pay & Rations.(2) I think if those Commissions were not, they ought to have been intimated to the General. I will look into that matter to morrow or as soon as I can, but I am weary of troubling Congress with my opinions & sentiments on Army Etiquet. Your General has not the Talent of our Colo. O Roberts. Otherwise whenever Congress overleaped him, he would, & perhaps in a quite different Stile, give the necessary hint. It grieved me the other day, as it has done upon many similar occasions, to be made the Instrument of transmitting positive orders to the Commanding Officer of a detachment from General Washingtons Army without passing through the Medium of the General. I spoke of it & intreated to pursue a regular course, the answer was by a Gentleman who entertains high notions of the sublimity of his own judgement. What Sir have not Congress a right to give what Orders they please to their Officers? Is it possible I can err in being of a contrary opinion with necessary references to that respect which is due to a Commander in Chief & to the well ordering & safety of the Army. Consider I intreat you & answer me. I refer in this Instance to a late Order to General Smallwood (3) a Copy of which you will find inclosed & my inquiry is for information. If I am right in my present Idea, I have been so in a numberless past Instances & I will speak to MARCH 29, 1778  the Members out of Congress & put them upon their guard against improper Acts which I am persuaded have not been pursued from any design to affront the General. Some Men hold power & omniscience to be Synonymous, I do not. Inclosed with this I transmit you a Letter which I have just received of the 8th March from my good friend the late President Rutledge together with his Speech to the Council & Assembly of So Carolina in the Act of his Resignation,(4) an Act which involves very momentous considerations & upon which I formed my Judgement, upon the first veiw, I am not ignorant that this may be called a moot point the question admitting much debate & of very refined argumentation, to be determined, or perhaps more properly, undecided by nice Casuistry. An honest plain answer will contain your Sentiments & I will candidly inform you mine & compare Notes. That Restless Spirit continues like the troubled element in which he has been so long dabling I mean an old Neighbor of ours.(5) I see he has been at the bottom of this untoward event. As there subsists a friendship between your General & Mr. Rutledge I think it will not be improper to offer the General a perusal of these papers. If he will take that trouble & shall think proper to disclose his opinion I am persuaded it will afford Mr. Rutledge pleasure & will be very complimentary to me. General Duportail hurried me into an opinion that I should not have had time to fill half the 1st page, otherwise I would have addressed my Son on a more decent piece of paper. You will excuse me & be assured of my continued Ardent Love & increasing Esteem & Respect.  [P.S.] Carefully return Mr. Rutledge's Letter &ca & soon.  ""

  Dear Sir, York Town, 30 March 1778.(1) I had the honor to write you the 25th Ultimo & 7th Inst. acknowledging your favor of the 11th January,(2) and pursuance to your request, & my duty, I shall proceed to give you every information in my power relative to the Public Weal.  About two Months ago Congress sent a Committee of their Body to Camp in order to consult with the General upon a mode for regulating the Army. Mr Danna, one of that Committee is returned with a Report for the new arrangement of the Army in which it is proposed to reduce the present establishment to 88 Battalions, each to consist of one Colonel, one Lieut Colonel, one Major, six Captains, one Capt. Lieut., Eight Lieuts, nine Ensigns, The Staff to be appointed out of the Line. The Qr. Mrs. General for the Grand Army are already appointed, vizt Major Genl. Green, with a Col. Cox & Mr. Pettit (both of this state) as assistant Qr. Masrs. General. There has been great complaints of neglect & peculation in this department, into which a strict inquiry will be made.  The Report proposes half pay to all Commissioned Officers on the new Establishment, who shall remain in the service at the end of the War. Congress has already employed a Week, de diem in diem, debating warmly upon this point, & nothing yet determined. The half pay scheme meets with great opposition, the House divided in a Committee of the Whole, the Question not yet put, but will I believe tomorrow, if carried in the affirmative (wch is still with me a doubt) it will be for a limmited term of years, & not for life.(3)  By a letter from General Washington receivd last night, we are informed the Enemy are preparing for an Expedition.(4) They have  MARCH 30, 1778  ordered Troops from Rhode Island & Nw. York round to Philadelphia, from which Manoeuvre the General conjectures, that they do not expect any considerable reinforcemts from Europe this Campaign, or they would not take the Field so early. Should their designs be against Genl. Washingtons Army, it is at present in a weak State. Should they be routed, or obliged to retreat, from the negligence of Quarter & Forrage Masr, they have not Horses to bring off their Artillary & Military Stores &c.  Governor Casswell from N. Carolina is on his march with 5000 Volunteers for the Grand Army, and Virginia has 5000 more, but we know not as yet what has been collected in the other states by Inlistments or drafts. If the public reports we have from abroad be true, we have nothing more to do than to exert ourselves this Campaign, & our Independence will have a permenant Establishment.  Our Magazeens of Provisions are filling daily, especialy of the bread kind and we have lately advice of the arrival of large Supplys of Arms, Amunition, & Cloathing, in the out Ports, both to the Eastward & Southward, but from the badness of the roads & scarcety of Waggons, few as yet have been conveyed to the Army.  I forgot to inform you that it has been also moved in a Committee of the Whole, that a bounty should be given to the Soldiers at the end of the War, of fifty dollars each & a suit of Cloths, over and above the bounty of Land formerly voted.  The Marquis de la Fyette is in high esteem with the Congress. He appears to be a nobleman, with a high sence of honor, & I hope nothing will be done to give him the least disgust.  The Polish General Polasskey is appointed to raise an Independent Corps of sixty Draggoon, with 200 light Infantry, to Rank a Brigdr General; I believe he will prove a valuable Officer.  Congress is anxious to know if the Forts on Hudson River are carrying on with Vigour as they have the security of that River very much at Heart; such has been the large demands for money that the Treasury was nearly exhausted, but hope it is now in such a train, as to be soon and amply replenished.  General Wayne with a party made lately an excursion into the Jerseys where he was followed by a party of the Enemy. They skirmished & were driven back with the loss of Eight or nine taken & some wounded, Genl. Wayne distroyed large quantities of forrage & returned. The Enemy took from us a drove of 120 black Cattle near Corrells ferry on the West side the Delaware comming for our Camp. If General Washington is not soon reinforced, I fear he will be obliged to quit his ground & cross the Sassquehanna. Should that happen, the Enemy will have the States of Pennsylvania, Delaware & Maryland in their possession, & Virginia must be our Asylum.  My worthy Collegue Colo. Duer returned to Congress last week, so that now our State is represented. Mr. G. Morris is still at Camp, we expect he will join us in a fortnight.  The following is exctract from a letter I this day received a Baltimore. \""In a Vessell that arrived here last Monday from Martinque, a gentleman came Passinger who reports that Mr. Bingham shewed him a letter, which he received from Parris, the day before this Gentlm left the Island, the purport of which was that Doctor Franklin was received by the French Court as Ambassador from the United States of America, & that a packet for Congress came in this Vessell which was landed on the Eastern Shore.\"" The packet here mentiond, is not as yet received by Congress.  We have also this day received a letter from a Capt of French Ship of 32 Guns 170 Men just arrived at Nuburn N. Carolina, with a Valuable Cargo consisting of Articles suitable for our American Army, of which he makes an Offer to Congress. I have a list of the several Articles, but time will not permit me to send you a Copy. Let it suffice, when I say, that in my opinion we have lately arrived on this Continent a sufficiency of Supplys for our present wants, nay more, if they were properly collected to their respective magazeens.

If Marquis delafayette had been upon the Spot he might have added to the Sum which I have paid Mr. Bell for his Waggon here, but I think I have gone as far as appear to be equitable & have exceeded the Sum you agreed for. I have paid him 470 Dollars equal to £188-upwards of three pounds per day for a light load out, & empty return is certainly a very enormous price with which Mr. Bell seems satisfied.  ""

  Dear Ma'am York Town Apr. 1st. 1778 When I tell you that no Credit is to be given to the late Report of an attempted Assassination of Doctor Franklin, you are not to attribute my Assertion to an Endeavour to give Relief, at all Adventures, to the anxious Mind of an amiable Sufferer. Had your Letters of the 1st. and 8th of March (1) reached me before this Morning, I could not have given you so much Satisfaction as at present. I could only have told you that no Letter of mine had \""confirmed\"" the Report. I did, it is true convey it to Boston, in hopes that I should procure a Contradiction of it, by Intelligence received at the eastern Ports later in Date than what Capt. More brought to Maryland. He left Bordeaux the 12th. of December and had pickt up his Story at Blaye before that period. But we have a fresh Packet from Mr. Bingham Our Agent at Martinique in which he gives us the Substance of Letters from Paris dated Decr. 22d, ten Days after More left his Outport.(2) Mr. Bingham's Correspondents are certainly a Class of Men who could not be ignorant of a capital Event respecting our Commissioners near a Fortnight after it is said to have happened, and who also would not have omitted to mention the Attempt upon Doctr. Franklin's Life, if it had really been made. The Connecticutt Gazettes tell us the Doctor was well about the 31st of December.  Call me not a Savage, when I inform you that your \""Allarms and Distress\"" have afforded me Delight.  I assure you, Ma'am, that my Intimates think me not devoid of the most tender Sensibilities: But, if you expect that your Griefs should draw from me only sheer Pity, you must not send them to call upon me in the most elegant Dresses of Sentiment and Language; for, if you persist in your present course, be it known to you before hand,  APRIL 3, 1778  that I shall be far more prompt to admire than to compassionate Them.  I do not at all recollect the subject of those letters which you mention to have fallen under your eye after the sailing of the Boston, I rely altogether on your discretion to burn or foward them.(3) I have a degree of curiosity to know what was the purport of that from which you scratched the name, and delivered it to the Judgement of Genl.

  Sir, Yorktown, April 3d, 1778. When I attended the general assembly of this state in December last, they obtained a promise that I would give a little assistance in draughting some bills at their adjournment in March, at which time I, accordingly, in pursuance of a letter from the speaker, went to Lancaster, and, having stayed there ten days, returned to York on the l9th. During this interval, your favour of the 4th of March,(1) by lieutenant Frazer, arrived at York, and by the advice of the express, was opened by the president and read in congress. It was well there was nothing private in it, and I must confess you gave me more agreeable prospects of our little state, and more sincere pleasure, than any thing relating to it had done for three years past. I congratulate you on the whig election in Sussex. With such a general assembly as the present, which could I have done, or rather, could I not have done? Sure I am, you will make a proper use of this most APRIL 3, 1778  fortunate occurrence, in which there appears visibly the hand of Providence, which can alone save this deluded state. Though the resolve for completing the quota of troops, by draughting in the several states, passed against my consent, yet as Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the four New England governments, &c. have agreed to it, I should have been glad if the general assembly had even proceeded no farther in that business; this would have showed a respect for the recommendation of congress, encouraged the recruiting service by making it the interest of every individual in the state, and prevented an opinion that I had wrote to the general assembly against the measure, which I never did; nor, indeed, did I ever hint the matter to any person whatever. AS to the proviso in the second section of article 9th of the confederation, quoted by you, to wit; \""provided also that no state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States,\"" my opinion is, that it must be referred to the subject matter of the preceding paragraph, and may, by a fair construction, mean, that in a contest between two states respecting boundaries, the territory taken from the one shall be added to the other, and not adjudged for the benefit of the United States; and yet I confess I have apprehensions, that it may, hereafter, be insisted to mean what you seem to fear. Some gentlemen with whom I have conversed on this affair say, if the intention of congress was, that Virginia, &c. should be deemed at present to extend to the south sea, yet no injury could arise from thence to any of the United States; for that Delaware, for instance, has a right to apply for one or more townships for their troops, to be laid out equally with Virginia in that state, without paying any purchase money or any other expense, more than that of surveying, &c. which Virginians themselves must pay; and that, if that state increases in inhabitants, it will have to pay more towards the support of the government of the United States, and in the same proportion lessen the burden of the other states, but if Virginia, &c. grow too large, the people themselves will insist upon a new state or states to be erected, even if the congress should be passive; and no good reason can be assigned for refusing such a requisition, whenever it may be proper to grant it. The Stockbridge Indians in New Hampshire and Connecticut, the Oneidas in New York, &c. were I suppose the objects of the 4th section of the same article: The 3d section of article 9th, seems to have been calculated for the disputed lands between purchasers under Maryland and Delaware, and Maryland and Pennsylvania; but upon the whole, it may not be an improper method of adjusting such controversies. If Delaware had been represented in congress, at the time the finishing was given to the confederation, it would, I am persuaded, have been a public benefit, as well as a particular one to that state; but matters are too far gone, I fear, to procure any alterations, so many states have   already empowered their delegates to ratify it; however, I will exert every nerve to accomplish any measure which shall be recommended by my constituents, who may think it advisable to direct their deputies to endeavour to procure any explanation of certain doubtful expressions in different articles, if they should not think it proper to do more.  Nothing has been effected with regard to president M'Kinley;(2) but as the cartel for a general exchange is now debating, and settling between three commissioners on the part of general Washington, and the like number on the part of general Howe, in Germantown, where they met on the last day of March, I hope in a few weeks, something favorable for him may be done.  If you can procure any clothing for the Delaware battalion, it may be useful, but I am confident there is sufficient for the whole army, already purchased by congress, for above a year; and yet I am told the most of the troops are naked-peculation, neglect of duty, avarice, and insolence, in most departments abound; but, with the favor of God, I shall contribute my part to drag forth and punish the culprits, though some of them are high in rank, and characters I did not suspect.  You will also receive a little pamphlet of the earl of Abington's, which is worth your perusal.(3) General Rodney is not yet arrived, nor could I procure a lodging for him in town when he comes; indeed, when I return, I shall be at an equal loss for myself; this is discouraging, but we must not expect much comfort during this great and glorious struggle. It is reported Howe is recalled, and is to be succeeded by lord Townshend: this will be an active, and I fear a bloody, campaign.  April 12th, at Lancaster. I find you give up the command in chief to general Rodney, so that perhaps it may suit you to come to congress.(4)  I am, Sir, Your most obedt. friend, Thos.

JCC, 10:246.  2 See McKean to Read, February 12, 1778, note 2.  3 McKean doubtless enclosed a copy of the Earl of Abingdon's Thoughts on the Letter of Edmund Burke, Esq. to the Sheriffs of Bristol, on the Affairs of America (Oxford, 1777), which had just been reprinted in Lancaster by John Dunlap. For further information on Abingdon's pamphlet, see John Henry to Thomas Johnson, February 17, 1778, note 2.  4 On March 31 the Delaware Assembly elected Caesar Rodney, a brigadier general  in the state militia, to replace Read as president of Delaware, Read having served as acting president since John McKinly's capture by the British in September 1777.

So great and so frequent have been the demands on the Treasury for that necessary article that it hath been out of our power to furnish the Navy Board agreeable to our wishes. It is on this account principally that we have wrote to them directing them to stop the building of the seventy four gun ship at Portsmouth.(1) You will drop the building of her for the present & take proper measures for securing and seasoning the Timber provided for her.

A new Committee was immediately appointed, these Gentlemen some 8 or 10 days ago offered a Report, when Mr. Duer interposed arguments which induced the House to postpone the Consideration for two days. I have taken the liberty to name that Gentleman because his declared motives for delay were coupled with assurances of particular considerations respecting General Schuyler.

  Sir, York-Town April 5th 1778 Since my last nothing new hath occurred at home, and by the unfortunate shipwreck of Capt. Weeks and the robbery of the Dispatches committed to the care of Capt. Folger we have been disappointed of the Intelligence expected from France.(1) We have received no advices from our Commissioners since last May; so that I have nothing to communicate, from that quarter, which can be depended upon. The indirect news, published in the inclosed NewsPaper, from Martinico came from a good hand, and deserves as much credit as any account that does not procede immediately from the fountain .(2)  A Number of ships lately arrived at Philadelphia, it is said, with APRIL 5, 1778  Soldiers from New-York, and we have a report from the eastward that the Troops at Rhode-Island were embarking to reinforce Genl. Howe, with a view to enable him to make an efficacious attack upon our encampment before the recruits from the several States shall have joined the main army. It is of the utmost importance that the states should fill up their battalions and send them forward immediately. I find that my information, respecting the negroe Regiment, was not good.(3)Since I had the honour of writing to you, one of the committee from camp hath informed me that it was not the intention that we should have two battalions in the field, that the surplusage of our recruits, above the number necessary to complete our one battalion, was to remain in the state so long as it should continue to be invaded. Inoculation is carried on in camp with such great success that recruits may come forward without any reluctance. Out of three thousand six hundred, which were lately inoculated at Valley forge, eleven only died of the small pox.  An Important questions are on the carpet, whether an establishment of half pay for life or term of years shall be allowed to military commissioned officers who shall continue in service to the end of the war? Whether any provision shall be made for the widows of those Officers who have fallen or shall fall in battle, and whether some allowance shall be made to such soldiers as inlist during the war and shall continue in the service to the end of the war? The first is the great question. A Question of such magnitude, in my opinion, that I am one of those who think that it ought to be referred to the consideration of the States. At present it is postponed at large.(4) When it shall be resumed it will be moved that it should be so referred; but whether the motion will meet with success or not is uncertain. I could wish to be instructed by my constituents how to give my voice especially on the capital question; will beg leave to expect it. If I should be called upon, before I receive the Instructions I wish, and shall expect, to give my vote, I shall do it as shall appear to me to be right, and if I should not jump in Judgment with my constituents I hope I shall not be censured.  Congress have recommended it to the States to transmit as early as possible such Acts as they have passed in pursuance of Resolutions of Congress, since the first, I think it is, of November last. I wish that our state may attend to the recommendation. I have not received any authentic Information of what hath passed our Assembly for a long time, and what I have heretofore received were such abridgments of Acts as were of but little use.  The circumstances of my family are such as to necessitate my return home immediately after the election, I hope therefore that the Assembly will order on to Congress, the Delegate which may be chosen directly. By a private Letter I am informed that your Ex-  cellency means to resign.(5) I am sorry for It behoves at this time, especially, that sound patriots should fill the several offices in Government. Whether you continue in or go out of office, I shall always entertain a high regard for your excellency on account of that sound steady patriotism which you have discovered and preserved during your administration, and am with the greatest Respect, your Excellency's most obedient, humble, William Ellery  [P.S.] Please to excuse interlineations & incorrectness.

We have since heard that she is arrived at Boston and carried in two or three Prizes.(2) We should be glad to get the Providence APRIL 6, 1778  and other armed Vessels out of the River, and at a less expence than we find will attend it, but they must be got out let the expence be what it may, if it should be practicable and from the success that hath attended such attempts we infer its practicability. We highly approve of the Conduct of the Board in getting out the Warren and don't doubt but that they will exert themselves in getting out the Providence & Columbus, especially as the season for brisk, steady north winds will in a Short time be over, and we are sure that you will exercise frugallity wherever it may be beneficial.  The Demands upon the Treasury from the great departments of the Army are so large and frequent that they cannot be supplied. We have however procured Three Warrants-One on the Loan Office of New Hampshire for 30,000 Dollars-One on Massachusets Bay for 40,000, and One on Connecticut for 30,000 making 100,000 Dollars transmitted herewith for the use of your Board.(3) We chose to have them on those different States, because Money will be wanted in each. If the Money cannot be had at the offices, the Certificates may be disposed of-you will take care that Mr. Langdon hath his share. We have already advised you that we have paid Mr. Shaw 40,000 Dollars and charged the same to your Account, part of which money we presume will be applied towards fitting out the Trumbull &c. The Warrants we returned to you corrected we are glad to find have reached you.  We have determined to stop the building of the Seventy four at Portsmouth for the present, and desire you will give orders accordingly, and for seasoning of the Timbers prepared for her. You will man and equip the Warren with all possible dispatch and order her out on a Cruize to the West Indias with directions to Captain Hopkins to apply to Mr. Bingham at St. Pierre Martinico or Mr. Ceronio at Cape Francois, Hispaniola, for such supplies as he may Chance to want, and send the Prizes he may take to their address or to the Continent as he may judge proper. You will further direct him towards the Close of his Cruize to go to Cape Francois, call upon Messrs. Ceronio & Carrabasse for such goods as they may have to ship and take in what he can conveniently bring to the Continent without hurting the Ships sailing. You will furnish us with a Copy of the Instructions you shall give him.  By the Notes in the Margin and endorssment on the Account which you sent to us for inspection, and which we now remit you will see what part thereof is allowed and what rejected.  Before discharging the wages of those and any other Continental officers, you will procure from the Continental Agents in your district accounts of the Monies they have paid them on that score. We have ordered the Paymaster of the Navy in this district James Read Esqr to transmit to you a State of Captain Olneys Account, and the Ac-  counts of such other officers now in the Eastern Department as may have received any Monies of him.(4) Enclosed is a Resolve of Congress respecting the pay, Rations and allowances of Officers not in Actual service and during their Captivity and under Parole.(5) We wish Vessels for the flour and Iron speedily. We congratulate Captain Rathbourne upon his success, but cannot think he is entitled to the whole of the ship Mary and her Cargo. The question was put in Committee & they came to the following Resolution-\""It is the opinion of this Committee from the representation of the said Board, that by the Resolves of Congress the Captors are only intitled to One half of said Vessel & Cargo.\"" Enclosed is a Copy of the Resolves referred to.(6) You will see that a Claim is put in on behalf of the Continent. We shall write to Mr. Landais by this opportunity-it is out of our power to comply with his wishes.(7) We have a number of Captains out of employ, and it would be imprudent to pass by them. We shall immediately write Samuel Tuder and Captain Lawrence at Poughkeepsie on Hudsons River to send forward to you at Boston the sails of the two frigates, which were saved at the time said frigates were burned and which is in their possession, If they should receive directions from you therefore.(8) One of those frigates was 28 and the other 24 Guns. The sails of the 28 may suit one of the Ships building at the Eastward as they are large, and the sails of the 24 may suit for some of the sails of the other. You may direct both or either of the suits of Sails of these burned frigates to Boston or Norwich or part to one place or part to the other as you shall judge proper-they had two suits each. We are satisfied with your report respecting Mr. Roche. How he came to be suspended by a Resolve of Congress from his command of the continental ship of war the [Ranger] when he never was appointed to the command of her we cannot tell.(9) Captain Roche laid a plan before Congress, which they referred to the Marine Committee to carry into execution, whereupon they empowered Mr. Langdon to build a Vessel of war, and employed Captain Roche to advise and assist about the building &c. He wrote the Committee a Letter dated the 29th of December last at the close of which he mentions that he had waited with that patience that became a Gentleman in his situation living on his own Money for Six Months, wages &c being stopped ever since his suspension and that he waited impatiently for our further orders. He hath a right, as you have reported in his favour, to his wages, and therefore would have you enquire into what time he hath been paid, and what per month, and pay him off.  We have no vessel to give him the command of without passing by several good Commanders who now hold Commissions and are out of service. If he will accept of a Lieutenancy on board of one of the Frigates and you think him a proper person we shall have no  objections, otherwise we shall not consider him any longer as being in the service of the Continent.  We approve of your altering the name of the Industrious Bee to that of the General Gates altho we think it would have been a higher compliment to have given his name to a frigate. We cannot determine upon a proper person to command the frigate at Salisbury, We would have the berth left open for Captain Manley as he may be exchanged, and for the present the Charge of her be given to the person who you may judge suitable for a first Lieutenant of her. We leave to you to determine respecting the Lieutenants who are desirous to make a Cruize of a few Months. Inclosed are the Rules & Regulations of the Navy. Congress has ordered us to Revise them.(10)If you can suggest any New Rules or alterations that will be necessary, we would be glad you would propose them, and if you can by any means procure a British Privateers Commission, send it forward to us. Coppies of Captain Judds and the Captain of the Jamaica Packets may answer-they were taken by Captain Harding of the Connecticut State ship and their Commissions are in the Maritime Court of the Middle District Massachusets. We have ordered Mr. Barnabas Deane of Connecticut to lay his Accounts against the frigate Trumbull before you,(11) which you will please to examine and transmit to us a Copy of his account Current when we shall give Orders for the paymt. of the balance that may be due to him.  We are Gentlemen, Yr humble Servants (12)  ""

  Dear Sir, York Town, 7th April 1778. I have been in possession of your favour of the 16th March about 8 days. After you are informed that Congress have in the mean time been sitting every day from 9 A M to the same hour at night & some times an hour longer you will not wonder that I have not so fully APRIL 7, 1778  executed every one of your commands as otherwise I should have done, but be assured Sir none of them shall be unnoticed  Your Letter enclosed nothing relative to Mr Holt the name excepted, I remain therefore utterly ignorant of your & his purpose respecting an application of the Money intended for him. You will be so good as to supply this deficiency.(1)  Our Accounts from Great Britain are as you will read in the inclosed Paper-from this City below-no appearance of excursive steps until reinforcements shall be received. Deserters assert possitively that General Howe's Baggage is embarked & that he will follow it immediately upon the arrival of Lord Townsend who is expected daily, to assume the Command. Admitting the embarkation, a change of Command is implied.  An Exchange of Prisoners was intended & Commissioners had met at German Town the 31st March. Last Evening I received dispatches from our General, from whence I infer, the business is interrupted by a late Act of Congress which I transmitted the very day on which the Commissioners had convened.(2) The Letter has not yet been presented to Congress, but has undergone severe strictures from a knot of our friends who called here late at night & conned it over.  I will give no opinion at present, yet I have the vanity to think if you were in York we should not differ; had you been present, certain ambiguities, I do not say contradictions, would not have taken place in our Acts-but this is tender ground. I will wait the event of that debate which in three or four hours I shall hear in the multitude of Counsellors. General Lee in the mean time has reached Valley forge on his Parol only-an actual Exchange it is said would have taken place but for the circumstance just now alluded to.  Intelligence from Fort Pitt, very dark-the Officer McKee who had been at large on Parol, gone off to Detroit & carried with him an Interpreter & four other Men, the Savages engaged in daily butcheries on the guardless Country people. Our Commissioners had at length assembled, they write sensibly & seem resolved to proceed with vigour. Colo. Morgan had passed a stout enquiry & was acquitted with honor & the Court have subjoined to the acquital an handsome recommendation.(3) Since the flight of McKee the minds of the People have been again agitated by suspicions of General Hand who has renewed his intreaties for a successor in order that he may come within.  Baron Stuben has condescended to Act the Drill Master as well as the Inspector in Camp, he has hit the taste of the Officers, gives universal satisfaction & I am assured has made an amazing improvement in discipline. A Young correspondent of mine who is a very honest Man & not very ignorant & who had always regretted the deficiency of discipline, tells me if I were present I should be enchanted by the change suddenly made in the grand Camp.(4)   I am confident if the States are in earnest & will send in reinforcements in time to partake the benefit of the Current reform we shall not be driven much further from the Ocean. The present newly adopted encampment, General Duportail assures me, is tenable against the Enemy's utmost efforts by their present powers.  We are menaced & not slightly, with the loss of all our good Officers unless a Peace establishment is made. This has appeared to me, unjust, unseasonable & a compliance under threats, dangerous & the reasonings in favor of the measures \""a total loss of virtue in the Army,\"" the worst adopted in the whole circle of ratiocination for converting me. In the first place I cannot beleive it-if I could, I would say, every Man to his Tent-tis a matter of indifference to me whether the Tyrants name be George or Dick-not an argument adduced in favor of the measure but will apply generally to every Person zealously engaged in the present dispute & to thousands more forcibly than to our Officers in general. The Remedy proposed is also inadequate to releif, upon the grounds on which the Claim is set up. Half pay to commence seven Years hence will not add a Shirt nor a bottle of Wine to a complainant General Officer in the mean time. I will not be further troublesome at this Instant, I may hereafter submit my sentiments at large to your better judgement with permission. The object is stupendous; veiw it in either light-the danger of losing \""All\"" \""All\"" your \""good\"" Officers-or that of getting \""no more\"" Men & \""losing those you have\""-one of these Evils may be remedied-but from my own feelings I trust, who have already lost a great Estate & am in a fair way to part with the present small remainder, there are many Thousands whose hearts are warm with the reasonings which induced the original Compact & who have not bowed the Knee to Luxury nor to Mammon.  'Tis time to turn to your Letter, from whence I have thus digressed, from casting my eye on your Complaint of the dearth of News. You will forgive all that is said too much, I have not time to retrospect, nor genius nor inclination for refining phrases into no meaning, besides, I dare trust you Sir with my first thoughts, those upon the half pay establishment are rooted in my mind. Hitherto the strongest arguments in favour of the measure have been the necessity, & for avoiding the consecutive threatned evils. The Justice & propriety of the Act would have made some impression upon such a heart as mine, but \""portents & prodigies are lost on me.\"" The project we are clearly informed originated in a sphere above Regimental Command; it was a work extremely practicable to roll it down Hill, the application comes in not directly, but through a medium & Clothed with terror, but whither am I again wandering.  P.M. 3 oClock. I just returned from the Chair, & while the morsel is removing from the Cabouse to the Table, before I take up your  Letter let me add a word. If you delight in contracting an enormous debt to a Crafty powerful foreign State, your absence from this Mornings service has lost you much pleasure.(5) I have executed your several Commands & while I think of it let me add, your public Letter was in due time, presented to Congress & referred to the Board of War from whence I have learned nothing concerning it-unless the Board have included the subject of yours in their Report on General Schuylers Letter, not yet considered in the House.(6)  The arrival of Majr. General McDougall at FishKill has anticipated an answer to your enquiry, who is to command in the Highlands? but, whatever might have been General Washington's intention when he ordered that Gentleman to repair to that Post, tis probable his Command will be but temporary-it has been said & repeated that General Gates must soon take the Field & in your quarter & although this is mere out of door talk, I would wish you to understand it, as said to a Member of Congress.(7) Under the same stipulation if you & I were tete a tete, might attempt to account for the amazing neglect of North River. I might add at least twenty other neglects, & possibly as many Acts which ought to have been neglected, make an aggregate of these & transfer the whole to the debit of the general Account of the thirteen UNITED FREE AND INDEPENDENT States of America. What Representation had ye for upwards of three precious Months, when those things were done which ought not to have been done, & those left undone which ought to have been done. Why-9 States-9 or 11 Members when we could collect them- seldom 15-17 made a very full House. You well know Sir, the unavoidable drudgery of Committees requires more hands. I am not competent to Lecture upon heads, nor need I attempt description to a Gentleman so well acquainted with the sagacity of the Stock which he left upon hand. Be this as it may, I do aver & will maintain the United-States & not their few Pack Horses are blameable. The United States have acted & 'tis far from impossible may be whipped, like Children Often have I lamented the neglected state of North River as well as of many other essential works. Whatever may be the event, I shall feel some consolation from a reflection, which it would be unbecoming to boast of. I still trust we are not quite too late; tis true danger appears. That Lion which I have beheld for three Years past Couchant, always well apprized of his unexerted powers, is now roused, his Eyes flash & he growls; if he has strength to Roar & expand, we shall retrospect with pain. Be it so; let us not be stricken by fear, let us be animated & Wise. There is Wisdom in America, let it be collected, strength & success will be the Issue, but no time is to be lost. I do not hold it impossible, we shall hear of some attempts to accomodation as a prelude to the ensuing Campaign; admit the belief of a change in the Command at Philadelphia & the suggestion   will not appear extravagant, but we need not distress our minds by apprehensions that the very first article will be a confirmation of American Independency, & who can dry eyed contemplate submission?  Your hint respecting a Committee for North River & that department is valuable, but in our meagre state respecting numbers & qualities, can we spare a respectable detachment? When could we have spared such a one? Why, My Dear Sir, may we not appoint Men of abilities including diligence, of the vicinage to act as Commissioners & to receive compensation from the Public for devoting their whole time & attention to the Public service? This consideration if we pursue it will head us into a large field from whence we shall not be able to return before night, therefore let us go back.  The Marquis has indeed as you observe been in an awkward situation. I have sometimes felt pain on his account, but most from an inspective view of consequences which might follow a vindictive assertion of his honour. I trust however that his greatness of mind & his attachment to our Cause will dictate the propriety of seeming a little blind & a little unfeeling upon a late determination.(8) I entertain an high opinion of that Noble personage. As a General & a Commanding Officer I am persuaded he would have given great satisfaction in the Northern department. When I reflect upon the alacrity with which he obeyed the order of Congress to penetrate Canada, his Zeal for the public Interest & upon the propriety of his whole conduct during that short lived Command & at the same time take into view certain concomitants to the Act of remanding him to Valley forge,(9) I admire his magnanimity & grieve for the mistakes of some of our good friends.  If you said any thing in your public Letter relative to your Freind General Schuyler, as I think you did tis not at present in my power to reply particularly; I surrendered the Letter the Morning it came to hand to the Board of War where it now sleeps. We have indulged the New Board in an exceeding bad practice, making Reports & detaining the subject referred, you perceive in an Instant how many inconveniences this produces, one which I feel is, an inability in many Cases to answer Letters with perspicuity & dispatch. ® I am speaking to a Member. I write to the General Officially.  Such Money as may remain in your hands of the trifle intended for St. Lawrence give if you judge it proper to the Child or Children you sometime ago mentioned or to any of my poor fellow Citizens who may have suffered by the hand of violence or the misfortune of War on North River & whom you may think a more necessitous object.  God protect you & yours, free from the assaults of our Enemies, you being safe, your neighbors will be so, I include you all in my prayers & I beg you will beleive I always hold you in a very respect  able light & am with great Regard, Dear sir, Your obedient & Most humble servant. Henry Laurens  Dear sir, 8 April 1778 After your Packet had been sealed up, I discovered a mistake which this is slipped in to inform you of & to save you some trouble. I am in possession of Mr. Holt's Letter & will by the very first opportunity pay into the hand of Mr. Morris or of his Agent here if he does not come within the course of this Week to York, the intended Money 300 Dollars. You may tell that Gentleman now, that 200 comes from a Brother Printer John Wells Junior who lately had his own House in Charles Town burnt over his head in the dreadful conflagration in that Town, but had the good fortune by accumulated assistance to save his vast collection of Books, his household furniture, Paper Types & almost everything & within a Week of the accident proceeded in his Publications.

  Sir Manheim April 7th. 1778 I am honoured with your letter of yesterday & not a little surprized at the Contents of the paper enclosed therein; but I believe & hope the information it contains is founded on Suspicion more than fact.

  My Dear York Town 7 April 1778 I Wrote to you (I beleive it was) the 18 Ultimo which I hope you have recd. This is my fifth Letter to you since I came to this Place (1)-- and which will be sent by Mr Frost a Deligate from N Hamshire or Col Dyer who will probably Return to Morrow.(2) I have heard nothing from you or any of my Freinds since Oliver's Letter of the 4t Ultimo, But as I expect that Brown will Return in about a Forthnight I hope by him to receive a Letter from you. I find that the Conveyance by the Post is so Very uncertain that I shall Venture by him but few Letters whose miscarriage could give me any concern. By the Blessing of God I still injoy my Health and am free from those sundry Disorders which some Time ago so much Afflicted Me. You will therefore suffer no Anxiety on my Account as I hope any Solicitude in that respect will be as unnecessary as it will be unavailable. The same protecting Providence which has hitherto preserved me will I trust Return me to my Family in safety. Your Cares I know must be many besides any Concern for Me. Alleviate them as farr as you can, and put your Trust in the Protection of that Being on whom alone Confidence is to be placed.  Nothing material has Occurred in these Parts since my last. It is reported with some Degree of Credibility that about 1500, or 2000 Troops have lately joined Genl. Howe from N York. Whether merely APRIL 7, 1778  for the Purpose of Stregnthening his Army in Case of an Attack, which I am sorry to say that I see no probability of soon, or to be employed to Act offensively against our Army, is uncertain.  A Scandalous Languor still exists amongst the People of this State. I suspect that they have not yet suffered that Chastisment which is Necessary for them. There Wants nothing (according to human Probability) but a proper Spirit in this People to put an end to the War- But which thro' their infamous Baseness, may be drawn out to a considerable Length, unless the Power of G. Britain should be diverted, by a War with her Neighbours, of which there is no certainty. Material Intligence may be dayly expected, but as you have foraign News earlier at the eastward than We have here, you will probably receive it sooner than any Information I shall be able to give you. The Regulating Acts have no Effect in this State. Nothing of the kind has any Existence at the Southward, and you may depend upon it that the Operation of Acts of this Nature, will soon be suspended or Abrogated every where, And perhaps Congress will Advise to Repeal this Act. You will present my kindest Love to my Children, Family and Freinds, and be assured of My tenderest Affection for you. Oliver Wolcott  P.S.

  Sir 8th April 1778. On the 28th Ulto. I had the honor of receiving & presenting to Congress your favor of the 15th which was immediately referred to the Board of War from whence a Report came up the 3d Inst. but this has not yet although frequently offered, been taken under consideration, consequently I have received no Commands.(1) I have on this & a similar Case detained the bearer hereof from day to day hoping upon each the next would have produced the desired effect at length, persuaded it will save some expense to the public & even afford you Sir, some satisfaction. I have submitted to the importunities of Mr. Green by consenting to his return-but I cannot let him go without adding a word on the Subject which must, most nearly, affect your mind.  Some time in February the Committee appointed to Enquire into the Causes of the loss of Tyconderoga &ca presented such Evidence as APRIL 8, 1778  had been collected to Congress & by order, transmitted the whole to General Washington, & then the Committee were discharged. The General in a Letter of the 27th Febry. intimated a necessity for Stating Charges. A new Committee was thereupon appointed, who soon after offered a Report which was about to be determined upon the 28th Ulto. when the Honorable Mr. Duer interposed arguments which induced the House to postpone the intended consideration for two days. I take the liberty to name that Gentleman because his declared motives for delay were coupled with assurances of particular considerations respecting General Schuyler & because there can be no ground for doubting the goodness of his intentions. On the 4th Inst. I called on Mr. Duer, reminded him of his engagement & urged the painful situation in which his friend was suspended-yesterday I directed the Secretary to repeat the call. General Washington has again written upon the Subject, I was in hopes this would have proved an incitement, but all remains still dormant. I hope to give no offence, but I will this very Morning remind Congress of the business again.(2)  Be assured Sir, I have long Sympathized with Gentlemen who are Subjects of that Enquiry, abstracted from all Ideas of Censure or applause, & although it was with extreme reluctance I obeyed the order of Congress to be of the Original Committee after having offered such reasons for exemption as appeared to me to be forcible, yet I cannot charge my Self with delinquency at any stage in the course of our proceedings. To account for the uncouth entangled State of this enquiry would not be half so difficult as it might be improper in the line of official correspondence, therefore I shall only add that my endeavors shall be continued for putting it in motion.

We shall now answer the queries you presented for our consideration in that Letter. first. We have already ordered the Paymaster to remove his office to Baltimore when your Board removes to that place.  2d. We would by all means have the Commissarys store at Bordenton immediately broke up. Congress has resolved that no Rations or Subsistance Money shall be allowed to any officers but such as are in Actual Service-inclosed is the Resolve dated the 20 March last.  3rd We would have you examine the Accounts of your clerk and Treasurer yourselves, and appoint or nominate a new one just as you please.  4th. The Agents at Baltimore will be notified that they are responsible to your Board for the settlement for their Accounts.  As the New Signals for the Navy have been sent to the Navy Board of the Eastern Department and have been given to several Commanders we think it would be improper to alter them at this time, however as it may be necessary hereafter to change the Signals, we would be glad if you would compose a sett.  The want of officers at present makes it impracticable to hold a Court Martial for the trial of the officers who commanded onboard  APRIL 8, 1778  the Continental Vessels that were destroyed in the Delaware. Congress having ordered us to revise the Rules and Regulations of the Navy, we would be obliged to you to propose any alterations or amendments which you may think necessary to be adopted.

We are glad to inform you that the Virginia frigate has got to sea.(1) Mr. Read the Paymaster having represented that the duties of his office did not require his constant attendance he had our permission to transact some business for the Board of war. Congress has not appointed him to any new office-you will please to write to him and advise him to return to his office if he hath not already returned. You have enclosed an account of Maxwell & Loyals which we refer to you for examination. We suppose you will require them to exhibit the particulars of the Charges in the said Account with the vouchers we have marked the drafts paid by this Committee since our removal from Philadelphia, and you have in your Books an account of what had been paid before.

You will take the Commissarys Receipt for those articles and charge him in your Books.

  Sir York Town April 8th 1778.  Understanding from Colo. Cox that the purchase of horses for the army in your state was impeded for want of money, I was led to en- APRIL 8, 1778  quire into the circumstances, as warrants had issued in your favor for 80,000 dollars so long ago as 30th of March. Accordingly I found in the Treasury office one warrant on your Loan Office for 50,000 dollars which is inclosed,(1) & one other on Mr. Hillegas for 30,000 ds. Respecting the latter it will not answer any purpose to rely on it 'till we can get Mr. Rittenhouse to finish what he has in hand.

  York Pensylvania April 9th. 1778. No State has yet absolutely instructed its Delegates to ratify the Confederation except Virginia and New York, and none except those and Connecticut, Maryland and our State have transmitted any instructions at all.(1) The Congress have at present no leisure for entering upon it being much engaged in what relates to the Army. A Committee which has been a long time at Camp, has proposed some alterations in our Military System, tho I think they have not reformed any of its capital abuses which are want of discipline in the men and want of industry in the Officers. They have proposed to reduce the number of battallions from 116 to 88 and the number of Officers in each battallion from 40 to 29.(2)  Two subjects very much engage our attention at present, and we all wish on one of them to be particularly informed of the sentiments of our constituents. These subjects are, a general exchange of prisoners, and an establishment for the Officers of the army after the War. The former meets with many difficulties from the opposite views and interests of the contending powers, and also from the secret wishes of some Officers in the Army. This last is conjecture, but many of us are convinced of the reality of its foundation. The enemy want their men and officers, but are very unwilling to let us avail ourselves of the experience and abilities of General Lee, we want the General and have determined that his releasement shall take place, or no exchange at all be permitted. We insist that the enemy shall pay for the provisions we give their troops, when prisoners, in hard money, or replace them in Quantity and Quality. They are unwilling to agree to this. We are desirous that all traitors should be delivered over to the Civil Magistrate to be punished agreeable to the Laws of the States to which they respectively belonged. The Enemy are unwilling to admit this distinction, but desire all to be considered as prisoners of war. Finally Sir we are many of us persuaded that some Officers in the Army wish not for the release of General Lee because his enterprising disposition and martial genius will be a strong contrast to their want of both, and we find by undoubted testimony, that it is a prevailing opinion in the Army that no regard ought to be paid to the Penal Laws of the States in settling the exchange of Prisoners but that all ought to be deemed prisoners of War. A letter from General Washington relative to this affair is now before Congress wherein he recommends that the Laws be suffered to sleep in his expression, and that a rule of practice be adopted directly contrary to them; but this proposal met with very great and almost general opposition and indignation in Congress.(3) It appears to most of us that giving up a matter of this kind is betraying our independence and in effect giving APRIL 9, 1778  a licence to the enemy to recruit in our country. If we suffer our citizens who adhere to our enemies, and actually take arms against us to be considered as prisoners of war, and subject to no municipal laws, I see not where our independence remains, and we cannot conceive that even Congress can dispense with such Laws much less a Cabinet Council of Military Officers. These are the sentiments, I believe of a great majority in Congress as well as mine, and I venture to say the matter will be peremptorily insisted on.  The other matter, that is, the establishment for Officers has cost us much time and debate, but the favourers of it have not yet ventured a Question on it, the proposal is from the Committee who were at Camp, strongly supported by the Commander in Chief. It is to make a provision of half pay for life after the end of the War for all Officers who shall continue in service until that period, and to extend this provision to the Widows of Officers who may be Slain, also to make such half pay transferable under the Controul of Congress and to subject the Officers to be again called by Congress into the service occasionally. In support of this it was alledged that at present the Officers having no permanent interest in their Commissions, it is not possible to reduce them to discipline, because whenever the necessary strictness and severity is observed they threaten to resign a Commission which affords them no prospects but of pain, danger, fatigue, and ruin to their private fortunes. That it is unjust to sacrifice the time and property of the men whose lives are every day exposed for us without any prospect of compensation, while so many who are protected by their valor and exertions are amassing princely fortunes, that unless something of this kind is done we cannot long expect to have an Army, because the Officers being unable even to subsist on their pay have already expended much of their private property and would be entirely ruined were they to continue; in a word Sir that without it we can have no discipline, and almost no army. On the other hand it is alledged that the Officers in the Army are and ought to be actuated by the principles of patriotism and public spirit, and ought to disdain motives of private interest, that enough will always be found to command our Troops who will deem the service of their Country and its gratitude a very ample compensation. That making such an establishment will involve the idea of a standing Army in time of peace to be at the disposal of Congress and that the rights of the States of appointing the regimental Officers will be reduced to nothing, that its effect will be to keep a great number of People idle Pensioners on the public who ought to be restored to useful industry, that it will be burthening the country with an expence for Officers at the same time that the Soldiery must be supplied from the Militia. That since it cannot certainly produce an army exclusive of the Militia no good can be derived from it, for which we ought to   hazard such inconveniences. But the most formidable argument is that the Congress being instituted only for the purposes of War have no power without particular instructions, to make any peace establishment. For my own part Sir, I cannot help admitting the force of the arguments for this measure so far as they prove the necessity of holding up the prospect of some adequate Compensation for the Officers and Soldiers likewise, but I do not approve of the mode proposed. The arguments drawn from Patriotism and public spirit may be fine and specious, but I choose to trust to some principles of more certain, lasting and powerful influence for the defense of our country. There will be room enough for their full operation after every thing else in our power is done. The fear of a standing Army arising from this establishment, has no great weight with me. This War will make too many of our people Soldiers to leave us any thing to apprehend from a standing Army in one generation. The few in each State whom the fatigues and consequent infirmities of a long and painful War will induce to indulge an indolent ease are not in my opinion an object of any consequence, the argument of want of power is no more conclusive against this than against borrowing money which must be paid and its interest in the mean time kept up by revenues which must continue long beyond the War, but it is not conclusive against either if the necessity for raising and keeping together an army be admitted. The argument with respect to the power of the States, in appointing the regimental Officers cannot be denied, but I hope after the present war we shall not have occasion to exercise that Power again in the age of any man now living, In short Sir I could get over all the objections if the number of Battallions were so reduced that no State should be obliged to keep up more than they can man exclusive of draughts from the Militia, but so long as it tends only to keep Officers in pay without regular troops under them, so long as our State are required to keep up a number so much beyond their proportion and ability, I cannot agree to it. It will not have the effect of producing a good army which may prevent the necessity of calling on the Militia, and so long as a country must employ its Militia, the expence and injury arising from it is sufficient burthen without an established list of Pensioners. I shall use my endeavour to have the number of Battallions from our State reduced because I am convinced they cannot be filled by recruiting and to fill them with draughted militia is much too heavy and unequal a burthen for us. And if the establishment can be so moddled as to make provision only for Officers who shall have regular troops to command I shall consent to it, if it shall be determined during my stay.  ""

  Mr President York April 13th 1778 (1) I receive the proceedings of the house with respect, and (Protesting that until the Laws of the State I represent shall expressly declare the  APRIL 13, 1778  Contrary, I shall hold myself accountable for my Conduct in Congress to that State, and no other power on Earth) I shall use the freedom which according to my Idea belongs to a republican, and a representative of a Sovereign People in the answers I shall make.  I consider the minutes of the tenth of April as a charge of a breach of order in the thing, and a Contempt in the manner.  I admit that withdrawing without the permission of Congress is a breach of order, and I hold that no member can deny his personal attendance at reasonable hours or even his Sentiments on any question debated before him, except by special leave of the house, without incurring the Penalties on misbehavior in office and I have only to allege in excuse that I had uniformly observed the members of Congress withdraw themselves at pleasure from attendance on Congress, and without reprehension that I thought it not improper to use a liberty which had been denied, as I conceive, to no other member, when I deemed the subject of too much Importance to be debated and determined, at a time when the faculties of the members were tired by the attendance of a whole day and when my own particular Indisposition rendered me incapable of giving that attention which I thought my duty to my Constituents required.  As to the manner, I am not conscious of having Intended a Contempt. I did not, nor do I now admit that less than Nine States can make a Congress. I understood not that the Message came from the President, but deemed that it came from Colonel Duer (2) whose name the messenger particularly mentioned, from whom he delivered a private message to the Delegate from Georgia (3) requesting his company as a favor, and to whom I intended my words should be conveyed. Before my departure, I heard Mr Lovell from Massachusetts say to the House \""there is no farther occasion to call the states, this declaration is decisive\"" in which I thougllt the House acquiessced, and that the adjournment was compleat. The Delegate from Georgia, who always answer the last in order, accompanied me under the same persuasion. With respect to the minutes of the eleventh, protesting that as a Delegate representing a free and Sovereign People, I am entitled to entire freedom of Debate, I say that the Expressions minuted were accompanied with and explained by other Expressions not minuted which declared my sense to be, that Congress have a power so far as to enforce the attendance of the members, that if the hours of attendance were ascertained by Congress I would punctually attend, but if not I must use my own Judgment, at the risque of any consequent punishment, as to the time being reasonable when my presence is required, that I am at all times ready and willing to Submit my Conduct and opinions to my Constituents, in whose Justice I have the firmest Confidence, and to whom I owe, as a duty, to prevent,  if I can, the decision of important matters, when members cannot duly attend to them, that Conviction of Error always did, and always shall precede Concession with me.  That (abstracted from the breach of order under Consideration which I meant not to Justify, but excuse) my general political opinions were that undue, or unreasonable exercise of any power, tho' lawful power, is Tyrannical, and that no freeman is bound to submit to it. That every freeman must use his own Judgment on it before he determines to disobey, for until he does disobey there can be no subject for any other Judgment and it remains for his Country to decide whether he is mistaken or not, and if he is, he incurs the penalties provided by Law. That it is Criminal in members of Congress to withold their attendance when the public safety required it, but that they are to be Judged and punished by the Laws of the States they represent, and no other power.  These Sentiments however expressed, I avow, and as to the Language, I know no obligation I am under to use a Courtly Stile. My expressions are usually what first occur and in this Instance were not intended to offend.  I shall only add that I mean not by any thing I have here said to submit myself to any Jurisdiction, but that of the state I represent, such submission being in my Idea injurious to the majesty thereof, nor do I mean to forego any of my own rights as a Citizen entitled to the benefit of the Laws, and Constitution of the free State of North Carolina.

  Sir, York Town, 14th April 1778 In obedience to the directions of Congress, I am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant.(1)  Congress with great concern perceive that your sensibility is wounded by their resolutions. Placing the firmest confidence in your prudence, abilities and integrity, they wish to preserve that harmony with you, which is essential to the general Weal. You may rest assured that far from any intention to give you pain, their resolutions have no other motives or end but the public good. They therefore hope that you will not in future be distrest by apprehensions as injurious to their honor as they are to your own feelings.  APRIL 14, 1778  However different the views of Congress may seem to you now from what you supposed them to be when you entered into your late engagements with general Howe, Congress certainly had nothing in view, but a proper respect to the dignity, safety & independence of these States.  The duplicity of general Howe and authentic information that the gentlemen appointed by you to negotiate the cartel held opinions repugnant to the sense of Congress, constrained them in a matter of such high moment, as forming a general cartel, to express their sentiments in an explicit manner; lest they might have only to lament, when it was out of their power to remedy a misapprehension on points deeply affecting in their judgment, the safety & honor of these States.  Congress expected that you would consider their resolutions of the 30th Ult. in the light of private instructions calculated to shew their sense with respect to the general outlines of the proposed cartel: a practice usual with the supreme power of every state in similar cases.(2)  You observe that a strict adherence to all the resolutions of Congress must of necessity destroy all idea of a cartel, but as a distinction can easily be made betwixt such of the resolutions of Congress as flow from general principles of policy, and those which arise from circumstances which have rendered a variation from time to time necessary, it is conceived that an attention to this discrimination will rid you of those embarassments, which you may, at first view, think yourself entangled with.  The resolution of Congress of the 19th December respecting the mode of settlement for supplies to the Enemy's prisoners seems not to have been sufficiently attended to.(3) It is left at the option of the enemy to pay either in coin dollar for dollar or in provisions &c equal in quantity and kind to what is furnished. Whatever objections may be made against the first mode, there surely cannot be a more just and equal ratio than the latter. Genl. Burgoyne lately made the same objections on this point, which occured to you, but on being reminded of the alternative offered by the resolution, he acquiesced, and the victuallying ships are now actually delivering provisions in payment for what they received. The commissaries of prisoners on each side may pass receipts for the rations received expressing the quantum of each article received for the subsistence of the prisoners in the power of the contracting parties and the balance may be paid in provisions or in coin, at the option of either party. The mode suggested by you is liable to this strong objection, that it would lay us under the necessity of furnishing the enemy's prisoners with us as well as ours with them with provisions; which certainly would be a capital advantage to them, if we consider the distance whence they must derive their supplies.(4)  The resolution of the 30th December was a measure naturally flowing from the treason acts, which the respective states have passed in consequence of the express recommendation of Congress.(5) On a mature deliberation, they are convinced that a deviation from it would be subversive of our character as an independent people & inconsistent with sound policy. No act of Congress can suspend the operation of the laws of the different states, and therefore they cannot consent that any measures should be adopted in the proposed cartel which may contravene this resolution. It does not however appear to Congress that any embarrassment will arise in this matter unless the enemy should insist upon an article in the cartel that Americans taken in arms shall be intitled to the benefit of an exchange. Under the terms of \""Officer for Officer, soldier for soldier\"" &c which are generally used in cartels traitors would no more be included by the laws of nations than deserters. The carrying this resolution into practice can depend only on the will of the several states who in this respect must be presumed to be governed by principles of policy, of which they must necessarily be competent judges.  With respect to the resolution concerning genl. Lee, at his request, Congress are willing that you should wave his exchange for major genl. Prescot as a preliminary article; it is however their intention that no cartel be acceeded to unless it be expressly admitted therein, that general Lee be exchanged for general Prescot.(6)  Congress have taken measures for purchasing such articles of captn. Cotteneaus Cargo as are necessary for the Army.(7)  By order of Congress, Henry Laurens, President  ""

I remain, With the highest Regard & Esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient & Most humble servant,  Henry Laurens, President of Congress.  ""

  My Dear, York Town 14t April 1778 I was Very happy to receive your Letter of the 6t instant, tho' at the same Time that part of it which gave Me an Account of your Want of Health touched Me with a Very sensible Greif. I was in hopes that the Disorders which have so frequently afflicted you would not have returned, tho' I believe from my own experience that they are difficult to eradicate. My Seperation from you was always a most disagreable Circumstance to my being Sent on publick Business, and every Repetition of an Appointment of this Nature becomes less agreable. As no one I beleive has a greater Relish than I have for domestick Injoyment, so I beleive I may flatter myself that after my present Tour of Duty which will conclude in Two months from this Time not only my own Wishes But that of my Country, will be gratified by my returning to enjoy in future domestick Peace. I shall Write to Mr. Adams that either he or some Other Gentleman appointed to attend would releive me as early in June as can be done. My half year's Service counting to next Novr. will fully expire by that Time, and I shall not have a single Wish to prolong the Period, And if my Health shall continue in any tolerable Degree till that Time it is the utmost that I can hope for. The Service in Attending Congress is more Arduous than I had before known it. We sit sometimes till between 10 and 11 o'Clock at night, but in those Cases We have an adjourment at Noon. I have been so confined as not to have been on Horsback since I came here, which I find has been some Injury to my Health. At present I am not so well as to attend Congress. Yesterday I did not attend nor shall do so to Day. I am not confined to my Chamber nor in any Danger of a Fever, I suppose my Disorders are rather Billious and which will pass off by a Diarrhea which exercises me pritty freely, so that I expect to be as well as usual in a Day or Two. A Turn of this kind both Col Dyer and Mr. Huntington have had since I came here. I beleive it is a kind of seasoning for the Climate and mode of living. I feel myself much better than I did yesterday. I shall have my Horse Bro't in a Day or Two to a Stable near to where I live and intend to Ride Very frequently. You take Notice that I mention in one of my Letters that I was well and injoyed a flow of Spirits. A Flow of Spirits you seem to consider as hardly proper to be felt at the present Day. I hope you did not suppose I  APRIL 14, 1778  meant by it any Gayety of Temper. Your own Experience I beleive will convince you that a Flow of Spirits in me is to be a little above Dejection. As to the Gloominess of the Times which you mention, Times I admit are bad, but I do not beleive that God will Consign this Country to Destruction, Light in due Time will arise and the happy Days of Peace, Fair, equitable and just Peace will Return. Suffer not your Mind to be under any overwhelming Solicitude on this Acco. God will take Care of this People, and I trust that both you and I shall live to see the most convincing Prooffs of it in the establishment of their Independency and safety.  Your Cares on Acco. of the Family are great. I hope I shall soon be in a Condition to bear a part of them. What you mention concerning Mr. Peirces (1) Kindness I can only say that the Affairs in the Northern Department are intirely unsettled. It is I think most probable that the Peekskill and Albany or Northern Department will be united. If so Mr. Trumbull will hold them both unless Mr. Palfrey P[ay] M[aster] Genl. should Resign, if so which I think is rathar improbable, Mr. Trumbull who has been for a long Time uneasy at not being at the Head may suceed him. If an Oppertunity presents I do not know that I shall object against Oliver's accepting Mr Peirces Kindness. The Army is a good schoole for a yong Man to learn Men and Manners in-None perhaps better if he is brought into an acquaintance with the higher and most improved Characters in an Army as well as that infinite Variety which Makes up the Mass of it. Mankind are unreservedly exemplified in an Army. An easiness of Manners and Address may there be obtained by proper Attention and Care. An Army is likewise unhappily the school of what are called fashonable Vices, tho there is No Vice but what dishonours him who possesses it, and the Deformity of it in some Instances is only concealed by the concommitant splendor of Noble Virtues. But you will perceive by what I say that I do not on the whole object agt his Accepting the offer when proposed. Altho I think that will be Very uncertain. Not but that I think Mr. Peirce ought to fill any Vacancy which might happen, but that perhaps will not be the Case. Mr. Trumbull who has Wrote some pretty offensive Letters to Congress because he has not been treated with more particular Marks of Respect one would imagine did not much care about holding the office.(2) But as it yeilds him a Salary of 125 Dollars per month without his personally attending to it scarcly any at all, I presume he will condescend to hold it, tho' I am Very sure that such sinecure pay must be too much by farr below the Merit of any one of that Family Their Claims on the Head of Merit I beleive have rendered them a little ridiculous. But this to you only. I am as still as a Mouse and I hope you will not doubt my Prudence. While I am here I shall mark the events and if any Thing happens I shall give my opinion upon it  farther. I hope Oliver will not set his Heart upon this Business. It is a precarious Event, and if realised the advantage will be doubtfull. As to the Conducting of the little Farming Business, I can give you no advice.  As to the Regulating Act the Achan (3) not only of all good Policy but of common Sence, Congress will I suppose in a few Days Recommend that it be suspended, at least I hope they will.(4) No Regard is paid to any Act of this Kind in this State. No such Act to the Southward of it Exists nor ever will. If Connecticut Maintains a Regulation of this kind, they will be the only State in the Union that will do so. Tho I know that our State will not do it, for this plain Reason because it is impossible, absolutely impossible in the Nature of Things, for such an Act to exist. So I find I am got upon a New Sheet. I shall now be fully able to answer every part of your Letter which I may Very well do considering how few I have to acknowledge. As to the Business which Mr. Reeve was to transact for me it seems to have been done in part for which I am oblidged to him. I have long tho't that I should never be Rich, indeed I am almost sure of it. Perhaps a pritty narrow Fortune will be best for us. The trading Business is carryed on at great Risque, tho I am glad he has purchased but I will not depend upon much success. How farr to engage in the Naval Way I shall be intirely Satisfied with your Determination. This you may be assured of. You mention the Vast Number of Militia Cases bro't to Court-which I am sorry there should be any occasion for. I hope some better Regulation will be devised for calling out the Militia, indeed I hear that six Battalions are to be under some nay to go on service upon an Emergency. Pecuniary Punishment will I fear be but of little Service to any but the Prosecutors-tho' I think at the same time it will be a matter of much dificulty to Adopt a mode effectual to call forth the Strength of the Country. Dr B's Case which you mention is undoubtly a Very singular one, such I beleive as is not to be found in any Law Book. But as I always considered him a Man of an extraordinary Turn, a correspondent Conduct might therefore be expected from him.  As to News I shall put that if I have any (which at present I do not know that I have) in Mr. Reeve's Letter.(5)  And now I do not know what I can add farther, But to advice you to take the best care of your Health in your Power, and attend to the use of those Prescriptions which I)r. Wolcott gave-free yourself as farr as you can from Anxious Care. Remember that he who does not suffer a sparrow to fall to the ground but under his providential appointment and who knows the Wants and Desires of all his Creatures will do that which upon the whole will be best for every one who humbly confides in his providential Goodness. Your own Experience has taught you that you have suffered many unnecessary In APRIL 15, 1778  quietudes. I am sure that mine has done so in Numberless Instances. Let us then commit all our Concerns to the Disposal of our Maker who I beleive will order that concerning us, which shall be for our greatest advantage.  This is my Sixth Letter, my last was by Col Dyer which you will receive in a Day or Two. I have Wrote Dr. Smith and Mr. Adams each a Letter, which I do not know whether either of them have recd.(6) I need not tell you how acceptable your Letters will be to me. Those by Brown will come safe. My tenderest Love for my Children and Family. My Ardent Wishes for your Happiness.(7)  Oliver Wolcott ""

  My dear Sir,(1) York Pensylvania 15th April 1778 'Tis true the Phaeton to whom you allude in yours of the 29th part, has like the first of that Name fallen never to rise again, but was not so effectually cooled by falling into an Element of an opposite kind.(2) The Mild Planet, whose Course the modern adventurer of that Name had wished to have guided, receded from him with so gentle a Radiance that the Impression remains, perhaps too strongly to be obliterated.  Cruel Necessity if it should be so! since no other Remedy is probable. But you who are much versed in the military and can maneuvre equal to Stueben himself, can you not as heretofore, by marching and counter marching find out the Causes of Movements in Friend as well as Foe? There are more things in Heaven and earth than even Phylosophy will teach.  But where a Planet looks with amicable benignity on a Saint, may he not invoke her to explain the Causes of certain Influences, why attraction ceases in some and goes on in other Instances? and then as a Phylosopher why the finest feelings and some of the tenderest Emotions of the Soul do not always awaken the same in others, by Sym APRIL 15, 1778  pathetic Power. Perhaps inimical Interpositions have been thrown in the way to spoil the Concord.  Perhaps poisoned falsehood propagated Good Name in Man or Woman, dear my Friend, is the immediate Jewel of their Souls &c &c.  This planetary object was great indeed! weighing down in substantial good even an Empire. Could not an obscure letter be erected upon a Consultation of the Stars, and the Result of certain Maneuvres? Such as, How the Responses of the Oracle might be; take Care 'tho of too much ambiguity. If you can go deeper into the obscure than this, being understood, magnus eris mihi Apollo; Apollo, you know, did deal in obscurity when he patronized Physic. To there? I come off decently with my Deity, I thought otherwise when I had got him obscured, do allow him to be fairly brought off now & I promise never to risque him again in so dangerous a Post. But no matter so I am hid from vulgar Eyes in these confidential Communications.  How delightful a change in Systems and prospects of alliances, in four or five daies! On it I congratulate my Friend; but in the System of politics how comes it that another Power is introduced on the Stage? Such Jarring interests cannot consist together. It is therefore time for the Power first engaged in the Campaign to come to an explanation upon so delicate a Subject, lest the Balance of Power should not be rightly adjusted, in settling definitive Treaties. France & Spain seem to be at a Stand as to an interfereance with America's Quarrel for her just Rights, indeed I never expected any assistance from them but What was immediately conducive to their Interest. Nor is it to be expected from any Nation, but if these Powers are equal with the advantages America may throw into the Scale, to G. Britain's navy, they would consult that darling Passion of Men & Nations immediately to begin hostilities. An argument was very well concluded upon the advantage attending such an accession of Force to America, by General Lee. A Gentleman in Company a few Minutes ago insisted that Hostilities carried on by France against G. Britain would not aid America. The Gen. replied that the Argument required no other Refutation than to suppose we stood a better chance against that Nation with 20 thousand than four thousand Men.  However at all Events the Americans are doomed to stand another Campaign unaided by any Force but that which should be derived from their own heroism & virtue. Wonder not at the use of the Words Heroism b Virtue, without them no Nation ever persevered in the defence of its Liberties. Did we certainly possess these republican virtues the Strength of the Continent might be called out, to the instant destruction of the Invaders of our Country.  Ill judging ambition & the Lust of Gain has induced our Fellow  Subjects beyond the Atlantic to rob us of Possessions which had they but been wise & contented we cultivated for their use.  I wish the same cursed Love of Wealth and Selfish attachment may not equally act upon us, & render our resistance too feeble to admit of Speedy decision It is said the King of Prussia, considering the German Mercenaries as so many Beasts for Slaughter, has laid a duty upon every individual, a duty which amounts to a Prohibition of their passing 'thro his Territories. Inform Mr. Osborne if you take one sixth of my Share in the commercial Scheme formed when I last saw you. If so pay him £250 for Col. B Harrison of Brandon, & he will give you a Receipt for £100 as Stock and the £150 as you can tell him. I am in daily expectation of letters from you & should hope you will not fail to let me know everything interesting as well to the Saint & his connections as to his & your affect. Friend, J. Banister  [P.S.] Mr. Adams arrived this day & our state is represented (3) which gives me great satisfaction 'tho I shall be obliged to give closer attendance on Congress. That is from morning untill Evening. The last Crisis is sent you of which I can say little except for the Zeal of the author.(4)  ""

  Sir York 16th April 1778 In consequence of a letter from Govenour Henry to the Virginia Delegates, directing the Payment of thirty thousand Dollars, as an additional Bounty granted the Soldiers who have reinlisted into the Virginia Regiments, I am to inform you that the money shall be paid in any manner you may please to direct.(1)  It was with the most painful Sensibility that I perused your last letter on the Subject of the present State of the Army,(2) and am equally concerned in reflecting that I do not see effectual Measures taken to ward off the impending Blow.  As to the Establishment, I am under no doubt of its being adopted & put upon a ground of Stability.(3) Its not having taken effect as yet has been owing to a thin Representation. Virginia the Leader in this great Business, for want of the constituent Number to form a Representation, remains a Cypher without Suffrage, at this Momentous Period.(4) Did I not fear to intrude upon your Hours of essential business I should sometimes write to you for my own information on military subjects; here being the greatest Ignorance in every occurence of that kind mixt with an inactivity that permits affairs of the greatest magnitude to lie dormant & give place to local Trifles. I have said with freedom in a few words what has often occured when I have been here. I wish I had the Capability to apply an instant Remedy for nothing procrastinated will do. However the military establishment will come out soon. God knows what other Regulations may APRIL 16, 1778  take place. Virginia's drafted Mell will come on soon & I beleive may amount to 1700 instead of 2000 voted, as it is highly probable more men desert of those compelled into Service than if they had entered voluntarily. Col. Harrison's artillery Regimt are on their march. Would volunteers, provided they can be had, be of Service to your operations? Certain it is they will not come out in such Numbers as some have conjectured, but I beleive a considerable Body, perhaps two Battalions may be induced to venture their Persons in this time of danger.  I am with the highest Regard & attachment, your Excellency's mo. Obedt. & mo. hble Servant, John Banister  [P.S.] The Order on the Paymaster if it is to go 'thro his hands will [be] 30 thousand & 80 dollars, the 80 being for a Soldier which I have desired Col.

  Sir, York Town 16th of Apr. 1778 Herewith you have a copy of what I did myself the pleasure of writing to you on the 2d of last month; since which we have received your favors of Janry. 14 & 26, Feb. 8 & 21st.(1)  Your draught of 23554.9.9 in favor of the secret (now commercial) committee has been duely paid. The four first charges in your account current like many other sums on similar occasions here have been expended to no sort of profit to the continent; but I hope we have seen the last of such expences.  Your situation must have been very disagreable indeed in consequence of the failure of remittances from hence. Large quantities of Tobacco have been long stored; but our bayes & coasts are so infested  APRIL 16, 1778  by the enemies ships of war that it is impossible for us to conduct agreable to our earnest wishes of maintaining the best credit in our commercial concerns abroad. It is probable that a commercial board, not members of Congress, will very soon be established so that the whole time of the conductors may be spent in exertions for the public benefit in that branch of continental business.(2)  The want of intelligence from our Commissioners at Paris makes it improper for us to draw largely on them at present; therefore you must content yourself with the oeconomical bounds of the power which is given to you by the within resolve of Congress of this day.(3) Be assured that all possible attempts will be made for your relief by remittances of our produce.  I find it impossible to convey to you any thing of a plan of opperations for this campaign. The enemy having the sea open to them must have the Lead in military matters; we must oppose or follow them just as they think fit to attempt an advance or to retire. It is hardly probable they will again attack New England without large reinforcements.  Our Correspondent at the Hague is very regular, but his intelligence is never in season to form the ground of any of our proceedings. We have packets from him regularly to the letter Y Decr. 16th (4) though our Commissioners have not been able to convey one safely since May last. Tis strange that they cannot succeed thro you. But, indeed you appear also to know but little of them.  Mr. Deane being wanted here, Mr. John Adams sailed the 17th of February to take his place at the Court of Versailles. It is probable you will hear of his arrival before this reaches you. It seems needless to desire you to give us early notice of that and other foreign intelligence. Your usual punctuality needed not the spur of the information which I have given you of our present great ignorance of the situation & transactions of the Gentlemen at Paris.

  [April 16, 1778] (1) Having mentioned to you a packet from Mr. Bingham I will give you a sketch of the contents.(2) Great Britain is meanly covering her commerce in Dutch bottoms for by obtaining Burgher's Briefs at St Eustatius the British merchants become Dutch subjects and sail under the protection of the Flag of a people whom they affect to think their inferiours. The Grand Seignior is said to have given orders to seize all the Russian vessels, in the ports of his dominions, so that war was expected to be declared betwixt these two powers. It was expected also that the port of Lisbon would be shut after the 1st of January against all armed vessels belonging to his Britannic majesty. A powerful confederacy was forming against England, it had taken a consistence, and the basis of its political views was the Independency of America. In consequence of several conferences between the Commissioners of these United States and the French ministry couriers had been dispatched to Vienna, Lisbon & Madrid and as soon as they returned France would acknowledge the Independency of America.  APRIL 16, 1778  \""These accounts arrive thro' such a variety of Channels that the most incredulous can hardly doubt their authenticity. The letters that convey them are dated at Paris the 22d of Decr.\""  American vessels sailing from St. Pierre's are regularly conveyed by French frigates, and many French merchantmen take the benefit of that Protection, as they remember the conduct of Britain before she last declared war. Custom-house formalities and fees of Office were not demanded of Capt. Chew who was allowed to wear his pendant, altho a French Commodore was then in port. Our Flag is thus put on a respectable footing, and the rising Constellation which is now in place of the British Union is a Device greatly admired in our Colours.  When any more authentic particulars arrive \""respecting the Doctor\"" or a nearer friend,(3) I shall aim to \""mitigate your Anxiety\"" being your affectionate humble Servant J L  ""

Neither have I had the satisfaction to learn that of the many Letters I have written you have ever received one.(2) It would give me infinite Pleasure to hear of my Friends yourself in particular but since it is my Lott to know no more than the Burthen of General Report I must be contented. I receive great Pain from being informed that you are distressed on my Account. Be of good Chear I pray you. I have all that Happiness which flows from conscious Rectitude. I am blest with as great a Portion of Health as usually belongs to the share of Mankind. Content with what I have and what I am I look forward serenely to the Course of Events confident that supreme Wisdom & Justice will provide for the Happiness of his Creatures. It gives me Pain that I am seperated from those I love but comparing this with what thousands suffer I dare not repine. Let me earnestly recommend to you so much of either Religion or Philosophy as to bear inevitable Evils with Resignation. I would that it were in my Power to solace and comfort your declining Age. The Duty I owe to a tender Parent demands this of me but a higher Duty hath bound me to the Service of my Fellow Creatures. The natural Indolence of my Disposition hath unfitted me for the Paths of Ambition and the early Possession of Power taught me how little it deserves to be prized. Whenever the present Storm subsides I shall rush with Eagerness into the Bosom of private Life but while it continues and while my Country calls for  APRIL 16, 1778  the Exertion of that little Share of Abilities which it hath pleased God to bestow on me I hold it my indispensible Duty to give myself to her. I know that for such Sentiments I am called a Rebel and that such Sentiments are not fashionable among the Folks you see. It is possible (tho I hope not) that your maternal Tenderness may lead you to wish that I would resign these Sentiments. But that is impossible and therefore for the present I cannot see you. Let me however intreat that you be not concerned on my Account. I shall again see you. Perhaps the Time is not far off. I am much distressed for Wilkins.(3) I sincerely love and respect him and I fear that we are seperated for a very long Season. Pray remember me to him most affectionately and to my sister. She too has been much wounded. The Loss of her Infant must have distressed her greatly but perhaps her own Experience may have led her to prize Life at its just Value and if so it is a Blessing she may not think so estimable as to wish it for her Child. Remember me most tenderly to all her little Infants to Isaac particularly who I am told hath not forgotten me poor Child. I hope it may be in my Power to return his Attention by the Protection of a Parent. God forbid he should need it or any of them. Remember me to Mrs. Ashfield (4) and her Children for I think she hath more than one. I wish her Husband had acted more consistently, but enough of this. And now my Dear Madam let me again intreat you to make yourself happy. Discard the gloomy Ideas which are too apt to croud into the Mind in your Situation and Time of Life. There is enough of Sorrow in this World without looking into Futurity for it. Hope the best. If it happens, well; if not, it is then Time enough to be afflicted and at any Rate the intermediate Space is well filled.  Adieu. Yours most affectionately, Gouvr Morris  ""

First It is expedient a Provision, [instead of-\""that an establishment\""] (4) of half Pay be made for the Military officers commissioned by Congress who now are or hereafter may be in the service of these States & shall continue therein during the War & who shall not be annexed to any Corps of established Troops or hold any office of Profit under the United States or any of them & that such [establishment] Provision take place after the conclusion of the present War.\""  This Motion, which in itself had undergone a Question upon Order being thus taken under Consideration & in part amended, a Motion was made for dividing the Question which caused some debate but the manner in which the division was desired declared in writing as follows.  \""The House was Moved that the Question be divided & that the sense of the House be taken, whether any provision shall be made for Officers &c.\""  The President rose & said his Duty Constrained him to speak to the House-\""that this Motion contained no division of the Question in debate but was a complete new motion which he could not put without express Command.\""  Mr. Huntington & other members objected in like manner debates & some disorder ensued-the President admonished the House against disorder & intemperate reflections.  A majority of probably two to one insisted upon having the Question put as it had been reduced to writing. The President replied he could not apply the words so reduced to writing to any part of the motion & give it the appearance of a division, except by taking up  some & suppressing or skipping over other words in the Motion. The Member who had reduced the said division or new motion to writing, expressed great surprize & added it is the easiest thing in the World. The President requested his assistance, & delivered the Motion to that Member Mr. Chase who read it as it is reduced to writing & averred it to be a division of the Question. The President resumed the Papers & again requested the Order of the House. Some of those Members who had complained of the division & were against admitting the motion to be a division, exclaimed they were borne down & all said, any how, any how, we see the Gentlemen will have it in their own way-put the Question.  The President then read the Motion again & put the Question.  \""You Gentlemen who agree that a Provision shall be made for the [Military] Officers Commissioned by Congress &c. [® The words of half pay suppressed & the word Military introduced, by order] when you are called upon will signify it by saying Aye-Contra, when called upon will say No. The Yeas & Nays were called & appear on the Journal.(5)  Instantly after calling the Members, Mr. Chase presented the following motion read by himself & by the President.  \""The Question moved & put that such Provision for the Officers be one half of their present Pay.\""  But the House adjourned without debate or putting the Question.(6) It is asserted by Gentlemen that Officers & some of high Rank in the Army have declared (\""I have heard one & of high Rank too\"") that they were not for Peace.  They desired War for a support, as they had no fortunes to live upon.  Query. Is it necessary to make further Provision for Men who declare that what they already enjoy is a desirable subsistence, or for Men who at the expence of the Blood & Treasure of their Country wish to enjoy their present subsistence?  Query. Is there no danger that Men of this disposition will, when once an half Pay establishment is fixed do everything, & submit to any terms for compassing Peace even submitting to accept another half Pay for this purpose from the Enemy? Thus Gentlemen in their reasonings upon different subjects in which the Officers of this Army are introduced, destroy their own arguments used in support of a Peace establishment.  It is unjust-- the Motives & considerations not applicable  the demand unseasonable & a compliance dangerous.  the Remedy proposed grievous to the People & inadequate to (7)   Unjust, because it is inconsistent with the original compact- Officers were not compelled but eagerly solicited Commissions knowing the terms of service-because every argument, of loss of Estate, neglect of family-forfieture of domestic happiness-the exorbitancy of prices for every specie of goods for the necessary support or Comfort of Life is applicable to thousands of our fellow Citizens with greater force & in some degree to every Inhabitant of the United States engaged in the Compact with this great difference in favor of Officers that they are Provided with Rations or daily food, with Servants, with Horses at the Public expence & with Clothing from (8)  ""

  Dear sir York Town 17th April 1778 I troubled you with a Letter the 7th Inst. by Messenger Green to which I beg leave to refer.  Mr. Morris continuing to be absent from York Town I yesterday APRIL 17, 1778  paid into the hands of his Agent Mr John Browne Three hundred Dollars on Account of Mr. John Holt for whose information I now transmit through you a Copy of the Receipt which I directed to be taken for that Sum, in which I was governed by the Contents of Mr Holt's Letter, & having no further use for the Letter I return it to you within the present Inclosure.(1)  We are now in the Wane of April, you know what is undone, done & doing for securing the important passes of Hudson's, on the possession of which our connexion with the Eastern States so intimately depends. Congress have ordered General Gates to repair immediately to Fish Kill & there to Command the Troops at that Post & the whole Northern department, & have empowered him to call out Militia from N.H., M.B., C. & N.Y., as well as from Rhode Island if the Enemy should evacuate that State.(2)  Here, we are still encamped at Valley forge, reinforcements arrive very gradually. General Lee's opinion is the Enemy may March when they please to Lancaster. I am strongly inclined to add \""& be cut off.\"" That Gentleman is at present on parol; Congress had restricted the Commander in Chief to an article, as a Preliminary upon which the progress toward establishment of a general Cartel should depend that Majr. General Lee should be exchanged for Majr General Prescot, but at the General's special request this article is varied & now appears an Instruction.(3) General Lee is exceedingly anxious to be exchanged, intimates that General Howe had assured him he should be, & was equally apprehensive of ill effects following a dogmatic preliminary. General Howe, he was persuaded, would instantly withdraw his Commissioners. I am ignorant of the present state of the business of Exchange, the Commissioners had met at Newton, but there has happened some untoward explanations between the Commander in Chief & York Town & I have had no return to a late Letter signed by Order.(4)  General Lee assures me the British Officers of his acquaintance generally wish for accomodation & that not a few of them approve of our opposition. My pleasure was heightned by another assurance that our suspension of the Convention of Saratoga is censured by none & applauded by many, excepting the Prolixity of our reasonings upon that occasion. He explodes the Idea of a Change in the Command at Philadelphia.  We are now busily engaged on the Report for an half pay establishment. Long & warm debates for many a day had led us to the threshold of the Report from the Committee of the Whole. We had Entered fairly the Door, by reading the whole for information-the first Clause for debate & had received an amendment which was read by the Chair & the question half put, when we were turned out by a New Motion-debates arose upon the point of order, referring to   that Motion,(5)an agreement entered upon the journal, which I shall inclose for your information,(6) was also called for & insisted upon in aid of the general reasonings for order, against receiving the new motion-after long & fervorous arguments the Question was put. You Gentlemen who admit this Motion to be in order will signifie it by saying Aye &c. How say you Sir? I intreat your answer.  That you may fully understand this circumstance I should not omit, that the proceedings of the House in debating the Confederation & other Questions were cited as precedents, & replied to, by referring to the special agreement in the present Case & likewise by alledging that the variations which were quoted had been made by \""general Consent.\"" I speak again to a Member of Congress.

  My dear sir Apr. 18th. 1778. Your favors of Feb. 29 & Mar 31st came to hand this afternoon.(1) Col. Campbel is actually gone into Philadelphia, and I suppose my old fellow sufferer is before this time among his friends.(2) There has been a variety of managemts. in the affair that may tend to your amusement at some future leisure moment. Howe most evidently had rather have to do with any body rather than Congress; there being this difference that he cannot induce us to believe him any thing better than a deceitful rogue, while some others confide altogether in his honor and often put themselves into situations to have their \""feelings hurt\"" by our decisive Resolves which are therefore wished APRIL 18, 1778  to \""sleep.\""(3) I may venture to tell you at so great a distance as Boston is from this place that Genl. Heath has acquitted himself greatly to his own honor as an executive officer upon the Resolves of Congress. Surely there is no odious comparison in what I assert.  Since the date of your last you must have seen my letter to Mr. Appleton respecting Mr. Amory (4) and I think you must have judged the Spirit of it not to be against the proceedings of the Genl. Assembly.  We are now come to the Season when certain birds of passage return who seldom appear in our flock during winter. I will not enlarge upon the advantages of the regulation of this year for our vote in Congress. Esqr. C____ (5) the patron of yeas & nays will give you after opportunity of examining that matter. 4 & 4 and I divided lost a question against the voice of D & myself Brother G being very ill (6)____a question of the highest importance so that you may expect soon an half pay System upon which the existence of the army this campaign is said \""religiously\"" at one time & \""devoutly\"" at another to depend.(7) It is said to be (Economy Justice & Necessity. The last really is not altogether fictitious the second does not exist and the first is quite problematical. Distinctions ought however to be made between an half pay establishment and a military establishment the latter being a curse the former a nuisance. Can less than 9 states appropriate money in the manner hinted above? Can it be called a contingent expence of this war? I am Clearly of opinion not. I wish all the old Geese were here as Mr Childs called our worthy select men on a certain time.  Genl. Gates is to go immediately to the north river having the command of the posts there & the superintendance of the whole northern department. I tell you he is to assist at a council of War in his way to determine upon the plan of operations for the campaign.(8)  Genl. W____ tells us Massachusetts is most allarmingly deficient in her quota; pray exert yourselves. Our cause is greatly at hazard.  I have mentioned to Docr. Cooper all the scraps of foreign news which have lately reached.(9)  I hope Lot Gray (Hall) has paid you cash. My poor wife needs no addition to her present trouble.  The public letter and instructions came to hand with your favors (10) and will be duely respected.  Apr. 19th. Sunday M[ornin]g. Mr. Geary is something recovered this morning; he will take a ride this delightful day and he must certainly be relieved from Congress shortly; but I warn you of great difficulties as to Lodging and I advise you to be composed upon the thought of not being accommodated here. Mrs. C____ will move to Philada. or to some other part. I am sorry to find the regulating law   passed you will be desired to suspend the execution till Congress know what the Southern states will do. We owe this to the eastern states who have sacrificed their Judgements to our Recommendations when others have not. I think such laws may not be without some good effect so suspended.(11) We have got Col. Wadsworth at the Head of the commiserate unfettered strictly so;(12) Had the same Steps as now been taken witll Trumbull a year ago amazing sums would have been saved and Howe have been reduced to the greatest Extremity last fall if we may depend upon the causes assigned for past inactivity. Let us look forward with hope.  Mr. John Purveyance has told me within two days that he has got my Almanac from a Soldier at Mount Holly who found my stripped pocket Book on a wharf below Bondford's Coffee House the morning after I (was robbed) lost it.(13) I now give up all thought of finding my money as the manner in which the book was found proves I had been robbed. I can take my oath as to the 260 Dollars lost in it; and wish for your advice about applying for it as an inevitable expence. I do not see how I can possibly make it up to my family. It costs me as much here to patch my old Cloaths as would have given me and two of my Children a Suit of new not long ago. I wish you could find a number of men willing to come on witll you to this political scene of drudgery so that I may try some other for awhile. I do not see how I can quit unless 4 come up for I should not be easy to have our vote at the risque it has been for near 4 months. N Hampshire & Delaware are not represented R Is 1, Mas 3, Con 2, N Y 2, N J 1, Pen 2, Mary [3], Virg 3, N C 2, S C 3, G 1. Col. R.H.L.(14) is on his way but stopped by a dying brother. Col.

I think the States have been very patient so far; There will be a dreadful mix & medly of Resolves & Treasury minutia-. I find the supervisal of the press a poor interlude to the business in Congress. It is too much like leaving work to saw wood but by no means so salutary.  I cannot refrain from telling you a little Camp Doctrine in the face of our Resolve vizt. that citizens of Philada. and any others who take up arms with the Enemy in their progress thro the Continent are changeable as prisoners of war. I hope no State will give up its treason acts even to Congress much less to one of its officers.(18) Affectionately your humble Servant. J L  ""

  Dear Sir, York Town 18th April 1778 (1) I expected before this to have written to you \""Provision is made for the American Officers\"" but that Thief of Time Procrastination hath kept it off from Time to Time. The Question is now an Order of the Day and as such takes Place of every other Business. When it will be determined I know not but this I know that it shall be finished one way or the other before any Thing else Let what will happen.(2) I am confident it will go right if something very extraordinary does not happen. In the Interim nothing is done. I feel as severely on this Occasion as you can do but it is impossible to make Men of Business out of . All will yet go well. We have determined to send Gates to Hudson's River where he is to command very largely. But he is to receive Instructions which shall be proper.(3) You are directed to call a Council of Major Generals in which the Chief Engineer is officially to be a Member and to which by a Subsequent Resolution Genls. Gates & Mifflin were ordered to repair.(4) As these Gentlemen ought not to receive Orders immediately from Congress they are as you will see permitted to leave the Board of War upon your Order. This Amendment was for that Reason acquiesced in nem con. Colo. Harrison will I believe be again appointed a Member of the Board APRIL 18, 1778  of War.(5) This I mention by the bye. I add my Wish that your Business and his Inclinations may be so ordered as to accept of it. For this I have many Reasons. Every Man of Business knows that Words are of great \Weight and we receive Reports from the Board of War every Day. I need say no more except that it is not always possible to weigh Sentences with that Accuracy in a public Assembly which is practicable in the Closet. It is astonishing that Congress who certainly are not without sufficient Apprehensions should at so critical a Moment as the present be so supine but this is human Nature and we must bear it. I have a Remedy in Contemplation but that as to present Exigencies will be after Meat Mustard. If you were an unconcerned Spectator it would divert you to see that altho a Majority of our House have been agreed in a certain Point ever since Mr. Dana arrived here yet nothing is done.(6) A propos of your Council of War. Should you determine on any Thing which considering the Course of human Affairs is I confess rather improbable Let Congress know Nothing about it. A Secret should never be trusted to many Bosoms. I will forfeit any Thing except Reputation that it will not be well kept even by those necessarily confided in. I know your many Avocations and therefore I insist that you do not answer any Letter from me. Should you have Reason to write a Letter it is another Affair.(7) Remember me to Mrs. Washington.

Never had any poor Culprit better ground for building to the utmost extent of his inabilities an elaborate apologetic preface than is at this instant in possession of your Excellency's Debtor. He might without impeachment of his veracity aver he has discovered the Art of uniting Liberty & Slavery, that for two Months past his Masters have confined him Morning & afternoon often till 9 & even past 10 oClock at Night, fixing him immoveable for Six hours together to be bated & Stared at, giving short intervals for refreshment & that as were allowed to him were necessarily devoted to public business including much Trash of incessant applications by French Men & other as light headed Men who watch his Entrance into his Room as keenly as a well [fee'd] Bailiff attends the nocturnal excursion of some poor fellow who has been too liberal with his Taylor & Vintner. I might urge that I seldom write but when other people are amusing themselves in Bed-what becomes of Sunday? that's my day of Rest-I write all day & discharge half a week's arrears. Will you say you have not more than once toyed away an hour talking nonsense with the pretty Girl above stairs & sometimes below stairs since the 26th Febry. when you received the Governor's Letter of the 5th. No I wont tell a Story, but this is my only relief, I am lame & can neither walk far nor ride for exercise. 'Tis a much surer & pleasanter means for reanimation than lounging the hour in an Elbow Chair if I had had one, cogitating & grumbling upon the cares & Labours of the drudge of a political manufactory-but waving further interrogation calculated to ensnare me, let me answer in a word, I have writ oftner by once within six Months past to Governor Livingston than I have upon any Subject in my private Estate, & perhaps the seeming indifference has arisen from the same reflection, I know neither of them will suffer from my silence. Be that as it certainly is, when I am called upon, I ought to answer & I promise in return for the very honorable dunns which I have lately received, to write whenever I can lay hold of matter however concise which I shall think not unworthy the Governor's notice. I will do myself the honor of attending his Levee as constantly as possible, should there be an appearance of a little obtrusion now & then in subject or manner I shall know who will not be to blame.  What will you say to yonder long Letter under the two short ones! APRIL 19, 1778  maybe not a word more at present, 'tis Sunday & although very early I am fatigued & from the labors of the past Week I feel a Sterility upon my natural barrenness. I must get off as well as I can, I'll tell the Governor a Cock & a Bull Story about an important subsisting debate in our Club, amuse him with my friend Chief Justice Drayton's speech upon Articles of confederation (1) which as a Special favor I have obtained for the purpose, add Copies of a very honorable correspondence lately held with the fallen Hero of River Bouquet,(2) endeavor to draw His Excellency into a decision of Questions upon parliamentary Order & then conclude by repeating what is as true as any thing ever said by any Chief Justice Hero or Parliament.  Sir, We have within a Month past, improved many whole days & some tedious Nights by hammering upon a plan for an half pay establishment for Officers who shall continue in the Army to the end of the present War-a most momentous engagement, in which all our labour has not yet matured one single Clause nor even determined the great leading questions to be, or not to be. The Combatants have agreed to meet to morrow vis a vis & by the point of Reason & by somethings proxies for Reason put an end to the Contest.(3) I'll be hanged they do.  Had I heard of the Loss of half my Estate, the account would not have involved my mind in such fixed concern as I feel from the introducing of this untoward project. A Refusal to gratify the demand of the Officers will, as we are menaced, be followed by resignations from all those who are valuable-an acquiescence without an adequate provision or doceur for officers of the Militia as well as for all the Soldiery will be attended by a Loss of Men & prove a Bar to future energy in those Classes. We shall have no Army.  If we provide pensions for one part of the people from the labour of the other part who have been equally engaged in the struggle against the common Enemy & who to say the least have suffered equal losses, the enormous debt which will thereby be entailed on posterity will be the least evil, constitution will be tanted, and the Basis of Independency will tremble.  Advocates for the Measure say, \""the present pay of Officers is not sufficient to support them in Character, their Estates are exposed to waste & loss from their personal absence, they might by various ways & means from which they are now cut off, improve their fortunes as their friends & acquaintance are daily doing. You must not confide in that virtue which you talk of as the Cement of the original compact there is none or very little of such principle remaining, upon your decision of this great question depends the existence of your Army & of your Cause. If you say No-All, All, your good Officers will leave you.\"" This is the substance & amount of pro. Con starts-\""the de-  mand is unjust, unconstitutional, unseasonable, a compliance under menaces, dangerous-the reasoning from loss of virtue & insufficiency of the present pay not convincing.  Unjust because inconsistent with the original Compact, Officers were not compelled but eagerly solicited Commissions knowing the terms of service, loss of Estate, neglect of family, sacrifice of domestic happiness, exorbitancy of prices of every specie of goods for the necessities or comforts of Life, applicable to every Citizen in the Union & to thousands who are not officers with greater force & propriety.  Unjust because without superior merit, Officers demand a seperate maintenance from the honest earnings of their fellow Citizens many of whom will have been impoverished by the effects of the War & rendered scarcely able to pay their quota of the unavoidable burthen of equal Taxes-unjust in the extreme, to compel thousands of poor industrious Inhabitants by contributions to pamper the Luxury of their fellow Citizens many of whom will step out of the Army in to the repossession of large acquired or inherited Estates, of some who have accumulated immense fortunes by purloin & peculation under the Mask of patriotism.  Tis held possible by these naughty Cons to produce more than one case in point.  Compliance with a demand unjust as it is extraordinary with a penalty affixed & delayed till the people are reduced to the awful alternative of losing the Army & their Liberties would be dangerous, because it would be establishing a precedent to the Soldiery-because it would be to Tax the people without their own Consent-because the people would have no security against future arbitrary demands- because the attempt is to deprive the Representative of free Agency & to reduce that Body to a State of subserviency-because it would lay the foundation of a standing Army, of an Aristocracy, the demand militates against Articles of Confederation-because it would have a tendency to waste the Army by discouraging the Militia & yeomanry in general to take the field, abate the fervor of the warmest friends & invigorate the hopes & endeavors of every Class of our Enemies\"" &c &c &c.  The assertion of loss of virtue is not admitted as a fact because the plan originated in a sphere above Regimental Command from whence it was easy to Roll down the glaring temptation.  Insufficiency of the present pay cannot be admitted because the Remedy proposed is not adequate to relief-half Pay to commence at a distant period will not supply present wants-\""succeed in the first attempt & by the same means we will compel Congress to augment pay.\""  If Officers withdraw & the loss of the Army & Liberty are to be  consecutive events, by what \""various ways & means\"" may officers improve their fortunes, where will be those lucrative employments which it is pretended they now envy-but officers may retire when they please-so may senators & what then?  A whole quire of Paper would be too narrow to range in, upon this topic. It is fortunate for you Sir that General Gates, an English News paper & two or three members of Congress steped in & knocked out of my head more than would have filled another sheet. If I can beg that News paper which contains some good things it shall accompany the other papers. Let me conclude this head by observing the Cons move to postpone the consideration of the plan until the several States shall be fully informed & consulted.(4) Here a strenuous advocate let out the Cat-no I am afraid the people will not consent. What! dare we bind the people in any Case without or against their Consent, tis very near akin to burding them in all Cases. I must confess the affair for an affair of5 such magnitude has been poorly conducted by the managers.  A Report of the whole, called for in a certain Assembly being the order of the day-read once for information the first paragraph read for debate an amendment offered & received a question on the amendment half put-a new proposition was started irrelative to the paragraph & amendment, contrary to general consent & having a tendency to set aside both-Question is it in order to receive & put to Vote the proposition?  A question was moved upon the order; Question is the latter motion or the first subject for a previous Question?(5)  From what has been said Your Excellency will collect enough to determine on the article of confusion. That Mass of paper Iying there which I lug every day to & fro would give a more explicit answer to this point than, as I think, becomes me. My own Spirits such as they are keep in pretty equal tone. Men may bear pain with great equanimity in general, yet be impelled by sudden twitches to bawl out & sigh for a moment.  Things in public life were in extreme disorder when I had last the honour of writing to your Excellency & besides I beleive other things in private were as crooked. I fancy I was a Bed with Gout. Some departments, which as I dont mean to be invidious I will not partticularize, are shifted into more promising hands & I intertain hopes, if we have an Army, it will be better supplied than it has been with entertainment for Men & Horse but take a general view & the prospect is still extremely mortifying. However, we have lately received acquisition of some abilities though not half enough & tis pretended the Spirit of reformation is at our threshold. My Colleague Drayton has given earnest of his determination to set his face against fraud in every shape & to call upon those men who detain unaccounted Mil-  lions.(6) Thank God we have other virtuous sensible Men to aid him. I believe things were at the time allude[d] to at the worst-nothing but complete ruin could have proved the contrary.  General Burgoyne had reached Rhode Island & probably embarked about the 5th Inst. His arrival in England will produce an excellent fund for polemics.  Congress have directed General Washington to convene a Council of Major Generals including the two Gentlemen of the Board of War & the General Officer of the Corps of Engineers in order \""to form such a plan for the general operations of the Campaign as the Commander in Chief shall deem consistent with the general welfare of these States.\"" General Gates from the Council will proceed to Fish Kill & take upon him the Command of all the Northern department.  I learned yesterday that the works upon North River were going forward under great exertions of Industry. Officers assist in manual labour. Apprehensions of losing the important passes & their apendages on that River through a strange delay & perplexity of orders wearing the appearance of infatuation have often exercised my patience.  The knowing ones here will bet that terms of accomodation will be a prelude to the Campaign, I dont pretend to be related to that family, but I expressed the sentiment upon Reading the Speech of the 20th November.(7)  No public good can be derived from Spreading such opinions, a plausible pretence to treat in earnest will bring the Union into a critical situation & will demand all the Wisdom of the thirteen States to counteract a finesse.  But for the visit above mentioned I should have dispatched the bearer at 9 oClock this Morning, my Chain was broke, I went to Church & have finished in the Evening-& ought to be charged one day's expence of the Messenger.  I sincerely wish your Excellency health & Safety being with the highest Esteem & Respect &ca.  ""

  Dear Papa, York 20th April 1778 I begin to be settled. I now lodge at one Dowdell's in the same house with Mr. Henry. Our lodgings, all things considered, are well APRIL 20, 1778  enough. We breakfast at home but must dine abroad. The principal business now before Congress is the report of the Committee, which went to camp for putting the army on a new establishment: when the report is gone thro' & confirmed by the House, I will give you the heads of it. Recruits come slowly on to join Gen. Washington, whose army I fear is much weaker than the Enemy's. Gen. Gates will soon go to the high lands on Hudson's river & command a distinct corps to be stationed there for the security of that post. This corps will I fancy be augmented to 8000 men. I have had some conversation with Gen. Lee, who was in this place a few days ago on his way to his Farm in Virga.(1) He says Howe has 14000 men in Pha. I fancy he is imposed on & that the Enemy is not so strong. I judge of their strength by their inactivity. When we have done with the arrangement of the army, we shall proceed to the regulation of finances, which demands the immediate & serious attention of Congress.  The Cartel is in suspence. I do not imagine an Exchange will take place; an insuperable bar to it will be a resolve of Congress, which considers Americans inlisting with the Enemy as Traytors, & subject to the treason laws of the Several States to which they may respectively belong. This Resolve Congress can not depart from; nor can Howe submit to it.  We have had no letters from our Agents in France since last May. One Mr. Francy, an Agent of Beaumarchais, is now here & has entered into a contract with Congress. He had agreed to advance us 24 millions of Livres, but it is specified in the agreement that we shall not draw for more than £100,000 Ster, till he receives the approbation of his Employer. I have not the least doubt but that Beaumarchais is the go between, or the Agent employed by the French court; for of himself he has no estate; this information I had from Mr. de Coudray. I have no doubt but that France & Spain will aid us with money & the necessaries of war, but I am equally persuaded in my own mind they will not yet a while engage in a war with G B, unless they should be drawn into it by some unforeseen accident, & contrary to their present System of politicks.  I hear our Assembly has raised the Tax to 25/ in the hundred. I think they have done well. You must keep a considerable sum of money by you to answer the demands on our estates, for the public assess[men]ts & county levies. We must not have less than £4000 by us to answer these demands & current expences.  The Enemy will, I am persuaded, make a vigorous effort this Campaign; at present we are very ill prepared to receive them. However as our lives, our property, & Liberty depend on the event of this Contest, I hope the People will rouse from their lethargy, & act with a vigor & spirit suitable to the important & glorious cause in which they are engaged.   I write this to Molly as much as to you. I hope she is assured of my affectionate love, & that she will take great care & use much industry to recover her health. I hope she will send me the thread stockings when finished; by this time I dare say Miss Betsy has finished the pair she was about when I left home. My love to little Poll & Charles, & Mrs. Darnall. I hope you are well. Use gentle exercise, keep up your Spirits, mine are good notwithstanding the prospect is a little cloudy at present; but we have surmounted greater difficulties, than what we have now to contend against, and I trust we shall surmont these. The American motto should be \""tu contra audentior ito.\"" My complts to Capt Ireland, Jemmy Howard & the Doctor. I am, Yr. affectionate Son, Ch Carroll of Carrollton  P.S. 4 o'clock.  We recd. this morning letters from the General of the 18th instant.(2) The Treaty for an exchange of prisoners is broken off, and upon the very point we could wish vizt. the Commissioners of Gen. Howe acknowleging that it was only a personal treaty on his part by which his own personal honor would be bound, & not the faith of his Nation. The General has sent us a printed copy of the draughts of two bills;(3) we do not know whether these bills have been brought into Parliat. or passed into laws; but considering their insidious tendency, I imagine they are by this time Acts of Parliat. The first is  A draught of a Bill for declaring the intentions of Parliat. concerning the exercise of the right of taxation over the Colonies.  This Bill, after reciting that the views of Parliat. have been misrepresented, enacts that Parliat will not impose any duty, tax, or assessment payable within the Colonies, except only such duties as it may be expedient to impose for the regulation of commerce, the net produce of such duties to be always paid & applied to & for the use of the Colony in which they shall be respectively levied, in the manner as duties &c collected by the authority of the respective Assemblies are ordinarily paid & applied.  In short this bill only enacts into a law the proposal made by Lord North in 1774.(4)  The second draught is of a Bill  To enable the King to appoint Commissioners with sufficient powers to treat, consult, & agree upon the means of quieting the disorders in America.  The principal provisions are as follow-to appoint commissioners  1. to treat of grievances which may exist in the Colonies with any body or bodies political & corporate.  2. to treat with said Bodies of & concerning any aid or contribution to be furnished by all or any of the Colonies or of any other regulations or matters as the Commissioners may consider necessary or convenient for the honor of his Majesty.   NB-nothing agreed upon to be conclusive till confirmed by Parliat.  3. to order a cessation of hostilities; to suspend the act of the 16th of the present King for cutting off all intercourse with the Colonies; to suspend all the Acts passed since the 10th of February 1763, all this to be done at the discretion of the Commissioners in all such places as they shall think proper.  4. to grant pardons to all such persons as they shall think proper & deserving of them.  5. to appoint Governors with the usual powers of Governing in all such places as they shall think fit.  I have given you the substance of these two famous or rather infamous bills; for the obvious intention of them is to mislead & divide our People. The Ministry begin to see they can not conquer us but by dividing. You must excuse inacuracies & blunders. I write in a great haste having my hands full.  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton (5) ""

  Dear Sir, York Town. 20 April 1778 General Howe has sent out of Philadelphia a Cart loaded with Hand-Bills, expressing to be A Draught of a Bill to declare the Intentions of Parliament, concerning the Exercise of the Right of imposing Taxes, within the Colonies.  And be it Enacted & declared, That the King and Parliament, after the Passing the Act, will not impose any Duty, Tax or assessment whatsoever, payable within any of the Colonies, except only such Duties, as it may be expedient to impose for the Regulation of commerce: the Net-produce of such Duties to be paid and applied to the Use of the Colony, in which levied, in such Manner, as other Duties collected by the Authority of the general Courts or assemblys of such Colony, are ordinarily paid & applied.  A Draught of a Bill to enable his Majesty to appoint Commissioners to treat, consult and agree upon Means of quieting Disorders in the Colonies.  And be it enacted etc. That-Persons to be appointed by his Majesty, shall have Power to treat, consult and agree, with such Body or Bodies political & corporate, or with such assembly, or assemblies of Men, or with such Person or Persons, as they shall think meet, of & concerning any Grievances or Complaints, existing or supposed to exist, in the Government of any of the Colonies, or in the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, respecting the same, and of or concerning any aid or Contribution to be furnished, by all or any of the Colonies respectively, for the common Defence of the Realm, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, and of & concerning such other Regulations, provisions, Matters & things, as, upon mature Deliberation of the Commissioners or any of them, shall be thought necessary or convenient for the Honor of his Majesty and the common Good of all his Subjects: Provided that no Regulation, provision, Matter or thing, so proposed, treated, consulted or agreed shall have any other force or Effect, or be carried further into Execution, than is mentioned in this Act until approved by Parliament. APRIL 20, 1778  Provided also that the Commissioners or any- of them may order & proclaim a Cessation of Hostilities, on the part of his Majestys Troops, in any of the Colonies, for any Time, & under any Conditions or Restrictions, they shall think convenient, and such order & proclamation may revoke & annul, according to their Discretion.  And be it Enacted That the Commissioners or any of them, may by proclamation suspend the operation & Effects of the Act of Parliament, of the 16th year of his Majesty, \""for prohibiting all Trade & Intercourse,\"" or of any of the provisons or Restrictions therein contained, for such convenient Time as they think proper.  And be it Enacted That the Commissioners etc. shall have Power to suspend, in such places, & for such Times, as they may think fit, during the Continuance of this act, the operation & effect of all or any of the Act or Acts of Parliament, which have passed, since 10th of February 1763, & which relate to any of the Colonies, so far as the same does relate to them.  And be it Enacted That the Commissioners etc. shall have Power to grant a Pardon or Pardons to any Number or Description of Persons, within any of the Colonies, & to appoint a Governor in any Colony, with such power, as heretofore granted by his Majesty.  The act to continue in force till  1st June 1779.  Published by order of the Commander in chief, Robert Mackenzie Secretary, Philada. 14 April 1778  Two opinions prevail here. Some think this insidious Scheme originated in Philadelphia, others the far greater Number beleive it came from the Ministry. The manifest Intention is to amuse Us with a Prospect of Peace & to relax our Preparations. I hope my Countrymen will have too much good Sense to be deceived. I think it would be adviseable immediately to publish this Attempt, but I hope it will be attended with some Remarks to expose its Design, & remove the baneful Effects it may have on the credulous & weak among the People. Mr Paca has Leisure-it ought not to be attempted to be suppressed.  Captain Nicholson informs, that a Number of Recruits are enlisted for the Enemy in Worcester and Somst. Counties, 90 came to the fleet, when he was on board. It is reported the disaffected in Queen Ann's County have rose, & Congress were yesterday acquainted with an Insurrection in Sussex County. The Malignants are assembling in Arms at Jordans Island. You will be applied to by Congress to order 300 of your Militia, with two field Pieces, & 28 Artillerists, to march there.(1)  The Randolph Frigate is said to be lost. She engaged a 50 Gun Ship for an Hour, and both Sides drawing off to repair their Damage,   she by accident blew up, and every Soul on board perished. The proposed Cartel is broke off. Our Commissioners had full Powers, & their Act would have bound the public faith, Howes Commissioners had not full Powers, & could only engage his private Faith, and that too only during his Command. The Exchange on Parole will continue.  No other Part of my last (2)was to have been private, but Genl. Lee's Name. I am inclined to think Baltimore fort remains in the same defenceless State as I mentioned to the assembly a year ago. There is a great Mistake in my Letter about the Quantity of Continental Arms. I meant to say Congress had fifteen thousand Arms, & above two hundred field pieces. I suppose I folded the Letter before it was dry, & that Circumstance added to the Naughts. I will seize the first favourable Opportunity to apply to Congress for some Mony, but our Demands to pay & buy provisions are very pressing.

  Dear Sir, York Town April 20 1778 I wish some Mode would be adopted to pursue the Release of our Subjects, who are taken by the Enemy, not in Arms. The Situation is truely distressing. Humanity and Policy combine to urge Us to take some speedy and effectual Measures to obtain their Discharge but one of two Modes occurs to Me, either to declare them not objects of Capture, or to seize the Friends of Great-Britain, and detain them to redeem ours with the Enemy.  The Case of Mr. Gunning Bedford is attended with some particular Circumstances. He was taken by a Party of our Enemy abt 13th of February, and has been confined in the New Jail ever since, and even threatened with Punishment as a Robber for stopping some People carrying provisions into the City.

  Dear Sir. York Town Apl. 20th. 1778. I have procured the inclosed paper with some difficulty. When you have read it, if the Assembly should be setting, I wish you would send it to the Speaker. Different opinions prevail here with regard to the Authenticity of it. For my own part I have no doubt, from what I have lately seen in the English papers, but these two Bills before this time, are enacted into Laws. I dread the impressions it will make upon the minds of many of our people. If it should, and I have no doubt of it, make its appearance in the form of a Law, it will prove more dangerous to our cause than ten thousand of their best troops. It will in a Day or two be under the consideration of Congress.  The Cartell for the General Exchange of prisoners is at an End. Upon our commissioners examining the powers of the Commissioners on the part of Genl Howe, they discovered he meant the treaty to be of a personal Nature, founded on the mutual Confidence and Honor of the contracting Generals, and had no Intention of binding the Nation, or of extending the Cartel beyond the limits and Duration of his own Command. They declared themselves ready to treat with us on this footing, with their present powers which they deemed adequate to the purposes of their Meeting. Upon this point the treaty broke off. I lament the Situation of our prisoners, and must approve of the Conduct of our Commissioners. A Cartel upon so narrow a foundation as the personal Honor of Genl Howe would be of little use to us and of short duration, liable at any time to be set aside by a subsequent Commander or by the British King without a breech of Honor. This Conduct will teach us a lesson respecting Genl Burgoyne and his Army.  I make no doubt you have heard of the insurrection in the Delaware State. By a Letter from a Mr Patterson we are informed that a considerable Number of the disaffected have assembled at a place  APRIL 20, 1778  near the head of Chester River. They are exerting themselves to add to their Numbers and those who will not join them, they deprive of their Arms and Amunition. It is said here they have British officers among them and expect to be reinforced from Philadelphia. This Matter is viewed here as very serious by some. Mr. Carrol gives his Compliments to you and desires me to acquaint you that there is a considerable quantity of provision at Charles Town at the Head of our Bay which appears to be in a dangerous Situation. There is also as I am informed by Mr. S. Stewart quantities of provisions at Princes Ann in Somerset, and other places in that neighbourhood, which it would be fortunate for us if we could remove them without Delay.  When I wrote to you, some Weeks ago, I informed you, that I had procured ten thousand Dollars for the recruiting service which I sent down by Col S. Smith, I have never heard whether you have recd. it.(1) If you should write to any of the Delegates, by the next post, I should be obliged to you to acquaint us with the receipt of the Money if it has reached your hands.  I am Sir with great respect, yrs. J. Henry Junr.  ""

General Howe is now circulating as far as his own & the power of his Emissaries extend a Paper said to have been received by the February Packet, but printed in Philadelphia, 'titled  \""Draught of a Bill (Private) for declaring the intentions of the Parliament of Great Britain concerning the exercise of the Right of imposing Taxes within His Majesties Colonies Provinces & Plantations in North America.\""  \""Draught of a Bill to enable his Majesty to appoint Commissioners APRIL 20, 1778  with sufficient Powers to treat consult & agree upon the means of quieting the disorders now subsisting in certain of the Colonies Plantations & Provinces in North America.\""  \""Whereas the exercise of the Right of Taxation by the Parliament for the purpose of raising a Revenue has occasioned disorder, &c.- It is expedient to Declare that the K & P. will not impose any Duty &c. for the purpose of Revenue, except for the Regulation of Commerce &c. the N't produce to be applied for the use of the Colony in which the same shall be respectively levied-Commissioners to be appointed by His Majesty & authorized to treat with Body & Bodies political & Corporate with Assembly or Assemblies of men-Person or Persons-to proclaim a Cessation of Hostilities-to suspend the operation of the Act of 16th Geo 3d prohibiting Trade & Intercourse-to suspend for time all the Acts relative to the Colonies passed since 10th febry. 1763-to grant pardons to any number or description of persons to fill up Vacancies in the Offices of Governors & Commanders in Chief in the Colonies\"" &c. &c.(4)  The last article is nugatory & must have arisen from their ignorance that every place is full.  I need not trouble Your Excellency with my sentiments on this attempt nor on the proper means for exposing it to complete contempt & ridicule.  I differ with Gentlemen who suppose the performance originated under authority in England; it appears to me to be destitute of the most essential marks; if the MS., crossed the Atlantic it must have been the production of a Jacob Henriques or a Moses Lindo. I believe it to be of Philadelphia manufacture probably under hints from the other side of the Water & sent abroad like a Sibyl's Letter-'tis not improbable I may be obtruding a subject, which before this can reach Your Excellency will be known at large; be that as it may, if I can possibly obtain a Copy of the whole draught it shall accompany this for although I think it should be treated with contempt-yet not silent contempt-it is at present in the hands of some Gentlemen who will exert their Talents in stricturizing.  Your Excellency will have heard of the seperation of the Commissioners for establishing a Cartel, the conduct & determinations of the Gentlemen who appeared on our part is highly applauded by Congress-will do themselves honour & our Cause, service. I have the honour to be with the greatest Esteem & regard Sir Your Excellency's obedient & most hum. Serv't,  Henry Laurens, President of Congress.

Huntington drafted a report that rebuked efforts to create an independent state of Vermont and declared that \""no number or body of people\"" had the right to set up a new state \""without the Consent of the State or States in which they are or were Included at the time the Congress were at first Elected & Convened for the Safety & defence of these United States; & the approbation of Congress.\"" This report was submitted to Congress (it is not known when), but Congress never read it-in part because the delegates felt they had more pressing business to attend to but also, one supposes, because they were disinclined to tackle such a sensitive issue involving so many conflicting interests and no clearcut way to reconcile them. See JCC, 10:367; Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 3:144-46; and New York Delegates to Clinton, July 21, 1778.  3 Laurens also transmitted copies of these resolves with brief covering letters that he wrote this day to Gov.

I write all my private Letters by scraps as I can catch half an hour & half an hours disposition, the intervals between Public business nature claims as her own for lounging or amusement & we have often little family quarrels upon this score.  General Howe has as far as his own & the Power of his Emissaries have extended sent abroad a spurious draught of a Bill insinuated to be Parliamentary, importing an intended proposition for reconciling differences & quieting disturbances in the Colonies. Governor Clinton shall be furnished with a Copy-which you will of course see-probably you will have seen one sooner-your Morris & our Drayton have it in hand. I make no doubt but that we shall return it decently tarred & feathered.(1)  The Commissioners at New Town for establishing a Cartel for Exchange of Prisoners have done as did Balaam & Balak, 24 Numbers 25 v.(2) Those on our part have gained great Credit, their conduct & proceedings were spirited, perspicuous, honorable to themselves & their Constituents & must do our Cause service in the Eye of the Enemy.

  Sir April 20th 1778  We have the honor of acknowledging your Letter of the 2d inst. and very unhappy in not being able to comply with the request of your Excellency and your Council of safety.(1) The gallant conduct of Captain Harding intitles him to notice; but when you Sir, and your Council of safety consider that by the destruction and Capture of several of our frigates their Captains are thrown out of actual service, you will easily perceive that it would be doing not only injustice to those officers some of whom at least are very valuable, but to the Continent to pass by them, and appoint to the command of the frigate at Norwich any Gentleman who hath not had A Command in the Continental Navy let his merit be ever so great. It would particularly disapoint the expectations of Captain Hinman who hath wrote to us on the subject should we honor Captain Harding with the Command of that frigate. Indeed it is not with us to appoint it is our duty only to nominate and recommend. We beg leave in answer [to] the last paragraph in your Excellencys letter to observe, that it is not the practice of States to recommend Navy Officers, and that Captain Saltonstal was nominated to Congress by the Marine Committee in consequence of recommendations from the Delegates of your States.

  Dear Sir, York 21 April 1778. By a letter from Gen. Smallwood of the 17th instant from Willmington we are informed of an insurrection of the Tories at a place called Jordans Island 10 miles from Dover. Smallwood apprehends this insurrection may become very serious unless speedily suppressed. His letter is referred to a committee of which I am one. We shall report that you be requested to call out 300 of the militia from the adjacent counties of Maryd. & put them under a spirited & active officer, who will receive his instructions from a committee of Congress.(1) I beg your attention to this business. Smallwood writes that we have considerable stores at Charles Town, which he fears may be taken or destroyed by these Insurgents. If we have any considerable Stores at Charles Town, or at any other place near the bay they run an equal or greater danger of being destroyed by parties from the Enemy's Shipping. You can not take too much precaution to secure these or any other stores that may be near the water.  Mr. Henry has sent you a copy of draughts of two Bills, which as they are of a most insidious tendency, I make no doubt have long since been passed into Acts of Parliat. I wish you would employ some ingenious writer to combat & expose the perfidiousness of our Enemies. They stop at nothing. The whole british Nation seems rising against us; they will unite art & force to conquer us. I am persuaded they will send over during the course of the summer & fall at least 14000 men, principally british.  Is it not strange that the lust of domination should force the British nation to greater exertions, than the desire of liberty can produce among us?  By the Mercury Packet in 7 weeks & 3 days from Falmouth we hear that all hopes of an amicable settlemt. between the Turks & Russians were at an end. By a courier which arrived at Warsaw the middle of Decr. there was reason to believe hostilities had then, or were on the point of being commenced.  The Elector of Bavaria is dead. His death may possibly involve Germany in a war. If our People would but exert themselves this campaign we might Secure our liberties for ever. Gen. Washington is weak; reinforcements come in slow. Try, for God Sake & the Sake of human nature, to rouse our countrymen from their lethargy. Gates will command a body of men in the Highlands on Hudson's river for the Security of its navigation. The Congress do worse than ever. We murder time, & chat it away on idle impertinent talk. However I hope the urgency of affairs will teach even that Body a little dis- APRIL 21, 1778  cretion.

  Dear Sir, York Town April 21. [17]78, Tuesday Night 11 o'Clock Congress this Evening recd a Letter from Gen. W. enclosing a Philada. Paper of the 17 Ulto. The Draft of the two Bills (mentd. in mine of this Day) are published in it. Dispatches arrived there last Tuesday, in 28 days. Under the London Head of 19 February  on the Tuesday preceding Leave was given to bring in the two Bills. Lord Norths Speech is in it, on making the proposition.  Short late acts for your Satisfaction. \""Our Army is great, our Navy is great, our Men in Health, in Spirits, & well supplied, but the Resistance of America is greater; & the War has lasted longer, than was at first apprehended, much longer than any friend to this Country could wish, & I do not think it will end in this Campaigne. In the present Situation of affairs only three propositions can be made-1st. to strengthen our forces & continue the War upon the present plan. 2. to recal it from America, and 3. to offer Terms of Conciliation to her. The first is attended with too great an Expence of Men & Mony, an Expence which Conquest itself wod. not balance. The second is to subscribe to the Independy of America. The third is that which appears to Me to be the best and the wisest. I wish for an open Conference with America-he then explained his plan as expressed in the Bills.  \""I will say hold out to the Colonies a Cessation of the Exercise APRIL 21, 1778  Photographic Reproduction of Resolve on Pardons, April 23, 1778  of Taxation, & I will not subject it to any Conds. or to the Demand of any specific Contribution. I do not see that any other Concession can be made without admitting the Complete Indy. of America-but wod. be the Effect of that Independy? I cannot see into futurity, but it is big with every possible Evils. Independy with a cordial Love between Us is one thing; with an Union with our Enemies, fatal. From their Indy a Danger arises from a great Naval Power; a Danger also to our other Possessions. I do not think that we should yield to it, till our Resources are much lowered. Indy. is not beneficial to America, she cannot be so happy, so easy, cannot have such personal Liberty, as if she remains dependant on Us.\"" Moved for the Bills.  This Minute received the enclosed from our President.  I forgot-Ld North-\""it is necessary to hold out some Inducemt to the Colonies, collectively & seperately. Some may not & some may renounce their Independency.\""  Two things are in my opinion essentially necessary-a respectable Army, a full Congress. Every Nerve shod. be exerted to fill our Ranks. I am of opinion that it would be prudent for every assembly or executive immediately to publish a Pardon to all their Subjects who have taken arms etc, who shall return to their Country & take the Oath of allegiance before a limitted Time.(1) Think well of this. I beleive it would thin their Ranks, and detach their friends. We know our people, many of them, are desirous of quitting them. If possible keep our assembly together-if broke up convene them early in June. I wish Mr Stone wod. come up. I wish Paca wod. quit his Judges Seat, & that our assembly wod. appoint him. I did intend Home, but I beleive I shall stay & see it out. The Hour to try the Firmness & prudence of Men is near at Hand. I am really diffident of Myself, I shall endeavor to act my Part well. My Soul has been chagrined at certain Conduct, but I love my Country, & shall with pleasure retire after Peace is established.  I am tired-tis 12 oClock. Adieu, Your Friend, Saml Chase  ""

  Sir York 21 April 1778. General Howe having industriously circulated the Draught of a Bill, said to be the ground of an Act of Parliament intended to be passed, with a view no doubt of diverting the People of America from their grand object of Preparation and defence, and General Washington having transmitted a few Copies of it to Congress expressly to put it in their Power to guard against the baneful Effects with which this political stroke of G.

  Dear Papa 22d April 1778  Yesterday evening we heard from the General, who transmitted us a Pha. newspaper containing Lord Norths introductory speech to the two bills which I mentioned in my last. His Speech I will send you by the first opportunity; it shews that the British Ministry are seriously alarmed at the expence & consequence of this war. I am firmly of opinion; that if we can keep the Enemy at bay this campaign, & prevent their making any considerable impression, That G B will acknowledge the Independency of these 13 united States next winter or spring. The war between the Turks & Russians, the death of the Elector of Bavaria, & the foreseen consequences of that event or at least the dreaded consequences, perhaps, the suspicions of a treaty between our Agents & the Courts of France & Spain and the heavy expence of this war may have determined the Administration to this measure. I believe also they mean to lull us into security, & that they will send this Summer & fall very powerful reinforcements to Gen. Howe. North's speech discovers great despondency; perhaps there may be some policy in this, the better to deceive us & make us remiss in our preparation.  The Raleigh continental Frigate is arrived at Porsmouth in New Hampshire in 32 days from France; the Alfred, which sailed with her, is taken by the Enemy. We have not as yet received any dispatches from our Agents in France by the Raleigh; perhaps the express may be on the road. It will be astonishing if we receive no letters from them by this opportunity. My love to Molly, Mrs. Darnall & the little ones. God grant you all health. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S. As the speech will be printed this evening I shall send it to you, that you may judge for yourself. The President has informed some gentlemen (as he says from good authority) that Sir Wm. Howe is recalled & Sir Henry Clinton succeeds him in the command. This piece of information, I believe, comes from his son, who is one of General Washington's aids.  2d P.S. 24th. I thought to have sent you the Speech before this but the Express has been delayed by other business. I hear nothing more of Howes being superseded. Imagine it is not true; tho' by Ld. North's Speech it is pretty plain the Ministry do not approve of his conduct. I am afraid this severe weather will destroy all the forward fruit.

The Committee have not yet reported on the information given by you respecting the disposal of Salt by Messrs. Hughes & Smith, but as your attention to the public Interest in general & particularly in that Instance is highly applauded & as the reputations of those Gentlemen are also in question, I persuade myself the Committee will not suffer the subject to sleep under their hands, & that a full investigation of facts will soon be made for the satisfaction of all parties.(3)  At a time when extortion, purloining, peculation & unjust appropriation of public Money together with a Thousand other Acts equally unbecoming Men professing to be supporters of the Virtuous Cause of these Infant States appear within the observation of every discerning Citizen every day I cannot resist an inclination to thank a fellow Labourer who discovers some attention, some disinterested attachment to public Interest. Your conduct is generally approved as I judge from the Voice of Delegates in Congress; if my particular thanks are worth your acceptance, I beg you will receive them. It is not my intention to insinuate censure nor to pass an hasty judgement against the Gentlemen at Edinton who have not been heard in their defence although from your State of the Case, they have had time & opportunity for that purpose, but admitting you have in some particulars mistaken facts, Your Zeal & Candor merit thanks & you have mine most heartily.

Bring to punishment one Capital transgressor & an hundred petit Knaves will fall by the same blow.  If we attend honestly to the expenditure of public Money, Issues from the Treasury will be restrained & the Comparative value of our Currency preserved. The greatest Enemies to these distressed States are those faithless false friends who under a pretence of serving the public have with sinister views plundered the Treasury, forced Emission upon Emission, depreciating the Exchange exactly in proportion to the increase in quantity.

  Dear Sir, 23d April 1778 By this opportunity you will receive draughts of two bills and Ld North's speech ushering them into the house of Commons. I have little doubt myself but that these Bills have long since been cloathed with all the formalities of law. If Lord North's speech is genuine (and I think we have no reason to suspect it to be otherwise) we may fairly conclude that the Administration begin to see the impracticability of APRIL 23, 1778  reducing these States, or of retaining them, when reduced, in such a state of subordination as to be useful to G B. The heavy & encreasing expence of the war, a Jealousy of France & Spain, perhaps the appearances of an approaching rupture in Germany about to be occasioned by the death of the Elector of Bavaria, the actual commencement of hostilities between Russia & the Porte have forced the British Ministry on this measure. However I am satisfied they will try the arts of negotiation first, in order to divide us, if possible, and will hazard another campaign, before they acknowledge the Indepence of these States: to withstand their hostile efforts this campaign, which I am convinced will be vigorous, and to counteract their insidious profers of reconciliation, it will be absolutely necessary to have a very respectable force in the field this year; and if a right & dexterous use is made of the Minister's speech, it will probably much promote the recruiting service among us. In a word, if we guard agt. their insidious offers on the one hand, and can resist their warlike efforts on the other during the ensuing campaign, I have not the least doubt but that they will acknowlege our Independency next winter, or Spring, particularly if no alliance between these States or any other European power be concluded in the interim.  The Raleigh continental Frigate is arrived at Porsmouth in 32 days from France; the Alfred which sailed with her is taken; we have not yet recd by this opportunity any dispatches from our Commissioners at Paris, tho I do not yet despair of receiving them, as the Express may be on the road.  The Congress has passed some observations on the two draughted Bills, to counteract their obvious design, or at least the possible bad effects they might produce in the minds of the People, if published without such strictures. These Observations will be printed to day; they will be immediately distributed throughout the United States.(1) I fear they are not so perfect as they ought to be, but the hurry of business & the want of time must & will, no doubt, sufficiently apologize with an impartial Public for all their imperfections.

  Dear Sir, on publick Service Albany 24th April 1778 I have passed some days in this City in Conference with the Commissioners of Indian Affairs on General Washington's Application  APRIL 24, 1778  for a party of the Oneidas and Tuscaroroes to join the grand Army.(1) Every Measure in our power has been taken to accelerate a Requisition which his Excellency has so much at Heart. These Nations have sent an Answer to a Speech from the Commissioners on the Subject, which will be transmitted by the Board. In the mean time as I this moment heard of an Opportunity by Express, I shall mention the Substance. They say that the Number of 200 is more than can be obtaind; but if the Troops and Fortress which they solicited are furnished agreeable to the Commisrs promise they will send forward a party of their Warriors; the number they do not ascertain. I presume the Result of the Council of the Six Nations now assembled at Onondago to deliberate on the Talk from the honourable Congress will enable us to form a true Judgement of the Dependance which may be placed on the Cooperation of those Nations. If they see a prospect of Tranquility on their own Borders some of them will turn out & Join our Arms with alacrity, otherwise it is hardly to be expected.  Since I wrote you a State of Affairs in this Department in my Letter of the 16th of March (2) one of my Predictions is verified. The Enemy with a Number of Vessells and Troops have appeard at Ticonderoga. A Party of 600 have landed and defeated the Militia of that neighbourhood. The whole Northern frontier is in Confusion. They apply earnestly for Assistance, and declare that without it they must again abandon their Farms of which many of them have so lately regaind the possession. But what Succour can be afforded? The Inhabitants of Tryon County are still apprehensive of an attack from the Westward; and from Albany Northward, which has been the principal Scene of the last Campaign the people may be said to be at work for their Lives; for if they do not at this Season get in their Summer Crops-(fall they have none)-they must starve. In the mean time all the Continental Troops except three small Regiments barely sufficient to guard the Publick Stores and Magazines and Laboratory at this place are drawn away. These Regiments are Graton's of about 210, Alden's 300, and Warners 124 Including N. C. Os. Van Schaacks of this State which was 500 strong I saw go away with great Reluctance on my part. Of our five Battallions none are now left us but Gansevoorts which garrisons Fort Schuyler, and the remains of Du Bois's employed in the defences of Hudson's River. If this State was in any tolerable Security it woud be my first Ambition to see the Forces which it has raised fighting the Battles of their Country in the most conspicious Field of Glory; but while We are exposed in every Quarter I cannot but entertain disagreable Apprehensions from the feeble Condition in which it is left. I have done the little in my power to prevent the Distresses which threaten us by my endeavours to possess Congress of the true Circumstances of our Affairs in my Letter before  alluded to. That it has not had some weight I pray God may not prove a publick misfortune.  We expect daily the Resolution of the Indian Council at Onondago. Much depends upon it, and I wait here to receive it and assist the Commissioners in the Measures which may be further necessary in their Department.  I have received particular Pleasure in taking a view of the Laby. & Park of Artillery & military Stores at this place. Everything is in the most excellent order, and great Honour is due to Major Stevens of the Massachs. who commands the Corpse of Artillery in this Department. The Conduct of this young Gentleman in the Field & in conducting the publick Works is so distinguished as to entitle him to Favour & Applause. The Committee of Congress who visited Ticonda. in November 1776 (3) appointed him Major of a Corpse of Artillery to be raised & to consist of three Companies of Artillery & one of Artificers to serve in the Northern Department. The 9th of the same month he recd a Commission from Congress appointing him Major Commadant of that Corpse. He is much dissatisfied on finding that Col. Crane considers him as Major of his Regiment of Artillery; which Mr. Stephens thinks a Degradation; & seems determind to Join the Grand Army as a Volunteer if it is insisted on. The officers of his corpse are equally averse to such an Arrangement. These are the Facts which I promised to State to Congress, & for the Truth of which he refers to Major General Gates. I wish as Major Stevens has undergone severe Service, with great Reputation, & without any promotion, that a suitable attention may be paid to his Merit. He declares that he is contented to retain his present Rank in a separate Command. If He can be gratified consistent with the good of the Publick, it seems to be a very small Reward for a series of services so distingushed; & in the last Campaign so eminently successful.(4) I have the Honour to be, with the greatest Respect, Dear Sir, Your most Obedient humble Servant, Jas. Duane  [P.S.] There are still great Complaints of the want of money in this Department. The Commissy. of Purchases is disabled from complying with his Contracts, & the fat Cattle intended for the Army fall into private Hands for fear of the Operation of the regulating Law which has taken place in this & other states. The Paymasters of Van Schaack's & Gansevort's Regiments have taken up large Sums to silence the clamours of the Soldiers. It was well that they were Gent. of credit & connections, or this Seasonable Remedy woud have been out of their power. There are 200,000 Dollars in the Military Chest; but it is said Mr Trumbull has directed this money to be removd to the Fish Kills; And that if it remaind here there are no means to issue it; as a General Officer's warrant is necessary. If the operations of the Enemy to the Northward become more serious; and already   they are very distressing to the frontier Inhabitants; what is to be done? Is not Gen. Carleton at the head of 3000 men with the entire command of the Lakes which conduct him to our very Doors still formidable; If not for the purposes of Conquest at least for those of Ruin and Desolation?

  Sir, 24th April [1778] Since my last of the 31st March by Lieut. Thomson I have had the honour of receiving & presenting to Congress Your Excellency's favour of the 26th of the same Month.(1) Within the present packet Your Excellency will receive twelve printed Copies of a Speech said to have been made in the British House of Commons by Lord North, Draughts of Bills referred to by His Lordship & an Act of Congress of the 22d pointing to those supposed performances in the Councils of old England & earnestly calling upon the States for their contribution to put the Army in the most respectable State for meeting the Enemy with the Sword or the Olive branch.  Last Night intelligence was received of great commotions in the City of Philadelphia, the Officers of the Enemy's Army expressing loud dissatisfaction at the appearance of an unfavorable change of affairs, & the Citizens clamoring their apprehensions of what may happen to them. Admitting all this to be true, it may be mere shew, & we ought not to trust for safety from crafty manoevres. Let us endeavor to be prepared for meeting either Generals or Ambassadors with a formidable force as the only means of procuring terms for an honorable peace. General Lee had assured me some days since that many Officers in the British Army are good Whigs & speak their sentiments freely & none of the whole group satisfied with their late & present employment. I have good authority for saying that General Howe is recalled & 'tis said Sir H Clinton is to be at the head of the Army.  A dangerous attempt to Insurrection is discovered in the State of Delaware & parts adjacent in Maryland, Congress have adopted such measures as appear necessary for suppressing the parties concerned in it & for bringing them to punishment.

  Dear Sir, 24th April [1778] By the Seals affixed to the inclosed Letter you will see that I had opened it, that is to say, had in my usual way cut the paper round the first Seal, which was no sooner done than I discovered the error without seeing the Contents the whole of which I am as ignorant as you at the present moment are. It had come in a number of public Letters when Mr. Drayton was sitting with us & anxious to communicate intelligence to that Gentleman, I had begun to open this, supposing it to have been directed to me, he was Witness to the accident & to my instantly mending the breach.  Inclosed with this you will receive three Copies of an Act of Congress of the 22d Inst. founded on the appearance of preceeding Acts said to be Lord Norths Speech & draughts of Bills referred to. Supposing these to be Sibyl's Letters, our Act I trust, will do no harm. The States will learn the temper of their Delegates & I hope be animated to the utmost exertions for reinforcing the Army. The general opinion is in favor of the genuineness of the Speech &ca. & last Night intelligence from the City imported marks of confirmation. Tis said the Army & their Landlords were in commotion the former exceedingly dissatisfied with the politics at St. James's, the latter with \""Conscience trembling for their Sins.\"" I may laugh at all this & admit it to be so, but as nothing looks so much like an honest Man as a Rogue, I would act & earnestly wish all these States to Act as if the whole was manoevre.

A formidable appearance will oblige our Enemies to dulcify their propositions if they mean to hold out any, for peace. Never trust appearances on the part of an Enemy.  General Gates will begin his Journey to Morrow for Fish Kill where he is to take Command of the Northern Army.

  Dr Sir. York April 25th 1778 Mr Harnett will inform you of every thing which I can write about at present. I shall therefore refer you to him, and spare you the trouble of reading.  The enclosed paper (1) will shew you the present temper of our Enemies, and the disposition of Congress. I will make on it no other comment than to observe that nothing is necessary to ensure our success but vigorous efforts. This opinion which I have so often declared, is every day more and more justified, and I hope will be finally sanctified by the happy event of our struggles.  I hope before this the assembly have made a new choice of Delegates, and supplied my place with a more able citizen. I shall set off on the fourth of May and leave what public papers are in my hands directed for the succeeding Delegates. Altho' I shall remain here until that day, yet I do not find myself entirely clear on the propriety of voting in Congress after the 28th Inst. I am told by Mr Harnett that on that day, in last year the election of Delegates was made, and on the preceding day in this year, trust in that case the term of my service ends. The commission under your hand being dated the 4th of May and having in some former letters promised to remain here until then to execute any command of the state, I will keep my promise tho' I assure you Sir, every hour is and will be a very heavy one to me, until I can return to the station of a private Citizen, secure under the protection of the Laws and constitution of my Country. Every day Sir, convinces me more and more, that such a station is the only happy one, and nothing but my deference to the opinion of my Country and my wishes to serve the cause of Freedom should ever have drawn me from it, or will withhold me now from it. Happy is it, for those Countries who are at a distance from the war. They are secured from the depradations of the Enemy, and their civil rights from most violent infractions. The Rights of private citizens, and even of our sovereign Communities are at present so little regarded in Congress that any rumor will determine a majority to violate both, and it is hardly safe to oppose it. Every argument against the unlimited power of Congress to judge of necessity, and under that APRIL 25, 1778  Idea to interpose with military force is heard with great reluctance, hardly with patience, and the internal police and sovereignty of states, are treated as chimerical phantoms. One instance I will give you. Genl. Smallwood was ordered by Congress to apprehend two men, in the Delaware State, under a suggestion that they were inimical, and that the state was unable to exercise any act of government, tho the assembly was then sitting. He did apprehend them. They applied for a Habeas Corpus. The Chief-Justice granted it, the officer refused to obey and applied to Congress for advice. The Congress approved the officers conduct, and was with difficulty prevented from ordering him in express terms to proceed in direct opposition to the habeas Corpus-and they forbore this only under an Idea that approbation of his former conduct would determine him to proceed.(2) I need not tell you I opposed these things. You know my pertinacious attachment to civil Rights, and my immovable determination to oppose every thing that may give color to an arbitrary exercise of Power under an Idea of right. I shall probably give you another instance before long wherein our state and I myself am concerned. I have upon a late occasion insisted so far on the sovereignty of the state, and my being amenable to no other jurisdiction, that I have given very great offence to Congress.(3) An accident involved me in the dispute, and so far as it regarded me personally I should have waved all opposition, but I delivered occasionally in debate my political Opinions of the power of Congress and the sovereign and exclusive Authority of the states, over these Delegates. These Opinions were not relished and I was required to make some apology. I very frequently apoligised for the Terms and manner in which they were conveyed, tho' I could not perceive any thing offensive in them, but I persisted in the Opinions, and declared I could not give them up without an Outrage to my honor in telling a falsehood and what I deemed a treason to the state I represented in giving up her sovereignty. Nothing however would do, but retracting the opinions, and it was in vain to require this of a man who would die in support of them. I shall trouble you no more at present on this subject, but at some future time will give it to you, with all its circumstances. My Country will I suppose one day judge of it, but I shall not desire it during the present struggle. I should be very sorry that any thing would interrupt the public harmony which is so necessary to our success, a time of peace and tranquility will better suit the investigation of Civil Rights and relations. I wish you sir, all imaginable happiness, and am with the greatest sincerity your Mo. Ob. servt.(4) Thos. Burke  ""

  Sir York Town April 25th 1778 Mr. Collins arrived here last Saturday with emaciated horses after having passed through a very deep and difficult road. Your Letter to the President of Congress and the state accounts are referred to the treasury board who will soon report thereon to Congress. We should urge this matter on; but it would be impossible for Mr Collins to procede with his horses without being recruited, and the longer he stays here the more money he will probably recieve. I could wish that the Assembly in their Letters had mentioned what part of the ballance it would have suited them to receive, in Loan-Office certificates. However I shall do what I think will be agreeable to my constituents.(1) The confederation is not yet taken up; if it should be before I return I will pay a religious regard to your instructions.  I observe that the State have fitted out a Vessel to purchase a load of provisions at Maryland, Virginia, or North Carolina. If she had been dispatched in the winter it would have been better. The navigation then Was less hazardous, and provisions much cheaper than at present. I wish her a prosperous voyage, and will honour the bills that the Capt. of her may draw upon me on account of the state. In a letter I wrote to the Assembly (2) sometime past I informed them that I had paid out off the ten thousand dollars, which Mr. Marchant had retained of the 200,000, a bill of exchange drawn by Timothy Coffin late master of the Diamond on Mr. Marchant and myself in favour of Richard Ellis and endorsed to Ruben Hussey or order, of which as no notice hath been taken in any letter I have received from Governt., I am afraid my Letter miscarried.  Mr. Collins informs me that the Delegates which will be chosen at the ensuing election will not set out until some time in June. I should be loth to leave congress, the state unrepresented, but my health, and the unhappy situation of my family require that I should be at home as soon as possible, wherefore let me intreat you to send forward two of the delegates at least immediately after the choice. APRIL 25, 1778  This will be accompanied by a late Speech of Lord North, the Draught of two bills and the remarks of Congress on the latter. The design of this ministerial manoeuvre is obvious.

  Dear Sir York Town April 25th. 1778 I am now to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 4th of March and the fourth of this month.  The Boston hath on board a precious cargoe.(1) May she carry it safe to France! The Enemies ships do indeed swarm in the Seas of America and Europe; but hitherto only one of our Frigates hath been captured on the Ocean. Two have been burned in North River, two sunk in Delaware, one captured there, and one in Chesapeak. The Alfred we are just informed was taken on her passage home by two frigates in sight of the Rawleigh. The particulars of this capture and why she was not supported by the Rawleigh we are ignorant of. I hope Capt. Thompson is not culpable. I entertain a high opinion of him. The Columbus is a trifling Loss, and I should not much lament the Loss of the Alfred if her brave Captain, officers and men were not in the hands of a cruel enemy.(2) Our little fleet is very much thinned. We must contrive some plan for catching some of the Enemy's Frigates to supply our Losses; but we must take care not to catch tartars. It is reported that Capt. Biddle of the Randolph, in an engagement with a sixty gun ship, was blown up. We have been so unfortunate that I am apt to believe almost any bad news; but this report I cannot believe. I fear for the Providence, I know but little respecting her captain, and only one of her other officers.  APRIL 25, 1778  General Burgoyne and his family are allowed by Congress to go to Britain on their parole and Col. Anstruther to Rhode Island to solicit an exchange between himself and Col. Ethan Allen, if an exchange of the latter for Lt. Col. Campbell should not be agreed, which is the case; so that Anstruther must return on his parole. I know nothing about the Hessian officers you speak of, but presume they had permission to go to Newport from proper Authority.  I am sorry to hear that we are so much neglected by our Sister States, and hope that the arrival of the new General (3) will be attended with favorable circumstances. He is an officer of Spirit and I trust will take due care of the State and the tories. When Thomas Cranston Esq. came off the Island, he played the hypocrite so artfully as to induce some people to believe that he had changed his principles.(4) I wrote to one whose credulity was imposed upon by him my Sentiments on the occasion.(5) Sooner will an Athiopian change his Skin or a Leopard his spots, than Tories will become Whigs. I am told that he came from Newport to make a conveyance of his Estate to his son, it may be so, but such a fraudulent conveyance will not I trust protect it from confiscation. The ten other infamous scoundrels you have given me a list of, I never had the dishonour to be acquainted with. I am of your opinion that some persons of consequence in the Towns of S. & N. Kingstown are busy in procuring men for Whitmore's regiment, and by proper management it may be, if true, fully known. The way might be this. Let Genl. Sullivan bribe some artful persons who are connected or will connect themselves with those who are supposed to be disaffected in said or any other towns to converse with them on the subject of our political disputes, and fall in with their sentiments, in this way they may become acquainted with the principals among the Tories, and after having obtained sufficient proof to convict them they may be dragged forth to public view and receive the punishment which such perfidious miscreants deserve. A plan of this kind was successfully executed in the State of New York, and cannot fail of success in any state provided proper persons are employed. It is of great importance that the Tories should be known, not only to prevent the mischief they may do, but that the States where they lurk may have their Estates to enable them to discharge the debt contracted by a war which they have encouraged, and are still supporting by every means in their power, against their country. If you approve of the measure I have hinted for detecting our internal secret enemies I hope you will mention it to General Sullivan.  If it should be thought proper to have an addition of one to your Board, it would have more weight coming from the board than from a member in his private capacity, and I don't know any Gentleman who would be more agreeable to Congress than Mr Whipple.  We have nothing new, but a melancholy account of the Randolphs  blowing up in an engagement with a fifty gun ship. It is supposed that every Soul perished.  Inclosed is the last York paper which contains mighty manoeuvres. It ought to be immediately reprinted in Providence. You will therefore deliver it to the Printer so soon as you shall have read it.

  Dear Sir, York Town April 25th 1778. I am to acknowledge the receipt of your's of the 6th instant.  Very happily for us the Flamand is not at our expense while she lies in Portsmouth; however that hath not prevented the Committee of Commerce from doing every thing in his power to dispatch her.(1) The demand of money for the great departments of the Army have been so large and frequent as to prevent our supplying the Navy Board agreeably to our wishes. We have lately procured warrants upon the Loan Offices in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut and have desired the Navy Board to give Mr Langdon his share of them.(2) The want of money and the impossibility of getting hands for the 74 if she were built hath occasioned us to order the building of her to be stopped;(3) these reasons and the blockade of Chesapeake hath caused to cease building the ships in Virginia.(4) Could you have thought it? The keel stem and stern post of one of those frigates are but fixed, and the other is not half finished, notwithstanding the carpenters have been employed about them upwards of a twelve month. If we were disposed to build a Navy and were to proceed at this slow rate and the enemy were to continue to capture  APRIL 25, 1778  and force us to destroy our frigates as they have done for a twelve month past, it seems to me we should never have so many frigates afloat as there are States in the Union.  You have heard of the loss of the Virginia and how it was occasioned; it would give me pain to repeat it. The destruction of the Columbus is a trifling affair, nor should I much regret the loss of the Alfred, if her officers and men were not in the possession of the enemy. Capt Thomson was in sight when the Alfred was taken by two frigates. I shall suspend my judgment on this matter until I know the particulars.  I rec'd a letter lately from Mr Vernon in which he mentions that an addition of one should be made to the Navy Board and you as a suitable person. I have wrote to him that such a proposal would come with greater weight and propriety from the Navy Board than from him in his private capacity, and desired him, if the Board thought it proper, to mention to them to propose it to the Marine Committee.  Your State have shamefully neglected sending forward a representation. I imagined when you knew what happened last June by Rhode Island's not being represented you would have pointed out a measure to prevent such an evil happening by your State.(5) One of the most important affairs is now on the carpet, that of a military establishment of half pay for life, for such military commissioned officers as shall be in the service at the end of the war and New Hampshire unrepresented. When it was known that the old members could not continue to act until the new ones arrived the latter ought to have been ordered on in season.  Mr Burgoyne and his suite had leave from Congress to go to Britain on parole. General Lee is parolled for General Prescot and was here a few days since. The Cartel hath broke off on Genl Howe's refusing to pledge the public faith for the performance of what should be stipulated. The Epilogue would have pleased me better if the praise had been more judiciously bestowed. The name of the Marquis de la Fayette is printed wrong. It will be reprinted here and the name printed right.  This will be accompanied by Lord North's new conciliatory speech, two drafts of Bills with remarks thereon by Congress and a certificate from Wm Tryon. Our enemies are endeavoring to accomplish that by their insidious arts which they have not been able to effect by their arms. We are counteracting them.  Last evening we rec'd the melancholy news of the Randolph, Capt Biddle, blowing up in an engagement with a fifty gun ship. Our little fleet diminishes fast. We must contrive somehow or other to catch some of the enemy's frigates. Can you tell us how to do it? Our small vessels I think are the most successful. Instead of looking up to 74  gun ships we should look down to swift sailing 10 or 12 gun sloops. I have only time to add that I am with great esteem, your most humble servant, Wm. Ellery.  [P.S.] Give my regards to Mr Stevens, Gen Folsom & Dr Stiles if he should be at Portsmouth.  ""

This measure may be adopted-and if so I think that it will by calling in and burning so large a Quantity give Credit to the Whole-and perhaps particularly raise the first Emissions which are proposed to be sunk in this manner. As the Payment of the Interest in Bills will while the Interest shall continue have the same Effect to the Lender as tho the Principal was in specie, This may therefore induce such People as have the first Emissions not to part with them or rather induce such as Wish to be Lenders to procure such Bills. As every one well knows that a Certificate whenever it may be necessary to turn it into money may easily be done.  The Randolph Frigate is lost, Blown up in an Engagement  ""

Such has been Mr. Tryon's conduct towards Governor Livingston, General Washington, &c &c, an expence & trouble which might have been spared, since Congress from the first appearance of the Stratagem had determined to expose it in the most effectual manner to public view. In pursuance of such Resolution I have now the honour of transmitting within the present Inclosure twelve Copies of an Act of Congress of the 22d Inst. confirming the Report of a Committee on General Washingtons Letter of the 18th containing the said Draughts, to which is prefixed Lord North's speech at the introduction of the Bills into parliament.  Your Excellency will also find inclosed an Act of Congress of the 23d for granting pardons to certain characters therein described & Recommending to the several States to enact Laws or issue Proclamations for that purpose.(2) In a seperate packet are 50 Copies of this last mentioned Act which Your Excellency may judge necessary to disperse immediately. Congress were induced to this measure from well founded suggestions that great advantages would follow.  I have the honour to be with the highest Esteem & Regard &ca.  ""

  Sir 26th April [1778] When I writ to your Excellency by Messenger Brown the 20th Inst.(1) I had been at some trouble to procure the Copy of \""Draughts of Bills\"" &ca which went inclosed with my Letter, from an opinion that I should have offered somewhat quite new, but If I may be allowed to judge, from the measures which have been adopted by the late Governor of New York for affronting Govr.

  Dear Sir,(1) York Town April 26th. 1778 I Arrived here the 21st Inst. after a most disagreeable Journey indeed.  I inclose you a paper (2) (which if you have not seen) will amuse you, & I imagine some parts will not a little surprise you. Compare APRIL 26, 1778  the Speech of the Minister, with the last Speech from the Throne. Lee is exchanged. Tryon was imprudent enough, a few days agoe to write to Washington inclosing several of the Acts, desired him to disperce them thro' his Camp. When the Acts were posted up in Philadelphia The Officers tore them down in a most riotous manner swearing they were all cheated, for they were promissed the Rebels should be conqured, & their Estates divided amongst them. The Physic begins to work you see, All we have farther to do, is, to give them one good dose more this Campaign, & the business is done. The speech, the Acts, the exchange of Lee (which did not happen 'till after these acts came out, he had been out on Parole some time before), the sollicitude to disperse these Acts amongst our people all serve to shew those dam'd Villains are heartily sick of the business. However Congress takes it up in a different point of View, as all meant to throw dust in our eyes, & are preparing for a Vigorous Campaign. I think these manuvres of the Enemy will have this Good Effect. The house of Bourbone has all along been Jealous of our still hankering after an accommodation, & alliance with Great Britain, which has kept them very cautious in their conduct towards us. These Acts tend immediately to that purpose, & being so suddenly, & I may say, unexpectedly pass'd upon them, will oblige them instantly to declare themselves what part they mean to take with us, for they have been playing fast & loose with us too long. However before these acts made their appearance, we have had greater reason to think they would do something this summer, than we have yet had, but this beleif arises merely from hear say, for we have not had one line from our Embassadors since last May yet the information comes through such a Channel, that we have some reason to give Credit to it. I do not think Lord North altogether insincere, nor do I think he would be incorrigibly obstinate against admitting our Independency. You will observe these remarkable expressions in his speech. \""The first proposition is attended with too great an expence of Men & money, an expence which Conquest itself would not balance.\"" Again. \""Independency, with Cordial love between us, is one thing, with an union with our Enemies, Fatal.\"" I think this last sentiment means a great deal. I could make many other observations on it but time nor my paper (for I assure you its a scarce article here) will not allow. Another inducement I have to believe Ld. North earnestly wishes peace, & would not be totally averse to Independency, is the formidable appearance France particularly now wears, & which will prevent his sending a man to America this year, tho' we have had a most pompous account of 32,000 to be raised in the different parts of the Kingdom, for that purpose. So far, France certainly renders us some service. You will observe the report of the Committee, speaks doubtfully of the validity of the two Acts (3) but that was before, we received   them from Tryon, which are certified by him, to have actually pass'd. The report fully shews you the Ideas of Congress on this important subject. As this is a matter of as great & momentous concern as any that can come before Congress (except that of real treaty) I would therefore wish my conduct on every such occasion to be known to my Country, & leave to their Judgment whether I am right, or wrong. I do therefore declare the whole report met with my most hearty concurrance. I could then wish, If Commissioners should come out this summer, (as I really believe they will) & they have such powers as Congress can consistently treat with them upon, That a special meeting of the Legislature should be call'd, on this most Important subject, that their delegates may know their sentiments, & receive instructions accordingly. I just drop the hint to you, that you might be prepared for such an Event. I have not consulted any of my Collegues on this Subject, but I think the necessity of such a measure is so self evident that they must concur with me in this opinion, I am sure I should not think myself Justifyed in stirring one step in this business without. I have not time to add more than that I am Dr. Bee, with sincere Esteem Yr. most Obdt. Servt.  Jno. Mathews P.S. 27th. We received an express late last night (for tho' Sunday, we are obliged to do business, three nights out of five that I have been in Congress, we have sat 'till nine & ten oClock, so that you may imagine our business not trifling) from the General, Informing us that he had just received an account that he could depend on, That the Commissioners from England were daily expected in Philadelphia. They are Lord Amherst, Admiral Keppel, & Genl. Murray.(4) From such Men I am sure we can expect Nothing decisive, neither of whom have one single Qualification Requisite for such a business. They come out with their full Military Commissions also. On such Conduct, & such Men, I could say much, but time will not permit. Genl. Howe is certainly recalled & Clinton to take the Command.  ""

Brown is an orderly industrious fellow, & I would wish to keep him, but I think his demands are exorbitant. I wish Molly could recover faster, but her perfect recovery must be the work of time & proper regimen. I am sorry for the death of bold Robin; his death is a real loss. General Amherst, General Murray & Admiral Keppel are the Commissioners coming to treat with America. General Howe is certainly recalled; Sir Henry Clinton is to succeed him in the command, but I apprehend, only until the arrival of General Amherst, who I imagine will have the supreme Command. From the inclosed letter, & the articles of News in the printed handbill, which you sent me, I have no doubt but that preliminaries of a treaty have been entered into by our Agents at Paris. I suspect Carmichael is taken by the Enemy, as he sailed from France, or left Paris, the 27th of last Decr. Govr.

  Sir York April 28th 1778 The Instrument authenticating my last Election as a Delegate from North Carolina is dated May the 4th 1777. Both my Colleagues have informed me that they believed the Election was made on the 28th of April preceeding. The Constitution of the State requires the Election of Delegates to be annual, and it is a fundamental principle that the Constitution is a fixed rule of Conduct for all the powers of the State, which cannot be dispensed with, or deviated from, unless the Collective Body of the People give special authority for that purpose. All these circumstances induce me to believe that my power of Representing the State is at an End. The Instrument refer'd to is on the Journals of Congress and they can determin whether my attendance can be longer commanded. I request you Sir to lay the matter before them for their Opinion that my absenting myself may not be deemed a Contempt or breach of Order.(1) I should have Submitted my difficulty at a more early day in my place, but that I was unwilling to Interrupt the attention of Congress which was employed on objects far more Important. The same Cause kept me silent on another Matter which I shall now beg leave to mention in this which  APRIL 28, 1778  I suppose the only way remaining, for I hope my Country has yielded to my earnest request, and excused me from the Delegation.  I feel myself under a sense of very respectful Obligation to you and most of the Gentlemen of Congress for the solicitude which appeared for me on a late Occasion, and am persuaded that nothing but my being so unhappy in my Expressions as not clearly to convey my Ideas could have occasioned a mistake which is on your Journals. I am there represented as attempting to Justify withdrawing from Congress without permission, in an Instance which Interrupted very important business.(2) Such Justification is, sir, what I never did attempt, nor do I think that or any other breach of order Justifiable. My attempt was intended only to excuse my departure under particular Circumstances, by alleging that the same thing had been usually done by the other members without reprehension and that the time and Occasion were not improper for using a Liberty which had been denied to no other member. I am also represented as sending an Indecent Message to the House which I protest was never my Intention. The matter respecting the member from New York,(3) I never conceived myself called upon to answer, but it is not of Consequence enough to trouble you with. I do not mean now Sir to withdraw this matter from the Jurisdiction of my Constituents, it is in the train I wish it to be. To them I hope I can shew that the House intirely mistook my Meaning and when it can be done without injury to the Common Cause, I shall solicit their attention to the Subject, but not before if I can avoid it. My sole purpose at present is to prevent Gentlemen whom I greatly esteem and respect from retaining Impressions of me which I am unconscious of deserving. This I hope to Effect by declaring that I hold no Citizen in any rank or station Justifiable in doing any act, on any pretence, which may tend to the public prejudice, or in forbearing to do any act which is requisite for public Service. That I hold no man Justifiable for using Language or Manners Not sufficiently respectful to the assembly or Society of which he is a member. That attendance in Congress at all times when requested by the President either in or out of the House is in my Opinion what every member is absolutely bound to; and the House itself is Judge of the respect with which the whole or any of the members is to be treated in debate, and I only meant to Insist on the right each freeman must Necessarily have of Judging for himself on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of every Exercise of Power, and on the peculiar Right of the States to apply any punishment which should go beyond Censures. These I advanced occasionally in debate, as general political Opinions not in Justification of any thing that had happened but in answer to some things thrown out by other Gentlemen which seemed to me to hold up Opinions very different from them for the adoption of the House. I hope they are  not dangerous, and that persisting in them is not disrespectful to the honorable Members. If the Language and manner in which I delivered my Sentiments was not sufficiently respectful in the Opinion of the House, I beg they will attribute it to Inadvertance, or Imperfection of Temper, not to design. I beg they will believe that no man is more unwilling to give offence, no man more sincerely laments it when it happens through warmth or earnestness of Natural disposition.

  Sir,(1) 28th April [1778] I find my self indebted for your several favors of the 10th, 10th, 14th & 25th February, & this day I have been further honoured by the receipt of your 25th Inst.(2)  Congress will not attend to applications relative to Rank in the Army until an arrangement which is still under consideration shall be completed.  I have however conversed with friends on the particular subjects of your Letters & learned their sentiments. APRIL 28, 1778  It is admitted, that through the importunate & incessant pressing of different French Gentlemen for grade there may be instances of Commissions granted to some which seem to others injurious to themselves respecting relative Rank, but on the other hand it is insisted, as an undoubted fact, the Commissions in almost every case granted to Foreigners are comparatively disgraceful to the American Officers, & that there is no just ground for complaint by the former, that in order to avoid such mistakes for the future, as through a hurry of business, a business altogether new in this quarter of the World, have heretofore happened, it is necessary to wait until Congress shall be possessed of a Complete list of the Army & to grant no more Commissions except in very extraordinary Cases; Your case is not allowed to be one, unless it shall be said you have received extraordinary promotion in acknowledgement of extraordinary services & that an extraordinary degree of attention has been paid to you as a Foreign Ally, extraordinary in comparison with the ordinary course of proceeding towards many very meritorious Sons of America.  These I say are private sentiments drawn from friends among my Coadjutors in Congress, & a direct application to the House after I have been so well informed of the minds of Members would not only produce no good effect but in my opinion would be offensive. Nevertheless if you judge it proper to risque & will direct a Memorial immediately to Congress it will become my Duty to present it & you may rely upon the fidelity as you may upon the friendship of, Sir, your most obedt servt.  P.S. I have within a few days past seen repulses given to written requests made by General Gates for Commissions to officers of whose merits he spoke very warmly in two Instances, upon the principles above mentioned.(3)  You remark that you have made a journey of 6000 Miles-that length will reach much further than the remotest part of France, but my Dear Sir, reflect a Moment how many thousands are wishing to travel all that distance for moderate promotion & the assurance of an Asylum.

I am glad our Act of the 22d pleases you-it appears to me to be sufficiently energetic for the present purpose-the last paragraph one excepted will point out to the illustrious Commissioners from White Hall, from whence to take their departure & save much time which might otherwise have been spent in Ceremonious preliminary.(3) My sentiment is that this little Clause of 7 Lines nullifies many Pages of their Instructions, it certainly contains a complete answer to the Laborious performances of Lord North & the Labours of the blood thirsty Tryon.'The Tit for Tat, which your General lately gave to the Quondam Governor must exceedingly mortify a Man of his arrogance.  Some of our people here have been exceedingly desirous of throwing abroad in addition to the Resolutions an intimation of the willingness of Americans to treat with G Britain upon terms not inconsistent with the Independence of these States or with Treaties with foreign powers.(4) I am averse. We have made an excellent move on the Table-rest until we see or learn the motions on the other side- the whole World must know we are disposed to treat of Peace & to conclude one upon honorable terms. To Publish therefore is unnecessary-it would be a dangerous Act, encourage our Enemies & alarm our friends.  Your Ideas respecting New York square precisely with my own.(5) I wish the States & the People of the States could be roused to fill a reputable Army. You have thousands of Men scatter'd over the Country in the Character of Servants to Officers &c &c. Why are not they collected. There is amazing laxness of discipline somewhere or perhaps too generally in your Army. What does Hartley's Regiment in this Town? Congress ordered it to Camp a fortnight ago.(6) Their Idle Drums & Fifes twice a day by my window jarr upon my soul. Thus are we & thus we suffer our selves to be treated.  I have in hand the article you desire for Summer wear, sent for it from Boston, you shall have it by the present or the very next Messenger.  Try to say somewhat to the several heads of my Letters in order to rep[air] my Memory, for I have not time to Copy generally in the very wane of time I take up a piece of Paper to tell you in the best manner so short a moment how very truly & affectionately & respectly  I am your faithful friend, Henry Laurens APRIL 28, 1778  ""

  Dear Sir, 28th April 1778 Before this day you have received my last Letter under the 10th March by the hand of Captn. Senf.  Six days after that had been dispatched I had the pleasure of being confirmed in my opinion that my affairs under your direction were not neglected, because you had not written to me by every opportunity. Such assurance I received in your Several favors of the 6th December, 22d January & 16 Febry. which demand, & I beg you will be pleased to accept, my hearty thanks. I will not trouble you with even a Single direction respecting my Plantations. Order, direct & advise in every case relative to them as if they were your own, I shall be content with events & gratefully express my acknowledgements of your friendship.  I have long since adopted the advice of the Man recorded in history \""Wise\""-\""whatever the hand findest to do, do it with all thy might,\"" & I pursue this precept with most ardor, when applicable to the service of my Country or my friends. Hence you may account for the very little attention which I have given for some time past to my private concerns, these I submit to providence & to my friends under Providence, trusting that my labors for the public will not work detriment to my self.  You must not expect to see me very soon, although I had about two Months ago determined to return to my native Clime immediately after I should obtain permission.  When the House of Assembly were pleased to grant me leave to return, they were also pleased to re-elect me for this Station, this I received as an Intimation of their desire that I should remain, & as it reached me at a juncture when our public Cause had assumed a very gloomy aspect, I immediately declared to my Son & to my Colleague the Chief Justice, that I would not turn my Back upon the appearance of danger & difficulty. I am determined to continue in the service of my Country maugre all particular considerations, until we have a full Congress or some favorable changes in the affairs of our Union, or until my Colleagues are well initiated in the weighty businesses which they are sent to engage in. These are weighty indeed, & the due proper APRIL 28, 1778  discharge of them require always very great diligence, and more wisdom than I am possessed of. All the States have been exceedingly remiss in their respective Representations in Congress, a remissness which will cost them Millions of Dollars & which had one time exposed our Cause to the most imminent danger. Had General Howe been a Soldier of enterprize he might have made prisoners of the little Congress, dispersed our little Army, destroyed all our public Stores & returned with very triffling loss to Philadelphia or have taken post at Lancaster & kept a competent Garrison in the City.  We begin now to be in better order & if the Enemy is disposed to pursue the War we shall still be able to make at least a respectable defensive Campaign.  North River which has been too shamefully neglected & whose defenceless condition had endangered the loss of our communication with the Eastern States is now nearly secured by proper works within the Water & upon the Commanding Banks. General Gates will proceed to morrow to take the Command of that department, called the Northern. In his way he is to join a grand Council at General Washintons Head Quarters where a plan for the operations of the ensuing Campaign is to be formed.  General Lee who is now exchanged for General Prescot will be present.  A General Cartel for the Exchange of prisoners was lately on the tapis & Commissioners from each party had met for establishing Rules, but were seperated in the preliminary steps. General Howe refused to engage on behalf of the King His Master, our Commissioners would not accept of engagements which would not extend to bind his successors in Command. Upon this point, our Commissioners retired, & have gained great applause. There was great propriety in their support of the dignity of these free & Independent States. From certain mean & scandalous proceedings immediately under the Eye of General Howe & undoubtedly consistent with his knowledge such as forging & publishing Letters in the name of General Washington & Acts of Congress in my name it can hardly be questioned that he had sinister views in refusing to bind his successor & we now find he is recalled & is to be succeeded in command by Sir Henry Clinton or some other which he must have known at the time the Cartel was in agitation. Last year he gave us dead & sick Men in return for well fed hearty fellows, this year he had Studied some new artifice perhaps to give us no Men.  General Lee assures me the British Officers approbate our conduct in detaining the Troops comprehended in the Convention of Saratoga. This affords much satisfaction to a person who had so large a share in that business as I had. He adds there are numbers among   those officers who often express their wishes for our success & beleive that even the Commander in Chief thinks our Cause just.  This seems wondrous strange!  The papers which will accompany this will shew you Great Britain desire of Peace & the mean Stratagem which she is substituting for honest intentions in order to deceive us. Possibly the Act of Congress of the 22d April may teach her Ministry to know we are not quite blind, nor quite Idiots.  We have been long battleing in Congress on a half pay establishment to take place after the present War for our Officers which I hold to be inconsistent with our original Compact, unjust in a comparative view with the Militia & with the Soldiery in general unconstitutional & dangerous. Upon these Several branches I have endeavored to reason against the measure & may by & by shew you my sentiments. If the Question is carried it will be by a bare Majority of one State.  Mr. Tryon the late Governor of New York, has had the imodesty to insult General Washington & all our Generals commanding at Posts in the Northern & Eastern departments as well Governors of States with Copies of the Draughts of Bills offered by Lord North to parliament with an injunction to make them public among the Officers & Soldiers of the Army & the people in general. In return to such effrontry, General Washington has sent him the Act of Congress of the 22d April, shewing the Quondam Governor that 'tis the wish of Congress his Curious draughts should enjoy an unrestrained circulation. At the same time he also transmitted him an Act of Congress of the 23d April for granting pardons, a Copy of which you will find here inclosed, desiring the said Governor to exert his powers to communicate the contents to the persons Who are the objects of its operation, & concludes with a sneer upon Mr. Tryon-\""The benevolent purpose it is intended to answer will I persuade myself recommend it to your Candor.\""  Thus I think the Governor's account is Balanced by a retort which he would not have expected & which will therefore be the more mortifying to a Man of his arrogance.  It is said that Lord Amherst, Admiral Keppel & General Murray are named as Commissioners for treating with Congress & that they are daily expected. When they arrive at Philadelphia they will meet half their business done by the Act of the 22d. The paragraph, next to the last, will point out to them where to begin their negotiation & save much trouble of preliminary which otherwise they might have judged necessary.  My circumstances are such as afford me only scraps of time for writing private Letters & none to Copy & amend. You will therefore account for the imperfections of this & be so good as to accept it  rough as it is & believe me very sincerely, Dear Sir with affection & Esteem  ""

  Dear Sir, York-Town April 28th. 1778. Your favor of the 18th instant came safe to hand.(1) If the General Assembly continue to sit a few weeks and I can be informed of that intention, and that it would be agreeable to them, I shall do myself the honor to wait upon them upon notice, being anxious to render any and every service in my power to that virtuous Body. The affair of the hundred men I have not yet had opportunity to move,(2) but am told three hundred are ordered to be raised on the Eastern shore for the purpose you mention, which it is thought will be sufficient. I congratulate you on the success of Lieutt. Colo. Pope and should be glad to know whether any prisoners were taken and what has been done with them.(3) The Congress sometime ago passed an Act for the apprehending Charles Gordon & Thomas White Esquires & such others as were notoriously disaffected and active agt. their country in the Delaware State.(4) This took its rise from a motion of the Delegates of Maryland, founded on an Information given to, and an intercepted letter of Thomas White's laid before, the Governor and Council of Maryland, and some kind of claim they had to the persons named, they being lately subjects of that State, living upon their borders & carrying on an iniquitous conspiracy within that State. The intention  APRIL 28, 1778  was to have them imprisoned in Maryland, and to prevent any revenge on the part of these men or their adherents agt. the Executive Power of the Delaware State, and also to prevent their being rescued out of our Goals by the Enemy or the Tories, or their being liberated by habeas corpus, as the General Assembly had not suspended the habeas corpus Act. I have heard that they have since been taken, and discharged by ha. cor. and that Gordon has again joined the Enemy. Tho' it was perfectly right to enlarge them on this commitment, yet the charge made agt. them by Congress would have been sufficient ground for my brother Chief justice to have bound them to the Good Behaviour. I should have mentioned this affair to you or Mr. Read before but that it was ordered to be kept secret, lest the execution of it should be frustrated. I was called upon to name some of the most dangerous men in the State to be added to the others, but I refused, alledging the people there were now becoming good Whigs, and I hoped there would be no occasion.  Now for most important intelligence. You will receive ten papers herewith, published by Congress, which will give you part of it, and which I must beg you will distribute among the Members of the General Assembly. The Bills have been passed into laws, and Lord Amherst, Admiral Keppel and General Murray are the Commissioners. This whole affair will (I know) surprize you, but it has been owing to preliminaries for a treaty with Congress from France being intercepted, tho' the duplicates have not yet been received here. I have not a fear of an Acknowledgmt. of our Independance, and an honorable peace, if British Honors, Offices & Gold do not tempt and corrupt your Members of Congress & the Generals & principal officers in the Army. Do Sir, as I have not time to write to any body else, press the General Assembly to send two more Delegates here, and inform them that you know with certainty I am determined never to give up the Independance of the United States, after so much expence of blood & treasure, whilst I have a breath to draw; that I shall neither be allured nor intimidated into it; and that, if this resolution should not meet with their fullest approbation, they would be pleased to remove me immediately.  God grant us virtue & fortitude in this hour of trial. I have worked double tides (as the Sailors say) all the last week, being every day in Court, and also in Congress, which latter sat on the Fast I)ay and also yesterday. Our Officers will be allowed half pay for life, under sundry limitations & restrictions, the thing not finished but near it. The Bell tolls for Congress. Adieu.

You will deliver to the order of the Board of war the 26 Pieces of coarse sheeting  24 Bolts Oznabrigs 9 doz felt hats 17 Sadelles & their furniture  81 Pieces napped Cottons  200 ready made bags enumerated in that Inventory.

A severe engagement between her and the Randolph ensued and after it had continued 12 minutes the latter unfortunately blew up and in all probability every soul perished.(3) The British ship immediately on the explosion gave chase to the other Vessels, who were enabled to make their escape by Captain Biddles having shot away the ships bowsprit and Mizen top Mast. If this most unfortunate accident had not taken place in all probability the Randolph and the Armed Vessels had given A good Account of  APRIL 28, 1778  the 50 Gun ship.

  Dr. Sir. York April 29th 1778. You will receive from the President of Congress some Extracts from the Journals relative to me which will appear very odd to you if uninformed of several attending circumstances.(1) The history of the matter is as follows: A letter was received from General Washington relative to some resolutions of Congress which stood in the way of an Exchange of Prisoners;(2) the House in general determined not to recede from the resolutions he complained of, which I believe I mentioned to you in a former letter. A Committee was appointed to draught a letter in answer. The draught was reported, and it appeared to several of us exceptionable in many parts, particularly in some Eulogisms on the whole Tenor of the resolutions of Congress relative to the Exchange of prisoners which we thought neither consistent with Truth or Modesty, and also in several charges against the General of suffering the Dignity and Honor of the United States to be Injured, charges which were I am persuaded void of all foundation. The whole indeed appeared to several Gentlemen as well as to me to indicate in the framers a disposition not friendly to the General, nor such as so good, so Important, so public spirited and Disinterested a Character deserves.(3) One Paragraph had taken up the whole afternoon (4) in debate. The members of the Committee had let themselves very largely into many foreign matters, declaimed very vehemently but to no other purpose than confirming us in our former opinions, and fatiguing every faculty. At length the exceptionable parts of the Paragraph were expunged and it received a very different dress. The members of the Committee strenuously urged that we should proceed and finish the letter that night, tho' it was then after ten o'clock. The principal opposition they met with through the day was from General Reid, of Pennsylvania, Mr. Drayton, of South Carolina and myself. I labored under a very Distressing fit of an intermitting fever, which heightened by the part I was obliged to take in the Debate, and the noise of loud, incessant Declamation, occasioned so violent pain in my head that I was totally unable to attend any longer. Mr. Harnett has been several days confined and there were only Nine States repre- APRIL 29, 1778  sented. In vain was all this and much more which was equally forcible, urged against Sitting any longer. The Question for adjournment was put, and before it came to me I was very apprehensive it would pass in the Negative and I determined to withdraw if no other way was left, to prevent our proceeding so improperly on business of such Importance. Those who know the Opinions that had long prevailed relative to a party against a certain great officer,(5) will not deem this resolution an absurd one, tho' perhaps it was not the most prudent that could have been formed on the Occasion. The event took place nearly as stated in the Journal and I withdrew;(6) the Messenger attended me soon after with a message which from his manner of Delivering it and from my knowing there could be no Congress without me I did not conceive to have come from the President, but from Mr. Duer, of New York, with whom I was on Terms of particular intimacy, and who I imagined, presuming on that Intimacy, had sent for me in order to his facilitating his carrying through the Letter, which seemed to be a favourite object with him. I returned an answer which I intended for him and in which I was not choice of expressions. Next morning (7) the matter was opened by a member from Massachusetts,(8) in a very illiberal manner, but with general observations, and general Inferences of Danger and Inconvenience if such practice was to be permitted. I rose immediately, observed that the application was doubtless intended for the Event of the preceding Evening, (I did not at this time know that my answer had been reported) and therefore said nothing relative to it to the particular Event. I said little more than I was indisposed, and my faculties had been so much fatigued by the whole day's attention that I found myself unable to discharge my duty, and I conceived very few other members were. To the general Observations and Inferences I answered that an unreasonable exercise of any Power was Tyrrany, and that to keep a member at such unreasonable Hours and under such circumstances was in my opinion Tyrannical, and that I would not submit to it but by force on my person; that I considered every freeman as having a right to judge for himself when the Exercise of any Power was unreasonable, and if I erred in my judgment the power of punishing lay with the State I represented. If Congress should determine to what hour the members should attend in the afternoon as it had in the forenoon I would punctually attend, but while it was undetermined I must use my own judgment, at the risk of Incurring whatever Penalties my Country should adjudge. The members of the Committee who had framed the letter, now united, and labored strenuously to make a Mountain of this Mole-hill, talked vehemently of the insolence of appealing to the States, declared their disposition to proceed to Commitment or to Expulsion and lamented that the circumstances of Congress made my presence Necessary and   prevented them from moving to such purposes. They talked very much of the Contempt in calling any act of a Majority of Congress a Tyrany. I now perceived that I was on ground which it became my Duty to maintain with consequences to myself never so fatal. I addressed the President and declared I would sit patiently until every Gentleman in the House who chose to speak should exhaust the whole of his eloquence. I would only request them that if they chose to use any abusive language (for much had been used) they would reserve it for some other place, and when every one should have done I would reply. I accordingly sat very patient for Hours, and at length when every one who chose it had entirely done I delivered the following Sentiments: That my opinion of the power of Congress over its members had been often given in that Assembly and was well known to be that no member could refuse his attendance or even his Vote when called on, that the States furnish quotas of Council as well as Troops, that either would be furnished in vain if the Individuals assigned could refuse to perform the requisite Duty, that my name stood to this opinion on the Journals, but the Individual must of necessity Judge whether the particular Instance in which his performance is required be reasonable or not. IS he judges wrong or disobeys without just reason he incurs the penalties provided for misbehavior in office, but the power of judging and punishing Delegates was never Committed to Congress by any Express act of the State I represented, that the opinion that each freeman had a right to judge of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of any act of power, and even to resist it if unreasonable at the risk only of the Judgment of his Country, I held to be the grand Principle of Whiggism and the best Security for public Liberty, a principle which I would never forego but with my Life, that the other opinion relative to the jurisdiction of the State over its delegates seemed to me to Involve the Sovereignty of the State and its Security in a representation since it would be impossible for its representatives to assert and maintain its rights with firmness and freedom if subject to arbitrary Imprisonments, and punishments by Congress & that I would never retract it but by the Express order of the State, who alone had power to give it up. That I would not justify the particular breach of order under Consideration, but hoped it might be excused because it was not unusual nor under its particular circumstances even improper.(9) That as I discovered great favour in all the members except a few towards me on this occasion I was exceedingly sorry my Conduct or Language had given offense; that nothing was further from my intentions, that the words I used were the only names I knew for the things I wanted to express, that I held it an unworthy Business for a republican and a representative of a free and sovereign People to be looking out for courtly Expressions. That had the matter been opened with any  regard to Liberality, a few words which I would have said would have Satisfied the House, and put an end to it, but as the matter was managed it became Inconsistent with my Duty and my honor to make any Concession without expressly insisting on my opinions. That with this reservation I would make any apology the House should require, but without it I could make none which would not involve a breach of Trust to my Country, and no punishment could be devised which I would not meet sooner than be guilty of such an offence. The members of the Committee still persisted; nothing would do but an Explicit acknowledgement of what they pleased to call my Error. I rejoined only that I knew no power who could make a man change his opinion before he was Convinced of his Error, that I was not and therefore would not acknowledge it. They proceeded now to enter on the Journals such a state of facts as they pleased. I desired only that they would enter a fair and full statement, that such as they offered were far from being so. After some time it was said by the Gentlemen that I should have an opportunity of answering and could set forth any that were omitted. In my answer I acquiesced, and so did the House. They then proceeded to take down some of my Expressions in debate. I required them to take down all that would speak my full Sense, and not detached Expressions; that I would give it to them as fully as they could wish, being firmly resolved not to retract one Iota of it. But I was answered, as before, that I could supply the deficiencies in my answer, and I acquiesced. The Entries were made and the president announced them in form. I thanked him for his politeness of manner, told him I hoped I could satisfy the House that no disrespect was Intended to them, but that I avowed my opinions as I delivered them in debate; that I persisted in them, and insisted on entire freedom of Debate. I was required to return an answer to the next adjournment, which was to be in the afternoon, and I desired no longer time; but afterwards the House changed it to Monday, which was the next day of Business.(10) Reprinted from N.C.

  [April 29, 1778] (1) I beg leave to submit to the assembly the following State of Facts and the proofs relating to them, also of my motives and Sentiments which gave occasion to the transmissions from Congress.(2)  General Washington had written complaining of some Embarassments in forming a Cartel occasioned by several resolutions of Congress which he deemed inconsistent and requesting something to be done to remove them.(3)  A Committee was appointed to draught an answer. A draught was reported and it was the subject of Debate on the 10th of April. It was in many parts in my opinion exceptionable and I together with some other members opposed those parts. The members of the Committee were very strenuous in their Endeavours to carry it through. The Exceptionable Parts seemed calculated to wound the General's Sensibility, and I could perceive no Necessity for it. After the Day until ten O'clock at Night had been Spent in debate on One paragraph which was at length amended, an adjournment was moved for, and the Committee Strenuously pressed to go through the remainder of the Letter that night tho at so late an Hour. I who had Sustained a principle part in the Debate was totally unable to continue any longer by reason of the violence of a fit of an Intermitting fever under which I labored.(4)  I admit that I withdrew &ca.  My reasons were the following  The subject under Debate was a Draught of a Letter to General Washington reported by a Committee in answer to one relative to the Exchange of Prisoners in which he complained of being wounded in his feelings and embarrassed by Some resolutions of Congress which appeared to him inconsistent.  The Draught seemed exceptionable in many parts which tended to give pain to the General without answering any good purpose, and they were opposed by some other members and myself. The whole day until 10 at night was taken up with debate on One paragraph which was at length amended. At that late hour the members of the Committee pressed very Strongly to proceed and finish the letter before adjournment.(5) They Seemed very strenuous for carrying through the draught as reported. I was of Opinion that it ought to undergo many amendments which from that day's debate I perceived could not be Effected without (6) very Strenuous Opposition. I deemed it therefore very improper to proceed when our faculties were exhausted. Besides this General reason I had one peculiar to myself. I had been obliged to take a principle part in the Debate altho during the whole afternoon I labored under a severe fit of an Intermitting  APRIL 29, 1778  fever, and at the time when the Question for adjournment was debated was so oppressed with the head ach attending it as to be (7) unable to give due attention to any Subject. (I found that my Endeavours were necessary for procuring the Amendments to the report and could not reconcile it to my Duty, or to my Sense of Justice, honor, or Utility to let it pass without using every Endeavour in my power to have it amended in the exceptionable parts.)  I have penetrated the personal character of General Washington. In my Judgement he is a good officer and most excellent Citizen, moved only by the most amiable and disinterested Patriotism, he perseveres in encountering extreme difficulties, dangers and fatigues under which he seems Sensible of no uneasiness but from the misfortunes of his Country, and of no pleasure but from her success. His few Defects are only the Excess of his amiable Qualities, and tho I am not of opinion that any Individual is absolutely Essential to the success of our Cause, yet I am persuaded his loss would be very severely felt, and would not be easily supplied. With this Idea of him, I could not but deem it very impolitic to hazard giving him disgust when no good cause required it. Nor could I avoid deeming it unjust, and ungenerous to give unnecessary offence and Insult to so worthy a man who had so well deserved of his Country. Had a Majority of Congress been for it, I would nevertheless have used my most strenuous endeavours against it, for neither as the Citizen or Magistrate will I ever forgoe the Sentiments of the Independent republican, but as I had great reason to believe that very few in Congress would agree to such a Measure if rightly understood and even the few would err rather through excess of misplaced Zeal than ill disposition, there were still Stronger reasons for my wishing to prevent its passing when it could not receive due examination, and when I was totally incapable of performing my Duty. The Debate of the preceding day had Convinced me that even my Endeavours were not altogether unnecessary-the Sequel of the Business sufficiently Evinced that I Judged not amiss. The report underwent long and strenuous debates and was finally amended nearly agreeable to my Idea. Tis true that departing without leave is in strictness a breach of order, but it had been usually done without reprehension, and I only used the same liberty which every other member had frequently done and in some recent Instances by two members of the Committee on Occasions far from being so proper or excusable as that under Consideration.(8) The answer which the Congress were pleased to call Indecent I hope will appear to the assembly in a very different light when they hear the Testimony which was given on the Occasion, an Authenticated Copy is annexed, to which I pray the assembly to refer.(9) I hope it will from thence appear that the Congress were not then in a Capacity as a Body to send any Message or receive an Answer, and  that the message appeared not to have Come from the President, but from a private member,(10) and that the answer was intended for that private member alone.  To avoid taking up the time of the assembly I shall only refer to the answer which I delivered to Congress for an Explanation of the Minutes of the eleventh and tho' I might very well insist upon the dangerous Infraction of the freedom of Debate which must result from Censuring A member of that assembly upon Expressions picked from what falls from him in Argument and so Arranged as not to Convey the whole of his meaning, yet knowing that this will not escape the present Assembly who are watchfully attentive to all the Rights of freedom, I shall for my own part waive it and plainly declare that the Sentiments expressed and avowed in the answer were by me delivered in Debate and in Language Such as I usually Speak which tho' perhaps not refined enough for the Courts of Princes, might escape Censure in a republican assembly. Those Sentiments are mine, and I did refuse to retract them, they are Convictions fixed in my Mind and the result of much thinking, and long Investigation of the Rights of free men. I have not changed my Opinions nor can I without Conviction of their being erroneous, to say I had would be false, and a Meanness which no power could force me to.  The Opinion respecting the exclusive power of the States to Judge and punish their Delegates appears to me Necessary for their future Independance and Essential to their Sovereignty, and I think that when this state invested me with the power of representing them in the united Council of the free, Independent, Sovereign States of America the Supporting and defending that freedom, Independance and Sovereignty which was always my Duty as a Citizen, becomes so in a much greater Degree as a Delegate and to have yielded any thing Injurious to them was in my Idea a heinous Treason.  The Congress refused to receive this answer in writing and altered the Journal which Contained the first order at the making of which every One expected my answer was to be returned in writing and I yielded to the partial insertion of my words and the mistate of the facts under an express declaration they should be able to correct them by my answer, but the members afterwards thougllt it unparliamentary, tho' in truth there is no Similitude in this respect between the Congress and Parliament, Members of Parliament being Subject to no Jurisdiction out of Parliament. The Thing Insisted upon by Several Members in Congress was Concession, they Endeavoured to Extort it by Illiberal Declamation, and by threats of the most Summary Violence, Such as even Imprisonment of my person, and expulsion Others endeavoured to obtain it by argument, and friendly Liberal persuasion. To the first I confess I could not yield even the Semblance of an appology, and doubt not my words conveyed some   part of the resentment which I could not help feeling for such Treatment. To the Second, I declared my sincere Concern if any thing in my Language or manner appeared not sufficiently respectful to Congress, that my Terms were the only names I knew for the things I wanted to express, that tho' my manner was perhaps expressive of resentment and Indignation it was plainly directed against Individuals who had given great provocation, but that no man was more deeply impressed with a Sense of respect for Congress and I was far from intending to give Offence. But the Sentiments I delivered being still unchanged and being in my opinion Essential to the rights of the States, and of the Citizens Individually, any Concession relative to them would be a Sacrifice of those rights, and a cleanness which I hoped the Congress would not expect, and which it was impossible to bring me to.  It is sufficient to hear them in their places because the charge and defence is before the ultimate Judge, but Members of Congress are or at least in my Opinion, ought to be amenable to their Constituents and the Charge and defence ought to come before them with equal authority. The Copy before the assembly is one that was laid on the table while I [awaited?] the answer, and was taken up and perused by Mr Harnet while I was reading. He kept it afterwards in possession. At any time upon Such an Occasion I should have deemed it my Duty to have behaved as I did in the present Instance, but I was particularly Sollicitous to pursue this matter to its utmost length for the following reason.  Since the first of my attendance in Congress I perceived some Individuals to have an Extraordinary propensity to acts of power, and to have often urged Congress to exercise them where there was no apparent Necessity, in such a manner as must be Contrary to the Established Laws and Constitutions of the States. In very many Cases the prudence and Circumspection of Congress rendered such attempts abortive, in some a majority have been induced to Concur, and Individuals have been Seized, banished or Imprisoned by Resolutions of Congress against whom Rumors were the only Testimony, and who if insnared by this powerful and uncontrollable Body must be [....] Frequent attempts have been made to prevail on Congress to take into their own Hands the Political Administration of one State,(11) and on pretence that their Institutions were defective, Power was given to a Military Officer in an other to Seize, Imprison and remove whomsoever he might Suspect,(12) under a Suspicion that their magistrates were not well affected, and over the Same State and part of two others a Power was given to a Committee of Congress to exercise the most unlimitted dictatorial Powers,(13) on a groundless Supposition of an Insurrection.(14) In short some Individauls from too much Zeal not tempered Sufficiently with wisdom and foresight, from apprehensions  too lively and Judgements a little defective, from a busy Enterprising Disposition not quite enough Controll'd by caution and Circumspection or from some other defect of Capacity very frequently gave too much importance to trifling objects (15) and generally Suggested and urged the Exercise of acts of mere arbitrary power as remedies on every Occasion. Of late this Disposition was become more extensive, and appeared more frequently, and whoever spoke of the Internal Police or rights of the States as restraining the power of Congress was generally exposed to Sarcasm or ridicule. State Necessity was urged on all Such Occasions as Sufficient to Justify every act of power. I who am firmly persuaded that arbitrary Power has a Natural tendency to abuse, and am therefore Jealous of it in any Hands, who have marked the force and progress of precedents and have observed that those which have happened under the direction of Virtuous men have given Authority to Corrupt men to Violate the rights of mankind have always Considered this propensity as dangerous so far as it tended to Establish Precedents of such acts of Power exercised by Congress as are repugnant to or Inconsistent with the purposes of its Institution and the rights of the States.  When on the present Occasion I perceived Several of the Same Individuals assuming a power to Judge and punish at discretion the representatives of the Sovereign Independent States it appeared to me very dangerous even to permit the mention of such power undisputed. If not disputed it might pass into a general Opinion that Such power existed in Congress, if carried into Effect and submitted to it would be established by precedent. I therefore determined Instantly to dispute the power and to persist so as to bring the matter to a clear decision. I insisted on the right of the States to Judge and punish their own delegates, and that Congress could do nothing but represent their Conduct. I was certain whichever way Congress decided it would be important. If they Exercised the power the States would perceive that it deprived them of all security in their members by their being Subjected to the arbitrary power of an assembly which is without Controll, and can be punished for no wrong, and in which they must often assert the rights of the State at every hazard, and of Course would remonstrate against it. If on the other hand, Congress should only make a representation to the State a precedent would be Established in favor of the Exclusive Jurisdiction of the State over its representatives. The Confederation being then under Consideration I hoped this matter might be Considered by the assembly before they finally Concluded their deliberations thereon, and I hoped it would clearly point out to them the propriety of Instructing particularly on that clause which declares that \""freedom of speech and debate shall not be impeached or Questioned in any Court or place out of Congress.\""   A clause which in my humble Opinion is not only Contrary to our Constitution, but takes away the Controll of the States in a very great measure over its Delegates.(16) The Congress is the only power which can usurp or encroach on the rights of the States. The freedom of Speech is Necessary for Opposing the Congress in such attempts. To them only or to Combinations of them can that freedom give Offence, and it will always give Offence when it opposes favorite pursuits. They only can be interested to restrain the freedom of Speech, they therefore ought never to have the power of punishing it or calling it in question. On the other hand the States can have no interest to restrain the freedom of speech of their Delegates. That freedom must be always used for their advantage or in support of their rights, and should a Delegate vote or speak in a manner inconsistent with his Instructions or his Duty, he ought to be Subject to the punishments provided by the Laws of the Country, and with us being subject to legal Impeachment and Trial give him the same Security with every other Citizen. This clause precludes every State from even making Laws for the punishment of offending Delegates for to what End should laws be made to punish men who cannot be impeached or called in question in any Court or place out of Congress. To Congress only must we Complain of our Delegates, for sacrificing to them our rights, Congress is to Judge the offence and inflict the punishment, and it can hardly be expected that it will be deemed an Offence to be Complaisant to the prevailing Combination.  The assembly having concluded on this matter has prevented much of the good I intended but I hope however my wishes will not be entirely disappointed.  One other matter had Considerable weight in determining me to persist in this affair.  While every Citizen of this State is happily Secured by the Constitution and Laws against every arbitrary Exercise of power, is Secure of an Impartial trial by his Country on every accusation, the Case of a Delegate would be extremely hard was he to be Subjected to the arbitrary will of a Combination in an assembly which may be enraged against him for an Opposition which his Conscience may tell him it is his Duty to make. Nothing is more easy than for Such a Combination Secure of a Majority and therefore Secure of Impunity to give repeated provocations until the object of their vengeance is Constrained to use some Expressions which taken by themselves and unconnected with the rest of his discourse may be made the foundation of a persecution against him, and then he is to be tried, Condemned and punished by an Assembly who have no Law to Judge by but mere arbitrary will and who are at once Judge, party, witness and Executioner-who are without Controll and may do any wrong with impunity. I confess as this is a situation I should be very un-  willing to be in myself, I should deny that any freeman ought to be in, and had I had no other motive than merely this I should not have submitted to the power claimed by some Gentlemen in Congress. I hope I never shall betray the smallest right of any of my fellow Citizens to avoid any thing which power can impose on me. Lest any thing which I have here said should seem to derogate from the Virtue of the present Congress I beg leave to declare that nothing can be further from my Intention, nor do I believe any Set of men Existed who had Views more disinterestedly directed to public good, even the Individuals I mention as too much disposed to acts of power, are men of the greatest public Spirit and Integrity, and eminent for abilities. If in the particulars I mentioned they erred as in my opinion they did, I am certain they were moved by nothing but a zeal for the public Service which perhaps hurried them too fast to attend to distant Consequences, or prevented their perceiving objects in the proper point of Light.  I do not pretend that I myself have never been in this predicament. I confess I am warm in my Temper, (and apt to decide in favor of bold and vigorous Measures) and feel a Zeal too which I doubt not often transports me too far. Conscious of this, (and being very attentive to motives, and from that attention Convinced of their rectitude,) I heard every gentlemans Sentiments I believe, with Candor, and tho differing from my own doubted not their being Suggested by the same Desire of doing public Service-but I conceived it my Duty to use my own Judgement on all Occasions and I always used it because such as it was my Country Confided in it, and when it differed from other men, Integrity required that I should follow it. Thence Debate necessarily ensued but Enmity I hope never. Nothing therefore should be Imputed to Such Motives. I do not pretend that I never Consented to, nor recommended the exercise of acts of power, every man knows that such will be always unavoidable in times of public Struggles. But my professed Maxims are that Such should never be exercised but so far as plain and Evident Necessity requires and on very important Occasions that whoever exercises an act of power Should not be the ultimate Judge of the Necessity but should rely on it as an excuse but not a Justification. That it should always be Exercised in such a manner as not for a precedent for future Occasions-because such should depend entirely on its own circumstances.  Whenever I have recommended or agreed to acts of power I hope I have kept in view these maxims. I always opposed them on every other ground. I have thought some not quite so attentive to them, I suppose because they were not equally persuaded of their Truth.  In the matter before the assembly some things appear to me not altogether reconcileable to the Idea I have given of Congress. They have Insisted on a man's retracting his Opinions, and Censured him   for not Complying, they have given partial abstracts from his words, they refused to insert his answer along with the charge against him, and they have asserted a thing directly Contrary to that answer and to the Testimony taken before themselves.  These and many other Inconsistencies arise from a vain endeavour to adapt to Congress the rules of the British parliament. Many Individuals who form the Congress have been accustomed to observe Such rules in the provincial assemblies during the late monarchical Government, and have not yet clearly perceived the difference between an Elective assembly which knows no monarchical power to restrain, Corrupt or disturb it, and One which has Occasion for great and extraordinary powers to protect itself from the fraud or Violence of an hereditary controlling Magistrate, in a word between a power which if it assumes to act arbitrarily cannot be checked and between a Power which may be dissolved and divested of all authority and Capacity, Injured by a superintending Magistrate.  Concession was required from me because Concessions were usually required in parliament.  My answer was refused in writing because such was not usual in parliament, (Tho there be this plain difference, A member of parliament Answers no where out of parliament, and the same persons hear and Judge the Offence & Deffence.)  To enlarge on this matter would take up too much time: it [is] an evil which I hope experience will cure and in the mean time can do no great mischief if the States are firm in supporting their own rights and protecting their Citizens.  I hope I have not transgressed in being so full on this Subject, less would not have sufficiently laid the matter before the Assembly in that light which in my opinion it's importance deserves.  ""

  Dear Papa, 29th April 1778 I was glad to hear by Mr Digges that you were all well, and that Molly was recovering fast.  I wrote to you by last Post, & inclosed you a copy of Governor Johnstone's letter to Mr. Robert Morris. By that you will see, some treaty is in agitation between our Agents & France, & that the fears of an alliance between these States & France were the principal occasion of inducing the British ministry to propose terms, & of Ld. North's contradictory, false, & humiliating Speech. I wish we could hear from France, we are in daily expectation of hearing from thence: our dispatches, when we receive them, will probably let us more fully into the reasons of this sudden change of British politicks.  Have you got as yet returns of our different assessments? It is necessary to have them, in order to ascertain what we shall have to pay on this year's assessment. The 25/ in the hundred is a heavy tax: however I think the measure right. If the rest of the States tax in proportion, they will soon retrieve the credit of the money, & convince the English nation that we are in earnest & determined to maintain our Independance. We heared the day before yesterday from Camp; nothing new. It is said our army is increasing. A respectable army, & good management will secure our Independance without running any great hazard. My opinion always was, & now more than ever, to avoid a general action. Delay must ruin the Enemy. I wish you a long continuance of health & am yr. affectionate Son,  Ch.

With regard to the Regulating Act the State of Pensylvania have Suspended it & the other States to the Southward, of this have done nothing on the Subject, not so much as appointed Committees to meet & take the matter under Consideration as we can learn. A Committee of Congress, appointed to take into Consideration, the doings of the Committee at New Haven, have made their Report that the proceedings of the Committee at N.

It appears to us from the best Sentiments we are able to Collect, that the Southern States never will adopt the regulating Act.  The marine board Seem'd Sensible of Capt.

  Dear Sir Apr 29th. 1778. York Town  I promise myself much from the eight or nine scrawls which I have sent to you since your departure from America,(1) in the spirit, I own to you, with [which] Indians make their presents of feathers or bark.  I must depend upon your imagination to comprehend what I will not undertake to describe-our chagrin and perplexity at our total ignorance of the situation & transactions of the Commissioners at Paris and other parts of Europe. I ask you a plain question, or two. How often have the Gentlemen at Paris wrote to Congress since June last? Have copies and triplicates of their Dispatches been sent? Do you know who robbed Folgier? (2) Is there more reason to think it was done by the English court than the French, if it was done at all by court influence? Do not our mercantile concerns and the interest of individuals therein furnish the best clue of the robbery?  I must refer you to the printed papers for the conduct of our enemies. Tryons certified Bills did not come out 'till after our committee had reported. He sent packets to Genl. W ,(3) Gates & others requesting that they would not prevent the dispersion of the Bills among the Officers & people at large, I have not Tryon's letter by me just now but it will be printed shortly with Genl. W s answer as follows.  Sir Head Quarters Valley forge, Apr. 26. 1778  Your letter of the 17th and a triplicate of the same were duly received. I had had the pleasure of seeing the draughts of the two Bills, before those which were sent by you came to hand and I can  APRIL 29, 1778  assure you they were suffered to have a free currency among the Officers & men under my command, in whose fidelity to the United States I have the most perfect confidence; and the inclosed Gazette, published the 24th at York Town, will show you that it is the wish of Congress they should have an unrestrained circulation.  I take the liberty to transmit you a few printed copies of a resolution of Congress of the 23d instant, and to request you will be instrumental in communicating its contents; so far as it may be in your power, to the persons who are the objects of its operation. The benevolent purpose it is intended to answer will, I persuade myself sufficiently recommend it to your candor. I am, Sir, Your most Obedt. Servt. Go Washington  Majr. Genl. Tryon at New York The enemy just at the time when they are affecting to treat with us are sending forth in the Gazettes of Philada. & New York a forged Resolve of Congress, purporting our grant of a power to Genl. Who regard all militia men, enlisted or draughted for 9 months or a year, as soldiers during the war and to treat them as deserters if they shall attempt to leave the camp on the expiration of their present Agreement.  We have this day offered 800 acres of Land with certain Stock named to any capt. in the British Service, not a Subject of the King of Gr. Br., who shall bring off with him self 40 Men, and proportional rewards to Officers of inferior rank & to the Soldiers.(4)  This is taking up the enemy's practice. I do not like it because the offers are much too great. The same Generals who have managed the war are not to negotiate reconcilliation. Ld. Amherst is said to have arrived at New York and to have freed all our many prisoners there, upon parole. This is not certain; but He, Admiral Kepple & Genl. Murray are said to be nominated Commissioners. Is it not droll that I should send such news to France; but not expecting to hear from the Gentlemen there this season, I propose to let them know that we do get a little European intelligence other ways. Mr. D____at the Hague writes very punctually tho we treat him as we are treated by others.(5) I hope that we shall some time or other be told what is the proper recompence for that Gentleman's Services. I wrote to him last year that it was needless, for him, to be at the trouble of any thing more than to correspond with the Commissioners.(6) He is punctual however; and his letters down to Y. have reached us and tho little interesting have cost us great Sums indeed; one above from Boston £50 sterling nearly.

I do think of Vermont and unless I mistake Matters shall be managed to Effect without bellowing in the Forum which I beleive hath been a little too much the Case.(6) But why should I blame impetuous Vivacity. Hath it never led me into an Error?  Putnam will soon be tried.(7) The Affair of Schuyler & St Clair laboured under aukward Circumstances. Their Friends & their Enemies appear to me to have been equally blind. I enclose Extracts from the Minutes made the other Night to possess myself of the real State of Facts. There are some other Entries from Time to Time. It  APRIL 29, 1778  was erroneous to order a Committee simply to collect Facts; they should have been directed to state Charges. This Morning my Colleague being absent I got a Committee appointed for the latter Purpose. Sherman, Dana (Massachusetts) & Drayton (South Carolina).(8) This was unanimous and yet I would have undertaken to argue for it in a Stile which would absolutely have ruined the Measure. You know it would have been easy to say Justice to these injured Gentlemen instead of Justice to an injured Country requires &ca.  Great Britain seriously means to treat. Our Affairs are most critical tho not dangerously so. If the Minister from France were present as well as him from England I am a blind Politician if the thirteen States (with their extended Territory) would not be in peaceable Possession of their Independency three Months from this Day.

  Gentlemen No. 6 (Copy) York Town Apr. 30th. 1778 By the Gazettes which accompany this letter you will see that the Enemy are entering upon a plan which must shortly perplex us much, unless we receive dispatches from you to enlighten us as to your Situation & Transactions of which we have had no information since the latter end of May. As we have heard of the loss of Capt. Johnston and Capt. Wickes and know that John Folgier was robbed, we cannot charge our present want of letters to negligence in you; but we think you should not rest satisfied without sending triplicates of your dispatches .  APRIL 30, 1778  The commercial Committee will transmit to you the contract which they have enterd into with the agent of the House of Roderigue Hortales & Co. The heads of wch. contract happening to be at hand are inclosed.(1)  We have read a letter written by a friend (Govr. Johnston) dated House of Commons Feb. 13th. in which we are told that \""you had concluded a Treaty wth. France and Spain which was on the Water towards us.\"" (2) Imagine how solicitous we are to know the truth of this before we receive any proposals from Britain in consequence of the scheme in Ld. Norths speech and the two Draughts of Bills now sent to you.  The state of our foreign connections is a subject now before Congress; and, dubious as we are about your transactions, some resolutions will probably be formed to be transmitted to you by a special conveyance shortly,(3) when a general account of our Affairs will also be sent. We have little uneasiness about the Strength of our enemy. Our currency must be supported in due credit; after which we may bid defiance to Britain and all her German hirelings. We wish every advice and Assistance from You for the support of such Credit.  I am with great Regard, Gentlemen, your humble Servant,  James Lovell ""

  My dear Sir [April 30-May 2? 1778] (1)  In aid to your scrutiny after the real robber of the Commissioners Dispatches,(2) I send what I think a good Confirmation of Folgiers honesty. By comparing the Governors letter (3) with Folgiers Examination (4) you will find the Govr. led into a mistake about the number of Seals broken, by Folgiers forgetting that the outside Cover of the whole had any thing more than ''Dispatches'' wrote on it. He told us differently 2 days after we had sent an Express to Nth. Carolina. I am glad he did forget it at first as it strengthens eventually the nature of the Evidence.  You must not wonder that I make so much of this matter. It is of the highest Importance to you to be guarded against Bosom-Traitors yourself and to tear them from your Colleagues.

In addition to these representations, the said Commissioners shall demand a categorical answer of France and Spain to this point.

  Sir (1) 1st May 1778. No less than seventeen days have elapsed since I had the honor of receiving Your Excellency's Letter of the 16th March importing an extract from the journals of Assembly of the 5th, yet within this time I have not found a proper space of one moment for addressing Congress on the subject of Indian Trade.(2)  Congress have been closely engaged on one branch of a proposed arrangement of the Army, which has been long pending. The first article on the tapis, an half pay establishment for Officers who shall continue in the Army to the end of the War having met such opposition, has engrossed, with very little exception, our time for a Month past. This subject is at present suspended, for reasons which if I judge truly, are not assigned. The supporters of the measure perceive danger of losing the question should it be put at this time when there are only ten States on the floor & therefore wait to avail themselves of the voices of two in three which are daily expected (3)-but this grand business is succeeded by another said to be equally momentous & to which every other consideration must give place, the state of our affairs at foreign Courts. The reading Letters as a prelim[in]ary step employed completely the six hour session of yesterday. I have however introduced my Colleague Mr. Chf. Justice Drayton into the Committee of Indian affairs (4) & will enjoin him to collect the Committee & press for a consideration of the Resolve of Assembly alluded to above, thence a Report will follow & be properly inducted to Congress-& I have no doubt in my own mind of obtaining all that our State expects relative to the expence of supporting an Indian Trade, unless our late acquisition of Land from the Cherokee people should be faintly urged in bar. I know some Gentlemen veiw that circumstance with a jealous eye, be this as it may, I think a demand so well grounded & which may be well supported by applicable precedents with which our Journals abound can suffer but slightly from opposition.(5)  Two days ago Congress completed a Declaratory Invitation to foreign Officers & Soldiers in the service of the King of Great Britain to quit such service & settle in these States a Copy of which I will endeavor to lay before Your Excellency,(6) I like the scheme in general, my objection was to the last Clause.(7) Maryland, Rhode Island & New Jersey peremptorily refuse to bear any part of expence which may arise from the purchase or laying out the intended Grants of Land. New York & Virginia meaning the Delegates from these States, promised on behalf of their constituents to supply large quantities, & it was intimated that the Carolinas & Georgia might well make up the deficiency. Whatever were my sentiments respecting the policy of  MAY 1, 1778  the measure, I felt a repugnance to binding my Country by any engagements exceeding the powers vested in me & which she might for this & other obvious reasons refuse to confirm, hence I shall be found upon Record, No.  All the States had for many Months been exceedingly remiss in Representation in Congress. Fear I believe had operated upon many minds, partly of the excessive expence attending very bad fare in this Town & partly of a sudden surprize by the Enemy. Certainly had Sir William Howe been a Man of enterprize he might have possessed himself of Congress. This delinquency has cost the Union Millions of Dollars. The days lengthen, the weather mends, the Army is receiving reinforcements & Delegates drop in. We have lately been joined by some very able Men & shew upon the floor about 25-New Hampshire, Delaware & No. Carolina empty-New Jersey & Rhode Island one Delegate-the important Crisis to which we are now verging may possibly rouse the deficient States.(8) North River which had been left in a defenseless State from the time Sir H. Clinton had rendred it so will in the course of half this Month with permission of the Enemy be secured-but I tremble every arrival of a Messenger from that quarter with apprehensions of hearing of the destruction of our embryo works, of our Stores & Magazines at Albany & that our communication with the Eastern States [is] cut off-all this danger & an hundred other Evils are chargeable to deficiency of Representation. General Gates will proceed to Morrow to Valley forge Camp, there join a grand Council for planning the operations of the rising Campaign, thence proceed to Fish Kill & Albany & take upon him the Command of the whole Northern or middle department-with power to call for the Militia from New York & the Eastern States-if our affairs remain uninterupted when he arrives, all will be well.  The printed papers which I shall send within the present Inclosure will shew your Excellency a late fruitless attempt for settling a Cartel & the sentiments of Congress on Lord North's speech of the l9th Febry & his Draughts of Conciliatory Bills-an Insolent Letter from the Quondam Governor Tryon to General Washington & the General's modest reply will accompany them. Notwithstanding the seperation of the Commissioners who had assembled at New Town an Exchange of prisoners is in motion conducted by the Commissaries on each side. General Lee has been exchanged for General Prescot, & there are many other instances but the work is slow & not satisfactory. Besides from a fatal negligence in our public Officers we have lost an amazing number of prisoners. I have the best authority for saying near two Thousand have escaped or been winked at, a circumstance tending to prove our Riches in that branch, when it is considered that we have still a very large balance of Rank & file.  In addition to the Act of Congress of the 22d April Congress had been moved to confirm a Resolve, Copy of which will also be Inclosed. Upon its first appearance it was a favorite & I felt some anxiety lest it should succeed but after Iying a few days & a full discussion this Morning it was postponed generally.(9) General Washington intimates that he is well informed General Amherst, Admiral Kepple & General Murray are named for Commissioners to treat with America on terms of peace.(10) These or some other great personage, perhaps Lord Howe who it was supposed had been lost between Rhode Island & the Capes of Delaware probably arrived at Philadelphia the 28th April when there was heard at Camp much firing of Cannon in the City. A person of Credit from thence assures us, that Transports were halling to the Wharfs in order to receive Troops & Baggage, the conjecture is, that the foreign Troops are recalled. 'Tis as likely that an embarkation of wounded & other Invalids is intended, the season of the year & the numerous sick among the British Troops favors this opinion.  Major General Conway lately for the second time taunted Congress by an application for leave to resign his Commission, & in notes so extremely rough as secured a Majority of 8 States of 9 in his favor. I say taunted, because I have since received a Letter from his Aid de Camp who knew the contents of the General's & probably the intents of it also, assuring me it was not the General's meaning to resign & praying my Interest to obtain a Repeal of the Resolution. He certainly was not in earnest in his first attempt, but I beleive the door is now shut. His conduct respecting General Washington is criminal & unpardonable, severely censured by all the foreign Officers.(11)  I must now acknowledge & thank your Excellency for your favor of the 30th March (12) & for the Copy of the Constitution of South Carolina, the Title page is all that public business has suffered me to be acquainted with.  The loss of the Randolph & of the many precious lives in the same stroke is affecting. This account came in contact with intelligence of the Capture & loss of the Frigates Virginia, Columbus & Alfred, ancient & venerable characters, but we have Wood enough to Christen with the same Names; our Enemy has suffered great losses & have not Wood & other materials in such abundance, therefore we have least cause for despondency. A New York paper which will go inclosed to Mr. Gervais will shew the Enemy's account of the III fated Randolph. Had we had Men on this spot competent to the arrangement of our Treasury & finances, Men of knowledge, virtue & spirit, adequate to the Labour of stemming the torrent of peculation which has overwhelmed us with debt & brown paper Dollars, we should have less cause to regret the loss of four Frigates. These are gone; I trust, & I devoutly pray, the Eyes of these slumbering states may be opened, &   wise measures adopted for averting the loss of their Independences. We shall probably soon be called upon to meet by a proper Deputation the Commissioners expected from White Hall. For this momentous interview, my private sentiment is, that the Wisdom of the Union should be selected, that we should go beyond the bounds of Congress & of any particular State in our choice of Character. It is probably too late to ask advice or Instruction, & if I do not misunderstand we shall find our Men in York Town. Your Excellency shall receive early intelligence of determinations on this Subject.  The Tax of £5 on Lands &ca is high, but I feel no disposition to repine, excepting only when I reflect upon the gross frauds upon Public Money which overflow this Land & consider the burthens prepared for us, through such Wickedness.  I shall do everything in my power to obtain Captn. Pickerings enlargement but this will be a work of difficulty while he is kept afloat, an object of peculiar resentment, rendered so by his own vanity.(13)  Although I have so long trespassed upon your time, permit me Sir, before I conclude to congratulate with your Excellency on your appointment to the presidency of South Carolina & to express my wishes that your Excellency may enjoy as much satisfaction & pleasure in the discharge of that important trust as I am persuaded your Excellency's Administration will afford to the people.

That the Resources of the States being greatly exhausted by their Exertions as well as by the many Disorders attendant upon Great Revolutions which are scarce conceivable by those who administer established Governments the Difficulty of prosecuting the War increases in Proportion to its Continuance.  That the Derangement of our Finances & the consequent Depreciation of our Currency render a Peace with G Britain not only eligible but necessary. MAY 1, 1778  And That the manifest Advantages which will arise from an Alliance with the Greatest naval Power on Earth over and above those which Peace would in itself produce have prompted us to smoothe the way to so desirable a Purpose.  That the said Committee do further inform the said Commrs. That Congress conceive it to be the true Interest of America.  To guarantee to the several European Powers their Possessions in the Islands the same being a Pledge in the Hand of this Continent for the Security of their Subjects in every Part of the World & also for the free Trade to those Islands.  To give equal Privileges to all Persons fishing on their Shores Reserving to them the Determination of Disputes arising on that Subject between foreign Powers.  To open the Ports of America to the Ships of all Nations freighted with the Produce & Manufactures of the respective Countries they belong to except such as may shut their Ports to the Subjects of America, &  To be at Peace with all the World & derive Accessions of Wealth & Subjects from the various Commotions of other States.  That the said Committee do further inform the said Commrs.  That Notwithstanding the Situation of this Country and its evident Interests Congress are determined faithfully to adhere to such Treaties as may on their Part have been entered into consistent with the Instructions heretofore given or any of them.  That if no Treaty is yet made by them they are to govern themselves according to Circumstances being assured that the British Force now in America is not adequate to the Purpose of subduing it and that if such Loans or Subsidies can be procured in Europe as to establish the Value of our Paper Emissions of Money there is no Doubt but that we can still continue the Conflict notwithstanding the Disadvantages before enumerated. Wherefore they shall propose & accede to such Terms within the Line of their former Instructions as shall upon the whole appear to them most conducive to the Interests of these united States &  That if War should be declard against Britain by any of the greater Powers of Europe they are immediately to take Advantage of such favorable Circumstance and borrow all the Money in their Power in Holland & keep the same to answer the Drafts or other Orders of Congress.

Sev- MAY 1, 1778  eral important Matters are depending unfinished respecting the regulation, & provision for the army, & for fixing the Credit of the Currency There is a report of a Committee for Sinking 20 Million dollars, of the first Emissions of the Continental Bills by a Loan, to recommend to the serious consideration of the Southern states the Report of the N. Haven convention for stating prizes, and to such of the States as have not sunk their outstanding Bills immediately, to do it & refrain from further Emissions.(1) The Assembly of Pensylvania have passed an Act to sink all their outstanding Bills & that they shall not be receiv'd in the Treasury after the 12th of next month. They also passed an Act regulating prices of Labour & Commodities the first day of April, to be in force the first of June. The regulating Act, in New York State, was in force & the Inholders Conformed to it, when I passed thro', New Jersey practised on their former Law, but it was said it would be altered agreeable to what was agreed to by the Commissioners met at New Haven. The prices of articles here at present are high.

An Act of 11th March for defraying the expence of carrying into execution an Act of the 9th Febry.(1) 2. of the 12 March for obtaining from each State the constant attendance of at least three Members during the War.  3.

I have not heard from you, nor recd. any Letters from my Freinds since yours of the 6t of April. I expect that Mr. Adams will be here by the latter end of this Month. As soon as he comes I shall Return. Nothing Material has occurred since my last. It is said and it is probably true that Genl. Amherst, Admiral Keppell and Genl.

Howe has or is going to England. My Opinion is that the Veiws of the British Administration are to delude and endeavour to divide- Altho' I do not perceive that any Attempts of this Kind have any Effect. A false forged Resolution of Congress has lately been published both in Philadelphia and N York, setting forth an order to Genl.

  Dear Sir.(1) York 3d May 1778. By an Express, of yesterday, sent by the board of War, I wrote Mr. Davis all the News preceding that date.(2) Before he got away a Messenger arrived from France charged with the most important Papers from our Commissioners at Paris containing a Treaty of alliance, and a Treaty of alliance and Commerce, between the Court of France and America. By these Treaties our Independence is made a grand Object on the Part of the King of France who has with great liberality that he takes no advantage of the present Situation of the States, but has made the same Treaty with them as if they had been in the most flourishing Prosperity.  The Treaty which was concluded & signed the 6th of Feby. guarantees to America all her Possessions in America, together with Bermudas.  If England declares War against France or occasions a War by attempts to obstruct her Commerce, we are to make common Cause with her & join her forces & Councils.  The States guarantee to France all her Possessions in America. Ext. Of D. Franklin's letter.(3)  28 Feby. We have found the greatest cordiality in this Court and that no advantage has been taken of our difficulties to obtain hard Terms of us, but such has been the King's magnanimity and goodness, that he has proposed none we might not have agreed to in a State of full Prosperity and established Power. The Principle laid down in the Plan of the Treaty, being as declared in the Preamble, \""The most perfect equality & Reciprocity,\"" the Priviledges in Trade are mutual, and none are given to France but what we are at Liberty to grant to any other Nation. When we mention the good Will of this Nation to our Cause we may add that of all Europe, which having been offended by the Pride and Insolence of Britain wishes to see its Power diminished. The Preparations for war are carried on with immense Activity and it is very soon expected. When this last Event shall take Place, America will be in a Situation to prosecute the War with Ease to herself, but at present the utmost Exertions should be made in opposition to those of G. Britain, which will be thro Rage & disappointment as great as her utmost ability in Men & Resource will admit; and it would be happy if the People at large could be persuaded that one vigorous Effort would restore them to what they so ardently wish, a State of perfect Tranquility, which with established Independence. The present Treaties, Advantageous as they are, have no immediate operation on our military Conflict with G. Britain, but promises eventually assistance, by G.

  Dear Papa, Sunday 3d May 1778 Yesterday evening arrived here Mr. Dean brother to Mr. Silas Dean, with the Treaty of Alliance & commerce Signed the 6th of February by our Deputies at Paris, & Monsr. Gerard commissionated for that purpose. This treaty is bottomed on principles of the most liberal, wise, & generous Policy; the only thing required of us, is the maintainance of our Independance. If France should be involved in the war, & acquired at the treaty of peace any Islands in the West Indies, we are to guarantee the possession of those & their present Islands. It is not even required of us to continue the war (provided we make peace on the footing of independant States) even if France should be obliged to continue the war if She should be engaged in one in consequence of this alliance formed with us.  Our latest letters from our Deputies at Paris are of the 8th March.(1) They promise us immediate & considerable supplies of clothing, arms &c. It is not expected that the military stores already supplied us are to be paid for. The King of Prussia has prevented the German mercenaries from coming over, so that G B will receive few or no soldiers from that quarter; her funds are fallen 10 per Cent. In short, by our Agent's letters it appears that all the great Powers of Europe are favourably disposed towards us. I sincerely rejoice with you on this happy prospect of our affairs.

  My Dear sir Yorktown Sunday morning, May 3d. 1778 On Yesterday afternoon arrived here from France, Mr. Simeon Dean (Brother to the Commissioner) with Despatches to Congress from our Commissioners, to the 28 February.  On the 6th of February two Treaties were concluded and sign'd by Monsr. Jerard Plenepotentiary appointed by his most Christian Majesty on the 30th January preceding for that purpose, and by our Commissioners, B Franklin, S Deane, & A Lee Esqrs. The first is a Treaty of Amity b Commerce on the plan proposed by Congress and almost in the words of it. The second is a Treaty of Alliance of Amity and Commerce. I cannot better inform you of the substance of these Treaties than in the words of the Commissioners. \""If England declares War against France, or occasions a War by attempts to hinder her Commerce, we shall then make a common Cause of it & join our Forces & our Councils. The grand aim of the Treaty is declared to be \""establish the Liberty, Sovereignty and Independency, absolute and unlimited of the United States, as well in matters of Government as Commerce and this is guarranted to us by France together with all the Countries we possess, or shall possess at the conclusion of the war; in return for which the states Guarrantee to France all its possessions in America. We have found the greatest cordiality in this Court, and that no advantage has been taken of our present difficulties to obtain hard terms from us, but such has been the Kings Magnanimity & Goodness, that he has proposed none which we might not readily have agreed to in a state of full prosperity and established power. The Principal laid down as the basis of the Treaty being as declared in the preamble \""The most perfect Equality [and] Receprocity; the priviledges in Trade &c. are mutual & none are given to France but what we are at liberty to grant to any other Nation.\"" By the Second Treaty France has renounced for ever possession to any part of the Continent lately or now in the possession of Great Britain, or acceded to her by the Treaty of Paris & to the Island of Bermuda. MAY 2, 1778  The account of General Burgoine's defeat was received in Paris the beginning of Decemr. Our Commissioners immediately pressed for the Conclusion of the Treaty, and a Council was called the 12th in which it was decided to acknowledge and support our Independancy.  Our Commissioners are of opinion \""That the Treaty with France will certainly be followed by the whole house of Bourbon, and probably by Holland. The Preparations for war Continue daily, & France is determined to protect her Commerce with you.\"" The King of Prussia is well disposed towards you & on application prevented the Hesse & Hanau Troops from passing thro' his Dominions & now waits the Measures of France. Very considerable supplies sailed from France in February under Convoy, and may be hourly expected. Mr. Carmichael is on board.  I do most cordially and sincerely congratulate you on this most important Intelligence. America has now taken her rank among the Nations & has it in her power to secure her Liberty & Independance. Let us be grateful to our God for this singular unmerited Mark of his favour & protection and continue to exert every Means in our power to support the war; this can only be effectually done by speedy and liberal Loans of Money to the Continent and a respectable Army. Congress some time past recommended that subscriptions should be opened in each County.  I am &c. Saml Chase  ""

  Sir, York Town May 3d. 1778. I take this earliest opportunity to inform your excellency that a Messenger arrived here yesterday P.M. from France, with dispatches, containing among other Things a copy of the Treaties of Alliance and of Amity and Commerce entered into between the Court of France and our Commissioners; which will without doubt be ratified by Congress. The former hath the protection and support of the Independency of these States for its basis, and the latter is founded in perfect equality and reciprocity.  If War should be commenced by Great Britain agst France it is to be made a common cause. The Independency of these States is to be supported. If any particular enterprize should be undertaken we are to join and act in concert.  No truce to be made without the consent of each, unless our Independency is absolutely acknowledged.  MAY 3, 1778  France guarantees our Independency, and all we possess or shall possess at the conclusion of the war and we guarantee to France her Possessions in America.  Admission of other Nations to equal advantages in Commerce.  These are imperfect minutes of some of the principle heads of the treaties as I took them at the Table last evening while they were reading. Hereafter when the treaties shall be ratified copies of them will be transmitted to the several states.  The Letters from the commissioners show a good disposition in the powers of Europe towards us.  Prussia shows a disposition to share in our commerce; but will not open her ports to our privateers until the arrangement of Independency shall be made.  The Ambassador of the Duke of Tuscany hath given our commissioner favorable expectations from his Court.  Portugal will accede to the family compact. The House of Bourbon & all the powers of Europe will soon acknowledge our Independency. We are desired to forget any animosities we may formerly have entertained against France, & to cultivate a friendship for her.  These minutes were made as the other and must of course be very imperfect also.  The Treaties of Alliance &c were signed the 6th of February; and display a spirit of magnanimity and a soundness of policy scarcely to be parallelled. Instead of pursuing that narrow policy which regards only the present moment and present Interest, and nobly disdaining to take an advantage of our situation, France hath, with but a small variation, acceded to our own proposals, thereby doubtless intending to bind us to them by the indissoluble Ties of affection & Gratitude.  It is reported that Genl. Amherst and Admiral Keppel are arrived at Philadelphia; but by an officer whom I saw this morning, and who came directly from Camp it seems to be only a report. Commissioners are daily expected from Britain with proposals for a reconciliation. Congress will abide by their Independency at all events, and I have no doubt but that it will be acknowledged this Campaign even by Britain herself, provided we bring into the field, a respectable Army. She is reduced to the greatest straits. From Germany She cannot collect recruits for their stipulated Troops, From her own Island but few can be drawn. Her credit is sunk in Holland, and her Stocks are fallen. France hath a large body of troops in Normandy and Bretagne, her Navy in good preparation and is determined to protect her commerce to America. She waits only for Britain to strike the first blow. Rather than do this it is my humble opinion that if our people will but step forth this campaign as I have said before She will acknowledge our Independency, and be contented with that part of our commerce which it may suit us to give her.  Mr. Collins will set off in a day or two. He will take with him One hundred and fifty thousand Dollars, and a Warrant on our Loan Office for the same Sum.(1) I am afraid you will be disappointed, but this was not obtained without difficulty. Unless Commissioners should be appointed to settle our accounts before you make another demand, and they are adjusted; or you should send your auditor with the vouchers for every Article, and direct him to tarry until the accounts shall be liquidated I am afraid any Application would be fruitless. Permit me to desire that two of the Delegates, if they should not have come on before this reaches you, may be sent forward immediately; for my health, and the situation of my family oblige me to quit York-Town. I continue to be with great Respect Yr. Excellency's very hble Servant, Wm Ellery  ""

I am much concerned that from a want of opportunity it has not been in my power to pay this respect earlier.  It is impossible Sir, for me to determine what might happen if a Gentleman of your Merit & Military abilities were \""actually on the spot, where Congress is convened,\"" or where the \""Army under General Washington is encamped,\"" but when I assure you that besides those returning French Officers to whom you allude, there are many valuable Characters of different Nations at both places unemployed, & that according to an arrangement now in agitation there will be many American Officers dismissed as supernumerary, you will admit the propriety of forbearing to hold out encouragement to you to encounter so long & expensive a journey, at the end of which there is at present no certainty of promotion, nor even of honorable service. This uncertainty does not arise from a superabundance of Good Officers in our Army, it must therefore be the consequence of our having too many Officers, there would be room enough for some of the first if it were practicable to remove with safety an equal number of the latter class. But Sir, our Army is in its infancy, a State which does not exhibit perfection, & there is a necessity from motives extremely obvious for retaining persons in the list of Officers who are not unexceptionable & we have ground to hope that objections which  MAY 3, 1778  now are urged against some of our young Men will be removed by time.

I will not therefore even unfold your Letters to look for any thing concerning myself or my own affairs, these I leave to providence & you the Instrument of providence, I know you will do as much for me without, as you would with, my fullest directions & probably in the former case much better. There is one subject, which has constantly dwelt in my mind contained in one of your Letters, this I remember without unfolding, because it has made me very unhappy. The circumstance of Mrs. Gervais's loss of health & the State which you describe, is very extraordinary & indicates much trouble to my friend. Either the Dear Lady is no more & you are left with young Children in your hands, or she is still a melancholy spectacle-You Struggling between wishes of affection & Charity for her Life & her Death. I might be very troublesome with words but tis best on such occasions to say little; the mind will have its course & that of a good Man, as you are, will sum up the whole in God's MAY 3, 1778  Will be done. Wisdom will lead you to this point. This uniform submission is the best & safest pilot through the mazes of a Life of vanity & nothingness. If Mrs. Gervais Lives present me in the most affectionate & respectful terms to her, if she is lost, get another good Wife.  Already in the writing the few lines above I have been taken off near an hour by visits of mere compliment & I must expect every moment, fresh breaks. Let me therefore hasten to say something, for upon my honour I was once very near dismissing this Messenger without a line to you.  Upon the arrival of Mr. Chf. Justice Drayton, our public affairs looked extremely gloomy, every thing was dark & dangerous. By his hand I received a permission from the Assembly of South Carolina to retire from Congress. I told that Gentleman at our first interview the true Situation of America as far as circumstances gave me insight & my resolution, since my Countrymen had been pleased to re-elect me, which I esteemed as a desire, at least, that I would continue here, not to turn my back upon danger, that I would stay & take the worst that should happen or till better times, or till Congress should be more respectable in numbers or till South Carolina, my very delinquent Country, should be more amply Represented. The Chief Justice expressed his pleasure, your friend Colo. John Laurens to whom I had previously written on this head, Strongly encouraged me in my determination-& now our faces are a little brightned, I have a new instance for felicitation, \""whatever is is best.\""  One grand subject had employed Congress in a Committee of the whole & in the House near a Month, an establishment of half pay for Officers who should continue in the Army to the end of the War. I had in the Committee Strongly opposed the measure before Mr. D's arrival, if I have time you will receive within the present inclosure the grounds of my objections & nearly in the words I delivered them.(2) That Gentleman on the same side in congress has offered his sentiments with much energy & perspicuity. There was used a good deal of what in my judgement is foul play & you will allow there was some violence when I tell you the declaration of a Majority Man. \""If the majority, said he, would be guided by me, we would take up the matter & carry it through at all events.\"" When the question was put, if I remember right that Majority was 7 to 4 or 6 to 5-a Member or two dropped off & the business has since been Stagnant, auxiliaries are waited for.(3) The Minority proposed to digest a plan & transmit it to the States for Instruction. It was no convincing argument, that \""perhaps, or I should say, probably the people will not agree to it\""-convincing I mean, of the rectitude of the intended Act, for how dare we establish a pension List, or attempt any measure repugnant to the good Will of the people. My reasonings were  Photographic reproduction of Franco-American Treaties of Alliance and Commerce  grounded upon the unconstitutionality, & the danger & the inadequateness of the remedy to the necessity complained of but you will hear more of it by & by.  For the News of the day, I beg leave to refer you to several papers which will accompany this & to my Letter to His Excellency the President,(4) I have referred that Gentleman for an account of the Randolph to a New York paper which I had intended to send you but some freind has kindly Slipped it off my Table.  I must not content myself with referring you to the print for an account of the Treaty between the Court of Versailles & the American Union. I must add my most hearty congratulations upon the promising event. I will not say the Treaty, specious & engaging as it appears, is altogether unexceptionable-but all circumstances considered 'tis very well. I am indebted to Mr. Chief Justice for the compilations in this Room to day-'tis a very good abstract.(5) The whole Treaty, a Secret Article excepted,(6) will be ratified & published very speedily.  Some people who are more Sanguine & more elate than I am talk of moving to Philadelphia. In adversity I am not accustomed to sink, in prosperity it becomes us to pause & be wary.  I intend by this opportunity to pay my respects to Monsr. le Baron de Bonstettin whose Letter lies before me in a pile which I shall never be able to reduce, if I addict myself to being so very prolix as I am in the present Case. Excuse me & beleive me to be with the warmest wishes for the happiness of your self & family.(7)  P.S. I pray you send some of the spare papers of News to Colonel Hammond with my Compliments.

I should certainly have repeated my respects by his hand. Let me at the same time confess I had not intended to have troubled Your Excellency this Morning, if I had not been called upon by the pleasure of forwarding with all possible dispatch four Letters received MAY 3, 1778  at 10 oClock last Night from France. The largest of these appears to have been made free with on the Road but whether the fact be so or not is uncertain, all the Letters having been carelessly sent 400 Miles on Horse back in a Canvas Bag were much rubb'd & some of them without Covers, the Letter I allude to was nearly in that condition when I joined the fractured parts by a bit of Wax.  I have before me Your Excellencys favor of the 26th April,(1) to which I must particularly reply & in such manner as I trust will be satisfactory to Your Excellency.  'Tis true I had not quite forgot the Money which I had the honour of advancing & for a reason of some weight, my shattered fortunes will keep me in remembrance of events which in these hard days are important. But no anxiety dwelt in my breast concerning the time or the manner in which a reimbursement was to be made. Let these be as shall be most convenient to your self in Bills of Exchange or simple paper Dollars. I neither take nor attempt advantages of this nature when I advanced the Money we are speaking of, it was done as a convenience to the Marquis delafayette to whom as an American I hold myself indebted for all the conveniences & all the services, & all the respects & devoirs & more than all, in my power. Hence Dear Marquis order the Money to be repaid as you please, but yet I wish to be near Your Excellency for half an hour on this same Moneyscore, which is not so well understood by every Man at one Age as at another & there are in the World who deem it legal prize to convert a little of the Cash of a Rich Young Nobleman to their own use. Hints of this kind are better to be known than talked of & I know my Dear Sir you will receive this as it is intended.  Your Excellency's Accounts for Money advanced for public service are so exceedingly clever as to convince me they are not the operation of a person who had seen above seven years transaction in a Merchants Counting House, in a word I do not know what to make of them but I will catch half an hour one day this Week & attempt some arrangement.  Our Courier from France left that Kingdom the 8th March, he says every face & every thing from Paris to Brest indicated an immediate War with England.  If your Excellency learns from the dispatches which I have now the honor of transmitting any thing more Interesting than the signing of Treaties of Alliance & Commerce at Versailles between that Court & the United States of America a communication of such intimations as are proper will be extremely acceptable.  There is somewhere afloat between France & this Country a squadron of 4 64, 4 28 Gun ships & several Armed American Vessels convoying divers ships laden with Clothing, Warlike Stores &ca &ca for   American service.

  Sir. York Town 3d May 1778. My last trouble to Your Excellency was dated the 30th Ulto. by Ross.  The present will cover an Act of that date for ascertaining the Rank & Pay annexed to Brevet Commissions. Whether this is, or is not intended to have a retrospective effect, I think is not clearly expressed by the Letter, & as I apprehend such operation may in many Instances give Umbrage I shall embrace the first proper opportunity for obtaining an explanation of the Act or information to my own understanding.(1) I dispatch this Messenger principally to inform Your Excellency of an event the knowledge of which may nevertheless very probably have reached Camp before this can arrive there, as our Messenger from France Mr. Simeon Dean had spoken every where on his Journey to York of the Treaties between the Court of Versailles & the United States of America which were executed on the 6th of February 1778. These were read in Congress late last Evening & will probably be ratified & published in the course of the present Week, except a Secret Article which it is also probable is very well known abroad. Be this as it may I view the Treaties of Alliance & Commerce, although not free from exception, as circumstances of advantage to these United States & which afford a bottom for vast improvements. I beg leave therefore to congratulate with Your Excellency & with every friend to the great American Cause. I shall move Congress tomorrow to order duplicates of the Treaties to be immediately transmitted to Your Excellency. In the mean time this of a Letter from Doctor Franklin & Mr. Deane which will go enclosed will communicate the great outlines.

  Dear Sir York 3d. May 1778 Having detained the Express that he might carry you the news that we heard was on its way from France, I am furnished with an opportunity of congratulating you on the important event of a Treaty of MAY 3, 1778  Commerce, and one of Alliance and Amity, having been signed at Paris on the 6th of February last, between France and these United States. Having been as particular as we could on this subject in the Delegates letter to the Governor, I must beg leave to refer you to that for further information, being compelled to shortness here as the Express waits. Great Britain has now two Cards to play but which she will choose we cannot tell, altho we certainly ought in wisdom to be prepared for the worst. She may either acknowledge the Independency of America and make a Treaty of Commerce with her and thus be at peace with us and with all the World; or she may submit to the uninterrupted progress of French commerce to avoid a war with that Power and yet push her whole force against us this Campaign and thereby injure us extremely if we are not prepared with a strong force to prevent it. She has now at Philadelphia 12,000 Veteran Troops, and may possibly collect and send over 8000 more for a last effort. This consideration points out the necessity of having a strong Army immediately. I do sincerely hope that our Assembly will vigorously and early take up this consideration, because I am sure that their last plan will not procure our quota by a considerable number.

  Dear Livingston, York Town in Pensilvania 3d May 1778 If you have not received Letters from me it is not my Fault for I have written many to you, but from your long very long silence I conclude that something prevents me the very great Pleasure I feel in Hearing from you and yours something which I know not but which I will not for your sake as well as my own suppose to be any Neglect or Forgetfulness for I am determined to beleive that the Friendship which exists between us is built upon that Foundation which the Incidents of Time and Space will neither alter, diminish or take away. What Situation your Politicks are in I will not even pretend to know. For this I know full well that I can hear Nothing so particular as to ground a Judgment on. Generally let me say from what I did hear that things have not gone so well as could be wished. I almost am desirous of being with you. My Heart says yes but in Times and Situations like the present it is not a small Misfortune that the Language of the Heart is not to be attended to. Could I have been of Use in your Legislature? Your Politeness, your Amity will say yes and if you ask whether I am of Use where I am perhaps my Vanity will make the same Answer. I beleive all is right but you know I am quite  MAY 3, 1778  a Candid. Let what will happen the ships Crew must remember not without Gratitude those who threw themselves on Board in the Hour of Distress and saved her from the Storm at the generous Risque of all that this World counts valuable. This is my firm Opinion and being so I cannot but beleive that whatever Men may prevail at a particular Instant in the Flow of Time and however weak, wicked or despicable their Measures my Fellow Citizens will always pay to my Friends that Attention & Respect which are due to their Abilities, their Virtues and the splendid, the essential Services they have rendered to the Republic. Let me intreat you to make my sincere Love & Respects to all your Family and gratulate with the Warmth of Tenderness upon the approaching Prospect of Post Imbres Sol; If you see Duane remember me to him. Have his services been properly noticed? Or hath the Council of Appointment neglected him. I suppose they have because if it is lawful and right to judge of Conduct from Character they have done those things which they ought not to have done and have left undone those things which they ought to have done. When you see or write to Schuyler assure him of my Attention to his Interests. I have written to Jay fully upon that Subject lately and therefore will avoid Repetitions. To him, to you and to our worthy Governor I have recommended Gates.(1) He has sense enough to see that he hath made some wrong Steps and tho I will not promise his Amendment as a Man I think I can venture to say that as a Politican he will not differ with the State who may afford him such essential Aid or do him so irreparable Mischief as ours in his present Situation. At the same Time my Love of the public leads me to desire that he may fall into good Hands and in such have I put him. If therefore he doth not work well Remember you my Friends are answerable for the Consequences. The little Incursion made on our Northern Country I do not conceive to be of such Importance as to demand a very serious Notice. My Countrymen will I hope agree with me in Opinion that while the Enemy are drawing all the Forces in their Power to Philadelphia it behoves us in the weak divided Situation of Pensilvania and the harrassed & exhausted State of New Jersey to draw thither so respectable a Force that we may meet the Enemy well prepared to answer on the great Theatre of War. It is there and there only that they can make such Propositions as we shall attend to. For the Sentiments of Congress on the Subject of Treaty I enclose you the York Paper of the 24th April. If I can lay my Hands on a Lancaster Gazette you shall have the newer news contained in it. One more Effort my Friend and we are free.  Yesterday Afternoon Mr. Deane Brother of Silas Deane, Esqr. arrived here. He brought with him a Variety of public Dispatches which were the more agreeable as nearly one Year had elapsed since we had received any authentic Intelligence. As you live much to the Eastward  of me you doubtless are acquainted with the Manner of his Arrival &ca &ca &ca. I shall therefore mention to you some of those Particulars which I am at Liberty to give to the Curiosity of my Friends and which they cannot learn but from Hence.  Among the Dispatches are two Treaties the one of Alliance the other of Commerce signed at Paris the 6th Feby last between the Count de Vergennes (2) Plenipo. on the Part of his most Christian Majesty and Silas Deane, Doctor Franklin & Lee Plenipotentiaries on the Part of the United States of America. When these Treaties are formally ratified Copies I take it will be transmitted to the several Governors. At present in Substance:  The first is a Treaty by which France acknowledges and undertakes to maintain our Independence both in Government and Commerce and Guarrantees to us our Possessions together with what we shall hold on the Continent (or Bermudas) at the End of the War Ceding to us all her Titles & Claims to every Part of the Continent of America & its Apendages reserving only her Fishing Islands & such Ports as in Case of War she may take from Britain in Newfoundland. And America guarantees to France her present Possessions in the Islands with such as in Case of War she may take from Great Britain. &ca. &ca. &ca.  The second is a treaty of Commerce upon broad, equal, just Principles. An Enumeration of Particulars would fatigue us both, but both the Treaties are upon Principles of the most perfect Equality and such as the greatest Friend to America would have framed had the important Word Louis been put in his Hands at the Bottom of a blank Paper.  The Conduct of the French Court hath been marked by Wisdom and Magnanimity. The Monarch declared that it was his Intention to treat with America as an Equal without Regard to her Weakness or his own Strength but to frame such Treaties as the united States would have entered into when in Possession of that Power which they must arrive at in Consequence of their Independence because he wished that the Alliance might be perpetual.  This will be followed by similar Proceedings throughout Europe where we can count upon Spain, Austria & Prussia as our Friends and Allies. The two latter have rendered us essential Services already and so indeed has the former. You may assure all good Whigs from the best Authority that no Russians, Danes or Swedes will (or shall) come to America. That after the Month of March they will be puzzled to get any more Germans of any Kind. Write the news to our good Domine whom I would write to if I could see a Probability of his getting my Letter.  Should you see poor Smith assure him of my sincere Regret that he hath made the unhappy Choice of being a Subject to the King of   Great Britain instead of to the State of New York.(3) Shake Walter Livingston by the Hand for me most cordially and tell him to bury a Bottle of his Falemian with mystic Rites For that I intend when the Storm abates a little more to come and make a Riot. Go to the old Gentleman and make him very happy by the Assurance that the British Ministers equally proud & abject have courted our Ambassadors to save their Nation from the impending Ruin.  I am at the Bottom of my Paper.  Adieu, Adieu. Remember me, yours, Gouvr Morris  P.S. Without the Knowledge of our alliance with France stocks in Engld. were down 10 (I think 12 per Cent). At Lancaster upon the Arrival of Mr. Deane an Article fell from 20/ per lb to 12/6-which is near 40 per cent. Gold fell from 13 to 5-in the City of Phila. it fell from 5 to 3.  ""

  York Town May 3d. 1778 I have the pleasure of advising you that yesterday brought us dispatches from our agents in Europe, of a most important and favourable nature to these states. I will not trouble your Excellency with minute circumstances; But think it my duty to advise you that the King of France by powers dated January 30th to his secretary of state did on February the 6th by the said secretary enter into one treaty of perpetual peace and amity and trade with these United states: And on the same day into another treaty of commerce with said states. For the present I beg leave to refer you to the following extract of a letter from Doctor Franklin and his colleagues as sufficiently indicitative of the spirit of said treaties.(1)  \""Mr. Gerrard one of the secretarys came yesterday to inform us by order of the King that after long and full consideration of our affairs and propositions in Council, it was decided and his Majesty was determined to acknowledge our independence and make a treaty with us MAY 3, 1778  of amity and commerce. That in this treaty no advantage would be taken of our present situation to obtain terms from us which otherwise would not be convenient for us to agree to, his Majesty desiring that the treaty once made should be durable, and our amity subsist for ever, which could not be expected if each nation did not find its interest in the continuance, as well as in the commencement of it. It was therefore his intention that the terms of the treaty should be such as we might be willing to agree to, if our state had been long since established, and in the fulness of strength and power, and such as we shall approve of when this time shall come. That his majesty was fixed in his determination not only to acknowledge but to support our independence by every means in his power. That in doing this he might probably be soon engaged in war, yet he should not expect any compensation from us on that account, nor pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes, since beside his real good will for us and our cause, it was manifestly the interest of France that the power of England should be diminished by our separation from it. The only condition he should require and rely on would be this. That we in no peace to be made with England should give up our Independance, and return to the obedience of that Government.\""  Thus our Commissioners. The treaty is such as might be expected from such established principles. And we may be assured of as determined a spirit in other courts. It now only remains with ourselves to act with spirit.  ""

  Sir, York, 3d May 1778. Having heared that a Messenger from France was on his way to Congress with important dispatches, we detained the Express who otherwise would have set out yesterday that we might furnish your Excellency with the intelligence he brought. It is with singular pleasure we inform you Sir that this Messenger has brought to Congress authenticated copies of a Treaty of Commerce, and a Treaty of Amity and Alliance signed at Paris on the 6th of February last between France and these United States, and we understand there is abundant reason to suppose that the whole Bourbon family will immediately acceed thereto. The Treaty of Commerce is exactly conformable to our own proposals, and it is upon the most generous and  MAY 3, 1778  equal principles. The Treaty of Alliance &c is professedly for security of the Sovereignty and absolute Independence of these States both in Government and Trade, and it agrees that if G.B. declares war against France on this account, or causes a war, or attempts to hinder her Commerce, that we shall make a common cause, and join our Arms & Counsels against the common enemy. Each Country guarantees to the other the possessions that they do or may possess at the end of the war. Having heared these Treaties read but once in Congress, we cannot be more particular now. In general we find that his most Christian Majesty has been governed by principles of Magnanimity and true generosity, taking no advantage of our circumstances, but acting as if we were in the plenitude of power and in the greatest security. We are shortly to receive considerable Stores from France that come under a Convoy of a fleet of Men of War. The King of Prussia has actually refused to permit the Hessian and Hannau Troops that England had engaged for America to pass thro his Territories. We congratulate you Sir and our Country on this great and important event, but we beg leave further to observe that it is in our opinion of infinite consequence that the Army should be quickly and powerfully reenforced. Because, if Britain should meanly permit the trade of France to proceed without interruption, and push her whole force against us this Campaign, it might be attended with very pernicious consequences. But with a strong Army, we shall, under God, be perfectly secure, and it will probably compel G.B. to a speedy recognition of our Independence, and thus secure the peace of Europe, with the peace, happiness, and glory of America.  We have the honor to be, with much esteem, Sir your Excellencies most obedient and very humble servants.  Richard Henry Lee  P.S.

  Dear Papa, Monday P.M. 4th May 1778 I wrote to you yesterday of an Express going to Baltimore Town. In that letter I acquainted you with the arrival of Mr. Simeon Dean from Paris with treaties of Amity, Alliance & Commerce signed by Our Agents the 6th of February & Mr. Gerard Secretary to the King's privy Council. These treaties we this day ratified. They are founded on a generous & true policy.  The articles of information in the printed paper was handed to the press by a member of Congress (1) tho' without the consent of Congress which has given offence; however the information may be relied on in every thing except \""that the King of Prussa has promised to be the Second power in Europe to acknowlege the Independance of America.\"" Our Agents write in their official letters that the King of Prussia would open the Port of Embden to us: he is certainly favourably disposed towards us. Mr. Izard, who has been long appointed an Agent at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, writes our President, the information as printed in the handbill. By the inclosed scrap of paper you will see the dates of the Several letters brought by Mr. Dean; the 28 of Febry is the last, on the back of said paper you will find two very material extracts from that letter.(2)  Gen. Heath has recd. from Newport 96 thousand silver dollars for fuel supplied to Burgoyne's army.  We hourly expect the arrival of a little fleet from France loaded with cloathing & military Stores; they are all armed vessels but one; one of them is stranded at Ocrocock in No. Carolina but the greatest part of the cargo, it is hoped, will be saved. The Capt. writes that this fleet of which he was one left France the 13th of February & was bound for Boston; that in Quiberon Bay they fell in with a French Squadron, who returned our Salute; that this little fleet, consisting of 5 vessels, I think, was convoyed out by 4 French men of war; but I apprehend this convoy will not come all the way with our fleet, so that there is danger of their being intercepted off our coast.  The letters of our General which were published in Pha. & to which you allude in your last, are forged.(3)  I sent you in mine of yesterday a newspaper containing a good deal of interesting intelligence. I hope the Express left my letter with Miss Goddard, as I directed on the back of it.  The words in the printed paper which are underlined are a mistake of the person who sent the intelligence to the Press. If France should not be involved in this war, we may make peace with G B, provided she acknowleges our Independance; for instance, suppose  MAY 4, 1778  G B should acknowlege our Independance, & make peace with us, & then a war shoulcl break out between France & G B, we are not bound to assist France, & therefore I hope G B will acknowledge our Independance, & on that footing conclude a peace with us, but if France should be engaged in this war in consequence of these treaties we are not to make a separate peace. For notwithstanding Ld North's speech, she finds great difficulty in raising men, & her credit is sinking fast; the legality of raising men by Subscriptions has been questioned in Parliat & in the County of Norfolk (according to the English papers) a remonstrance was preparing against that measure.  The defeat of Burgoyne & the maneuvres of the English Emissaries at Paris who were endeavouring to sound our Agents there to see whether they would listen to accomodation & treaty with England, it is presumed determined the French Ministry to be beforehand with them. I sincerely congratulate you on this important event, which I think puts our Independance beyond a doubt.  It gives me pain to hear that Molly still continues indisposed. God grant her a speedy relief from all her complaints. I flatter myself the approach of Spring will greatly contribute to remove them; my affectionate love to her. Do inform me very circumstantially in yr. letters of her health & of your own, both of which are very dear to me. My love to Mrs. Darnall & the little ones. I am, Yr. affectionate Son,  Ch.

  Dear Sir, 4th May 1778. Since my last of the 11th March I have been honoured with your several favors of the 16th Febry & 8 March.  The Account of your resignation gave me inexpressible concern.(1) All your friends, & every Man here, if I may judge from the respectful terms in which you are always spoken of, is your friend, expressed concern, General Lee in particular.  All agree your principle was good-but many say, & among these be pleased to number me & forgive my candor, you ought to have done every thing you did, the last act excepted.  I am exceedingly desirous of transmitting to you much of the minutia of our public affairs but at this time it is impossible, permit me therefore Sir, to refer you to the papers of intelligence which will accompany this. These papers contain subjects of the utmost importance. I have two objections formed in my mind upon the first reading of the Treaty-Bahama unmentioned & a total exemption of duty on French exports from America in return for exemption of Duty on Molasses imported.(2) Possibly at the next reading & upon consideration I may go further-upon the whole however, 'tis very well. In the course of this Week we shall ratify.  If Louis 16th shall have humbled an imperious & dreaded power- established a new World-extended the Commerce of his own people-obtained means for becoming a great Maratime & all without bloodshed or with very little-his name will be transmitted to posterity with Lustre. I am not without feelings for poor old England.  At the arrival of Mr. Chief Justice Drayton all our affairs were not only gloomy but tottering. I had communicated to a friend in Camp (3) my determination not to turn my back upon distress-this I repeated to the Chief Justice. Therefore after thanking you Sir for the permission which you were pleased to obtain from the House of Assembly for my return, it is necessary to intimate, that for such reasons as appeared to me solid I had determined not to avail myself of the benefit. The public aspect is now somewhat brightened, the approaching season not the most inviting to a Southern Journey, Congress not yet so respectable as it probably will be a Month hence. I have resolved to continue here a little longer.  The British Commissioners are hourly expected. My sentiment is to collect the Wisdom of America to meet them, if a meeting is to be had, not to confine our choice to York Town. On this occasion I have taken the liberty to mention your Name. I find it acceptable & we have only to regret that from the distance a timely attendance will be impracticable.  MAY 4, 1778  I wish you Sir every degree of happiness & have the honour to be with the highest Esteem & Regard, Sir, your obedt. & obliged Servt.  P.S. I have hinted to Mr. Drayton a fine stroke which may be made on Bahamas, if we have strength for such an important Coup from So Carolina. He will probably extend his Ideas-time will not allow me to add.  ""

  My dear Sir, York the 4th [May] 1778 I am greatly obliged by your very kind letter of condolance of the 24th last,(1) and I am to thank you for another of your favors that I found here on my arrival. I beg leave to congratulate you on the very important intelligence that we yesterday conveyed to Government by Express. There appears a magnanimity and wisdom in his most Christian Majesty exemplified in these Treaties with France that does him great honor. It was surely magnanimous not to take advantage of our situation so as to obtain unequal advantage, and it was wise to leave open a door for all the Maritime States (England not excepted) to enter and share the Commerce of N. America. Without this last, the intrigues of G.B. might have combined the other Trading powers with her to distress us and our new Ally. As it is, all will be with us against England because our Commerce is open and profitable to all. If England were wise, she would immediately acknowledge our Independence and make, as France has done, a Treaty with us, which, if agreed to on her part without making war on France, might give peace to the world, and guilty Britain alone suffer for her folly by the loss of N. America. But England is proud, and has long been Mad (I mean since the present accession) in her conduct to No. A. Pursuing her plan, if she meanly submits to the French commerce with us, and pushes all her force against us this Campaign, as I think she will, it may injure us much unless we wisely and timely prepare to resist her greatest efforts by quickly and strongly reenforcing our Army. This done, I am clearly of opinion that G.B. will and must acknowledge our Independence before the close of the year.  General Lee is hourly expected here in his way from his seat in our Berkeley County to the Army, being certainly and fully exchanged for Gen. Prescot.  I am, dear Sir, most sincerely and affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee MAY 4, 1778  P.S. The inclosed extracts are of most undoubted authority and I beg you will insist on both our Printers publishing them.(2)  In our dispatches by the Express it was mentioned that Gen. Amherst & Admiral Keppell were arrived at Philadelphia as Commissioners.(3) That Account came direct from Philadelphia, but it has since been contradicted, and therefore please have it contradicted in our papers if such news has got into them.

  Dr Sir York town May 5th 1778 I never addressed you on any public Subject with more pleasure than I do at present. A Treaty is arrived from France Executed by that power and our Commissioners which explicitly Cedes and Guarantees to the United States their Teritories and acknowledges and guarantees their Independence. The only Conditions required of us is that if France must enter into a war for that purpose we unite our Forces with her against our Common Enemy. But the inclosed handbill (1) will more fully inform you, and I shall without ceremony Congratulate you and my Country on this most Auspicious Event. The wisdom of France appears as conspicuously Superior to that of Britain as her Justice and Magnanimity. France wisely foreseeing that a very close union with America and Exclusive advantages must not only be Irksom to the People to whom it might be immediately disadvantageous but make her self the object of the Jealousy of other Powers has  MAY 5, 1778  forborn every such requisition, and She indeed requires us to do nothing but follow our own true Interests, and what we had unanimously resolved on in Congress some days previous to our knowing any thing of the Treaty.(2) As you will see by the paper I inclosed you by Mr Harnett England who evidently wished to make us every Concession, in my Opinion even Independance, lost the opportunity of gaining our alliance and Political Confidence by a vain Endeavour of shallow puerile Artifice to cheat us out of Resolutions which we had already so liberally sealed with our blood, and which she might see we were determined to support or Perish.(3)  In short Sir I am unable to express the satisfaction I feel on this Occasion. The Prospect of a free, happy, gallant, flourishing People obtrudes every moment on my Imagination and I enjoy by anticipation the future felicity of my Country.  Having yet heared nothing from you relative to the Delegation for our State, and my time being now completely elapsed I shall set off for home in a few Hours.(4) I know not who Succeeds me, but am happy to consider that they will find our affairs in so prosperous a Situation. Soon as I arrive at home I shall trouble you with a Letter, at present I have time only to add that I am, Dr Sir with the most perfect Esteem and regard your Obed Servt, Thos Burke  ""

  Dear sir, York Town 5 May 1778 In a public Letter which I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency the 3d Inst. by Major Brice, I sent a number of hand Bills calculated for giving satisfactory information to the Public who were anxious to learn the recent intelligence from France.(1) One article of this has been questioned, respecting the King of Prussia's promise- the only part of the performance that can be called mine.(2) I believe my authority is good. Mr Izard, under the 16th February, informs me, \""The King of Prussia has given the most explicit & unequivocal assurance that he will be the second power in Europe to acknowledge the Independence of America.\"" Tis true our Commissioners in their public advices are not so express, nor are they in my opinion so full & clear in some other respects as they might have been. Human nature pervades every human breast-a residence at Paris will not exempt Men from infirmities of the Mind, nor is even the momentous concern of Guardianship to thirteen united States, an Infant World in danger of being crushed by the hand of violence paramount to those Curses upon Mankind, Pride & Covetousness, sources from whence all the Evils of this Life spring. Our ambassadorial Commissioners of which Your Excellency cannot be ignorant, are unhappily divided in sentiment, Jarrings & Appeals have followed, intelligence intended for the Public loses part of that fulness & perspicuity which would have appeared in candid & united Counsels.  I have seen so much of the World as to be guarded against surprise at any thing, no inconsiderable benefit results from attempts to recon- MAY 5, 1778  cile & even sweeten the most untoward circumstances which happen in ones journey through it. I apprehend it would break in upon Your Excellency's time, otherwise I would have troubled you with Mr. Izard's Letter not merely for information but from a hope that something might be devised for promoting Concord between our friends yonder, or the Public good, by a Wise seperation, but I will not dwell upon this subject.  Last Night I had the honor of receiving Your Excellency's favor of the last of April & am happy in finding a confirmation of my sentiments respecting persons proper for treating with the expected deputation from our Adversary.(3) I fear the determination, where only this point can be determined, will be contrary. Be it so, thank God we have here some Men of abilities & Integrity, I hope we shall make a judicious choice.  The Act of Congress of the 22d April will blot out Pages of the British Instructions, the Commissioners from that side will perceive a necessity for taking a new departure from the Tower of Independence & what happened in France on the 6th February will oblige them to shape a new course. From the absence of the Commissioners I presume they had not sailed from England at the 10th March. It may have been found expedient at St. James's to vest them with more ample Powers, if they meant to come, than were originally intended, & under new sanctions of Parliament-a work of slow progress. The People would have much to say-that the Nation were more than a little agitated appears from a Letter which I take the liberty of inclosing for Your Excellency's perusal. I have likewise a Letter from the Mercantile line in London which proves to me the people in general had very sensibly felt the weight of the War, were ardently desirous of Peace & anxious lest Congress should reject the intended propositions.  The long & as I humbly think, unnecessary, delay of the Army arrangement is very affecting, I know it must give extreme pain to Your Excellency-it is improper for me to touch upon the causes, especially when it is so well known that Congress have been engaged in very much important business. The Plan introduced for that part of it which is intended to establish an half Pay for Officers during Life, I have been uniformly averse from, & in a Committee of Congress delivered my objections, these appear to me at this moment of more weight because they have not been removed by the reasonings which have been offered against them & I may without vanity think my self not obstinate. I am open to convertion & always without murmuring submit to a Majority.  I view the scheme as altogether unjust & unconstitutional in its nature & full of dangerous consequences. Tis an unhappy dilemma to which we seem to be reduced-provide for your Officers in terms dic-  tated to you or lose all the valuable Soldiers among them-establish a Pension for Officers, make them a seperate Body to be provided for by the honest Yeomanry & others of their fellow Citizens many thousands of whom have equal claims upon every ground of Loss of Estate, health &c &c & lose your Army & your Cause. That such provision will be against the grain of the People has been unwarily testified by its Advocates whom I have heard converse upon the subject indeed they have furnished strong ground for opposition against an immediate compliance with the demand.  If we cannot make Justice one of the Pillars, Necessity may be submitted to at present, but Republicans will at a proper time withdraw a Grant which shall appear to have been extorted.  Were I in private conversation with an Officer on this point I should not despair of fairly balancing every greivance he might suppose to be peculiar to the Army, by instances of losses & inconveniences in my own property & person-and I count myself very very happy compared with thousands who have as faithfully adhered to our original Compact. 'Tis said Gentlemen did not think the War would have continued so long, forgive me Sir, a ludicrous remark which I made early in our Contest, indeed in England before the commencement of Contest.  \""I know my Countrymen are good for the Quarter but I have doubts of their going the Course.\"" There is a certain versatility habitual if not almost constitutional in Men born south of 38 Degrees of Latitude in these States-circumstances which have occured in the process of this War have given strength to my observation, there are within that division of America not only objects inviting, but temptations almost irresistable, to Change-to say nothing of the general train of Education; hence tis easy to account for resignation of a Commission which had been anxiously solicited by scores. The want of something is made an excuse & even sometimes by worthy Characters who do not Suspect themselves.  Would to God Gentlemen had followed the Noble Patriotic example of their Commander in Chief, a Plan which reflection will shew them in a shade of disgrace would never have found a place in their minds. How superior are many of the Gentlemen now in my contemplation, for I know many with whom I don't converse, to the acceptance of an half pay, contributed to by Widows & Orphans of Soldiers who had bled & died by their sides, shackled with a condition of being excluded from the Privilege of serving in Offices in common with their fellow Citizens, bated in every House of Assembly as the Drones & incumbrances of Society, pointed at by Boys & Girls- there goes a Man who robs me every Year of part of my pittance. I think Sir I do not overstrain-this will be the Language of Republicans-how pungent when applied to Gentlemen who shall have   stepped from the Army into a good remaining Estate, how much deeper to some who in Idleness & by peculation have amassed Estates in the War.  This Sir is a large field. Virtue & Honor might be summoned to answer, but it is time for me to forbear. I am obliged to write in haste called upon by particular public duties, besides I feel a full assurance, notwithstanding the present seeming contrariety, that my sentiments when fully explained will not differ essentially from Your Excellency's. I must not however conclude without these declarations- that I am not among those to whom may be applied \""Our God & Soldiers we adore in a time of danger\"" &c.  I am most heartily disposed to distinguish the Gallant Officer & Soldier by the most liberal marks of Esteem-desirous of making proper Provision for all who shall stand in need. I would not except even some of the brave whose expences have been Princely, in extravagance, while they complained of insufficiency of pay.  I have ever detested & never practiced Parliamentary Jockeyings for procrastinating an unpalatable business, which as a silent auditor & spectator I have within some time past known to be alternately adopted.  I most sincerely wish this of the Army had been wisely attended to. The high Esteem I, from gratitude, bear for Your Excellency whose sufferings from a contrary conduct I know must have been great as well as my love of dispatch makes me wish it, & I lament that in some degree we are likely to be more indebted to the Policy & deep projects of other Men for our deliverance than to our own Wisdom & fortitude.  I ask Your Excellency's pardon for taking up so much of your precious time, & this the more particularly, because I know Sir your politeness & punctuality in making returns to correspondents. I intreat Your Excellency pay no regard to me in this respect, I am a very plain unceremonious person not ignorant that a multiplicity of affairs are continually crowding upon a Gentleman in your high station & know your mind must be as continually employed in the most important speculation. I only request Your Excellency, if you think me wrong, will believe me Candid & be assured I am with the most sincere attachment & the most respectful affection & Esteem, Dear sir, Your much obliged Servant, Henry Laurens  [P.S.] If it be not improper I request Your Excellency will cause the Inclosed Letter to Thomas Pike to be sent in to Philadelphia.(4)  ""

  Dear Sir. 6th May [1778] Affairs have assumed a different aspect from that which appeared when your Excellency writ the Letter which I am just now honoured with of the 27th April.(1) I took the earliest opportunity to transmit an Abstract account of the intelligence which Congress received from France on the 2d Inst. by putting under Cover 3 or 4 Copies directed to your Excellency the 3d but I had not time to write a decent Syllable. The performance was Mr. Drayton's, I had given him the article relative to the King of Prussia. This has been Since questioned because so Interesting a  MAY 6, 1778  circumstance had not been intimated in the public Letter from our Commissioners, but I rely on my authority. Mr. Izard writes to me the 16th Febry.-\""the King of Prussia has given the most explicit & unequivocal assurance that he will be the second power in Europe to declare the Independence of America.\""  Congress have Ratified the Treaty or Treaties & a Committee have prepared Somewhat for public information by authority in which many, probably all, of the articles relative to Commerce & for regulating Marine conduct will be included.  I think myself happy in being entirely of opinion with your Excellency respecting Independence & the half pay scheme.(2) This last business lags exceedingly, I beleive we wait for auxiliaries. I have no objection against Liberal acknowledgments of the services of Officers & Soldiers, any thing that will not strike at our Constitution, but if we can't make Justice one of the Pillars necessity will prove a temporary support. We may submit to it at present, Republicans will at a proper time withdraw a Grant which shall appear to have been extorted. This & the natural consequences, I dread.  When the Account of the Treaties of the 6th Febry had reached White Hall Administration were perplexed, they were stunned. I have a Letter which may be trusted, informing me that Lord Mansfield in tears applied to Lord Camden as a good Marl, to interpose for the salvation of the Kingdom, his Lordship alluded to his repeated predictions which had been treated with Contempt & intimated his fears that the Door was shut.  Another Letter which I have received from the Mercantile Line convinces me the weight of the War lay heavy, that the whole Nation were violently agitated. My influence is even asked to prevail upon America to accept the terms intended to be proposed, meaning the Conciliatory Bills. I do not know that I have a spark of Influence, if I had much, the whole should be thrown into the opposite Scale. From the continued absence of the expected Commissioners 'tis probable new measures were to be projected & parliamentary sanction obtained.  I remember something of Doctor Franklin's having proposed to a certain King a plan for reducing a great Empire to a Small Kingdom,(3) the Inclosed Evening post contrasts to Alfred the Great a certain Emperor of a floating Island. Having a spare Constitution of the State of South Carolina I send it for your Excellency's amusement.  I wont forget to enquire tomorrow concerning the Money for the light Horse,(4) I am sensible that in numberless Instances we improve our Talents in the same degree of loss. The mismanagement of our finances I often lament, our Children will feel the effects.  &c &c omitted Copying.  ""

  Dear Sir York the 6th of May 1778 The unfortunate cause which hath prevented me from attending to your last favor sooner,(1) will, I hope, be my excuse. The long sickness and death of my much loved brother of Belleview, has for some time past confined me in Virginia, and removed every other consideration from my mind. I now embrace the first good opportunity of sending you the pamphlet of forgeries that I formerly mentioned.(2) Tis among the pitiful arts of our enemies to endeavor at sowing dissention among the friends of liberty and their country. With me, such tricks can never prevail. Give me leave dear Sir to congratulate you on the happy event of our Treaty with France being so effectually concluded-Congress has ratified on their part and ordered the ratification to be delivered in due form. This will be announced to the public immediately. The counsels of France have been governed in this affair by true magnanimity and sound policy. It was magnanimous in his most Christian Majesty not to avail himself of our situation to demand unequal and oppressive terms, and it was wise to leave the Commerce of America open to all the Maritime States; which will prevent their jealousy & enmity, and make them foes instead of friends to England. Great Britain has its choice now of madness, or meanness. She will not war with the house of Bourbon and N. America at the same time, so that I incline to think meanness will be her choice as best befitting her present State and the minds of her rulers. It will probably happen that the Trade of France will not now be interrupted; and thus, by affording no pretext for war, the whole force of our enemies may be devoted to one last and vigorous Campaign against us. As wise men we ought to be prepared for such an event by collecting a strong army, and by every other means that can discourage and defeat such intentions of our inveterate enemies. Being disappointed this Campaign, must infal- MAY 6, 1778  libly compel the acknowledgement of our independence and keep the world for some time longer in peace. England alone will pay for her wickedness and folly by the loss of North America.  Our information is good that very few Troops can come here from Germany, and private letters, as well as public papers say that the plan of getting Regiments by subscription, tho much boasted of at first, has fallen very low. From the Highlands of N. Britain some men will be obtained, and perhaps a few from England and Ireland, but there seems no reason to suppose that their every exertion can add more than four or five thousand to the present force in N. America. But this will require a very considerable strength on our part to make the event certain. An unsettled dispute between the Emperor and the King of Prussia (which England will undoubtedly foment) concerning the division of the estate of the late Elector of Bavaria has threatened a rupture in Europe not for our advantage, because the former of these Princes being with us, the latter might be disposed to favor the views of G.B. to our injury. Alderman Lee writes that there is some hope of this being negotiated happily.(3) An intelligent Correspondent in England writes Alderman Lee that it was uncertain whether Lord Norths bills would be agreed to or not, but that they were industriously sent over here and circulated to prevent our Treaty with France from being concluded. Vain and unwise Men, their means are always destructive of their ends. Norths delusive and indecent propositions have accelerated an adoption of the agreement with France. I am much concerned to find in Virginia such want of method and industry in collecting and bringing forward the Drafts.(4) When I came away there were all the Men (amounting to forty one or two) both of the former and the latter drafts remaining in King George-Merely for want of an Officer to bring them away, and I am misinformed if it is not the case in other Counties. As far as I have been able to learn, it is probable, that if dexterous recruiting Officers were properly furnished for the business, and sent out, almost all these Veterans that have been discharged from our 9 Regiments would reenlist in a short time.  I am, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most affectionate and obedient servant, Richard Henry Lee  P.S. Alderman Lee says they talk of sending Lord Westcote and Hans Stanley here to treat with us, and that they are to bring half a million guineas to bribe the Congress. From their own corruption these men reason to the corruption of all others.  I had almost forgot to mention that four expresses have been sent from St. James's on the subject of Generals Howe and Clinton. The latter had leave to go home, the Court was disgusted with the former and had recalled him, but recollecting that Clinton might be come   away, another Messenger was sent to stop Howe if that should be the case. I hope they are both gone.  ""

As for any other disadvantages we are unconcerned; for we are sure we shall not be obliged to pay a freight on that Vessel to France, as the Captain of her hath refused to comply with his Orders. We have only to request you to Protest formally against the conduct of the Captain of the Flamand which will effectually secure us against the payment of freight. We have shewn to Mr. Francey your letter, he informed us that he received a Similar one from you, and in consequence thereof had ordered the Captain of the Flamand immediately to France. The Captain and Crew of this Vessel would have behaved better if the latter had not been deceived. Mr Francey when your letter was read to him told us that the Crew were shipped for the West Indies and home to France, and that when they found they were bound to the Continent they mutinied, and it was not without great dificulty that they were subdued to go to Portsmouth, and the same reason with the dread of Capture now induces them to refuse to go to Carolina.

  Sir 8th May 1778 I presented this Morning your favor of yesterday received by the hand of the bearer of this Mr. Thos.

  Gentlemen May 8th 1778 The many interesting subjects contained in your last Letter shall shortly receive a full answer, for the present we shall confine ourselves to the disagreeable business of the Alfreds loss, and the conduct of Captain Thompson upon that occasion.(1) From various concurring informations as well as from Captain Thompsons letter to this Committee of the 7th of April last, The Committee are of opinion that both the public Interest and the honour of Captain Thompson render it necessary that a Court of Enquiry should be held on his conduct. But this Enquiry the Committee think cannot properly be made until Captain Hinman or some of his Officers can be heard upon the Affair and in the mean time it is not fit that the public should be deprived of the use of the Raleigh. It is therefore the desire of the Committee that you forthwith suspend Captain Thompson from the Command of that Frigate until a full and fair enquiry can be made into his Conduct, on the Occasion of the Alfreds loss, and that the Raleigh be got ready for Sea with all possible expedition. By the time this will happen the Committee will appoint a Captain to take the Command of her.(2) The Committee are intirely of Opinion with you that it will be proper to send out a Collected force to Cruize against our enemies that we recover the injured reputation of our Navy and the losses we have sustained. With this veiw the Committee wish that the Warren and any other of the Continental Vessels that you approve, may be quickly made ready for Sea and you shall shortly hear further and fully from us concerning the destination of these Ships. We have the pleasure to enclose you the late Resolves of Congress concerning Marine misconduct, and the mode of trying it, which we hope may in future remove the dificulty that hitherto subsisted in Affairs of this nature.(3) It seems from your information of the Enemy at Rhode Island hawling three additional Ships into the Channel thro' which you proposed sending the frigate Providence to intercept her, that the chance of her escaping is too great to be unnecessarily run. We would therefore propose you should endeavour to man the Warren with the hands of the Providence and lay aside the attempt to get her out unless through a change of circumstances you should discover a fair  MAY 8, 1778  Opportunity of effecting it-in case this should happen we would have her ordered round to Boston there to join the Continental frigates.(4)  We are Gentlemen, Your Hble servants.

  Gentlemen May 9th 1778 We have received yours of the 6th, 9th, 15th, 20th & 22d April last under the signature of Mr. Warren and now sit down to give them an Answer. The loss of the Columbus altho' considerable yet by the prudence of your Board in taking out her Cannon & Stores before she left Providence, is much less than it would have otherwise been.  As it is highly proper that a Strict enquiry should be made into the causes of the loss of any of the Continental Vessels, you will institute a Court of Inquiry for the purpose of Inquiring into the loss of that Ship.(1) We have given directions respecting the frigate Providence in ours of yesterday which went by Express to which we refer you.  With regard to the Trumbull, the Governor & Council of Connecticut were desired to assist in getting her out of the River because you were not then assembled at Boston, and not from any the most distant Idea of your incompetancy to the business.(2) How it hath happened that you have not received notice of their being requested to  MAY 9, 1778  aid in that Affair we know not but suppose it to be owing to a multiplicity of business. However we hope that this circumstance will not prevent your exerting yourselves on this occasion. We don't doubt but that you will attend closely to the equiping and manning the Warren and Raleigh, so that they may be ready to go on a Cruize in company as soon as possible agreeably to what we have written to you in the letter already referred to.  The Sloop Providence is to be stopped if she hath not already sailed and to wait the orders of the Committee of foreign affairs.(3) We lament the death of that gallant Sea Officer Captain Chew. Fourteen or fifteen hundred Barrels of Flour and about 15 Tons of Iron are at Senepuxent waiting the arrival of the Vessels you may have ordered to receive them. We should have directed the whole thither had you not expressed a doubt whether you should be able to succeede in procuring Vessels. If you should collect a sufficient number of vessels to carry all the flour and Iron let us know it and we will immediately send the remainder to Senepuxent. The price of 30/ per Ton and insure so far from being thought enormous is so low as to induce a Suspicion that there is some error in your manuscript. No pursers have as yet been appointed for the navy, when there are their pay will be established. Captain Landais is here-hath been before us and his business is submitted to Congress. We have procured a Continental Commission for Captain Burke.(4) Captain Skimmer if he should behave well, which we cannot doubt after reading the good character you have given will be promoted Ceteris Paribus according to his Rank.(5)  To yours of the 9th of April we reply, that we have wrote fully respecting the loss of the Alfred &c by the Express,(6) and that we have transmitted to you the Resolve of Congress respecting the pay & Rations of officers not in actual service.(7) We would observe here with regard to rations that none in fact are allowed to Navy officers by the Regulations of the Navy, all that was intended by the Resolve is the allowance made to Seamen on Ship Board. We should not be sorry to get rid of our bad officers, as for the good ones they may depend upon receiving every encouragement that Congress can reasonably give.  On yours of the 15th we would observe that we approve of your ordering the Raleigh to Boston. That part which relates to an enquiry on the conduct of Captain Thompson is already answered. We shall transmit Instructions for the Frigates in Season. We shall attend to supplying you with Money from time to time as the Treasury will admit of it, so as to enable you to execute the business of your Department with advantage and satisfaction to the public and reputation to yourselves. We are glad to hear that one of the Warrens prizes is arrived, the other we fear is lost. We will attend to the affair of the Peggy. We had received Letters from Captain Jones of the Ranger  before we received your Account of him. In the Paragraph in answer to yours of the 9th we answered part of yrs. of the 20th. If it be meant that Tea, Coffee & Sugar should be allowed to officers not in actual service in lieu of the Rations of Meat &c we shall not object to it provided they do not receive of those articles more than to the Amount in value of that Ration. It was thought improper that Captain Skimmer & Tucker or any other Officers appointed by General Washington should be ranked in the Continental Navy at the time the Rank of Continental officers were determined by the Marine Committee. They must take Rank after them and their Ranks as they respect each other ought to be determined by the Senority of their appointments under General Washington. We now enclose you Commissions & Warrants.  In reply to your last of April the 22d we are glad to hear that Captain Manly is exchanged. It is our intention that he should take the Command of the Frigate Salisbury, If upon enquiry into the loss of the Hancock it should turn out it was not owing to any mal conduct in him.(8) The Resolve of Congress, which we have transmitted to you empower the Navy Boards to order Courts of Enquiry & Courts Martial in the cases mentioned in the said Resolve. Captain McNeill should be tried by a Court Martial. When the Resistance shall have arrived it may be time enough for us to appoint a Commander for her. We are somewhat Surprized that the Governor & Council of the state of Rhode Island should make any dificulty about sending in Captain Furneaux, as it would seem improper that he should [be] exchanged for a Captain of a Privateer if any One of that state should be in captivity.  We have nothing more to Add at present, but our wishes that you continue to exert the utmost vigor and Industry in getting the ships and other Vessels of war to sea, that we may avail ourselves of the extensive property which our enemies have upon the Water. We understand our enemies have a practice of detaining all the Boys that they make prisoners from us. We desire that this practice may be retaliated by not exchanging Boys that the Continental Frigates may captivate from them. We are Gentlemen, Your Hble Servants  P.S. Inclosed is an account of Disbursements on the Continental Sloop Providence at Charles Town South Carolina amounting to £5009.2.6 S. Currency, also an account of Slops furnished the Commander of the said Sloop by the Agents at that Port amtg to £3493.12.3 of both which Accounts you will make due note and see that the Slops are properly Accounted for.

  My Dear, Yorke Town 9th May 1778 I Wrote to you the 4t instant.(1) A few Hours after I had sent away my Letters Mr Simeon Dean arrived here, who bro't Congress Two Treatys the one commercial the other Defensive which our Commissioners had entered into with the Court of France-which Treatys have been much Approved of and Ratified by Congress. They are founded upon the broad Basis of Mutual Interest and Security, and Nothing in them which indicates any Design of obtaining any advantage over us. But seem adapted to secure a lasting Friendship which it is certainly the highest Interest of France to Cultivate. I enclose to you a Hand bill published here prematurely and not by any order of Congress, and which contains something in it \""false\""(2) but which as it is published here and abroad you may as well conjecture what is true and what false as others-and shall leave it to your Ingenuity to Make the Discovery. Congress have not thott proper to Say more at present upon those Treatys than what is contained in a Paper now in the Press and which I hope I shall be able to enclose to you. G Britain now must immediately desist from this cruel War and admit at once our Independency, or else be invovld in a War with France and probably Spain and Prussia. As soon as France announces our Independency which before now she has probably done she will not suffer G Britain to interrupt her Trade to these States. Indeed every Thing forbids G. Britain to be at Peace with her neighbours if she prosecutes the War against America. Our Peace I consider as now dawning upon us. And whenever it shall be established, may these Independent States thankfully Acknowledge that Great Goodness of God who by his kind Providence so evidently affords us his Protection.  Nothing Material has occurred here since my last. The Military Operations I hope will before long begin as most certainly We ought not to Relax for a Moment our most Vigorous Exertions on Accot. of these Events. For a safe and just Peace cannot be established with so MAY 9, 1778  inveterate a Foe while the Enemy have it in their Power to carry on the War-which I am Very confident they cannot do but a Very little while unless We become supine and inattentive to our own safety.  By the Blessing of God I injoy good Health. The Disorder which I mentioned in one of my Letters was the same as every one has had, who at first has used these Waters. I then tho't it was a Return of bilious Disorders-but I was intirely Mistaken. I expect that Mr Adams will soon releive me, when he does so I shall Return, and I hope in future I may injoy that domestick Happiness which this Merciless War has for some years so much interrupted.

  Dear Papa, Monday P.M. 11th May 1778 I have your letter of the 7th & one from Molly. Inclosed you have the last York Paper & an Address of Congress to the People. Mr. Digges pressed me to take the money, but I declined it; I told him I would take the interest; he said he had paid the interest. This was all he could, I thought, in reason expect from me; he did not press the matter farther. I am surprised you have not heared from Mr. Rutherford: his Silence gives room to conjecture he will not take the money. Our taxes, I suppose, will amount to upwards of £1500 for this year. I wish you could obtain the certificates of our different assessments. If peace should soon take place, with proper ceconomy in the expenditures of public money, a little skill in finance, heavy taxes, & a prosperous trade we might soon put our paper money on a sure foundation-but if the war should continue, & G B should remain mistress of the Seas we shall find it difficult to Support & prop up the tottering  MAY 11, 1778  Fabric of public Credit, unless we manage much better than we have hitherto done.  We have a report this evening, that the Enemy are fortifying Haddonfield & Mountholly in the Jersies; from this I conjecture they are meditating a movement from Pha. to N. York, but we shall hear more of their designs by tomorrow, as it is said, an express is on his way to Congress from Our General. If he should bring any thing new & interesting I will write you another letter tomorrow morning. Wishing you a long continuance of health I remain yr. affectionate Son,  Ch.

The Enemy on the 8th instant went up the Delaware with 5 armed vessels & between 20 & 30 flat bottom boats containing about 1000 chiefly light infantry.

I received to Day a Letter from Mr. Brown of Annapolis. He has expressed a strong desire to return home to his native Country. His Intentions are to apply to You and the Council for leave to go to Philadelphia and from thence to England. I cannot discover any reasonable objection against granting his request. Mr. Carrol will also write to you upon this subject; You will easily perceive this Gentleman is very desirous of appearing before you, with the assistance of some of his acquaintances to strengthen his application. I assure you if I could apprehend the least danger from granting him leave to depart in the way he desires, I would be one of the last who would give him permission, but I am persuaded he cannot, if he had an Inclination, communicate any thing to the Enemy which they do not know already.

  Sir, 11th May 1778 I am sorry to learn by your favor of the 7th Inst. that circumstances have occured which have disturbed your accustomed tranquility.  The Brevet which you have, is to the best of my knowledge exactly such an one as Baron Stuben applied for, I am sure it is such as I was ordered to grant, & you widely mistake, if you believe the disposal of Commissions rests with me.(1) The Resolves of Congress are my Orders-from these I never swerve, be my own inclinations as they may.  Your Brevet intitles you to Rank & pay of Captain, neither one nor the other are depreciated by such assistance as you may give to General Stuben.  Command was not asked for, if it had been, your experience of our Army has shewn you, it could not have been granted.  Major Des Epinier's Commission has been more than once retorted. The importunity of some Gentlemen & their friends at particular times, when Congress were not at leisure for minute enquiries, may have led the House unwarily into error. This perhaps may be produced as an Instance, 'tis impossible to escape without adhering strictly to Rules from which Congress indulgently to their friends from France have sometimes deviated-but when Monsr. Des Espinier shews his Commission & talks of his advantages every circumstance relative to his obtaining that Commission should be disclosed.(2)  'Tis impracticable for me Sir, to be more minute, my Duty to the public will not afford time. I shall only observe further, on two parts of your Letter.  You say, \""I certainly mistook the Baron when he applied for a Commission for you\"" & you tell me what his \""meaning\"" was-the interpretation of the Barons meaning was his expression & I am persuaded you will be tender in an attempt to prove he did not mean what he said.  But Sir, as an Individual what is all this to me? As the President of Congress I repeat, I act faithfully to the orders of Congress. I have no will of my own.  I have heard no complaint from Baron Stuben that his \""meaning\"" had been mistaken or perverted & I beleive there is no ground for complaint.  \""You will freely subscribe to my Decision.\""  I decide then with your permission, that you cultivate the acquaintance you have made among Strangers into friendships, & remain tranquil in your present Sphere until you can fairly & advantageously enlarge it.

Lanuville is so well recommended from all quarters & so warmly recommends himself as to insure him every thing that Con- MAY 11, 1778  gress can with propriety Resolve in his favor. Notwithstanding all this, if I can judge from appearances, that Gentleman will not obtain the Rank he aspires to, until he has given some actual proofs of his abilities as a Military genius. His papers are in the hands of Gentlemen who Seem heartily disposed to serve him-the issue will be known in a few days.(2)  I have not had a proper opportunity for introducing into Congress the business of Chevalier defayolls, but in private chat with a Gentleman most versant in foreign applications, I learn the Chevalier had some time ago adjusted his demands & received Money for conducting him to France, hence I conclude Congress will readily recommend him to a passage in the Warren or in any other Ship of War bound to France in the service of the States.(3)  You will receive by this conveyance several of the publications of the Treaty of Paris so far as Congress have judged necessary to inform the public at this time. The knowledge of the Treaty in general & of those particulars spread among the Indians can have no bad effect but may do good to our cause.  Colo.

I have told this Young Gentleman I can not flatter him with hopes of the Commission he seeks for. If he is inclined to address Congress I shall faithfully deliver his Memorial-but from the nature of things I may venture to predict that his application will be rejected.  Congress determined this Morning to proceed on the arrangement of the .Army,(6) the Members are exceedingly anxious to finish that business, wherefore I have no prospect of an opportunity until that is over, of introducing Colo.

  My Dear Son, 11th May 1778. The great improvements in the discipline of your Army marked in your favor of the 7th must afford a Gentleman of good taste in the Military Science all that Satisfaction which you have expressed & probably a little more than can be described upon paper.(1) I, who love order & etiquette & particularly love your General, participate your pleasure; go on improve till that which was impudently said & sarcastically intended shall be verified, Washington in War shall be equal to Frederic-in many respects he is far superior.(2)  The public is indebted to Baron Stuben, their minds I hope will in due time be impressed with a Sense of his Merits & that proper effects will be produced.  Your sounds of rejoicing were no doubt heard in the City. What feelings were raised in the minds of Some worthy Characters in the MAY 11, 1778  other Army! How deeply will their King be mortified when he reads \""protector of the rights of Mankind\"" & reflects upon his own folly in abdicating the most valuable part of his Dominions!  I am not ignorant of the conduct you complain of respecting your General.(3) In the recent instance I have suffered not a little Chagrin. I think I did not much err in my opinion delivered in Congress that General Washington should be made acquainted with all the Treaties even the Secret Articles; these might have been intrusted to a Commander in Chief of all the Forces of the United States of America, to a friend, a Virtuous patriotic Citizen with equal propriety & safety as they have been to the Member who lay snoring fuddled on one of the Benches while those papers were reading. The conveyance to & from Camp would not have been attended with more risque than the Journies & Voyage between Paris & York but the Treaties could not be spared, they were to be immediately Ratified & transmitted for Exchange-admitted, but in the mean time appoint a Committee or direct your President to write a Letter of congratulation & transmit an Abstract of the Articles intimating that the whole shall be sent for his information at a proper time. Extract, from Letters written by the Commissioners at Paris such parts as will shew the complexion of affairs in Europe, somewhat like this in my opinion ought to have been done, & why it was not is not to be answered by me, except that I am persuaded the omission was not the effect of design in a Majority who love & Esteem that valuable Man.  I wished & endeavored even to send the General a few of the latest News papers, these for once came into my possession but under a pretence or promise of sorting them were while I was engaged taken from before me & I have never seen them since save a few of November & December which we had read a Month before, & yet every one affects to wonder what became of the papers.  The foreign Letters are always in possession of a Committee of foreign Correspondence, & for some time heretofore have not as I have reason to beleive always made proper public appearance. This is unpleasant ground to walk on. I must retire from it, much former history should be recited, the State of parties introduced & other circumstances extremely disagreeable to me, in order to give you a tolerable understanding of matters alluded to.  I hope we shall recollect & still though late Act with becomingness towards your friend, his good sense & moderation will lead him to make a true judgement of Causes. If he were disposed to complain he could be at no loss for subjects of a much older date than the one before us.  With respect to Monsr. Lanuville I shall have no peace till he is disposed of, he asks for a yes or no but poor Gentleman he has discovered a mortal aversion to the latter. Congress are not disposed to   gratify his demand immediately & I have intimated as much to him & recommended his attending General Gates in a State of probation pointing to the example of the Inspector general.(4) What will be his resolve I can't tell but if I judge rightly he will not immediately succeed in his expectations-or rather demands.  We long to hear from Camp hoping a confirmation of accounts Just Reported here as from the City.  You will find inclosed with this two papers with my Name subjoined The proclamation is the most horrible botchery & verbosity that ever was seen.(5) It was introduced & passed in a moment when Men were impatient for adjourning & I can't persuade the Gentleman whose Cookery it is to reconsider-a word by the bye which in public proceedings I am not a friend to. It encourages rash determinations & impedes business-but Adieu. I am called upon by a variety of business.  ""

You seem to have fallen in with the general opinion that immediate Peace is to be the consequence of the Treaty of Paris the 6th February-and as a Man of Modesty & diffident of his own judgement, it would become me to be, at least, silent, but I know who I speak to, a Man of honor & experience in the World, who will always receive a freind's sentiment & judge of it with Candor-tis mine, that we are not to roll down a green Bank & toy away the ensuing Summer. There is blood much blood in our prospect-& in all appearance Sir, I mean all appearance in my view, there will be opportunity & incitement to unsheath your Sword. Britain will not be humored by a stroke of Policy-she will be very angry, & if she is to fall, her fall will be glorious. We, who know Sir, ought to be prepared-a powerful Army MAY 11, 1778  in our own field may, I should say, will, be the only means of securing an honorable peace.  If we universally adopt & indulge the Idea of Peace, it would be presumptuous in me to intimate to a Gentleman of Baron Stuben's experience-what probably will be the consequences. I am desirous of banishing from the minds of the people the assurance, even the hope, of a Peace the present Year.  'Tis impracticable for me, from a want of time, to be so Copious upon this subject, as the subject seems to require, but Sir to you-a word is sufficient.  I have a Letter from Capt.

The inclosed pamphlet I t[ake to] be a production of Dr. Franklin. It is well written, and was published first in Holland. When it began to make a noise, the B. Minister procured its suppression, but this, as usual, raised the public curiosity and procured it additional Readers. We have translated it here, and omitting one or two paragraphs that are not now true, it will be published next ueek in the Gazette of this place.(2) The reasons are good and may be well used in these States to support public credit. Suppose you were to have a translation published by way of supplement to our Virginia Gazettes?  My heart is so bent upon the success of our Country that it grieves me extremely to hear a probability of measures being adopted that I am sure will injure us. I am told that application will be made to this Assembly to revoke Monsr. Loyeautes commission from the last. Is it possible that such an application can be attended to? Thus to treat a Gentleman of unquestioned ability, of reputation in France, and after we have applied to that Court to obtain leave for his longer residence among us than his furlough permitted!

  Dear Duer Monday Evening [May 11, 1778] (1) Livingston is so ill he can't attend Congress. Monsr. La Neuville is kept in dilatory attendance.(2) The half Pay cannot be postponed (for now we are the Postponers) beyond To Morrow Morning. Tell Morris his Portugueze Affair is settled much against the wishes of his  MAY 12, 1778  Eastern Friends.(3) I could not get the Papers till last Night and this Morning I did the needful whereupon the delay was not chargeable on his and your, Friend, Gouvr. Morris.  The above is a Copy of a Letter written two Hours ago delivered to Duer who unfortunately arrived in Town without you very contrary to my Expectations. James Smith assures him that his worthy Colleague Jonathan B Smith hath absolutely declared off upon the Half Pay Business. Clingan is of the true Eastern Stamp and Clay. I need say no more when you know that Massachusetts is against us except that Hall is daily expected from Georgia and some of the Un true Blues from New Hampshire. Think one Moment and come here the next. My respectful remembrances wait on Mrs Morris. I send somewhat for your Evenings Amusement.  Adieu, Yours sincerely, Gouvr. Morris [P.S.] The Question for referring the half pay Establis't to the States cannot be deferr'd longer than to Morrow. Pensilvania being at present against us it will be carried to refer it to the States, which will defeat the Measure.(4) When I have mentioned this I am sure I need not add any thing more to induce you to be here by Eleven o'Clock to Morrow.

In addition to his vote on the half-pay issue on May 13, the journals also record his votes on two other issues on May 14 and 15, but two private letters he wrote on May 16 and 17 bear a Manheim place line.

  My dear Brother York in Pennsylva. 12 May 1778 Your favors of Octr. 24, Decr. 6, 8, & 19 by Capt. Young and Mr. Deane came safe to hand and deserve my thanks on many accounts, but on none more than for the care you have taken, and propose to take of my dear Son Ludwell. Under your kind protecting hand I hope he will be reared to much use both public and private. I approve altogether of your designs respecting him. It grieves me extremely to hear of the indolence and extravagence of my son Thom. They are qualities the direct reverse of those that must carry him thro life, if he passes with honor and ease to himself. I hope his Uncle Alderman's attention to him, and your advice, with wllat I have written him will work a change. It is witll infinite pain that I inform you our dear brother of Belleview (1) departed this Life on the 13 of April last after sustaining a severe Rheumatic fever for 6 weeks. Dr. Steptoe attended him the whole time, and I was also with him. Both public and private considerations render the loss most lamentable. He had  MAY 12, 1778  been just appointed one of our five Judges of the General Court, in which station he was well qualified to clo his Country eminent service. He has left behind him a numerous little family (7 cllildren) and a very disconsolate Widow. It is not necessary now to say much about {Deane}.(2) His {recall} which I now rejoice at will prevent all future {machinatiolls} from him, at least in {Europe} and himself as well as all others shall be well attended to here. Our friend Mr. Adams wllo {succeeds Deane} is a wise and worthy Whig who will not {form cabals} for any private sinister purpose. I adsise you to {cultivate} his {friendship}. Congrcss has now resolved the same for the support of their Commissioners at Madrid, Vienna, Berlin & Tuscany as for those at Paris, and they are authorised to draw bills of exchange on the Commissioner or Commissioners that may be at Paris for the money they want to defray their expences.(3) This makes each {independent} and will, for a time at least, render it unnecessary to send particular remittances to those places in the way of Commodities. You may be assured that Congress are ready and willing to send powerful remittances to Europe in the way of commodities; but the attempt now would be only supplying the enemy, wllose Cruisers are so numerous on our Coast and in our Bays, that almost every Vessel is taken. When a war with France and Spain shall take place, the numerous Ships of England will find some other employment than bending their whole force against us. Then it will be in our power to make the remittances we wisll to make. Congress has not yet taken up the consideration of appointing another Commissioner. Wllen they do, I think there can be no objection to the Gentlenlan you recommend or that lle shotlld be appointed to Spain.(4) Gen. Burgoyne has leave to return to England upon parole, but his Army is detained until the Court of London shall notify to Congress their ratification of the Convention of Saratoga. The detention of this Army u as founded partly on the reasons you assign, and for other powerful ones which Burgoyne himself furnished us with. In the inclosures which our public letter contains you will see the reasons more at large. I am very happy to be able to observe to you, that the Ullalterable attachment of Congress to Independence is clearly evidenced by their resolutions upon Ld. Norths insidious bills of pacification some days before they had any notice of the Treaty with France. I think you may make a good use of this with those who may doubt our firmness. We have now no danger but what may arise from our {funds}. Necessity has made our {paper emissions} very large, and may render it indispensable that a solid support shd. be derived from {specie}. Therefore {loans} from {Europe} are necessary, and the desires of Congress on this head demand great attention. New Orleans is so removed from us, and so situated, as to make the dif-  ficulty of getting anything from thence very great, that the Havannah would answer much better. The English Ships have taken and destroyed so many French & some Spanish Vessels the last winter and spring upon our Coast, that it appears to me upon every principle of policy unwise for these powers to keep their Marine force unemployed, whilst the whole active Naval force of England is warring upon their Commerce. That part of it at least, which approaches our Shores. I should be glad to know the particulars of Mr. Elliot's theft of your papers.(5) If you can contrive me any valuable new publications in England I shall be glad to have them, and I pray you not to forget an annual supply of Jesuits Bark for we have very little here. I have yet received only 8 pounds of what you formerly mentioned, but I thank you greatly for this. God bless and preserve you.  Richard Henry Lee.  [P.S.] The British Army have been closely confined in Philadelphia this winter. It is yet there, our Army is daily growing stronger both in numbers and discipline, and we expect soon to begin offensive operations against them. My brother Frank and myself, are both of us eligible to Congress for three years to come; our brother appears inclinable to quit the service, but it shall depend upon my Country whether I do so or not until I see a proper peace upon proper principles.(6) - R.H.L.

  Sir 13th May [1778] I had the honor of writing to you the 21st Ultimo by Messenger Brown.  I have remarked in Congress some difficulties which have arisen upon applications for Money on Account of the Clothier general said to be intended for discharging the debt contracted by you for the purchase of Clothing on public Account.(1) Possibly no obstacle would have been thrown in as a Bar to payment of a Stated account directly from your self, or as I should say from Messrs. Otis & Andrews. It is not necessary to account for causes of the demurs which have happened. Therefore waving an enquiry give me leave to recommend to you to transmit an Account of all your expenditures & engagements opposed by all the Sums you have received & drawn for, Strike the balance & either draw for such Balance or desire it may be remitted to you & from the Justice of Congress & their readiness to pay every fair account you will meet no farther disappointment.(2) If your Vouchers are not too bulky send them, if they are, Note at the foot of your Account that if required you will transmit the whole or produce them for inspection to any person authorized for that purpose by Congress. It may be proper to give some account of the thin & ordinary Clothing which have been produced in Congress, how the imposition upon you happened & why you had been obliged to submit to it.  My regard for the Honor of Congress & my Esteem for a Gentleman who, as I judge from the tenor of his whole conduct, has acted the part of a faithful Steward to the public has induced the present interposition.

  My Dear Sir, York, in Pennsylva. 13th May 1778 Our public letter (1) does not leave me much to add, but friendship will not suffer me to let this opportunity pass, without expressing my wishes to congratulate you on your safe arrival in France. You will find our affairs at your Court in a much more respectable Train than they have been heretofore, and therefore no doubt more agreable to you. Finance seems now the only rock upon which we have any danger of splitting. How far European loans may help us you can judge, but I fear that the slow operation of Taxes, which indeed are pretty considerably pushed in many States, will not be adequate to the large emissions of paper money which the war compels us to make. The number and activity of the British Cruisers on the coast, and in the Bays of the Staple States, render it utterly impossible with any degree of safety, and therefore very unwise, to attempt making remittances to Europe at present. It is in fact furnishing the enemy with what they want extremely, and much to our injury. Surely the Court of France will now give protection to their Commerce to and from America, the clearest policy demands it. Sir you would be greatly surprised at the number and value of the French Vessels taken and destroyed by the English on our Coasts this last winter and spring. Thus the Marine force of G.B. is actively employed in ruining the Commerce of France, while her powerful Navy remains unemployed. Can this be wise? Gen. Howe remains yet in Philadelphia, and our Army where it was, but daily growing stronger in discipline and in numbers. I am inclined to think that the enemy will this Campaign act chiefly on the defensive (carrying on the small war to plunder and distress) holding all they can in order to get the better bargain of us wl1en a Treaty shall take place. I wish, for the sake of future peace, that we could push these people quite off this Northern Continent. Monsr. Beaumarchais by his Agent Monsr. Francy has demanded a prodigious sum from the Continent for the Stores &c furnished the States. His accounts are referred for settlement to the Commissioners at Paris,(2) and I hope they will scrutinize most carefully into this business, that the public may not pay a large sum wrongfully. We have been repeatedly informed that the greater part of these Stores were gratuitously furnished by the Court of France. Holv then does it come to pass that a private person, a mere Agent of the Ministry, should now demand pay for the whole? It will give me singular pleasure to hear from you by all convenient opportunities, for I am dear Sir, with great sincerity your affectionate humble servant, Richard Henry Lee MAY 14, 1778  P.S.

  Gentlemen York Town May 14th 1778 Our Affairs have now a universally good appearance. Every thing at home and abroad seems verging towards a happy and permanent period. We are preparing for either War or Peace; for altho we are fully perswaded that our Enemies are wearied, beaten and in dispair, yet we shall not presume too much on that beliei, and the rather, as it is our fixt determination to admit no terms of Peace, but such as are fully in Character with the dignity of Independant States and consistent with the Spirit and intention of our alliances on the Continent of Europe.  We believe, and with great reason too, that the honor and fortitude of America, have been rendered suspicious, by the Arts, intrigues and specious misrepresentations of our Enemies. Every proceeding and Policy of ours has been tortured to give some possible colouring to their assertions of a doubtful dlsposition in America as to her perserverance in maintaining her Independance; and, perhaps, the speeches of several of the Minority in both houses of the English Parliament, who seemed to persist in the possibility of a reconciliation, might contribute towards that Suspicion. We, at this time, feel ourselves particularly happy in being able to shew from the accidental arangement of Circumstances, such as we could neither have policy to foresee or power to alter, that the disposition of America on that head was fixt and final. For a proof of this we desire your attention to the following.  The English Ministry appear to have been very industrious in getting their two conciliatory Bills (even before they had been once read) over to America as soon as possible, the reason of which haste  MAY 14, 1778  we did not then foresee, but the arrival of your dispatches since with the Treaties have unriddled the Affair. General Howe was equally industrious in Circulating them by his emissaries thro' the Country; Mr Tryon at N York did the same, and both those Gentlemen sent them under sanction of a flag to Genl Washington, who immediately sent the first he received to Congress. Mr. Tryon's Letter whicl covered them, and General Wasllington's answer thereto, you will find in Hall's and Seller's Gazette printed at York town May 2d.  Those Bills are truly unworthy the attention of any National Body; but lest the Silence of Congress should be misunderstood, or furnish the Enemy with New Ground for false insinuation, they were instantly referred to a Committee of Congress, whose judicious and spirited report thereon was unanimously approved by the House Spril 22d & published and circulated thro' the several States with all possible expedition.(1)  The dispatches in charge of Mr. Dean did not arrive till the second of May, eight days after the said reports were publislled; and his expedition in bringing the dispatches to Congress, prevented any Intelligence arriving before him. Inclosed are the reports referred to, to which we recommend your attention in making them as public as possible in Europe, prefacing them with such an explanatory detail of Circumstances as shall have a tendency to place the Politics of America on the firm basis of National honor, Integrity and fortitude.  We admire the true Wisdom and dignity of the Court of France, in her part of the Construction and Ratification of those Treaties; they have a powerful and effectual tendancy to dissolve that narrowness of mind which mankind have been too unhappily bred up in. In those treaties we see the Politician founded on the Philosopher, and harmony of affections made the ground Work of mutual Interest. France by her open Candor has won us more powerfully than any reserved treaties could possibly bind us, and at a happy Juncture of Times and Circumstances laid the seeds of an eternal freindship.  It is from an anxiety of preserving inviolate this cordial union so happily begun that we desire your particular attention to the 11th and 12th Articles in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. The unreserved Confidence of Congress in the good disposition of the Court of France will sufficiently appear by their having unanimously ratified those treaties, and then trusted any alterations or amendments to mutual negociation afterwards. We are apprehensive that the general and extensive tenor of the 12th Article may in future be misunderstood, or rendered inconvenient or impracticable, and, in the end, become detrimental to that friendship we wish ever to exist; To prevent which, you will herewith receive instructions and authority for giving up on our Part the whole of the 11th Article proposing it as a Condition to the Court of France, that they, on their part, give up the  whole of the 12th Article, those two being intended as reciprocal Ballances to each other.(2)  It is exceedingly distressing to Congress to hear of misconduct in any of the Commanders of Armed Vessels under the American flag. Every authentic information you can give on this head will be strictly attended to and every Means taken to punish the offenders and make reparation to the Sufferers. The Chief consolation we find in this disagreeable business, is that the most Experienced States have not always been able to restrain the Vices and irregularities of Individuals Congress has published a Proclamation for the more effectually suppressing and punishing such Practices.(3) But we are rather inclined to hope that as the line of Connection and friendship is now Clearly marked and the minds of the Seamen relieved thereby from that unexplainable Mystery respecting their real prizes which before embarrassed them that such irregularities will be less frequent or totally cease; to which end, the magnificent Generosity of the Court of France to the owners of the Prizes which \""for reasons of State\"" had been given up will happily contribute.

The decided part which his most Christian Majesty has at length taken in our cause must greatly influence other Crowned Heads in Europe not immediately allied to Britain, to desire a portion in our Friendship and Commerce, and must prepare the way for your welcome reception at the Court of Tuscany. We are pleased to find that you have formed a Connection with one who promises to be so friendly to your Commission as your correspondent the favorite minister of the grand Duke; and we think you could not have done better than in following his past advice.  The enclosed resolve of Congress of the 7th Instant will remove any doubts about your support which may have arisen in your mind from an omission on our part, which did not occur to us untill we had received a hint of it from the Gentlemen at Paris in their Letter of Feby 16th.(2)  Other papers herewith sent will convey to you a general Idea of our affairs; and we hope you will be particularly industrious to expose those attempts of our Enemies which are calculated to lead Europe to think we are not thoroughly fixed in our plan of independence. You may observe that we proceeded on the draughts only of two intended Bills which had been sent to America by the British Ministry. We should not have done this but from a conviction of insidious intentions founded upon former attempts to hurt our character abroad. We were so well satisfied of the spirit of these States to persevere in a noble cause that we should have waited for the Bills themselves, if we had not been anxiously attentive to the good opinion of Europe and the rest of the world. We were altogether stranger to the happy state of our affairs in France, accident and knavery having suppressed the Dispatches of our Friends; as our former Letters will prove, if any attempts shall be made to attribute our late determined conduct to a knowledge of our new alliance. Congress unanimously ratified the Treaties on the 4th and the people have showed their satisfaction wherever the knowledge of the proceeding has reached. The army also which is daily increasing in strength has expressed its Joy, and is now prepared either for honorable Peace or the continuance of the just war.  We shall indeavour to procure an enlargement of your powers, and shall immediately forward them to you.

We had before received your short Letter of the 11th of June, but are yet without that of the 29th of July, in which you had informed us \""at large of your Proceedings in Prussia.\"" (2) Its Contents would have proved highly agreable to us in those Months when we were quite uninformed of the Proceedings & Prospects of your Colleagues, at Paris. Impressed with a Sense of the Value of the King of Prussia's \""warmest Wishes for our Success\"" we give assurances of equal Wishes in Congress for that Monarch's prosperity. We have little Doubt of open Testimonies of his majesty's Friendship in Consequence of the late Decision of the King of France.  Your Information in Regard to our Connection with the fictitious House of Hortales & Co. is more explicit than any we had before received, but we further expect that all Mystery should be removed: Surely there cannot now be occasion for any, if there ever was for Half of the past.(3)  Our Commercial Transactions will very speedily be put under the Direction of a Board consisting of Persons not Members of Congress, it being impracticable for the same Men to conduct the deliberative MAY 14, 1778  and executive Business of the Continent now in its great Increase.  It has been next to impossible to make Remittances for many months from the Staple Colonies the Coasts of which have been constantly infested by numerous and strong Cruisers of the Enemy. We hope the Alliance of maritime Powers with us will remove our Embarrassments and give us Opportunity to carry into Effect our hearty Wishes to maintain the fairest commercial Reputation.  There will be great Impropriety in our making a different Settlement for the Supplies received from Spain from that which we make in Regard to those received from France. We are greatly obliged to the Friends who have exerted themselves for our Relief, and wish you to signify our Gratitude upon every proper Opportunity. But, having promised to make Remittances to Hortales for the prime Cost, Charges, Interest & usual mercantile Commission upon whatever is justly due to that House, we must keep the same Line with Gardoqui. On the one Hand, we would not willingly give Disgust by slighting princely Generosity, nor on the other submit to unnecessary Obligations.  The Unanimity with which Congress has ratified the Treaties with France and the general glad acceptance of the Alliance by the People of these States must shock Great Britain who seems to have thought no Cruelty from her would destroy our great Partiality in her Favor. What plan she will adopt in Consequence of her Disappointment Time only can discover. But, we shall aim to be in a posture either to negociate honorable Peace or continue this just War.  We stand in Need of the Advice and Assistance of all our Friends in the matter of Finance; as the Quantity of our Paper Currency necessarily emitted has produced a Depreciation which will be ruinous if not very quickly checked. We have encouraging Accounts of the Temper of the Hollanders of late and expect we may find Relief from that Quarter among others.

  Sir York Town 14 May 1778 Your favors of Novr. 24 and Decr. 18,(1) reached us only the 2d of this month with the letters of our friends at Paris from whom we had not received a regular packet for Eleven months.  You will readily conceive how much We wish to hear from you; and how very agreable your informations would have been at an earlier period. It is evident that You yourself were in a degree of doubt as to the conduct of France even after the Conference of our Commissioners in December; you will therefore be naturally led to give us due credit for the resolute manner in which We proceeded upon the two draughts of bills which the British Ministry had hurried over to America. Be assured we were unacquainted with the spirit of the French Court. The decisive part it has taken was really unexpected upon what accounts we had collected from travellers.  The dates of the papers herewith sent will enable you to put this matter in a clear point of view. The turn of affairs in Europe will make it needless for us to attempt the finesse of recruiting in Germany, which you hint at, and which would have a good effect in Case of necessity.(2) Doctor Lees letters make it quite probable that your Commission will prove successful at Berlin, and there appears the best agreement between the King of Prussia and the Emperor.  The enclosed resolve of Congress of the 7th Inst. will show their intentions with regard to your support, which was not properly attended to when your Commission was made out.(3)  Other papers herewith sent will give you a general idea of our situation. You may be assured that Independence is firmly adopted by the states; and the unanimity of Congress is truly emblamatic of all America. Nova Scotia has long ago expressed its wishes to be adopted by Us, and now afresh Solicits.(4) Canada will be greatly affected by the news of our alliance with its former parent state. In Short, Sir every thing which could be added to our own determina- MAY 14, 1778  tion of being free and independent is ensured by this eclairrissment of the Court of Versailles.  Our army is growing daily so that if we are to negotiate with Britain we shall do it in a proper posture. There are some reports of her drawing away her troops, that she may with a proper grace enter into parley. But this must be done without disguise, or no treaty can be held. For surely no one can suppose that we shall now give up a point which we had made a preliminary before we knew what powerful friendship was secured to us in Europe.  The powers which had been given to our Commissioners in France and our great Anxiety to keep perfect faith in Treaties induced a caution with regard to the powers given in after appointments which is now become unnecessary. Perfect equality being the basis of our present treaties without any exclusive privileges to France there can be no chance of discontent from the conclusion of similar treaties with other powers of Europe; therefore we shall doubtless soon forward to you more full powers than what were sent with your commission. As you seem to think it may be advantageous to have a cypher for correspondence we would propose the same which has been mentioned to Doctor Franklin formerly by Mr Lovell,(5) and this is the rather chosen because it may serve between the Doctor and you or any number of your friends taking a different key word for each.

  In Committee for foreign Affairs Gentlemen No. 8 York Town May 15 1778  Your pressing request for 5000 Hhds of Tobacco is a matter as embarrassing to Congress as to yourselves.(1) Their anxiety to get it to you is as great as yours to receive it. We have already lost considerable Quantities in the attempt and thereby furnished our Enemy, Gratis, with what was designed to discharge your Contracts with, and promote the Interest and Commerce of our Friends. We request your particular attention to this information. It is a matter of the highest moment to our allies as well as to ourselves. In the present State of things it is very probable that England will not interrupt the Trade of France in her own Bottoms, and our desire is, as well for her Benefit as ours, that France would open the Trade from her own Ports, so that the Intentional advantages of the Treaties may fully operate to both Countries. We need not enlarge on this head, as your own discernment and judgment will furnish you with all the reasons necessary therefor.  In addition to what is mentioned in our Letter No.____ (2) respecting the 11th & 12 Articles we observe that the 12th is capable of an interpretation and misuse which was probably not thought of at the Time of Constructing it, which is that it opens a door for all or a great part of the Trade of America to be carried thro the French Islands to Europe, and puts all future regulations out of our Power, either of Imposts or Prohibition, which tho' we might never find our Interest to use, yet it is the keeping those in our Power, that will hereafter enable us to preserve equality with, and regulate the Imposts of the Countries we trade with. The General Trade of France is not under the like restriction; every article on our part being staked against the single Article of Molasses on theirs. Therefore the Congress thinks it more liberal and consistent that both Articles should be expunged.  We have no material military Transactions to acquaint you with. The Enemy yet remain in Philadelphia, but some late movements make it probable they will not stay long. Our Army is yet at the Valley forge. The Enemy thro' the Course of the winter have carried on a low, pitiful, and disgraceful kind of War agst Individuals whom they picked up by sending out little parties for that purpose and revengefully burning several of their houses. Yet all this Militates  MAY 15, 1778  against themselves, by keeping up an inflamable Indignation in the Country towards them; and on the whole we know not which most to wonder at, their folly in making us hate them after their inability for Conquest and desires of Peace are confest, or their Scandalous barbarity in expressing their resentments.(3)  You will see, Gentlemen, by the Contract which the commercial Committee has signed with the Agent of Mr. Beaumarchais that Congress was desirous of keeping a middle Course, so as not to appear to slight any determined Generosity of the French Court, and at the same Time to show a Promptness to discharge honourably the Debts which may be justly charged against these States by any Persons.(4) We depend upon you to explain the affair fully, as you seem to make a Distinction between the military Stores & the other Invoices, while no such Distinction appears in the Letters of Mr. Deane & Mr. Beaumarchais. In short, we are rather more undetermined by your late Dispatches than we were by your long Silence.  Congress being at this Time deeply engaged in a Variety of pressing Business and the foreign Committee thin of Members you will be pleased to excuse us from being more particular in our Answer to your several Dispatches as well as in our Information of the State of our Affairs.  We are, Gentlemen, your very humble Servants,  Richard Henry Lee James Lovell P.S. You will see what we have written to Mr. Dumas, and will point out to us what will be our Line of Honour to him & Justice to these States.  ""

  My dear Sir 15 May 1778. I find it impossible to write to you at this Time so fully as I wish being greatly overplied with business from the neglect of others. I cannot however consent that Dispatches for France should go off without a line in Testimony of my personal attachment to you and in proof of remembrance of my promises, which kind of proof I have given 9 Times before since you left Boston. Ever more uneasy when Negociation was talked of than when fresh Troops were destined against us, I am not quite at ease now, though a powerful Alliance is formed in our favour with which the States are much pleased. I cannot be free from concern least the insidious arts of Britain should prevail to induce us to neglect the Oppertunity which is now offered to exterminate the Curses that yet remain on MAY 15, 1778  this Continent nested in three Capitals. I fear a temporary Cessation of Hostilities would ruin our best Prospects; when a month of vigorous Exertions wd. free us from the Enemy altogether. The same time spent in Negotiation under a suspension of Hostilities would familiarize the persons of our Foes to us, and give them the advantage of reviving our former feeling Attachments to Britain and to sow Discord and Division in Places where the Government is yet wanting a consistency to render it proof against tile Attack of an artful & designing Adversary. We owe Britain neither Love nor Money, but they owe us a vast Reparation. I have spoken here, without seeing, at present, the least opening for a negociation, but I felt haunted by the simple Idea of such a Thing.  A sort of half pay Establishment is made for the Officers and a grant of 80 Dollars for the .Men who shall continue to the end of the War, in Addition to former Encouragement. The Officers Provision will be either Life redeemable at six years Purchase or else for 6 years only absolute. The Soldiers 80 Dollars outright.(1)  Genl. Gates attended a Council in his way to PeeksKill, and the Plan of Opperations was settled with great Harmony and Unanimity. This is a good Opening, may the Close be answerable! (2)  Our little Navy is sadly destroyed but we have every natural Advantage for repairing our Losses. If it was not for the Justice of our Cause, no one could unravel the mystery of the manner in which we have so well supported ourselves against the most formidable naval Power in Europe. We have even made her afraid. As the Dispatch goes from the Eastward you will get news of your lovely family.

  My Dear Son 16th May 1778. I thank you for your favor of the 12th.(1) I still entertain a respectable opinion of the fortitude & prowess of our Enemy, nor do I doubt but that long before this day thousands of Monsr. Noailles Countrymen have had their heads broke for his sneer.(2) I need not characterize Englishmen to a Gentleman so well acquainted with the Nation & the history. Were you to retort, that of late they have had no Character, I acquiesce, & add, this is a principal part of it. I am not among those who think Englishmen will be bantered out of their wits, there is nothing galls them so much as the attempt & particularly when the taunts come from that quarter. I am glad of the alliance of France but it behoves us to look about us with Wisdom & firmness. We ought now to prepare for more serious contest than any we have experienced. If Great Britain has declared War against France the whole Nation will be engaged & the whole Nation is Mighty, their full power when exerted, & well directed, is almost Almighty. I am however more afraid of ourselves than I am of their allmightiness-afraid we shall lull our selves into a fatal security in the mistaken weakness  MAY 16, 1778  of Britain & Strength of our Ally. This excepted, & all my fears vanish. We shall do very well & not the worse for the alliance. General St. Clair I apprehend had mistaken the New Constitution of So. Carolina-you will have had better information from Mr. Drayton who I beleive was almost Father & Mother of that production; to make you a competent judge I transmit a Copy within the present Inclosure.  Monsr. Lanuville vexed me very seriously the other Evening, he brought your Certified Copy of General Washington's Letter (3) & in much warmth asserted \""it was not like the original-this had contained much warmer expressions in his favor.\"" I first mildly answered-he must certainly be mistaken-He persisted & warmly too. Sir! I replied, it is, it must be, a true Copy, I will Stake my honor & my life upon it. He retired in much seeming disgust. I sent for Mr. Nourse Secretary pro. tem at the War Office & between chiding for the repeated losses & miscarriages of public papers in that Office, & intreaties to search diligently for the Generals original relative to Monsr Lanuville, I prevailed on him at an unseasonable hour, not any such hour in my four & twenty to rummage, horrible Idea to rummage in an Office which ought to be accurate in all things. He succeeded, brought the Letter, I sent it immediately to the Gentleman Monsr Lanuville who returned a deep apology, which covered with blushes he repeated next Morning.  Congress must from necessity have done something for this Gentleman-because he had been detained here after he had asked only for a Yes, or a No, upwards of three Months. There was however more than a little Struggle. Under a droll resolution he is appointed Inspector of the Northern department, where he is to be on probation three Months & then considered according to merit.(4) As he is said to be a competent Soldier & appears active, no doubt he will obtain his wishes, to the hiegth of a Brigadier.  To Inadvertence & not to want of good will must be imputed a deficiency in Congress toward Colo. Ethan Allen. I shall remind the House this Morning to order him a supply of Money, in the mean time I intreat you in my Name offer him any sum he may require, obtain it of the Pay Master, or from any Body & I will remit immediately a Sum to reimburse.(5) Give me leave my Dear Son to ask if you live without Money or how you live. Tell me if there is any considerable alteration in fashions of Gentlemens' apparel & to take if I stand in need as much of your Scarlet as will make me a Coat.  God bless you &ca.  ""

The process will be a fitter subject for conversation, I shall not therefore attempt to trouble you with it at present. The original demand was unjust, its warmest advocates receded & shifted their ground, from time to time, compelled by the power of reasoning opposition. What is now Resolved might have been obtained on the 30th March,(1) but as I hope the pleasure of taking you by the hand in York I will only add that your conduct has lost you no ground in the esteem of your fellow Citizens.  Colo. Morgan wishes to see you & to accompany you to Fort Pitt.(2) You may be on the Road & this not meet you at Camp Why should I say more than repeating that I continue with great Regard, Dear Sir, your obedient humble servt, Henry Laurens  ""

  Dear Sir May 16th. 1778 As I hinted to you in my letter of yesterday, which goes by a different Vessel from what bears this, Half-pay for 7 years, if they live so long, is granted to the Officers who serve the War out. It was also resolved to give 80 Dollars to the Men in addition to their Land.  The Commissioners at the Courts of Tuscany, Vienna & Berlin are to have plenipotentiary Commissions and not to be restricted to 12 years Treaties of Amity & Commerce. They could only propose & treat but not conclude. I hope they will not be allowed to make Alliances. Great Caution indeed is to be used on that Point.(1) There is but one Power besides France that could tempt me, unless Minhaer (2) should incline.  I presume our Army will not immediately be reformed, the Battalions consolidated and the useless officers dismissed. He, as yr. namesake says, will soon put Things to rights, having been obliged to coax almost instead of order in times past. Our Soldiers deserve all praise for their perseverance in hunger & nakedness but the Genlmen (3) have taken improper times to move their schemes of Pension and, will you believe it, Nobility. Some, in a big House, think that there is no Objection to Titles when not hereditary: Does it not look well_______ ________ LORD chief Justice of DELAWARE.  It is reported that Mr. S.A. is coming forward. I assure you we who are here have had consummate drudgery day & night ever since you left us in November. Mr. D (4) is a very good man indeed. I wish he would consent to tarry but his Estate is continually destroyed by his Friends who are keeping his Enemies in order. I mean the Guards over Burgoynes troops. I hope Mr. Deane will come over. I mean I hope he will not throw himself out of use by resenting an Act of Congress founded on Necessity. I think he is peculiarly calculated for Holland if we have a Commissioner there. Howe is not gone from his command. It is reported that the Enemy are embarking their heavy Baggage. This if fact is no proof of their quitting. It may be a prudent preparative to coming out against us: a few days will make something certain. The Council which Gates attended in his way to Peekskill was finished with great unanimity of Sentiments and much Cordiality between the great men tho the latter was not expected from some foolish bickerings which had been raised out of Conways Indiscretion, whose Resignation has been accepted.  I wish you happiness and I think you have the Fund for it whether you are now in Paris or a Prisoner in England.  Give my love to your Son and tell him it is Matris Ergo, that he may try his talent at the Phrase, which teazed me in my Infancy. MAY 16, 1778  I hope soon to have from you Sic Canibus Catulos similis,(5) by way of Confession, and some Substitute, more adapted to my Experience than the Crepoctis of Tityrus, to mark your Sublimities. Be cautious, however, that you do not hint that you have seen any Thing Superior to Philadelphia; unless you are willing instantaneously to forfeit the great Portion you hold of Mrs. Clymars good Opinion.

  My dear Sally, York-Town, May 16th. 1778. Inclosed herewith you will receive an Address from Congress to the Inhabitants of the United States of America, and the Declaration of the Marquiss de Noailles, with all the news of the last week excepting some which I received from Mr. President Rodney & Captain Parry,(1) such as the capture of a sloop laden with wine, rum, sugar, porter, cheese and a large quantity of dry goods valued at £60,000; she stranded on Cape Henlopen the first of this month and was taken by Captain Parry under a heavy fire from an armed English schooner, but without having a man hurt; all the cargo is effectually secured; another company at Duck-creek has taken an armed schooner in Duck-creek with the Captain viz. Cook, two Lieutenants and the crew. There has been a great firing on Wednesday last at Busseltown, about eleven miles from Philadelphia, between General Maxwell & 1000 men, and a party of the enemy, the result not known.  MAY 16, 1778  The treaty with France is so favorable to the United States, & so much beyond what has been ever done on such like occasions in the world before, that in return I shall by virtue of my sovereign power, not only recognize the King of France as the most Christian, but also the most wise, most just, most generous and most magnanimous of Princes.  Now for some disagreeable intelligence. The Enemy, about a thousand in number, in row-gallies, flat-bottomed boats &c have been up at Bordentown, destroyed our frigates, row-gallies & all the vessels there, and burned Mr. Borden's house, the tavern he devised to Josey M:Kean, Mr. Hopkinson's and on the opposite shore all Mr Kirkbride's buildings.  I should be glad to hear from you by the way of Lancaster, and to know when you imagine the Boys will be ready to go to school. Goods are falling very fast-Coffee is retailed here, the very best, at 17/6, tho' it was 22/6 two weeks ago.  I am, my dear Sally, with love & kisses to the children, Your affectionate, Thos M:Kean  P.S. Yesterday the Officers in the army are allowed half-pay for seven years after the end of the present war. Colo. Francis Johnston upon my recommendation, and without his sollicitation or knowledge, is appointed Commissary-General of Prisoners in the stead of Mr. Boudinot, who has resigned in order to take his seat in Congress.(2)  ""

  Dear Papa, York 17th May 1778  I wrote to you the 14th instant a few lines just to inclose you the postscript to the Pena. Gazette of the 9th instant, which I now again send you together with Yesterdays gazette. I forgot to mention in my last that I have engaged Mr. Wilson, an eminent lawyer of Pena. who has lately removed into Maryd., in all my law business. He will attend our present provincial court; I wrote by him to Mr. Stone to put off our cause with Trammell. I have also engaged Stone in my law business, so that I think I have secured the two best lawyers that practice in our courts of law.  I am really concerned for the sudden death of poor Mr. Lux. He was useful public man, & his family will feel his loss. There has lately been a council of war at Camp of the Major Generals for concerting a plan of operations. I am informed a plan was unanimously agreed on: that our army is in good health & spirits, & increasing fast. Last Friday Gen. Lee went to camp to take a command in the army. He has applied to Congress to be made a Lieutenant General; he told me before he wrote his letter, that he should write to Congress for that promotion, & asked my opinion about it; I told him I should oppose his promotion; he seemed chagrined & nettled at my frankness, or with my opinion, which I am determined to abide by for more reasons than one. Congress has unanimously agreed to allow the officers 7 years half pay from the end of the war, as a compensation for their hard services, and the depreciation of our currency. I am told half Joes which before the news of the treaty with France, & Ld. North's speech, sold for £24 paper are now hawked about at £12 & £8. I do not however perceive that the price of commodities at or near this place has fallen.  Pray inform me whether the fruit has suffered by the frost which we had about ten days ago. How goes on the vineyard? Do the vines seem to thrive, & do they promise much fruit?  Monday 18th May P.M. This day's post brought no letters from you; which surprises and gives me no little uneasiness, as I know your punctuality in writing. I hope to God you are all well. This morning arrived at Congress from Boston Capt. Courter, late commander of the Oliver Cromwell privateer. He sailed from Corunna in Spain the 10th of March in a French frigate of 40 guns called the Neptune & MAY 17, 1778  brought duplicates of the treaty, which was brought over by Mr. Dean. I have the pleasure to inform you that the Dean frigate, Capt. Nicholson, & a 20 gun ship part of the fleet expected from France are arrived the one at Por[t]smouth the other at Boston. Docr. Cooper of Boston writes to Mr. Lovel a member of Congress of the 6th instant that most of the fleet expected from France were safely arrived, & Capt. Courter told me the day he left Boston several vessels were coming into port, so that in all probability all the expected supplies of cloathing &c &c will get safe to hand. This is great & glorious news. We were very uneasy respecting the fate of our little fleet which consisted of about 10 or 11 sail, and which sailed from France very late in February.  I am at loss to account for you not writing to me by the last post. I form a thousand conjectures; perhaps your letter may have been mislaid. I hope you are all well; if that was not the case, I am sure you would send off an express for me, that is Sam with horses to bring me home. Give my affectionate love to Molly. I hope she is much better than when She wrote to me last. My love to Mrs. Darnall & the little ones.  By late accounts from the Camp our army is encreasing fast. God grant you a long continuance of health. I am, Yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S. I forgot to mention that Docr. Franklin was presented to the King of France in form the 20th of March and most graciously recd. The King of France has appointed an Ambassador to these States, and a Committee was this day named for fixing the ceremonial of his reception. I am one of the Committee. Mr. Carmichael is arrived at Boston in the fleet above mentioned from France.  In Congress 19th May. Gen. Mifflin has recd. a letter from Col. Biddle containing the following articles of intelligence-vizt that the Enemy have embarked their heavy cannon, that the stalles for their cavalry are compleated; that the Tories of Pha. have hired houses in N. York, in short from every appearance we may soon expect to see Pha. abandoned by the Enemy. It is said Gen. Howe is returned; he probably met when he got to the capes of Delaware with counter orders. We expect every hour dispatches from our General; but if it be true that that this day he will move towards Pha. he will too busy to write.  A hot press has lately taken place in Pha.

  Gentlemen. Sunday Noon 17th May 1778.  Your Petition to Congress under a Cover directed to me, this moment came to hand. The little Lad who brought it discovers some anxiety to return immediately-for this reason & also because I believe his Stay here is not necessary I shall detain him no longer than while I assure you, your Petition shall be presented at the earliest meeting of Congress tomorrow.(1)  Congress is already apprized of the alarming attempts of our Enemies by means of their Savage Allies & we are adopting proper measures for defeating all their hellish Machinations. Great Britain now convinced of the impossibility of subduing these United States, is endeavouring to distress them by such extravagant Acts in predatory War as will Stain the annals of history with marks of Infamy & disgrace upon that once Magnanimous people. Their Soldiers are, as often as they can Steal abroad, making incursions near the Banks of Delaware, burning Houses, captivating, & too often murdering, such Men as they can lay hold of, leaving helpless Women & Children exposed to suffer all the hardships arising from the loss and absence of heads of families & the total destruction of their Habitations, apparel, furniture & provision. They have even improved upon the lessons learned from their Indian Consorts.  Their measure is nearly filled up, the hand of Vengeance directed by God himself will speedily overtake them.  Let each of us by proper spirit & becoming exertions in our respective spheres strive to be an happy Instrument of Providence.  I send in the Present Packet an Address of Congress to the Inhabitants of these States.  A paper containing such parts of the late Treaties between France & the United States of America as are judged necessary for public information.  And also an hand Bill in which is set forth important intelligence from the Courts of France & England.  General Sir Wm. Howe embarked as I am well informed last Tuesday & left Sir Henry Clinton his successor in Command at Philadelphia. If we will act with Wisdom & fortitude in every quarter, Sir Henry will soon be compelled to follow the other hopeless Knight.

  Dear Sir, 17th May [1778] The very Morning Colonel Gambit left York I sent to the Board of War an extract from your Letter respecting Colonel Armand & desired Monsr. Lomagne to attend the Board until a plan shall be digested & a Report made to Congress.(1) This I esteem the most eligible & most expeditious mode for bringing the purpose to effect. Your Excellency may rely on my good will & utmost endeavors but such crowds of important business now lie before Congress, increasing every Morning as almost forbid my hopes of introducing this in a few days.  I have not been able to collect one more French paper in addition to those few sent by Colonel Gambit. Mr. Lovel gave me the strongest assurances those were all he was possessed of or knew where to collect. I will keep my attention very closely to future importations  Congress having finished after long labour, in a very few Lines, the scheme of gratuity for officers, Non Commissioned Officers & Soldiers of the Army; the general arrangement comes next under consideration, this work will be prepared by Mr. Govr.

  Dear Sir, 17th May [1778] My last private is dated the 1st Inst. & forwarded by Messenger Cross since which I have been honoured with your Excellencys favors of the 13th & 18th April as acknowledged in a public Address of the 14th Inst.  I presented & read these to Congress as public & received great satisfaction from the attention which has paid to the whole & not less from the applause generally expressed upon particular articles. Men are pleased with instances of watchfulness over the public Stock even when they are not themselves half so attentive to expenditures as they ought to be.  As Your Excellency's Letters are Committed, & the Merits of course are to undergo the consideration of Congress, it would be improper in me to decide on any part. I shall therefore speak to a few points in general terms without pretending higher authority than my own.  The insurrections in our State & the affected Invasion upon Georgia were alarming, but I apprehend the whole appearance of danger has vanished before this day. The policy of St. Augustine, 'tis probable, led them to threaten, in order to avert a stroke which in their own weak state they dreaded at home.(1) 'Tis to be lamented that another Season is lost in which we ought to have removed the Enemy from that Quarter. I do not see at present any ground for apprehensions of a preconcerted Plan for attacking So. Carolina in front; we ought nevertheless to be continually prepared, guarded & watchful, this has been my sentiment from the earliest date of the War, & I have not lost the Idea of our receiving a brush from the tail of that Comet which has spread flames in these northern States. The Scotch are indeed exceedingly zealous in raising Troops but these must supply deficiencies in the Numbers expected from Germany & will be wanted there or in the West Indies. The Enemy cannot be ignorant of the value of So Carolina & Georgia, & will assuredly call upon them at a leisure day; a persuasion of this fact on our part will lead us into such measures for defence & safe retreat as will render the work more arduous on theirs.  One branch we ought to be most especially attentive to, it is absolutely necessary to be jealous of every stranger & of every doubtful Character in the State, particularly so, in the Capital & other Sea Ports.  If it were possible to procure a person, or more than one person whose business should be unknown to each other, to discover the errand of every Master of Vessel & of every Stranger coming in to our Country no expence would be too great for the purpose; Where bosoms are found impenetrable much discovery may be made by  MAY 17, 1778  incessant watchfulness day & night upon external movements. There has been & is an universal laxity in Government from this, to the remotest Sothern State which has afforded the Enemy much of their powers for distressing us. It would seem as if we had not felt our own dignity & importance or as if we were not in earnest. New Jersey & New York driven to extreme distress environed by & almost incorporated with them have been necessitated to watchfulness. The Eastern States preserve a policy of their own; in all respects they take good care of themselves, I am not among those who censure. I am grieved that we content ourselves with censuring & do not imitate them. From this State to Georgia there has been much foul play by Men of fair faces, hence the Enemy has drawn large succors of provision, Men, & Intelligence. To expatiate upon this head to Your Excellency would be waste of time, If we believe the fact, my aid will not be required to point out means for the remedy.  I will barely repeat that it appears necessary to keep a watchful Eye on every one, & add, particularly so, upon Men from among those who in bulk are our friends the Bermudians & Bahamians. Some of the former have sold their friendship for us, for British Gold & injured our Cause exceedingly. Was there ever a deeper scheme than the project of Arthur yet we are indebted for the discovery to his folly not to our sagacity, & I have yet some doubts of our holding him a prize.  When I look back to the precipice on which I have been Standing & on which my Country, more valuable than ten thousand I's, had been tottering all the past Winter, I shudder. Had the British General been a Man of Enterprize, Congress would have been on ship Board & Sir William Howe in quiet possession of York Town & of Albany. He could not be ignorant of our circumstances but our safety lay in Mrs. Lowry's lap.(2)  All the dangers to which we have been exposed were the effects of that languor in the Quarter which I have described, & so is the waste & misapplication of Millions of Money & loss of thousands of Men by death & desertion. If we are eventually delivered & without many more rude strokes, we shall have to regret that we are more indebted to the selfish views of deep politicians out of the limits of these States, than to the Wisdom & fortitude within, but while we continue to be in danger of such strokes is not it sir, our indispensible duty to be watchful on all sides, & in every place to guard against them?  I have my suspicions that a narrow inspection would discover the Board of War's expectations of Stores at Charles Town are not without foundation.(3) But suspicions are not proof. This must be produced by scrutiny, if anybody will take the necessary trouble.  Had your Excellency known in what manner we had just before treated your worthy predecessor's Certificates for money advanced in  So. Carolina for public services, you would have been more cautious of draining our private Treasury. I had intimated when the draughts were given to Mr. Rose on the Loan Office that there was no Money there & that consequently the Bills would not be paid. I was really affected by the item of advance made on that account although made with the best intentions & my duty obliges me to add that more than one Member on the floor expressed dissatisfaction with the practice of advancing Money from a particular Treasury On general Account without special order. This was indeed rather applied to the advance made to the Commercial Agent. I was well pleased with the hint, persuaded in my own mind Your Excellency will not insist upon a second.(4)  The taking up loan Office Certificates for raising Money seems to be very displeasing; If Money lenders will not deposit in that fund because of the low Interest, can a Negotiation in Trade be effected without a vast discount? Whatever this discount may be, it is kept out of Sight by laying the loss on the purchase. I refer only to the practice in this part of the Union.  It has been asserted in Congress that a gainful infamous traffic has been carried on by some of our numerous hosts of honest Servants, by means of loan office Certificates, which have been, as they impudently pretended, passed for ready money; but the prices of articles produced by them were enhanced 25 to 50 Per Cent to the emolument of the contracting parties, I say sir, this has been asserted, & in a land abounding with practices of peculation & sacrilegious Robberies of public Money I find no difficulty in beleiving it, hence appears in another veiw the necessity for watchfulness. If the Evil had stopped in the instances alluded to, the loss would have been confined, but a door once opened to advanced prices corruption becomes contagious, pervades every branch of Commerce, calls for extra Millions, depreciates the value of our Money, & threatens bankruptcy. There can be no doubt of the payment of Interest Money in Bills of Exchange in terms of the past resolves of Congress, but this is another Evil to be deprecated for the future. An attempt to renew this mode of Payment will be made, I shall as I did the former, oppose it with all my might Some gentlemen now see the pernicious effects & acknowledge the justness of my predictions but when Men are Interested, their Sight fails on one side & continues extremely clear in the sinister view.  Some shrewd remarks I learn have been made on the charge of our State account for the expence of the expedition against the Cherokees, it has been said, that Gentlemen were pleased with it, the Land Ceded by the Savages must of course be held as common property. The intimation came to me indirectly, through one of my Colleagues; at a proper time I shall be under no difficulty to find as proper an answer -precedent & Confederation will assist me. My Stated avocation will   not spare me time for inspecting minutely, but I am pleased to learn that every charge which had been apparently incurred for the general weal is introduced, I am under no doubt but our utmost intent will be fully countenanced.  With respect to the little explanation between your Excellency & Genl. Moultrie it is sufficient to intimate that under the Resolve of Congress of the 9th Febry Governor Livingston Weeded out a number of useless & pernicious Officers in the State of New Jersey, among others a Dep. Qur. Master general, exactly a Case in point, for which I have once returned His Excellency the thanks of Congress-& shall repeat the same tomorrow.  Your Excellency's refusing to grant Money before an account of the expenditure of former grants had been rendered has been marked with particular approbation, more of this will probably appear in the Report of the Committee, had Congress themselves given the example two years ago millions would have been saved-we are but beginning-& seem rather disposed to put the labouring Oar into other hands but 'tis a momentous concern, in which each state is Interested & in which each executive in my humble opinion is in Duty bound seriously to interpose all their powers. It would take up the remainder of the Night were I to enlarge on this head by adducing Cases to prove the necessity for watchfulness over the public Stewards in every branch of expenditure meaning no imputation upon the Gentleman checked by your Excellency.  The Sale of the General Moultries prize in a Dutch port is an Excellent prognostick of determinations at the Hague respecting these United States.(6) Poor old England, first cheat herself & now she will find she is bamboozled by all her Neighbors.  Within this packet your Excellency will find an hand Bill containing the sarcastical declaration of the Ducke de Noailles to the Court of London of His Master's alliance with the United States of America, which may possibly be new at Charles Town.  Two days ago I transmitted an Act of Congress to the Governor of New Jersey & President of this State for conducting the Honorable John Penn & B. Chew, from the place of their confinement in the former to any place within the latter & there to release them from their parole when they will become amenable to the Law requiring all the Inhabitants to take an Oath of Allegiance & Abjuration & may make their election. 'Tis suggested by some Gentlemen they will take the Oaths & save their Estates.  Your Excellency will read in the Connecticut paper the spirited reply of Govr. Trumbull to Mr. Tryon. This haughty Quondam must have suffered extreme mortification from the retorts upon his Certificates & empty Bills.(7) The Tories & Indians instigated at Detroit are become very trouble  some, the latter have committed many cruel Murders & Struck a panic upon the Inhabitants of the Western frontier, measures are adopted for giving these wretches employment at home but we have really been tardy, & much more mischief will be done before they meet a rebuff. The other Allies of Great Britain had affected Government, established a Mock Congress & Issued Money, nine of these I am told have been hanged at Fort Pitt & I saw pass by my Window this Evening about thirty in Irons. No Stone is left unturned, no cruelty unessayed, by our grand Enemy for distressing us. Predatory War in all its horrors is carried on by British Officers & Soldiers upon the Banks of Delaware, as often as they can steal abroad. They burn Houses, Captivate & too often Murder such Men as they can catch, leave helpless Women & Children to suffer all the miseries arising from the loss of heads of families & the total destruction of their habitations, apparel, furniture & provision, improving even upon the lessons taken from their Savage Consorts.  We are told & beleive that Sir William Howe embarked at Philadelphia on Tuesday last, & left Sir H. Clinton successor in Command. From a new proposition made by Sir William some fourteen days since for Exchange of Prisoners, from the vast quantity of Fire Wood which the British Soldiers have cut for exportation, from the embarkation of many families who had remained in the City when we came out, & several other circumstances, an opinion that all the Troops will speedily evacuate & burn it prevails. I feel all this as conjecture. If General Clinton really means to leave us, he covers his design by a mighty bustle in preparations for the field. It is probable he waits for orders which will follow a declaration of War. The expected Commissioners are not yet arrived, this circumstance gives further scope for conjecture.  Doctor Franklin was presented on the 10th March to his Most Christian Majesty & now protector of the Rights of Mankind in the Character of Ambassador plenipotentiary from the United States of America & was most graciously received. The King at the same time named an Ambassador from his Court to the United States. This circumstance has given a little fillip to Congress.(8) After living eight Months in a State somewhat below my Overseers in Carolina, we Talk of a Table; a Committee is appointed for the purpose & I am ordered upon it.(9)  General Washington's Army, as a friend of mine informs me, is amazingly advanced in discipline by the indefatigable attention & great Military abilities of Baron Stuben now a Major General;(10) by a late return it was 14000 Strong, actual Combatants, & Men are daily increasing that Number, but desertions keep it down.  General Gates is about this day arrived at Fish Kill where he is to take upon him the whole Northern department, I have a Letter from   that worthy Man in which he assures me the grand Council lately held at Valley forge had been conducted with perfect harmony & that he entertained the most favorable hopes from the plan concerted; hence I infer with the highest pleasure, he had a Cordial meeting & parting with the General & trust he will hereafter be aware of designing flatterers.(11) General Burgoyne must now be far advanced toward the place where he may end his progress by a sudden stroke before his departure. With great reluctance & not without great murmuring, he paid the Agents appointed by Major General Heath 94000 Dollars in solid Coin for the fuel supplied the British Troops last Winter, Transports are gone round to Boston to return the provision which those Troops consumed, in quantity & quality.  We are now taking Measures for obtaining strong proofs of prevailing Reports, that the Convention of Saratoga was broken on the part of Great Britain, & I am particularly desired by Congress to request your Excellency will without delay, cause an enquiry to be made of Captain Senf lately arrived in Charles Town respecting the Colours & Military Chest, & to transmit such intelligence by a faithful & expeditious Courier as may be received from that Gentleman.(12)  Since his departure from this place it has been repeatedly intimated to me that he had said the Colours had been concealed in part of the Baggage declared sacred by an Article of the Convention & the Cash in the Military Chest deposited, in parts, in the hands of the Officers.  I need not explain to your Excellency the vast importance of a detection of these frauds nor the absolute necessity for dispatch, nor that Captn. Senff ought to be examined touching other articles besides those abovementioned & the whole upon Oath. Here we have also been somewhat dilatory, I urged the present determination upwards of two Months ago, within a few days of Captn Senf's leaving this place.  The fleet expected from France with Cloathing, ammunition &ca &ca arrived about 14 days ago at Boston & Portsmouth & with them several very valuable prizes, no other particulars are received, except the naming 1 French 40 Gun Ship. Captn. Nicholson in one of the States Frigates & one other States Vessel, authentic & special advices I expect every hour.  Spain reserves herself for the arrival of her plate fleet looked for in April, when if England shall have declared War against France she will enter the lists & Portugal has certainly acceded to the family Compact. Spain affects much munificence towards this Infant World, when I am at Liberty I will explain to Your Excellency that my singular opinion respecting her views prove to be well founded. I communicated my suspicions to my Colleague the Cheif Justice & beleive he has improved upon them in some of his advices to Charles  Town, he said he would. At present that Gentleman is a truant, has been a fortnight on a Visit to Camp for which I shall salute his return with a little scold. A Man of his abilities & diligence I wish to have ever present.  After two Months labor on a scheme for half pay to officers, in which, as a Silent auditor & Spectator, I was Witness to many excellent & some violent Strokes in parliamentary Manoevre, a long Report of a Committee, ridden by amendments & New Resolves, the original project by the Grace of God, was the day before yesterday rid to Death, & from the Ashes, the inclosed Act of Congress of the 15th May, produced. I transmitted it Instantly to the Commander in Cheif; I shall learn in a day or two its reception in Camp. Congress have now Entered heartily upon the general Arrangement of the Army & will get through without difficulty.  Your Excellency will receive in a seperate Packet (13) Sets of Marine Commissions &ca all I have at present & all in my opinion that ought to be used until amendments suitable to our change of Circumstances are made. I have addressed Congress on this subject & hope we shall find time for the purpose immediately after finishing the arrangement-also 20 Military Commissions which may serve in cases of exigency until I transmit more, with the Report on your Excellency's Letters. The impropriety of my predecessors conduct in Signing & spreading in every quarter Commissions in the moment of his retiring was obvious, it has been necessary for me to replace thousands in the several departments.13 It did not become me to restrain the act, but a remark escaped my Lips \""My friend imitates General Vaughan who when he found it expedient to withdraw from Hudson's Banks ravaged the Country.\"" Some officers inadvertently hold Commissions under such premature signature, not worth a rash.  Your Excellency will be pleased to receive this as a performance accomplished in scraps of time after 4 or 5 different efforts. Tis now the 19th. I have the honor to be with very great Respect.  19th 3 oClock P.M. Just as I was about to close this Packet an acct. from Camp arrived.  The Enemy in Philada are in motion but their manoevres & Stratagems keep their real intentions inexplicable. All is conjecture. 'Tis said Sir Wm. Howe is returned, that their heavy Cannon are actually embarked. They have commited cruel Ravage on all the fruit Trees in & about the City. These they have stuck in a Semi-Circle on the Common & hung Lanterns upon each. Their design may be to attack General Washington-to get quietly off & go safely down the River with every moveable worth transporting-to penetrate the Jersey & cross over to New York. &c &c.(14)   ""

They Observe that they are much Inclined to be Angry at the Conduct of France, but Wheather they will really be so We shall soon know.  As to the Regulating Act which you mention No one here thinks any Thing of it. A Recommendation would before now have gone from Congress to suspend it had it not been Apprehended it might have been disagreable to our State. I Am Very well perswaded that there is but a single Member in Congress in favour of it.(1) The States may certainly do what they please either to continue or suspend the Act without giving any offence.

  My Dear, York Town 17t May 1778 I have Wrote you three Letters since the beginning of this Month, one a few Days ago enclosed in a Letter to Mr. Lord.(1) I still injoy Health. May I be thankfull to him who bestows it upon me.  I was in hopes to have recd. a Letter from you, but Brown says he passed the Town so soon that you had not Time to Write. However I was informed by him and by a Letter from Dr. Smith that you was well. By this Letter I am also informed you had the misfortune to lose a couple of your [Cows?]. Evils We must expect. This I hope will give you no great Pain.  Yale College Corporation Dr. Smith tells me are much offended by a Letter I wrote to Oliver, and suggests it may possibly have some influence pritty Material upon the Election.(2) If so I shall give myself no concern. If my Election can depend upon (so precarious a Tenure) such a frivolous Circumstance I should most willingly (quit) lose it, Altho my Desire of continuing in the Assembly was much greater than I certainly know it now is. What Business the Corporation have with a Copy of my Letter I cannot conceive. Does any one think to prevent me from writing to a Freind any Thing which I apprehend to be true. Certainly I never will be under that Restraint. Oliver perhaps was oblidged to shew the Letter to his Tutor, or might have suffered a Freind to take a Copy of it. At most it must have been but an Inadvertance and I have no Inclination either to blame him or myself at present-and beleive I shall have no Occasion to do it. I feel Very Innocent and consequently totally unconcerned about this affair.  This Day Duplicates of the Treatys with France were bro't to Congress. But no Material Intelligence was bro't-but what you must have heard of. Dr. Franklin was formerly Admitted at the Court of Versailles as Embasedor for these States on the 20t. March.

  Sir York Town May 18th. 1778. The Inclosd Resolution of Congress is the result of the most painfull & disagreable question that hath ever been Agitated in Congress.(1)  The question was Steerd before Col. Dyer left Congress & he will be able to give Some account of the matter & Sentiments of many of the States thereon.  A most disagreable & serious debate hath Continued about seven weeks, a bill being brot. in for an half pay Establishment for life for the officers & to their widows during their widowhood; Several Collateral questions were determind on the progress of the debate which Shewed that Eight of the States were in favour of the Establishment for life &c as above, Rhode Island, Connecticutt, New Jersey, & South Carolina strenuously in the negative, New Hampshire being absent.  General Washington wrote repeatedly upon the Subject expressing his great concern; & the necessity of the measure, in one of his Letters he Says that altho he never would take any benefit of such an Establishment himself, yet he did most religiously believe the Salvation of the Army depended upon it,(2) many of the States deemed the MAY 18, 1778  measure not only absolutely necessary but Salutary, Just & reasonable. The Justice as well as necessity of doing some thing for the Army was obvious, to Increase their wages would so directly tend to depreciate the Currency it appeard dangerous as well as futile.  Finally after long debate & delay in hope some favourable Event might turn up, even til delay became dangerous the bill was carried for an Establishment for life, but the four States who were in the negative as before mentioned persevering & urging the dangerous tendency of such a measure as being totally Inconsistent with free States, repugnant to principals upon which this great Controversy was begun & by which it must & ought to be defended with many other arguments & observations too tedious to be enumerated; the majority of the Delegates of Massachusetts, came over to the negative Side of the question.  There appearing a Serious concern in Congress to adopt Some mode in this Important matter, in which they might Unite so as to answer the necessities of the Army & preserve harmony & unanimity in all the States, a Reconsideration of the Bill was proposed & an Amendment moved & finally adopted which is the Inclosd resolution, providing both for Officers & Soldiers Such a reward as should be deemed equal in value to their wages at the Original Stipulation.  It is Allmost Impossible to give a clear & full representation of the difficulties attending this debate, on both sides the question to any gentleman who was not present, however many weighty reasons not here mentioned will readily occur to your Excellency.  If the Inclosd Resolve is not the best measure the nature & Circumstances of the Case would admit, it is certainly the best that could be obtaind.  Your Excellencies late Correspondence with General Tryon meets with universal approbation.(3)  We have Just receivd Intelligence that North Carolina have acceeded to the Articles of Confederation.(4) If the Delegates from New Hampshire should arrive with powers to ratify, which we hope will soon be the Case, there is a prospect the Confederation may soon be Compleated.  Duplicates of the Treaties of Alliance & Commerce, with France, arrived here yesterday & by the same packet we have advice that on the 20th of March Docr Franklin was formally receivd as Embassador from these States at the Court of Versailes & that his most Christian Majesty had named an Embassador, to reside here.

  Sir,(1) York-Town May 18th. 1778. I have received the powers and instructions respecting the confederation, and agreeably to a resolution of the house laid the proposed alterations and amendments on the table last Wednesday.  The confederation was to have been taken up last Saturday; but was kept back by some pressing business. I do not expect that any of the amendments proposed by our State will take place, excepting that for taking estimates every five years.(2)  If the confederation should be ratified before two delegates should arrive from our State it will be unrepresented; for, as I have long since informed the assembly, I shall be obliged to return home very soon. It is now about two years since I first attended Congress, and during that time, four months only excepted, the State hath been represented by one delegate. The saving thus occasioned will I hope enable the Assembly in future to keep up three members constantly in Congress; so long at least as it shall sit at such a distance from Rhode-Island. The necessity of this measure of having always three MAY 18, 1778  members at Congress hath been recommended and urged by Congress to all the states, and I have desired our State to comply with the recommendation.  I informed the Assembly some time ago that it was proposed in Congress that half pay for life should be allowed to all military commissioned officers, who now are or hereafter may be in the service, and continue therein during the war, and desired instructions thereon.  This matter was first agitated in a committee of the whole, afterwards amended in Congress, and when amended a question was had, according to a previous agreement, whether the propositions should be referred to the States for their consideration or not, and passed in the negative by a majority of one vote only. The main question was then proposed, and a debate ensued, during which it was thrown out by the minority that if the half pay was fixed for the term of six or seven years it might produce a coalition; whereupon the question was put off to the next day when this knotty business was settled according to the inclosed Resolution.(3)  Genl Howe, the President informs me, sailed for Britain last Wednesday, and is succeeded by Genl. Clinton. I have heard nothing of Capt. Coddington. I wish he may arrive safe; but the chance is very much against him. We have nothing remarkable. Inclosed is the last news paper. I heartily congratulate with you on the Alliance enter'd into with France, and am with great Respect, Your very humble Servant, William Ellery  ""

  Dear Sir. l9th May [1778]  I can say nothing more in return to your obliging Letter of the 20th April but that the Bill for 200 Dollars lies on my Table-after your own misfortune I had ventured to disclosure to Mr. Hall the name of his friend & I added for his sake & yours & my own a Moiety of your donation.(1) His Excellency the President will give you Govr. Trumbull's answer to Mr. Tryon's Complimentary Certificate upon empty Bills, & within this Inclosure you will receive bundles of printed Papers. If you write to me often & copiously I will acknowledge a debt & like other very honest planters if I can't be punctual in payment I will allow Interest & make you my factor.  Govr.

  My dear brother, York in Pen. 19 May 1778  Your several favors by the Vessel from Spain with duplicates of the treaties with France are arrived and shall have my most particular attention. In Virginia we have determined to retain in our practical jurisprudence the Common law of England excepting such parts as relate to royalty and prerogative. Also some of the Statutes that are of a nature the most general. These, with our own Acts of Assembly constitute our Code of Laws. You see therefore that Ludwell may be fully employed with you in reading the Common law and the Statutes, leaving the Municipal law of Virginia until he comes home. But I wish him much to have the groundwork of the law of Nature & Nations with the Civil law and Eloquence. I have not got the Virga. Acts of Assembly here, & it would be difficult to send them if I had. I am astonished at the {impudence}(1) and {jugglery} of {Deane} and his {associates}. You may depend upon their being {carefully attended} to, and as I have found during the progress of this {contest} that the {offenders} have been uniformly {discredited} and {punished}, so I have no doubt will it happen now. Persevere in {honest patriotism} and all will be well. {Patience} you know is one of the Cardinal virtues, and in this case {we} must soon give you {relief} since the late {recall} has broken the {faction}.(2) The Members of Congress are so perpetually changing that it is of little use to give you their Names.(3) From Massachusetts now come Messrs.

  Gentn. 20 May [1778]  I beg to be heard on the point of Order, in behalf of your President.(1) The motion was withdrawn by the Gentn. who made it, the Gent. did not whisper & I had declared it to the House. There was no objection-but how shall the Chair preserve Order when Gentn. differ so much and so often in their sentiments upon Order. Were I now, was the Chair upon every occasion to call Gentn. to Order it must of course bring on debate indeed altercation a term which ought not to be heard in this House. Seeing therefore there is such variety of opinion & so often changed, the Chair is always attentive & complaisant to every Gentleman & obedient to the determination of the House. It is not long since a violent infraction was made upon Order, it stands upon your Journal as violent an infractn. as ever appeared upon a Journal.(2) The Chair endeavored to prevent the evil-I am sure I acted with integrity & to the best of my judgement -but the House by a Vote Resolved it to be order, the Chair submitted. After such an Instance & so many disputes upon Order what part can the Chair Act. When the House condescends to direct the Chair I am obedient. I think I know what is Order, but I cannot Govern Gentlemen who upon different occasions differ from themselves-the Chair must therefore in most Cases wait the decision of the House. When the House desire my opinion I give it without hesitation, with Integrity & candor & in this view I trust the Chair will not be censured now nor upon any occasion for being slack in determining Order & in the present I had declared to the House what was, there were three motions before them, that one was withdrawn, in order to apprize no notice was taken this implied Consent & I proceeded.

  Dear General (1) 20th May [1778] Your favor of the 2d Inst. having been several days more than ordinary on its journey hither must account for so much of the interval of time, for the remainder I must wave your pardon. You know Sir, how I am circumstanced, not the want of good manners, nor of esteem for General duportail, but truly the want of half an hours leisure has occasioned this long delay of my respects. I had once sat down to write but was hindred by such Visits as I am continually exposed to & was forced to content myself with covering a printed paper in order to shew I had not forgot my debt, although I could do no more than write a superscription.  I have the satisfaction Sir of feeling in my own breast your Ideas of the conduct which true policy will dictate for the observance of the United States towards their new Allies & their abandoned Brethren; If I have any objection, it is to the stress which you seem to lay on the sense of obligation which ought to be acknowledged by the States to the former, this is touching a delicate String; a speculative point on which the most sagacious writers may hereafter differ without reproach upon the wisdom or candor of either, & 'tis a maxim with me, that attempts to explain Mystery is waste of time. Let us retire from this ground & I beleive every candid American will subscribe to your positions. The late Acts of Congress warrant this sentiment & the Treaties of the 6th February, mark a line for the government of the contracting parties. Notwithstanding the opening left by the Treaty of Alliance, there remains a strong repugnance in my own mind against any agreement with England, unless on her part an indemnification shall be first granted for the damages we shall have sustained by the present unjust War. This is not a growth from late appearances, I had uniformly expressed opinions to this effect long before Lord North's late speech & his Empty Bills had been ushered upon the Stage, but more particularly I wished to have made it an article in the Act of Congress of the 22d April. Nor had we then any knowledge, I candidly declare I had entertained no expectation, of the Treaties abovementioned. I had always determined to maintain this principle even if a convention with our old friends should have had its commencement beyond those Mountains. Every fresh injury added Strength to my Resolution.  There may be yet an arduous work to perform, it is far from being clear that the English will strike the first blow against France, she had delayed a declaration of War so many days subsequent to the explicit & contemptuous specification by the Duke de Noailles as intimates a different policy, probably she will attempt to treat, if we  MAY 20, 1778  reject her terms vengeance will follow & this Infant World will be exposed to the pressure of her full power; for it does not appear that France & Spain are yet disposed to make the first declaration of hostility. In this view, I perceive a long train of direful consequences to America, but this is likewise speculative & I am not furnished with sufficient premises for a larger discussion.  Your remarks on the temper of the people on this side the Atlantic I conceive Sir, will not apply to the great Majority. Britain by her unexampled Cruelties has rooted out the former affections of America towards her, it will indeed be her aim, because it is her Interest to recover that loss, but before this can be accomplished, the benefits of an universal acquaintance & of an unrestrained Commerce with the World at large will be so generally experienced as to throw an insuperable Bar against any Bias in her favor. In America Great Britain will be regarded as one of the European States & just so far as Interest & Policy shall direct will she be entitled to the friendships of a people whom she had attempted to enslave, whom she had wantonly proscribed & most unmercifully persecuted; the detail will be transfused in American Almanacs from year to year & every Peasant will be taught to rejoice on the anniversary of deliverance; nor will the stile of \""Protector of the Rights of Mankind\"" be read without its proper impressions & effects.  I wait with some anxiety to learn the further movements in Philadelphia, we are just now told that there is an appearance of retiring from New York, if this be true it works another mystery which time must unfold. Our present policy is to assemble a large Army as the best foundation for treaty & the best guard against tricks. I am rejoiced to learn that at Valley forge the Army is greatly improved by the unwearied attention & great skill of Major General Baron Steuben. I have the honor to be &ca.  ""

Gerard, which shall be carefully disposed of, the former of this direction, together with one for Compte Broglie & one for Monsr. de St.Paul are on their way to Boston to be embarked there in the same MAY 20, 1778  vessel in which the dispatches from Congress to the Ambassador Franklin are to be sent forward.  I do not find that War was declared in England the 23d March. Commissioners for the American business were named & were soon to proceed on their Embassy, a very valuable French Ship called the Henriette just now arrived at Boston had been 43 hours in possession of the Enemy & suffered to proceed. From these circumstances it appears Great Britain was disposed to more deliberation than when she was wont to commence hostilities antecedent to a declaration.  I have sent your Letter to Mr. Thomson. The Chevalier Failly may safely acquit General Gates who has done every thing in his power to obtain that Gentleman's promotion according to promise; Monsr. Failly I believe received General Gates's paper from me, in which he had signified the Merits of that Officer & earnestly requested Congress to order him a Colonel's Commission, the consideration was postponed till the arrangement of the Army should be completed, this will probably be in three or four days.(2) If Monsr.

  Dr Genl. York Town 21st May 1778 We are going on with the regimental Arrangements as fast as possible and I think the Day begins to appear with Respect to this Business. Had our Saviour addressed a Chapter to the Rulers of Mankind as he did many to the Subjects I am perswaded his Good Sense would have dictated this Text, Be not wise overmuch. Had the several Members which compose our multifarious Body been only wise enough Our Business would long since have been compleated. But our superior Abilities or the Desire of appearing to possess them leads us to such exquisite Tediousness of Debate that the most precious Moments pass unheeded away like vulgar Things.  I am at a loss to determine what the Enemy will do because it is impossible to see what their Interest, Situation and the like require of them or rather because these Circumstances require more of them than they appear to be in Force to perform. It is not so difficult to say what they will not do. They will not go up Hudson's River unless you will insure them a safe Passage down. On the whole it appears to me that they will leave a Garrison at Rhode Island, in Nova Scotia and Canada, possibly a few Men in the Floridas. The Remainder of their Army together with such of the American Rebels as they can force into Service, kidnapp &ca. to the Amount of about fifteen thousand effectives and the large Fleet now in the American Seas and about eight Ships of the Line and a large Convoy of Provisions will serve to carry on an offensive war in the West Indias. This seems to be their only Chance of Safety but of all this the Event will determine much better than we can.  As to what you mention of the extraordinary Demeanor of some Gentlemen I cannot but agree with you that such Conduct is not the most honorable, But on the other Hand even you must allow that it is the most safe and Certainly you are not to learn that however ignorant of that happy art in your own particular, the bulk of us Bipeds know well how to balance solid Pudding against empty Praise. There are other Things my dear Sir besides Virtue which are their own Reward.(1) And the Feelings of others unless I mistake will sooner  MAY 21, 1778  or later break out into a Retribution of those Act & Neglects which at present pass away unnoticed by the Herd of Observers or rather of Lookers on.  As to your Friend who hath thought proper to demand of you a Command, I did beleive from the first that his Resignation was like some former ones from the same Quarter meerly calculated to gain either Promotion or Favor or Revenge.(2) I was therefore led to expect that his Merits and our Misfortune in loosing him would become the Topick of Declamation & took the earliest Opportunity to express in the very strongest Terms my Satisfaction my Joy at the Receipt of the Letter from him and of Consequence to assign the Reasons why this Event gave me so much Pleasure. This gave a very different Turn to Affairs. Panegyrick dwindled to Apology and no Opposition was made to the main Point of accepting his Resignation. The next Day I was informed that he did not intend to resign, that his Letter was quite misunderstood &ca. The Gentleman however had been so unlucky as to use the most pointed terms and therefore his Aid from whom the Information came was told that the observations he made came too late. I am perswaded that he will attempt to get reinstated if the least Probability of Success appears but I am equally perswaded that his Attempts will fail. I beleive his Friends are hitherto of that same Opinion and therefore we have as yet had no attempts made in Congress and possibly we never shall.  I wish you would contrive to get the necessary Returns from Maryland Troops and others who have not made them so as that the arrangement may take Place as soon as possible.

The last Letter to his Family he dates the l9th Novr 1773 and told them that he is not maried, that his age will no longer permit him to perform the Duties of his office in the manner he formerly had fulfilled them and therefore he had resolved to return and spend the Remainder of his Days in his native Country. Since that time his Family have heard nothing from him and if now living he is sixty five years of Age.  It is requested that Doctor Franklin will have the Goodness to make some Enquiry into the Fate of the said Johann Christoph Hartwick and in Case he should have died to procure the necessary Intelligence as to the Estate he may have been possessed of and the  MAY 23, 1778  Steps to be taken by his Representatives to procure the Possession of it.  The Minister Plenipotentiary of Sax Gotha at the Court of his most Christian Majesty will receive the Information which Doctor Franklin shall procure for him upon this Subject with the utmost Thankfulness.  Now Jay what I have to request of you is that you will in the Course of your Peregrinations make Inquiry into this Matter and write me the Result.(1)  I received a Letter from our Friend Robert yesterday dated in Sussex County in which he desires me to write to him without telling me where to direct but as he mentions the having a Wife and two sisters with him I presume he is bound to Lebanon. He adds a wish that I might be in his own words \""in this State at the meeting of the Legislature.\"" I presume he means in the state of New York and not New Jersey, if so I say, This is impossible because Frank Lewis is absent. Because Duer hath leave of Absence and will I suppose go as soon as he can. Because Mr. Livingston is sick.(2) On this last head I have to add that I really am very apprehensive on the old Gentleman's account for truly I beleive he will not escape if he does escape without much Pain, Sickness & other of those Circumstances which render Life no such desirable Boon as those who observe the Tenaciousness of Mankind about it would be led to imagaine. What his Disease is no Body pretends to know. I who am no Phisician will however venture to guess that it is an Impostumation in his Stomach or perhaps in some one of the Viscera still more important in a Complaint of that nature. This I gather from a quick Pulse, Languor, continued sickness, some Pain and much Uneasiness about the Part I suppose to be affected, a Decline of strength & Flesh, Hectic appearance. But I will not play the Doctor to you at least who never plays it.  Adieu my Friend. Beleive me in all times, seasons & Circumstances, with sincerity, yours, Gouvr Morris  ""

  Dear General, York Town Saturday Morning 23d May [1778] I wrote you a few days ago by Colo. Johnson; as he is not yet gone, I will now add two Things I forgot to mention then. The first is that if you send any General to Rhode Island you will probably find it most convenient to get rid of Varnom, whose Temper and Manners are by no Means calculated to teach Patience, Discipline & Subordination.(1) Congress having determined on the Affair of the Prisoners; and (in my Opinion wisely) dropt for the present all Mention of Citizens; you will probably be enabled to negotiate a Cartel.(2) If not, severe Retaliation is the only Mode of compelling the Enemy to Humanity and should they as on a former Occasion complain of what they call Injustice, in punishing innocent Men for the Faults of a few, it will not be perhaps improper to observe that it is perfectly consonant to the Law of Nations; which expressly makes this Provision where the immediate Author of the Evil cannot be brought within the Power of the Party injured. But at the same time ought to be relaxed whenever Circumstances shall enable us to punish the Delinquents in an exemplary Manner. The Marquis I hear had like to have been catched. Pray Sir be pleased to make my Respects to him & Congratulations on his Escape. I have the Honor to be, yours, Gouvr Morris  ""

  Dear Sir Manheim May 23d 1778 As I heard an express passed through Lancaster Yesterday Morning from Boston with Letters from Capt. Green I was in hopes of receiving some letters to day by your means from that quarter but as yet nothing appears. I received a letter from Colo. Griffin by last Post dated at Williamsburg 9th May 1778 wherein is the following Paragraph.  \""By last Post I received a letter from Mr Babcock desiring me to receive the Money from the Secret Committee on the terms they proposed and in Consequence thereof, have drawn an order on you for the Amot. The papers were all left in the hands of Mr. Brown with directions to lodge the Money with you whenever you applied.  Mr. Griffins draft on me has not yet appeared but as I wish to be ready to Answer it I beg you will present Mr Ceronios draft to the Committee. It is drawn for hard Dollars, he has been advised that it wou'd be paid & the terms on which it was proposed to be paid was two Dollars for one which Mr Griffin did not choose to accept without orders from his employer Mr. Babcock and as these terms are favourable to the Public I suppose there will be no difficulty. You'l please to receive the Money & advise me when it is ready. I find Cap Brown of the Henrietta arrived in Boston was 43 hours in possession of the Enemy which occasioned his throwing all his dispatches overboard. Mr. Ross had this ship sold in Hamburg and by that means obtained Hamburgee papers & clearances for Hispaniola which has saved her & 600 Bales of Goods she has onboard. My Compts to the Committee.

  Dear Papa, 24 May 1778 Your letters by the last post, which I ought to have recd. last Monday, I recd. last Wednesday; they went by mistake to Lancaster & were returned by the return post.  A Law has passed in this State, of which you are probably ignorant, calling in all the money, issued under the Proprietary governt., by the 1st of next month; after that day it is not to pass: (1) persons having such monies & residing out of this State have a further time for bringing them in-I believe till sometime in August. Do look over your cash, and select from it all bills passed by the Legislature of Pennsylvania while under the dominion of G.B. You will find the Law in the Lancaster newspaper; probably it will be reprinted in Baltimore. I have written, & sent my letter to Col. Moylan recommending to his notice the person whom Mr. J. Howard wrote to me about. Please to inform Mr. Howard of this. It will always give me pleasure to render him such services. The Marquis de la Fayette crossed the Schuyilkill last Monday with 2300 men; he was ordered to draw near the city of Pha. and observe the enemy's motions; it has then imagined they were about to leave Pha. The Enemy had very early information of the Marquiss march, & they laid a scheme to intercept him: on Monday night they marched with 7000 men from Pha. in 3 columns taking different roads: one of these Columns had got in the rear of the Marquiss unperceived; the other was near his front, the 3d on his flank: from this perilous situation the Marquiss extricated himself by a rapid March to the Schuyilkill, which he passed with his whole detachment & altho the water was middle deep he brought off his men & cannon safe. As soon as he had gained this side of Schuyilkill he drew up, the Enemy on the other side looking on; the alarm guns at Gener. Washington's camp firing gave the alarm to the Enemy's column which had got in the rear of the Marquiss and they marched as quick back as they came out. Had this column attacked the Marquiss detachment, it is probable the whole would have been killed or taken.  General Washington in his last letter (I think dated the 18) informed us he was of opinion, from all the accounts he had recd. from Pha.,  MAY 24, 1778  that the Enemy were about to leave that city; his conjecture was that they were going to N. York, & from thence might possibly proceed to the W. Indies. Notwithstanding these appearances & the General's opinion founded on them, I am inclined to think the Enemy will not leave Pha. before the arrival of the Commissioners, who may be daily expected. If they do not acknowlege our Independence, but should have declared war agt. France, I am of opinon they will continue the war in this country and not carry their army to the W. Indies, to perish in that unwholsome climate.  If Joe has finished all the Jobbs at Annapolis, I wish you would set him about preparing stones to line a cold bath; the stones already raised at the soap stone quarry would be sufficient for this purpose, as the bath need not be in the clear more than 10 feet long & 8 broad & 4 feet, 6 inches deep. When I return I will direct where it shall be dug. Joe will be free some time next month, he may be engaged to stay till the bath is finished. I wrote to Skerret by last post to engage the Gardiner at £60 per annum wages. He is a sober & an industrious fellow, & considering the little value of the money, & the dearness of cloaths, I do not think that sum much out of the way.  Inclosed you have yesterday's paper of this place, it contains all the news circulating here except what is above related & what follows.  The only vessels arrived at the Eastward making part of the fleet which sailed from France the latter end of February are the Dean Frigate, and the Queen of France; the Duke de Choiseul one of this fleet is not yet arrived; she parted with the Dean off the western Islands in a gale of wind. Besides the above vessels, the Henrietta, a French Ship with a very valuable cargo, is arrived at Boston. She was in the Enemy's possession 43 hours, all her papers were thrown overboard. The Brigt Resistance is arrived at Boston from Martinico. Mr. Bingham, the Continental agent there, writes that the Govr. has recd. orders to put every thing in a posture of defence, & to be prepared as if war was certain.  Do let me know in your next how the Vineyard thrives. Has the fruit suffered by frost this spring? If it has escaped hitherto, I hope there will be a good deal of it. Remember to answer this part of my letter.  25th P.M. I have yours & Molly's of the 21st instant by this day's post. It will not be in my power to attend the approaching session of our Assembly. There are but 3 Delegates from Maryd. now attending Congress, Plater, Henry, & Self. Mr. Henry will leave this the latter end of this week, or the beginning of next. The death of Mr. Stone's brother will prevent his attendance for some time. Chase won't be here till towards the middle of next month; altho' he is not in our assembly, he will do well to attend it some time. I shall return home  about the 20 of next month never to return to Congress, & principally for the reason you suggest. I am sensible business must now be extreamly irksome to you, and I am determined to ease you of it in future by staying at home & minding my own affairs. You know my sentiments of the tender law, I would do all in my power to have it repealed as an unjust, publickly impolitical, & partially oppressive and an ex post facto law; but believe me, my presence in the Senate will not forward the repeal. I much doubt, notwithstanding the major's information, whether a Majority of the Senate would vote for a repeal of it, when it should come to the tryal. You have £11,473. £6000 of it are engaged, remains £5,473-out of this must be paid our assesst., say £1500, remains £3973 for curt. expences; if you are inclined, you may put out at interest to Individuals, this or a much larger sum. If the Senate were to pass a bill to repeal the tender law, it would be rejected by the House of Delegates. I believe every State are too much interested in the law to suffer its repeal. I flatter myself, if we should soon have peace, that our Public debts will be put in a regular course of payt., public credit will revive, and our currentcy settle at par; in that case we shall only lose in the present expenditures of monies paid us. Even this public debt may be of service, and serve as a cement, or bond of Union. It gives me great pleasure to hear that Molly is so much better. I hope she will keep mending, till she recovers a perfect state of health; my affectionate love to her; I would write to her by this opportunity but am tired of writing, and I can say nothing but what she must be convinced on & I have already said. My love to Mrs. Darnall & the little ones. We have not heard lately from Gen. Washington: the report still continues & gains strength of the enemy's approaching departure from Pha. God grant you a long enjoyment of health. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S. 26th May. I write this by Wm. Levy of Baltimore. He has promised me to send it to Mr. Brooke. If there should be any extraordinary intelligence I will write to you again this morning in Congress & send my second letter by the post.  ""

  My dear sir York Town May 25 1778 Your favor by Capt Coltor overtook me on the Road; agreeably to your Request I immediately on my Arrival here mentiond to a Gen- MAY 25, 1778  tleman of the Marine Committee the Necessity and Importance of keeping your Board duly supplyd with Cash to enable you effectually to do the duty of your department and was told that 50 thousand of Dollars had been lately remitted to you.(1) I will not fail to do what in me lies to forward that Service, as our Navy has always lain near my Heart.  I am exceedingly pleasd to find that our Army makes a much better Appearance than it has done since the Commencement of this War. It is very respectable in Point of Numbers and Discipline has been happily improvd by the Baron de Stuben who is appointed Inspector General with the Rank of Major General.(2) The invariable Accounts from Philadelphia are that the Enemy are making Preparations for an Embarkation, and it is expected they will soon leave that Place. Where they will proceed next you can as easily conjecture as we. I am not apprehensive of their visiting Boston; I wish however that more effectual Measures might be taken to strengthen & secure that Harbour & Town from Insult to which I think it is too much exposd.  I recollect that your Election of Counsillors will come on the Day after tomorrow. Has Mr (3) waited for the Event of that important Day? or is he on his Journey to this Place? It is a matter of so much Uncertainty here, that Nothing, I suppose prevents many wagers being laid upon it, but its being not of so much Moment as some others. Was he present here, he might, if he pleasd, vindicate me against a Report which has given occasion to my Friends to rally me, that I have been called to Account and severely reprehended at a Boston Town Meeting for being in a Conspiracy against a very great Man.(4) You know how little I care for such Rumours. It is easy for me to conjecture by what Means it extended it self from Manheim where I first heard it to York Town; and it may not be difficult to guess how it came from Boston to that Place. Manheim is about 12 miles East of the Susquihanna; there lives Mr R.M. a very intimate Acquaintance of my excellent Friend. Mr H is said to be on the Road, but no one makes it certain. When he arrives Messrs Gerry & Dana propose to set off for N England. I shall be mortified at their leaving us, for I verily think that the Accession even of that Gentleman will not make up for the Absence of the other two.  I am happy to find C[ongress] in perfect good humor and attentive to Business though so hard put to it in this place, as hardly to have a Room a piece in which to write a letter to a Friend. It brings to my Mind the Circumstances & Temper of the old Deputies who sat down under a Tree to eat their Bread and Cheese. This is the Kind of Men who are the Terror of Tyrants. I hope I shall shortly be able to write you something of Importance, from the Army at least. In the meantime Vale et me ama.  ""

If the Oraculum Legis can be spared from the state, I shall recommend your attending Congress this Summer by Way of a [Sacrifice?], which will probably be rendered more agreeable by the Removal of Congress to Philadelphia from whence the Enemy are said to be preparing to remove.

  My dear Sir, York the 25th May 1778 I am much obliged to you for your kind letter by last Post, by which however I see you had not received any of the several letters I had written to you since my arrival here.(1) The prevailing opinion both here and at Camp is, that the enemy are designed soon to embark their Army and quit Philadelphia, as they have, 'tis said, wooded and watered their Transports, & fixt up Stalls for the horses on board Ship. It is my opinion that this move will depend entirely upon the event of a French war taking place or not. And that this will happen soon seems doubtful at present, for it is very evident that those who direct the Councils of G.B. will submit to every insult rather than venture on a war which must remove for ever all hope of gratifying their revenge upon these States. France may force the war upon them, but they, I think, will not commence the war with France. Marquis Fayette went lately upon the enemies lines with 2500 men with design to act as occasion should point out; but one of his men deserting and informing the enemy of his force and his situation, they marched almost their whole army quickly in the night to surround the noble Marquis. However, he made good his retreat without any loss save a few Packs. Some Oneida Indians skirmished with the enemy & killed a few of their light Horse. Gen. Gates is gone to command upon the North river where the Eastern Levies are ordered to halt until the designs of the Enemy are more clearly fixed.  I am yours dear Sir with much affection.

I am thus formal in telling you why I write, because you seem to have neglected favoring me with a Single line by Mr. Bartlett with the express design of punishing me for a supposed neglect in what was partly the consequence of judgment and partly necessity. I have been expecting you here daily for many weeks and I have been the only one of the Committee for foreign affairs on the Spot for 16 weeks, in which time I have not only performed the regular duty of the absent Secretary, but have endeavored to make up for the neglect of the Committee in some parts of our correspondence during hurry of business last year. At the same time having only 9 States present, and our's requiring 3 for a vote, I was obliged to attendance twice a day in Congress. And now, Sir, think you that, with my duty to the State, my family in the corresponding line, I have had much time to devote to the pleasures of friendship. I will add to what is already written that I have wanted in common with other delegates, a convenient Situation for using a pen in quiet till now that a fire place is not necessary.  So many words look like anxious apology to you, but in truth I am so heartily vexed at your not coming to this forlorn hope of Society, Yorktown, that I care little what you think of me.  The Gazettes have so early & regularly contained our material transactions & intelligence from abroad that I have no occasion to say much on those heads. General Folsom & Commodore Frost are I hope safely arrived. They can tell you a long story about an half pay establishment, it's origin, progress and impediments till they left this place. After being carried, barely, for life, it was by an effort made redeemable at six year's purchase and after a while, made absolute by a sort of common consent, for 7 years. 11 States were unanimous. Only Genl. W (1) of Connecticut and myself were nay, of individuals. I hope as it has passed that the people will be reconciled to it. None out of Congress can sufficiently know the necessity though they may judge as well as we about the justice and feel the unpropriety.

Dupree's & Knights Cargoes, or so much of them as belongs to the States. I am apprehensive that the other two have miscarried, & should this be the Case, the Amount of the Invoices will be but a moderate premium for all the Goods shipped by that House on Account of the Continent. I have communicated to the commercial Committee your Demand for Money & desired them to determine the Allowance wch you are to receive for your Services & to settle your former Accounts. 50,000 Dollars are ordered to be sent You for the Use of the naval Department & 650,000 to Messers Otis & Andrews to discharge the Debts wch they have contracted for the publick.(2) Our Friend Mr Adams arrived here last Week & is pleased with the Appearances of Things; Our Army is well officer'd, Generals Washington, Lee & Steuben with the main Army, Gates, McDougal & Starks at the north River, Arnold & Lincoln in Reserve; no Complaint from the Want of provission, Cloathing, Medicine, Arms, Ammunition or Pay, & the officers Minds made easy with Respect to the latter, & a Style of Discipline, introduced by Baron Steuben who is appointed Inspector General wth the Rank of Major General, to  MAY 26, 1778  wch the Army have hitherto been Strangers. This great officer has his Inspectors & sub Inspectors with every Corps of the Army; & an Emulation prevails amongst the Officers to merit his Approbation by qualifying themselves for the places which they hold. In speaking of the officers pay, I meant to allude to the half pay Establishment lately made for the officers who shall continue in the Service to the End of the War, which provides that they shall be entitled to their half pay for the space of seven years & has had a happy Effect by making the Commissions of the officers valuable, introducing Subordination, preventing Resignations which of late have been so frequent as to prove very alarming, & promising the most happy Consequences. The Measure was exceedingly disagreable to Congress, as You will suppose when I inform You that it was debated near three Weeks, before it was adopted & the Necessity of it on Account of the State of the Currency was so apparent at length as to make the House unanimous in the Measure. The Soldiers are also provided for, each being entitled to 80 Dollars who shall continue in the service to the End of the War. If Congress should be then of opinion that there is Danger of introducing or fixing a plan of burthening the publick with pensioners & placemen, they may redeem the half pay & put an End to the precedent; for I presume few officers would refuse an offer to discount the Interest if they could be furnished at any Time with the remaining Sum arising on the half pay Establishment. Two Things remain to be accomplished, filling the Batalions & fixing the Value of the Currency, the first is the Business of the several states, the last of Congress who are determined forthwith to attend to it. To accomplish this & Confederate are the only Considerations that detain me here so late in the spring & induce me to consent to ride Home in the warm Month of June. I most heartily congratulate You on late Events in Europe; what a marvellous Change in the System of the political Worlds; the Goverment of England advocates for Despotism, & endeavouring to enslave the evermost loyal Subjects of their King; the Goverment of France Advocates for Liberty, espousing the Cause of Lutherans & Calvinists, & risking a War to establish their Independance; the King of England branded by every Whig in the Nation as a Tyrant; the King of France by every Whig in America applauded as the great protector of the Rights of Mankind. The King of Britain establishing Popery, the King of France endeavouring to free his people from this ecclesiastical Tyranny. Britain at War, & France in alliance with America. The Express is waiting which deprives me of the pleasure of touching on other Matters; I can only add my Compliments to your agreable Lady & Family, & remain wth much Esteem your Friend & hum serv, E Gerry  ""

  Sir, 26th May 1778 Since my last of the 11th Inst. by Post I have had the honor of presenting to Congress your Excellency's several favors of 26th April, 2d & 6th Inst. which remain subjects for Consideration.(1) Capt. Blount is here & will probably be the bearer of the Resolutions of Congress respecting them. In the mean time this will serve to Cover an Act of the 22d Recommending to the several States to exempt from Militia service & to disqualify for acting as Substitutes all prisoners & Deserters from the British Army & Navy.  Daily Accounts repeat the Enemy's preparations for evacuating Philadelphia-there can be no doubt of the appearance but time will shew the reality.  I have not had a Letter from General Washington later than the 18th, the General never trusts appearances.  The Marquis delafayette lately detached upon a Command of observation with about 2200 Chosen Men & Officers, had nearly been surrounded by 7000 from the City, betrayed undoubtedly by a Tory or a Deserter. The Marquis displayed great Generalship in his retreat which he effected without Loss of Men, Cannon or baggage.  Intelligence of his alarming situation reached the Camp at Valley forge, this was announced by the usual means of firing three Cannon. To the honour of Major General Baron Stuben, the whole Army in fifteen minutes were under Arms, formed & ready to march but the Enemy who had reached one Bank of Schuylkill just as Marquis delafayette had gained the opposite-contented themselves with giving him a look, perhaps a smile, he returned immediately to Philadelphia. The Marquis continues abroad with his detachment of observation.  I have the honor to be &ca.  ""

  Hond Sir York Town May the 27th 1778 I arrived here the 21st Inst. in the Morning. Mr. Wentworth & his waiter were Innoculated at Fish Kills the 13th, and rode with me to Reading about 46 miles from this place,  MAY 27, 1778  where by the advice of Genl Gates, they tarried till they should get thro' the disorder. Mr. Wentworth began to have the Symptoms about 20 miles before he arrived there. I have not heard from him since I left there the l9th.  I think it my Duty to inform you that the President of Congress thinks himself neglected in not receiving answers to his letters. He Desired to know of me whether our Governor had Receivd any letter from him for Eight months past: that he had Recd no answer to any of his for that time; tho he had taken particular Care to Send Duplicates as often as he trusted them to the Common posts. I Endeavoured to Excuse the matter as well as I could, by telling him that some of his letters were little more than covers to acts & resolves of Congress which were supposed to Require no other answer than a Compliance with their Directions: that I Believed Some answers had been sent since that time, which by reason of the irregularity of the post were not come to hand. He said that Every letter that he wrote by order of Congress, deserved an Answer, at least so far as to let it be Known that it was received; that the way to know whither any letter miscarried, was to keep up a constant Correspondance and note the last letter sent; that it would be but a small matter on the Receipt of Every letter to inform of its being Receivd, if nothing more; and when any thing was done in consequence of any order of Congress to let it be known &c &c &c.(1) The Confederacy is not yet Ratified, North Carolina being unrepresented & two or three of the other States not having impowered their Delegates to Confirm it; It is the opinion here that it will be Universally agreed to.

Lee & Mr. Ellery as they were standing together. Congress this morning added to the Marine Committee, numbers, abilities & diligence in the appointment of four or five auxiliary Members, among these Gentlemen Mr. S.

Three of the Six Nations have signified their desire to be at peace- the other three want a very little Courting. Marquis delafayette-but I refer you to the enclosed paper & save my distance.  My Compliments to Mr. Wharton & believe me, Dear Sir, your obedt. humble Servt.  ENCLOSURE Caution The Marquis delafayette having been detached from the Main Army with 2100 picked Men & selected Officers, aided by 45 Indians & about ten French Men in the Indian Corp, proceeded on the 19 May toward Philadelphia to observe the Motions of the Enemy & to make such advantages as circumstances should throw in his way.  On the 20th a proper Chain of Guards & Sentries were Posted to avoid surprize but however vigilant these were, the Enemy having received intelligence of the Marquis's motions by some means unknown to us, probably, from those worse than common Enemies, the Tories, Marched out in large force supposed to be at least 6000, about Midnight, & by a circuitous course passed beyond the Marquis's detachment & then divided by different routs in order to surround the American Troops. It then became necessary for the Marquis to Retreat. The Retreat was executed in most admirable order in presence of the Enemy's advanced parties of Horse. General Clinton who it is said commanded the British was so effectually deceived by the Retreat he judged it was an attempt to draw him into a Snare. This is the only apology to be made for the Commander whoever he was. The loss on our side was three Men Killed & four prisoners. The Enemy lost 2 Horsemen killed & six or eight wounded. When the Indians had discharged their fire upon the light Horse they set up the War Whoop & according to their Custom scampered off. The British light Horse Men terrified by the yelling of the Indians fled precipitantly the other way. The Indians picked up several of their Cloaks & converted them into Boots.  The Marquis's retreat had done him more honor than he would have gained by a drawn battle, or slight Victory.   Citizens are every day Stealing out of the City & deserters from the Enemy come into Camp in great Numbers. Appearances of an intention on the part of the Enemy to evacuate Philadelphia continue & indeed grow stronger, but We know General Washington never trusts appearances-his Army is in fine order & gaining strength every day.  If Mr Hopkinson thinks the above, which is a collection of facts, will afford information & satisfaction to the good people in Maryland he is at liberty to give a Copy to the Printer, but not this writing nor the writer's name.

My eyes are so extremely injured by their constant application, that without the aid and support of Spectacles I fear I shall soon loose the use of them. I pray you then to procure me a pair of the best Temple Spectacles that can be had. In fitting these perhaps it may be proper to remember that my age is 46, that my eyes are light colored and have been quick & strong but now weakned by constant use-My head thin between the Temples.  The British Army yet remains at Philadelphia and ours at Valley Forge about 18 miles from the City. The latter growing daily stronger in numbers & discipline; the former lessening in numbers by various casualties, but chiefly by desertion.

  Dear Sir York-Town May 27th 1778 Your favor of the 21st came safe to hand, together with the extracts of Colo. Piper's & Councillor Urie's Letters.  It may be well to make examples of some of the most wicked of the prisoners in Bedford as soon as practicable, but when I reflect on the Savages having scalped eleven women & children within five miles of the town of Bedford; that the people must be all in arms; that these criminals might escape for want of testimony or the Attorney General's presence, who cannot well bear the expence of so long a journey without some salary; that before a Precept could be sent to the Sheriff of that county, and the legal time for summoning Jurors &c being allowed, we should be in the beginning of harvest, with the court; and more especially that in great probability the Enemy may soon evacuate Philadelphia, which happening will require me immediately to resign my seat in Congress and to repair thither, as there will be an absolute necessity for a Judge on the Spot; I say, Sir, when I consider these things I am rather of opinion it would be adviseable to defer holding a court there yet.(1) As there will no doubt many more of these wretches be made prisoners, it MAY 27, 1778  would be as well in my judgment, to prevent the expence of two courts within perhaps two months, & try them all at once. If you think differently from me about holding the court in Bedford at this time, be so good to mention it to Mr. Atlee, who can write a Precept & sign it, and afterwards send it to me; he may fix any day for holding the court that he thinks proper, it will be agreeable to me.  I condole with poor Mrs. Wharton on the death of the President.(3) There is nothing new here. Jo.

  Dear General In Congress 27th May 1778. I have a Word to say to you upon the Subject of Promotion which we have just now finished or rather unfinished at least if that Matter was before in an unfinished Situation. That famous incomprehensible Baltimore Resolution (unluckily perhaps) introduced a very tedious Debate which terminated at Length by rejecting the whole of what the Committee reported with Relation to the Promoting of Officers.(1) You may be a little surprized when I tell you that upon the whole Matter I beleive this is best. But how? It is true I confess that much Ground of Heartburning is left under the Baltimore Resolution governing these Matters by the misterious Trinity of Seniority, Merit b Quota. Let me however on the other Hand observe that to tie up the Hands of the Republic as to the Officers whom they are to appoint is utterly inconsistent with the republican Principles of Government which ought to prevail among us. No Danger it is true can arise at present but my Dear Sir we are laying Foundations and how Posterity in future Wars may build on the Foundations laid by Ancestors whom they will certainly reverence No Man can be hardy enough to assert. What then you will say is the Effect of the now Rule? In my poor Opinion it is no Rule. What then is the Use of the Resolution? Nothing more than an Apology for Officers whom it may be found necessary to supercede. Congress in Effect seem to have pledged themselves to their Constituents that they will pay a due Attention to the Quota of Troops furnished by the States respectively, to the Seniority of the Several Officers, and to that Degree of military Abilities which Nature or Industry may have conferred upon deserving Individuals. You ask me what is to be the Rule of Promotion below the Degree of a General Officer. I answer that Congress would not with Propriety make any Rule. They have given to the States the May 27, 1778  Photographic reproduction of Establishment of the American Army, May 27, 1778 MAY 27, 1778  Power of appointing the Officers in their own Regiments;(2) of Consequence therefore it would be idle to restrict them as to the Persons whom they shall appoint. It will therefore be necessary to make Application to the several States on the Occasion. They have already I beleive in most Instances given you the necessary Power and if so then to fix the Order of Promotion will be only a Limitation of such Power. What are my Ideas on the Occasion you will see by the Letter I enclose directed to Governor Clinton(3) which you will do me the Honor to transmit to him.  I am Dr General, most sincerely yours, Gouv Morris  York Town 28th May We are going on with the Arrangement of the Army with charming Rapidity after a long stop. A very little Time will I hope compleat it.(4) I hear you expect soon to be in Philadelphia. In my Opinion the Instant the Enemy Evacuate it the best disciplined Troops in the Army should be marched in and the several Inhabitants ordered on Pain of military Execution to confine themselves to their Houses. Proper Persons should then be sent to the several Stores to make out Lists of the Goods contained in them. From these Lists you should mark the Articles which may be necessary for the Army, the Hospital and the like. The next Step should be to levy a Contribution of at least £100,000 Stg. in hard Money which ought to be apportioned upon the Inhabitants according to their Wealth and Disaffection. They may then be permitted to go about their Usual Occupations. But the Quarter Master should take proper Stores and therein lodge under Guard the Articles by you marked and Receipts should be by him given at the Rate such goods sold immediately before the Evacuation and duplicates of such Receipts forthwith transmitted to the Treasury Board. The Propriety of these Steps I will not debate upon. But should they be pursued I think the most beneficial Consequences would accrue to the public.(5) I am once more, yours,  Gouv Morris ""

You will therefore Sir do me the honor to receive this as private, which I dispatch partly to gratify your Messenger who discovers much anxiety to return, but principally from a feeling of my own, a repugnance to delay, holding coadjutors, in the Service of my Country, in suspense when 'tis in my power by any decent means to releive them.  The Acts of Congress of the 22d April & lately an Address to the people of the 9th May (2) were directed as from my self for your information of these important articles in our public proceedings. In the same manner I communicated those papers to other Gentlemen in your Quarter. Indeed I had entertained an assurance that you Sir, in particular ever active in promoting the public Interest would have made the Canadians as well as the Indians fully acquainted with their contents, but having received no direction from Congress, I could not from any consideration think myself entitled to request or even to hint.(3) I now take the liberty of inclosing an hand Bill & News paper containing other intelligence of the proceedings of Congress, possibly if the knowledge of the former were transfused throughout Canada good effects might be produced.  The public Letter which I had the honor of writing the 8th Inst. by Dodd will have informed you of the Resolves of Congress respecting supplies to the Indians.  Colo. Morgan is at present with his family at or near Lancaster. I expect his return to Morrow, Congress will then learn all that he knows relative to Atskeray (4)-solid peace with our Neighboring Indians is so desirable & so very Interesting, I am persuaded no time will be unnecesarily delayed nor any proper means left untried for Obtaining it.

I must not conclude, however troublesome I may have already been, without intimating, that Mr. Drayton yesterday shewed me some parts of an intended Report on the Ticonderoga affair, hence I expect that business will be speedily brought on the Carpet & finished.(6)  The moment I receive Commands from Congress respecting the Subjects of your Letters abovementioned a Messenger shall be dispatched with them.

  Dear sir, York Town 29th May 1778. Just as I had predicted when I had the honor of writing to you by Doctor Scudder the 25th, so it happened-the next Morning I presented your Letter to Congress-a Motion was presently made to postpone the consideration of granting a Commission to Monsr L'Enfant until the Army arrangement shall be completed & so it passed.(1) I then informed the House, I had heard the Baron Stuben who went through much Duty in Camp was reduced to the necessity often of walking on foot from a want of a good Horse-an order immediately took place, that the Quarter Master General provide two good Horses for the use of Baron Stuben-& by this conveyance I shall transmit the order.(2)  I conceive Sir, your Certificate hereafter of the usefulness of Monsr. L'Enfant in the Army will entitle him to Pay & Rations but I cannot hazard even a conjecture concerning a Commission until the arrangement is completed-this I hope will be in a few days.  I have not a scrap of News, nor any thing at present to add but the repeated assurance of continuing with the great Esteem & Regard, Dear sir, Your Obedient & Most humble servant,  Henry Laurens ""

  Sir (1) York Town, May 30th 1778. From the movements of the enemy and sundry intelligence received there are strong reasons to believe that they intend to quit their present quarters at Philadelphia, and from concurring circumstances it is apprehended they mean to rendezvous at some post or place to the eastward of Hudsons River.  If the Fleet should be bound to the W. Indias they may rendezvous in our commodious bay, in which case, unless our shores should be well guarded, the Troops may make incursions into the country, and lay it waste.  Genl. Sullivan will without doubt collect the forces under his command and post them in such places as he judges will best secure the country and prevent surprize.  Inclosed are the last Lancaster and York papers, which will give you all the news we have.  A Letter to the President of Congress hath announced your election MAY 30, 1778  to the place of Governor of the State of Rhode-Island, and Providence-Plantations, on which occasion your excellency will permit me to salute you.(2) It gives me great pleasure to see our late worthy Governor succeeded by a Gentleman so eminently distinguished for his patriotick firmness, and steady regard for the rights of mankind.

  Dear Sir, 30th May [1778] Two days ago, at the end of drawing, I collected the Numbers of the several Lottery Tickets which you had left in my hands, on the paper inclosed & sent to the Managers for information of their fate. The marks opposite to particular Numbers, contains their reply.  I am sorry 'tis not in my power to congratulate with your self & your friends on better luck. Congress yesterday Ordered the Managers to publish printed lists of all the Numbers drawn, each to be marked with its prize, this will afford us an opportunity for further examination, in the mean time, let me receive your Commands respecting the second Class & in whose hands to leave the Tickets when I return to South Carolina, an early answer is necessary.  The various accounts repeated every day but all tending to one point, the preparations of the Enemy for evacuating Philadelphia, has enlivened the hopes of almost every body of our re-entering that City in a few days. I am among the few who never trust to appearances in War. General Washington is almost silent on this subject, while other Officers of the next Class are felicitating themselves upon the prospect of being in Philadelphia in six days. Tories & other Citizens 'tis true have of late in great numbers abandoned that place & some of the very worst have taken the Oath of Allegiance & abjuration. The more persons General Clinton can persuade to leave him, the fewer will remain to consume provision which is become very scarce in his confines, & there is ground for suspecting stratagem because it is pretended he has forbid all persons leaving the City. Were he in earnest it would be impossible that so many hundreds MAY 30, 1778  should elude his vigilance. Tis said all the heavy Cannon & baggage are embarked, the Horses unshod for going on ship board. Admit this, how easy may the debarkation & shoeing be accomplished. My sentiment is, trust them not, reinforce Valley forge with all possible celerity, let the Camp be watchful against surprize. Sir Henry will know every step we take, if he finds we are upon our guard & will not be deceived, he will at least give us Credit for good Generalship, whether he goes or Stays. You have heard, but perhaps crudely, how narrowly Marquis delafayette escaped Burgoyning last Week. The inclosed narrative will inform you circumstantially of almost the whole of his adventure but as it comes from a young man nearly allied to me I request you will not suffer it to be published.(1) The Marquis has gained more applause for his Generalship in the late Retreat than would have been bestowed upon a slight victory.  I shall add to the papers already said to be inclosed a Pennsylvania Gazette & refer you to it for further intelligence. If Mr. Penn is still with you my Compliments & tell him I would have paid my respects to him if I had not reason to beleive he is, as he ought to be, on his journey to Congress.  The New intended 74 at New Hamshire, the building of which had been stopped, is now ordered to be finished with all dispatch, to have only two Decks, to mount 28 24 pounders below, 28 18s above upon a plan of Captn. Landais's, a skilful well recommended French Man & who 'tis probable will supervise the whole work & command the Ship (2)-This undetermined, is therefore only my conjecture.  [P.S.] This Instant I received an Accot from Camp strengthening all former of the Enemy's intention to quit Philadelphia.(3) Indeed very little doubt can remain in the most incredulous mind-but still I will not trust them. Generals Howe and Clinton were both out & with the whole Army with hopes of catching the Marquis. They lost many Men by the first Nights severe March 35 Miles. The 24th General Howe left Clinton the sole Command, embarked & dined with his Brother on board the Eagle.  I am with great respect &c.  ""

  Dear Sir, 30th May [1778] I had the pleasure of writing to you the 12th Inst & then transmitted all the Current intelligence.  Within the present Inclosure you will receive two News papers which will inform you in general terms of the present situation of affairs.  Every day brings us Reports of the Enemy's preparations for evacuating the City of Philadelphia. I have never put much confidence in these Reports, but after so long a time pretendly spent in preparations, I strongly suspect Stratagem.  General Washing[ton] I am persuaded is upon his guard & will not be amused by appearances. If they go, it will be known in proper time but I will not beleive them gone, until their ships are all fairly at Sea, in the mean time, their fairest shew will raise my strongest jealousy. Never trust an Enemy, is a maxim which ought to be invariably held in time of War, but how much more applicable is this Rule to such an Enemy as Great Britain, in the present War. That Nation or rather, the King & Ministry of that Nation, have been pleased to call us Rebels, & all their acts have demonstrated their opinions, that no faith ought to be kept with us, but when it shall be consistent with their own Interest, therefore my sentiment is-trust them not.

  Gentlemen May 30th 1778 We have to acknowledge the receiving of your favours of the 7th, 9th & 12th instant and to reply to their contents.  In answer to that of the 7th we are glad to hear of the arrivals you mention. We observe that you had offered the command of the Brigantine Resistance to Captain Waters who refused accepting it aledging he was intitled to a better vessel. We have determined that Captain William Burke shall command that Vessel of which you will please to notify him,(1) and inform Captain Waters that should he again refuse such command as shall be offered him, we will consider MAY 30, 1778  the propriety of dismissing him from the service.(2) You will have the Resistance fitted & manned for the sea immediately.  It was certainly out of the Line of your Department to have the receiving and storeing of Captain Greens cargo of Clothing & Stores- that was the business of the Continental Agent, who in the delivery thereof should be governed by the Orders of Congress, the Board of War or the Committee of Commerce agreeably to the enclosed Resolve of Congress dated the 28th Current which we send to prevent your taking unnecessary trouble in future.(3)  The schooner Loyalty which you dispatched to bring flour & Iron is safely arrived at Sennepuxent, and we expect by this time is Laden'd and ready to proceed back if not already sailed. We Observe what dificulty you have in procuring other suitable Vessels, and only wish that your exertions in that respect be in proportion to your want of those Articles. Principles of humanity & OEconomy direct the establishment of hospitals & that provision should be made for the sick seamen belonging to the Navy, and we doubt not Congress will consider that matter when time will permit. It gave us much pleasure to hear the Providence Frigate had got out but we are sorry to find that you despair of getting out the Trumbull. The Printers were premature in naming the New ship at Salisbury. The Congress have resolved that she be called the Alliance.  Mr. Vernon of your Board writes to Mr. Ellery of this Committee as follows: \""The two ships at Salisbury & Norwich are much larger than any yet built, will bear 18 Pd's. very well, at least 16 of their Guns may be of that Size and wish they were Ordered in time before these Guns are provided.\"" If you consider those ships as competant to carry sixteen 18 Pdrs. each we have no objections to their being put on board & should be glad to know whether guns of that size can be provided.  To yours of the 9th we shall answer that we are sorry Mr. Roach hath been so great a sufferer, and should be glad he would Accept of a Lieutenancy until a command can be given him.(4) As you think it would be proper to resume the Building of the frigate in Connecticut River we have determined so to do, and desire you will give the necessary orders for that purpose, agreeable to the plan you have proposed. We have not seen the Petition of the Hancocks officers we suppose it lies with the Secretary of Congress. We shall make enquiry and will duely consider it. We hope Strict enquiry and impartial judgement will be had on the conduct of Captains Manly, McNeill & Thompson. We desire that it may be a particular charge against Captain Manly how he came to surrender the Continental Frigate under his command without fireing as it is said a Gun, and summon Captain William Burke as an evidence on his and Captain McNeills Trial. We have already wrote you that we wished to have as many of   the Continental Vessels within your Department as can be ready in convenient Time fitted for Sea, and sent out to Cruize collectively against the enemy. It is our desire that the Warren should join this force and that our former orders respecting her should not be executed. We transmitted you the 23 instant 50,000 Dollars by Mr. Norton Brailsford an Express for your place which we hope will be adequate to the demands of your Department for some Time.(5) When you are obliged to draw we shall answer your Bills, but wish you to be as spareing as possible, as the heavy demands of the Army Departments keeps the Treasury very low. As you have not been able to procure a Hull for the Hamden's Rigging & Materials, we desire that you will order One to be built accomodated to them and employ Mr. Peck to plan the construction thereof.  In answer to yours of the 12th we approve of your drawing in favour of Mr. Shaw for 80,000 dollars and shall pay the Bill when presented. With respect to the ship Queen of France if she be calculated for a Cruizer we would have her employed as such, and joined with the other ships of war which you are to send out, but should she be a dull sailor and otherwise not well calculated for war, it is thought best to employ her as a merchantman, and in that case you will put her under the care of the Continental Agent to be employed agreeable to the orders of the Committee of Commerce.(6) As to the French officers on board that Vessel, they are become useless since the French Seamen have been taken away, and we apprehend it will be impracticable to man her with American seamen so long as they continue on board. We have [directed] therefore that they shall be discharged. Any Contract that may have been made with them in France we would have strictly fulfilled on our part, and you will either pay them their wages or give them Certificates to receive the same from our Ambassadors in France just as the Nature of their Agreement shall require. We are glad to hear the frigate Deane had arrived at your port, and hope she is again preparing for sea. Enclosed is a Resolve of Congress of yesterdays date respecting the ship on the stocks at Portsmouth heretofore intended for a Seventy four but now to be constructed as a 56 Gun ship. We have determined to resume the building of that ship immediately, and now write to Mr. Langdon for that purpose, and that Captain Landais in conjunction with him is to superintend the building of her. You will afford all necessary assistance in the prosecution of that business.  You will give strict orders to all Commanders of Continental Vessels of war, not to take any private property on board their Vessels unless by Order of Congress or this Committee.  We have directed the Continental Agent John Bradford esqr. to exhibit to you his accounts against the Vessels fitted out by order of General Washington, and all other accounts he may have with this  Committee, which you will please to examine and settle. He is to account with you for the Continental share of all Prizes already received, or that he may hereafter receive. This will be handed you by Captain John Barry whom we have appointed to Command the Frigate Raleigh.(7) He is a brave active officer and we doubt not you will find him very attentive to his duty. You will put him in possession of the Raleigh, and he will be governed by your orders. We have only to add that we hope your strongest exertions will be used in getting out the Vessels of war agreeably to your plan, and that their successes will repair the losses and honor of our navy.  We are Gentlemen, Your Hble servts  P.S. We have directed John Langdon Esq to lay his Accounts before your Board which you will please to adjust & settle with him. As we would not in any respect have the cause of Captain Manly prejudged, so we would not have it understood from what we wrote you of the 6th of March that he was by any means appointed to Command the new frigate Alliance.(8)  ""

This affair came into Congress in so vague a manner from a representation MAY 30, 1778  that our Treasury was exhausted, therefore the Requisition was made to Congress, without Mr. Craig's having it in his power to produce an Inventory or inform where the Goods were deposited, but in general that they were in the hands of a number of reputable people in the County of Lancaster, from these Considerations and plainly seeing that Congress would not comply with any such request, but through the State immediately or the Delligates thereof, I withdrew the application to have an opportunity to inform you, as also that I have not the least doubt but Congress would most readily advance the State for the Clothiers Department on a proper application as above.

  Dr. Papa, 31 May 1778 Mr. Henry's departure affords me an opportunity of sending you the Lan. & York newspapers. The letter in the former Signed Humphrey Thompson is a genuine letter, and is I think a most original piece in its way.(1) I think you should preserve it as a curiosity. From concurrent accounts strengthened by circumstances there remains little doubt of the enemy's intended departure from Pha. When they will leave that city is uncertain, but if we may judge from appearances, their stay in it will not exceed a week or ten days from this time. Perhaps they have already left it, or may leave it sooner.  There was a report a day or two ago that Spain had acknowleged our Independance and acceded to the treaty of Alliance, and of Amity & Commerce; how ever we have no confirmation of that report. It was also reported that war was not declared between France & England the 7th of April. A ship is said to be arrived at the Eastward which left Nantes on that day, and brings advice that war was then declared at least by France. We have no intelligence of the sailing of the British Commissioners.  I hope to hear from you by Mondays post that you are all well and that Molly continues to grow better. My love to her, the little ones, & Mrs. Darnall. I hope the fruit has not suffered by the late, or indeed  MAY 31, 1778  present cold weather; if this rainy weather should terminate in a northwester, I fear we shall lose it all.  I shall write to you again by Tuesday's post, and I flatter myself I may then be able to give you a certain account of the Enemy's having left Pha. Such an event would effectually stop the Spirit of Toryism and discredit the reputation of their arms with the European Nations.  By the latest advices from Europe a war in Germany seems very probable between the house of Austria & Brandenburgh. Wishing you health I remain, yr. affectionate Son,  - Ch. Carroll of Carrollton ""

  My Dear Sir, York Town May 31st 1778 I rec'd your's of the 10th of May a few days ago and wish I could give you any thing new and entertaining. The most interesting intelligence soon grows old, and we are constantly looking out for something new. I don't wonder that Solomon said all was vanity so soon as he had discovered that there was nothing new under the sun, for if it were not for the expectation of something new life would be but a dull scene, like an old reiterated tale. There would be an end to curiosity which stimulates to the acquisition of knowledge; and the world would be involved in one long night of ignorance and darkness. The most important intelligence that we could expect was, that Providence had disposed some European Power to stand forth in support of injured innocence and the violated rights of mankind. France hath been disposed to enter into an alliance with us and upon terms of equality and reciprocity, herein discovering a magnanimity worthy of the most Christian King. We have illuminations and fired our feu-de-jois on this occasion, and it is already become an old story. We are now looking out for further alliances and commissioners from Britain to treat with us. We have not as yet heard that war was declared between France and Britain. It will be inevitable unless Britain can bring down her proud stomach to relish sound policy, to acknowledge our Independency and make peace with us. Whether the haughty insolent Thane can stoop to this or not you are a good judge. I should with you, perhaps, have been willing that France should have continued in her usual way to have supported us, had not I in MAY 31, 1778  contemplation the divesting of Britain of every foot of land upon this Continent. I think it absolutely necessary to a future, lasting peace that we should be possessed of Canada, Nova Scotia and the Floridas, which we cannot so well effect without the open assistance of France. We have gained great reputation by our arms and humanity throughout Europe, and I believe even Britain herself begins to think us invincible. It is most certain that if she had not been secretly and openly aided by our own countrymen, she must have long since been compelled to give over her vain attempts. Hereafter when peace and independency shall be established, temptations to disaffection, the preservation of property and office, or the expectation of them will cease, and united truly like a band of brothers, we may bid defiance to the world. Commerce and Agriculture must be our great objects, the latter as the basis of the former and the former must be supported by a proper Marine. I wish we had a respectable Navy, but as matters are circumstanced we must go through the war with a small one. Your plan for a Navy is approved excepting that part of it which proposes the turning of the 74 gun ships into frigates which Mr. Landais, whom the Committee imagine is a very good judge thinks would not do. He hath proposed that they should be constructed to carry only two batteries; the lower battery to consist of twenty eight 24 pounders and the upper one of as many 18 pounders. In this way he says that the 56 gun ship will make as good a battle as a 74, be stronger, sail faster, take less men, be built quicker and be much cheaper. The Committee have laid his scheme before Congress, it was approved and I suppose the Committee will direct Mr Langdon to pursue the building of the intended 74 on Landais plan.(1) Our future frigates will be such as you describe; with two 56 gun ships and half a dozen such frigates under good Commanders, we should oblige our Enemy's ships to go in squadrons, or capture them wherever we saw them. But without brave skilful Captains it is in vain to equip fleets. I don't know which is the most criminal not to assist a ship overpowered by numbers, or to deliver up a ship without firing a gun. If the Devil were a coward I should think that he possessed some of our sea captains; but the Devil it seems, according to Milton, fought boldly against Michael and he is able and valiant enough, we are told, to maintain a dominion in our world even against the Messiah himself; from whence I infer the Devil wants neither courage nor stratagem. But to be serious, it is indeed melancholy to contemplate our little fleet; two frigates burnt in the North River, two burnt and one taken in the Delaware, one taken without firing a gun, and one lost for want of a pilot, I mean the Virginia. The story is briefly this. After being cooped up in the Chesapeake for more than a twelve month, she made several essays to get out, but to no purpose. Once she had almost reached the Capes, but the Lieuten-  ant, who it is said was well acquainted with the Bay, refusing to act as pilot she put back. Captain Nicholson informed the Committee of this cirucmstance, and that it was impossible for him to get a pilot without he had the assistance of Govt; whereupon the Committee wrote to Govr Johnston and desired him to empower Capt Nicholson to impress a pilot if one could not be otherwise obtained, and at the same time ordered Capt Nicholson to push out if a favourable opportunity should offer.(2) The Governor would not give him the power desired and he could not procure one to take the charge of his ship notwithstanding he made very generous offers. It happened at this time that the Purviances had a brig bound to sea with an old pilot on board. Nicholson agreed to give him £100 to pilot him out which he consented to; accordingly they set sail in the evening with a fine wind, ran down the Bay without any opposition until midnight, when they struck on the middle ground. After thumping some time she got over it, but leaked very much and her rudder was broke to pieces. In this situation they anchored and waited for day. When the day dawned they found two or three of the enemy's ships near them. Capt Nicholson ordered out the barge, and with some of his men, the wind blowing violently attempted to reach Cape Henry which he happily effected.  The enemy took possession of the ship with all her guns and stores, towed her up to Hampton Road, repaired or made a new rudder and have since sent her to New York. This acct as nearly as I can remember was given by Capt Nicholson to the Marine Committee and with this shall end the chapter of losses; for I mean to say nothing about the loss of smaller armed vessels, nor will I censure or acquit any officer. Committees of Inquiry are ordered upon Nicholson, Thompson, Manly, Hacker &c &c.(3) I hope that the inquiries will be strict and impartial. Congress have lately passed a resolution punishing cowardice with death. A little Bynging (4) would be of infinite service. Capt. Thompson is suspended and Barre appointed to the command of the Raleigh,(5) and it is proposed that the Warren and Raleigh should sail on a cruise in company. The Commander of those ships are brave men and I dare say will not loose their ships through cowardice.  New Hampshier is at last represented but the representation came too late. The Resolve, respecting half pay, had passed by a majority of one State only.(6) If N.H. had been present, Congress would have been divided. It first passed for life; but the majority being as small as possible, agreed to a kind of coalition and it was finally resolved that the military commissioned officers who should continue in the service to the end of the war should be entitled to half pay for seven years. The opposition which I think was justly made to the half pay establishment hath retarded the arrangement of the army so long that I am afraid it will not take place until next winter. It is proposed to  reduce the battalions to 88 which will of course reduce the number of officers, and lessen the quantum of half pay. The number of Battalions will continue to be reduced as vacancies of officers shall happen by death or resignation.  The argument you draw from the confederation was urged against the establishment and every method taken to get it to the States, but N.H. was not represented and so the minority failed, or rather there was a majority against referring it to the States.(7) Some consideration ought certainly to be made to the brave officers who should continue in the service to the end of the war, on account of depreciation and the hardship they have and may endure, and the risk they have and may run of health and life. Taken up in this light, perhaps three and half year's pay may not be too much.  I am exceedingly glad to hear that Dr Stiles and the greatest part of his family have safely got through the small pox. How the Dr mustered courage enough to encounter that distemper I cant conceive. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing him in New Haven, where I expect to be in my way home the latter end of June.  The interest to be paid in certificates in France ceased the 10th of March, and is not continued. General Lee and Col Allen are exchanged. The Clothier's agents are ordered to send forward such articles as they had purchased, and the shoes, stockings and linen and blankets lately imported from France and of which the Army are in want, are also ordered on, but the other clothing is directed to be stored in Springfield with a view of having a complete suit to put on each soldier in the Fall, to prevent their suffering as they did the last winter for want of clothing.(8)  Thus, Sir, I think I have given you a full answer to your long obliging letter. As I am about to return home soon, I must close my correspondence with you for the present. When I return I shall with pleasure resume it. In the mean time and always I shall continue to be with great esteem and respect, Your most humble servant, Wm Ellery  [P.S.] The Masstts representatives send their respects.

Mr. Clinton may get MAY 31, 1778  rid of many hundreds perhaps thousands of Mouths which were destroying his provisions become very scarce within his confines-& of a set of people whom he could not govern altogether by the Articles of War & his general Orders-of some who were daily spies upon his movements & critics upon his conduct, he may have in veiw to obtain elbow Room for his Garrison & he may in a very short space of time complete a debarkation of Horses, Cannon, baggage &c. He may entertain hopes also, to relax our proceedings for filling up this Army.  I will not trust him, I will not (although I beleive it) act as if I beleived he was going, until he shall be fairly gone. I would excite in Camp & guards double vigilance Night & day while he remained on this side or within the Banks of Delaware. Whatever may be his designs, go or stay, he will if we are watchful give us Credit, at least, for good Generalship. He knows every step we take.  I rejoice at the measures which you say are adopted for quieting the minds of those who are now under convictions of their errors & Crimes. Good Citizens may be made of many of them & I don't care how full of useful articles they leave for Sale in the City, there are some which I want & may lawfully purchase. Let me hear all that occurs & as minutely as your time will permit. I pray God protect you. Henry Laurens, President of Congress  [P.S.] In one of the Papers inclosed you will see an account which I wrote & caused to be Inserted of a Capture made at Frederica.(2) Those Vessels were certainly going to disburthen poor Breton Island of all my Rice in Barns &c, & the soil of all the buildings. As General McIntosh says he had not heard of the circumstance in Camp I presume you had not. Tell me how you have disposed of the little Pivot or how he disposes of himself, I have learned that he is now much disposed to adulate where he had betrayed & affected to dispise.(3) I cannot love or flatter that Man.  For once I have got hold of a string of English News Papers for the Month of February. Will these be acceptable to the General or to yourself, I will send them if you desire it.  ""

  Dear Sir, 31 May 1778 I did myself the honor to write to you the l9th Inst. by Messenger Sharp.  The News papers & Manuscripts which you will find within the present Inclosure will give you much Intelligence. I must not say this is all the time & place affords, but if you knew how closely my own time is applied to discharging the necessary duties of my present Station, you would rather wonder, at my finding time for collecting any news, than blame me for omitting minutia.  From the Copies of Letters from my son, you may if you please manufacture an Account for public veiw of the Marquis's late honorable Retreat, adding that this brave young Nobleman equally wise & discreet, has gained more glory by this late act than could have been derived from a drawn battle or a slight Victory; he must have been well supported by his officers who all participate of the honor. We are assured Majr. General Grant who had the Command of the 4000 that Marched out of the City near Midnight & who by a circuitous hard March of 35 Miles had compassed the Rear of the Marquis, is put under arrest for neglect of duty or breach of orders; had he trod the Ground assigned to him, he would have occupied Matson's ford, where the Marquis successfully passed & must have embarrassed our brave young Hero, who in that case would have been driven to a necessity of plunging into the River without time for ascertaining depth, must have lost his Cannon, Baggage & many lives. A Gentleman who was with the Marquis & who conducted the Retreat as Inspector, has just now sketched out the Marches of both, or rather of the various parties. General Grant instead of crossing directly to Matsons ford turned down a Road at some distance from the River. The Marquis Marched in view at some 300 (1) Toises distance between him & the River, gained & passed the Ford without loss or annoyance. This Gentleman, Monsr. Ternon has likewise given me the following account of the loss on each side which he says may be depended on.  British 3 Dragoons killed 3 Wounded & carried in a Cart to the City 1 Grenadier } } > Prisoners 2 Privates } 16 Deserters Union, 3 French Jagers of the Indian Corp killed 2 Missing. & possitively no more.  He confirms the account in very lively description of the flight of the British Dragoons upon hearing the Indian War Whoop, & adds that one of the French Jagers among the Killed had been most cruelly  MAY 31, 1778  butchered by the British. They had put him under ground but our people hearing of the circumstance took out the Body & exposed it to the view of the Soldiery. After the Marquis had crossed the River, Mr. Jno. Laurens, Mr. Ternon & a small party were ordered to return & reconnoitre. They followed the enemy & overtook them marching by a hasty step into the City. The Marquis had given early intelligence of his unpleasant situation, the alarm was fired in Camp & in fifteen minutes, to the honor of Baron Stuben be it said, the whole Camp was under Arm formed & ready to March. This alarm which the Enemy caught by sound, penetrated a little deeper & their precipitate retreat marks an indisposition to a general engagement.  I have this Instant (now candle light) a Letter from General Washington.(2)  \""The Enemy are still (28th) in Philadelphia but the intelligence from thence is so clear & so strong, it is as certain as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Against the various measures they are pursuing which point to an evacuation, I can learn but of a single circumstance approved. They are working at their Redoubts with great industry, but this last, tho' certainly true cannot be of sufficient weight to raise a doubt upon the subject & must be considered as merely calculated to deceive us & mask their design. We cannot by the most diligent searches discover whether their movement will be by Land or Sea.\""  The General has detached General Maxwell with a party to join General Dickinson in New Jersey & to annoy them if they go that way. General Smallwood is called in from Wilmington, no surprize is to be feared in that quarter, our Camp is strong & tis said impregnable. My own is at War with all opinions, except General Washington's, and a very few others. I am not inclined to beleive General Clinton is going, until he is fairly gone. When he has got rid of incumbrances & shall have received reinforcement what is to hinder him from Marching up the York Road & compelling our Army to take the Field. Observe I do not disbeleive, but knowing Mr. Clinton to be a Man of enterprize & deep stratagem, I dread the effects of security on our part or as I should say imaginary security.  A Gentleman just now called on me to read a Letter from New Jersey. \""The Enemy are shewing preparations for embarkation in New York. 'Tis conjectured a strong Garrison is to be left there & all the rest to go to the West Indies.\"" All conjecture.  Congress have ordered an intended 74 Gun ship building at Portsmouth New Hamshire to be constructed upon a plan given by Capt Landais a skilful French Sea Officer-to be of two decks only-on the tower to carry 28 24-& on the upper 28 18-pounder. She will cost less money, sail faster, be of equal force & require fewer Men by 150.  General McIntosh is here on his Journey to Fort Pitt where he is to  Command. This Gentleman has brought from Valley forge an high Character penned by the Commander in Chief (3) & an Address from the Officers of the Brigade which he commanded containing the strongest marks of respect, affection & applause.  The tryal of General St. Clair will soon come on, this is a subject too delicate to be treated with brevity, & on which candor forbids wanton prediction. Be the event what it may my original sentiment is confirmed.  The prospect of peace with the Six Nations which will be exhibited in one of the inclosed Manuscript affords me much Satisfaction.  The diligent Cheif Justice who has ten times more time for writing News than I have, will transmit to our Town ten times more than I am able to do. You will catch it all by some means or other.  I say you may manufacture from the materials which I furnish you with, being all to the best of my knowledge perfectly true, but I prohibit the disclosure of authorities. None of us are anxious to appear in print, & I am persuaded you will not willingly make an ill requital to your friends.  (I am Seriously projecting an Enterprize beyond Altamaha; General McIntosh to whom I disclosed my sentiments this afternoon is strongly united in them, but I enjoin you to keep this intimation to your self.) (4)  I rejoice in your good fortune, I know you are sober & vigilant, be steady & beleive me to be with great Regard &ca.  P.S. I have heard that Mr. R.H. Powell went some time ago to St Augustine. Pray tell me the rise, progress & event of that extraordinary circumstance.  I have been told the people about Red Stone have prohibited Tacitus Gaillard's proceeding down the Missisipy.(5)  ""

  Dear Sir, York May 31st 1778 Your favor of the 19th has just come to hand and I thank you for it. In proportion to my ardent zeal for the prosperity and security of  MAY 31, 1778  my country so were my wishes that Monsr. Loyeaute had been able to effect those valuable purposes for our Country that I own I thought him capable of doing.(1) I was the more intent upon this, as I well knew the necessity of what he professed to understand, and our utter ignorance of it. We may spend a great deal of money in this way, but I much fear it will be very late indeed, before we shall receive an equivalent in the protection afforded us. We have fortunately been but little tried yet in Virginia, and God of his infinite Mercy keep our enemies at a distance until we are better prepared to meet them.  The enemy, we are told, still continue embarking their Stores, heavy cannon &c, and the Universal opinion is that they will evacuate Philadelphia in a few days. It may be so, but they are so full of guile, it is no easy matter to penetrate their designs. Should a French war take place, they must go, and quickly too, to guard their W. India Islands, now quite defenceless. We have an account from Philadelphia that there has been an engagement between a French & an English fleet in which the latter has been worsted and lost two frigates sunk.

  Dear Sir, York-Town May 31st. 1778. Your favor of the 8th instant came to hand on the 15th,(1) but I had no opportunity of moving upon it until the 20th, when I had a referrence to the Treasury Board, who reported in two days in favor of the State, upon which I obtained the President's Warrant for ten thousand dollars. This money may be had whenever you are pleased to send for it. Mr. Thomas White's affair, and the hundred militia requisition were referred to Mr. Duer of New-York, Mr. Carroll of Maryland and Mr. Bannister of Virginia, (2) a Committee specially appointed early last winter to take the direction of Delaware, as it MAY 31, 1778  was understood that the Government was at an End, the President & records being captivated, no Delegates having attended Congress & it being reported that I had given it up as lost and therefore left it. The expectation of a report from these Gentlemen daily has prevented my writing to you sooner, but I find the settled opinion that the Enemy are about quitting Philadelphia, if not the Continent, is the principal cause of the delay, as it is thought should that be the case, White might be bailed, and the hundred men would be unnecessary; should the case prove otherwise, you may depend upon the men, as Congress are determined to support the Whigs in Delaware be the expence what it may.  The treaty of amity & commerce will be sent to each State, but the treaty of alliance with France will be kept for some time in Congress; as there was one Judas among twelve Apostles, there may very probably be a traitor to his country in most of the General Assemblies, or at least among their officers, and therefore it may be prudent to conceal the principal articles until the war commences between France and Britain, or some more suitable time. Believe me, Sir, if the United States of North-America had been recognized as Sovereign & Independent by all the Powers in Europe, and in the plenitude of Strength & Greatness, a more favorable treaty & alliance could not have been expected; this transaction equals in point of justice, generosity, policy & magnanimity any thing to be met with in history; it far exceeds my most sanguine expectations. We have just got an Account, that Spain has acknowledged the United States to be among the Sovereigns of the World, and has entered into a commercial & friendly treaty, but this is not received officially, tho' beleived, therefore we must not pronounce it true 'till further confirmation. The King of Prussia's Prime Minister has wrote to one of our Ambassadors at France, \""that after the King of France has recognized our Independance he will not ballance,\"" so that we may also expect soon to hear from that quarter.(3)  I am just now favoured with your letter of the 22d instant,(4) and would have set off for Dover without delay, only General Patterson tells me the General Assembly will not sit above ten days, which will probably make my journey there now useless. In my last I told you that I should attend them in the beginning of May; in answer I understood they were then about adjourning. This is unlucky.  When you send for the 10,000 dollars, you may send the draught in my favour for £90.0.111/2, and I shall take it out of this money, and remit the draught & a receipt to you. Have the General Assembly made any & what allowance for their Delegates? My Dinner alone, in a club of ten members of Congress at Widow Moore's tavern, has cost me on an average 26/ per day. No small State, and I am sure no private Gentleman, can well bear this expence; and yet I cannot do better.   Unless I have new powers respecting the Confederation, I shall be obliged to quit Congress next Saturday, as it is determined to go on that business tomorrow, and they expect in a few days to finish it. Be so kind to hint the necessity of these powers or instructions, and of a fuller Representation of the State in Congress.  In a few days I hope to write to you from Philadelphia. There seems to be no doubt but that the Enemy are about to quit Philadia. and the Delaware, if not the Continent. I believe they mean to embark at Blackpoint or at South-Amboy. It is rumoured, there has been a [battle] between the English and French, in which the former lost In[tirely] owing, the British officers in Philadia. say, to the great super[iority of the] latter in numbers & [metal?]. The British Commissioners are exp[ected].  Please to present my compliments to Messrs. Read, Killen, [. . .] meaning all my friends. Adieu, Dear Sir, Your most obedient humble servt, Tho M:Kean  P.S.

(1) The Arts you mention as being practiced by the Tories in Boston, to prejudice the People against our new Connection, are similar to those which I find on reading a late Philada Paper, are practiced there. The Danger of Popery is particularly held up by the Partizans of that King, who would wish to drain Ireland of its Catholicks to carry on his bloody Purposes in America. I do not wonder that a certain Gentleman, though of the Character you have describd, should joyn in such an objection. He may think it will give him Popularity among a particular Class of Men, & serve one Purpose which I beleive he has constantly in View; but I am satisfied that such a Suggestion will have a different Effect.(2)  I have receivd several Letters from my Friend Dr Lee since my Arrival here. Those by the Way of Boston are Duplicates, and contain Nothing of Importance more than what we receivd by Mr Dean. I wish you would revive in the House of Representatives the Proposition which was made last Winter relating to that Gentleman. I have an additional Reason inclining me to urge this Matter, which I will communicate to you at another Time, and which I am very sure you will approve of. At present I beleive you are satisfied that it is both Policy & Justice that it should be done.(3)  Congress has been pleasd to put me on the Marine Committee.(4) I mention this to you, in hopes that I shall have the Pleasure of receiving your Letters the oftener on that Account, & particularly on the Subject of the Navy, which I will use my utmost Endeavors to build up. The Committee have orderd a Letter to your Board by this Post.(5) Capt Burk is to have the Command of the Resistance which may be a Step to further Promotion hereafter.(6) The French Gentleman (7) who was fed with Promises at Boston and afterwards substantially releivd by you is highly esteemd by this Committee, and will be rewarded & employed & Capt Peck is not unnoticed. The new Frigate at Salisbury, though before christned by another Name, has that of the Alliance given to her by the Committee.  This Letter I intended to have finishd & forwarded by the Post, this Morning (June 2), but was prevented. Capt Barry who is to take the Command of the Raughley will deliver it to you.

  My Dear Sir, York Town June Ist 1778. Before you receive this, I suppose you will have rec'd the Order of Congress for going on with your ship, which is to be changed to a two decker and to carry 56 guns-viz 28 of 24 Ibs & 28 of 18 lbs.(1)  Mr Wentworth was innoculated at Fishkill, rode to Reading where he remained a week, is now here and attended Congress the day before yesterday.  As to news I have nothing material to write you. The substance of the treaty with France you know. The Ship which arrived from Spain only brought a duplicate of that Treaty. Spain will not accede to the treaty till the arrival of her West India fleet, unless drove to it by England. It is then expected she will act as openly as France. Our Ambassadors inform us Spain and Portugal have settled their disputes & Portugal has acceded to the family compact. The extract of a letter in the enclosed paper dated February 28th 1778 is from Mr Lee one of our Commissioners.(2)  The common opinion in the army is that the enemy are about to leave Philadelphia, while some suspect it to be only a political manoeuvre to draw our army into a disadvantageous situation and to attack them. The Tories are stealing out of the City and taking the Oaths to the State. We have no further account of the famous British Commissioners who are to restore peace to America. I believe before this time they are satisfied they will effect nothing unless they enlarge the powers given by their late act of Parliament. One of our Ambassadors tells us the British Ministry publicly gave out that they have sent half a million of guineas to pave the way to a reconciliation and that Lord North informed Count Maurepas that he was sure of a majority of Congress. To such vile shifts are they drove to prevent foreign powers from assisting or acknowledging us; but all will be in vain. Give my best regards to General Whipple and remember me to all friends. I shall hope to hear from you as often as convenient.  I am your friend and most obt servant, Josiah Bartlett  ""

These were referred to a select Committee, upon whose Report the Inclosed Act of Congress of the 29th is founded, to which I beg leave to refer as containing all the Commands I have received.(2)  The Enemy within the circumjacent lines of Philadelphia have for a fortnight past shewn strong marks of a design to evacuate that City, the embarkation of their Cannon & Baggage, their Horses & forage & the flight of many hundreds called Tories who flock into our Camp & into Lancaster & York in order to make their peace are evidences of such an intention, nevertheless I have doubts, & will not JUNE 1, 1778  beleive Mr. Clinton going, until he shall be fairly gone. If he can get rid of all the Citizens he will have fewer mouths to consume provision now become very scarce within his narrow confines. Philadelphia will become a complete Garrison subject altogether to Articles of War & his general Orders. There will be less danger from spies & fewer critics upon his general conduct-& if further, he can so far amuse us as to retard intended reinforcements for Valley forge until he shall be Strengthened by such as he himself expects. The debarkation of Cannon & Baggage will be an easy work & he will applaud himself upon the success of his Stratagem. I am happy in finding General Washington acts as if he had also his doubts, although in the last Letter received from him he writes-  \""The Enemy are Still (28th May) in Philadelphia but the intelligence from thence is so clear & so Strong, it is as certain as any event can be, that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Against the various measures they are pursuing which point to an evacuation I can learn but of a Single circumstance opposed. They are working at their Redoubts with great industry, but this fact tho' certainly true cannot be of Sufficient weight to raise a doubt upon the subject & must be considered as merely calculated to deceive us & mask their designs, we cannot by the most diligent searches discover whether their movement will be by Land or Sea.\""  In this State of uncertainty the General has detached General Maxwell with a large detachment to join General Dickinson in Jersey with orders to annoy the Enemy if a March through that State Shall be attempted, & has called in General Smallwood from Wilmington & I am well assured the utmost vigilance is observed in Camp. Twenty Six days have passed over Since General Howe or General Clinton or both have propagated the Report of the intended evacuation. If the object requiring their removal is important, they have certainly lingered away time in a manner apparently inconsistent with an important demand, but I will not be further troublesome with conjectures-a few days more will produce demonstration. The bustle & shew in New York is nearly similer to this in Philadelphia. There they have about 2060 British, 1250 Hessians & 2893 American Levies, & 100 Anspachers-this account may be relied on-& tis thought they mean to ascend North River by Land or Sea. If these from Philadelphia should join, the whole will be Strong, but I hope not too Strong to be Burgoyned. I should observe the computed number in Philadelphia is 8 to 9 Thousand greatly diminished lately by death & Desertion. The papers which you will receive Sir within this inclosure will convey some intelligence, the Letter from the Reverend Mr. Kirkland 3 gives a pleasing prospect of peace with the Six Nations, we are endeavoring to cultivate their present disposition into friendship by every proper means.

  Dear Sir, 1st June 1778. My last to your Excellency of the 14th Ulto.1 went by Messenger Sharp.  The Committee to whom Your Excellency's Letters of the 13th & 18th April had been referred having made their Report to Congress the inclosed Act of the 29th Ulto. was thereupon produced to which I beg leave to refer.(2)  Congress are truly sensible of the necessity of marking a limit to the Military in every State, be this as it may, from the tenor of a Resolve in an Act which I am to transmit to Georgia (3) there appears to me an opening for disputes between the Executive of a State & the officer commanding the Troops in such State. Even in cases where the Salvation of the State may be at hazard, a capricious, or a sensible Officer, according to my interpretation may under sanction JUNE 1, 1778  of this Resolve withdraw every Troop from a State whenever he shall judge it proper to do so, notwithstanding a former instruction.(4) At best it will encourage dispute. Being restrained within my now Sphere of Duty when this was offered I could do no more than intimate in private my now feelings to one of my Colleagues & to the Member who had framed the Act.(5)  As these Gentlemen received no impressions from my remarks, I therefore doubt the force of them. Nevertheless as I cannot divest my mind of its original Ideas on the subject, I take the liberty of Submitting my opinion to your Excellency.  The Resolve is general, concerns the whole Union & may particularly affect the State of South Carolina. I shall therefore subjoin a Copy for the information of your Excellency & the Executive of the State.  \""Resolved, (29th May 1778) that all Military Officers & Soldiers in the service of the United States are & of right ought to be amenable to the Laws of the State in which they reside in common with other Citizens, but as to the propriety of undertaking distant expeditions or enterprizes or other Military operations & the mode of conducting them the General or Commanding Officer must finally judge & determine at his peril.\""  A Commanding Officer as a little reflexion will shew, may shield himself in almost every Case by unanimity of voices in a Council of War & by means which have sometimes been practiced & which may again bc adopted.  Under this Resolution I conceive every Garrison may be Stripped if not of all, of the best Men by a Commander of Troops whenever he shall determine the propriety of a distant expedition. The want of access to a Military Chest may be some Check, but if there be danger in the power adventitious Checks I humbly apprehend cannot Safely be relied on for preventing the exercise.  I acknowledge I have not time at this Instant for examining & comparing the former Resolve alluded to above*--as I remember the General or Commander cannot March out of our State more than l/3d of the Troops without order of Congress or consent of the president. If this be all he can do now, why this new & general Resolve Your Excellency will judge & you will be pleased to receive this from me as a private & pardon me for making it the vehicle of the public Act first mentioned.  I shall do my self the honor of writing again by Capt Cochran such intelligence as the time affords but must at present conclude, which I beg leave to do with repeated assurances of being with great Regard & Respect, &ca.

  Dear General, 1st June 1778 I beg leave to refer to my last under the 18th May by Messenger Sharp.  The Committee to whom were referred the Letters from President Lowndes & your Self having made their Report Congress there upon formed an Act on the 29th Inst. a Copy of which you will receive within the present Inclosure for your information and government.(1)  General Clinton makes great shew of an intention to evacuate the City of Philadelphia & for aught I know he may be Sincere, but he has been so very long abou't the business, as to Strengthen the jealousies which I had entertained from his earliest pretence. If there be an absolute necessity for his going to New York, any part of the West Indies, Ireland or England, his dilatoriness is inconsistent with the necessity.  If he can so far alarm all the Tory Citizens as to get rid of them either by sending them to England & by suffering Thousands to fly to Camp & into different parts of this State he will have fewer mouths to feed, the whole City will become a Garrison governed by articles of War & his general orders-he will be less exposed to danger from Spies, & less harrassed by Complaints & applications from Cits, in plain Coats & broad Hats.

  My Dear, York Town lt June 1778 I believe my last Letter to you was by Brown, since which nothing Material has occurred. The Enemy are Undoubtedly preparing to leave Philedelphia and probably will do so within a Week. Whether G Britain will yeild the American Contest or rather than do so will engage in a War with France is yet unknown. If she has not already She must immediately take a decided Part in this Affair.  I find that I shall not Return home so soon as I expected when I wrote some of my last Letters. Mr. Ellsworth has lately wrote Me a Letter that in case Mr. Adams shall not come forward he will do so  JUNE 2, 1778  by the latter End of this Month. I trust that it will not be long before that I am releived.  By the Enclosed Paper you will find that None of us have made our Fortunes in the Lottery.

  Sir (1) York Town 3rd June 1778 Through the Smiles of Divine providence public affairs Seem to have taken a Surprising turn in favour of these United States.  It Seems almost beyond a doubt from repeated Accounts the Enemy are about to leave Philadelphia. We expect every hour to hear the City is evacuated, but their rout or destination is unknown. The Tories are in great distress, Some in despair are taking passage to fly their Incensed Country, others coming out of the City & taking the Oaths to the Government here.  We yesterday receivd advice by a Vessel arrivd at Baltimore in Sixteen days from Martinico that war was declared between France and England, but this I give you as Ship news that wants Confermation; however this may be, it is certain the favourable Sentiments of France, Spain & Other European powers with regard to these United States have Involved our Enemies in the greatest perplexity & Confusion.  The State of our Currency Seems now the greatest difficulty with JUNE 3, 1778  us & requires Immediate attention, tho, the Credit of Continental Bills is rising in these parts, Congress Seem to be Of Opinion that Regulating the prices of Articles by Law will be of no advantage in the present Situation of our affairs.

  Dear Sir, 3d June 1778 I had the honor of writing to you on the 4th Ulto by Messenger Cross.(1) Every day since has been prolific of intelligence but the great event which has occupied almost every one's conversation & expectation is not yet come. The Enemy, in all the bustle of preparation for evacuating Philadelphia, remained in possession the Ist Inst.  Within the present Inclosure you will find papers which will lay before you much of the Intelligence which I allude to, & from better hands. I trust Sir, you will collect from better hands such articles as are omitted in these. The Chief Justice, who has more time, is very Diligent in preparing a circular Letter full of matter, you will undoubtedly have the perusal of one of the Copies.  We have before us in Congress a plan for extending Commissioners & friendly commercial Treaties at the Courts of Lisbon, Hague, Stockholm, Copenhagen & St. Petersburgh.(2) Two whole days the subject has been upon the Anvil & very laboriously hammered. I have had the presumption to wish myself on the floor once or twice, from an opinion that even the little commercial knowledge I am possessed of might have struck light. There is not a Merchant present, & not a Book in Town to assist a Speculatist, but there's another obstacle to dispatch in this point, which as a silent spectator & auditor I can see pretty clearly & half understand-a plurality of Officers partly established & further aimed at. One of the Ministers at Versailles (3) who is Minister at Madrid, is tendered as the proper person to treat with Lisbon. The Minister intended, if practicable, for Berlin & Vienna( 4) it is proposed should negotiate with the Northern  JUNE 3, 1778  Courts; hence those minds, disposed to assign a Minister to a Court & no more, are embarrassed. Here a kind of delicacy, mark'd in my plain vocabulary, \""false,\"" restrains them from Speaking out, hitherto therefore the contest has been confined to advanced guards & now & then upon the flanks. If it became me, I should be very apt to carry arguments home by the shortest in-offensive course-in my present situation, however important the point, I do not see my duty in interposition either within or out of Doors. The Subject which has cost already two very precious days, will probably be postponed the third & possibly a very necessary measure too long delayed because some of us are not inclined to conduct it properly.  Captn. Landais a skilful Sea Officer has prevailed upon us to reduce in Stile the 74 Gun Ship which had been intended at Portsmouth. His plan which we have adopted, is to lay Decks only; to Mount on the lower 28 24 & on the upper 28 18-pounders. The building will be much less expensive-the Vessel sail faster-& be of equal force with 450 instead of 600 Men & now the workmen who had been taken off will be ordered to proceed.(5)  I am thinking very seriously of an enterprize against the place where you & I Sir once sent John Burnet, we may if the British Troops should withdraw & not pay Charles Town too serious a visit obtain proper Officers & Men for beginning the operation the Ist November, the most proper Month in the twelve.(6)  The Remark which I made on our Treaty of 6th Febry. respecting Bahama & the latent views of Spain, were not a little exploded here,(7) but since we have been told, that Court is desirous of repossessing Pensacola,(8) which might have been predicted without pretension to much depth in politics. Gentlemen begin to reflect our feelings however are generally porportioned to the distance from danger. New England's jealousies are excited by the proximity of Canada. Carolina sees the destruction of her Commerce, from Bahama & Florida in the hands of an Enemy, I say nothing of Georgia because she is not represented.  I have the honour to be &ca.  P.S. Major General Conway is just come to town in order to explain his meaning in a Letter of April, which Congress in his opinion had mistaken, and immediately notified him that his Resignation was accepted.(9) If he fails of success in that point he intimates to me his hopes of a Recommendatory Certificate of his behaviour-whether this alternative will be listned to, is doubtful. Gentlemen feel keen resentment for the unprovoked gross affronts which he offered in January last to our worthy Commander in Chief; besides, he has been strongly charged with malconduct in other respects which it seems incumbent on him to answer, before he can expect general countenance in Congress.  P.M. The forepart of this day devoted to Selling the Bear's Skin, (l0) it might have diverted you Sir, to have heard the variety of sentiments delivered in each extreme upon this momentous Subject. The wrangling of two honest Lawyers who both mean the same thing is no novelty, but the manners of two Chief Justices (1l) in conducting their debates were curious enough, & if other people were right they were both wrong. People are anxious to know how we shall dispose of the goods, Wares & Merchandize which we shall find in the City. Some seemingly Wise, some very foolish many premature propositions must be expected in a three hours discussion of this nature. A new Report may reconcile all opinions to mine, delivered only here, & which for aught I know may be ranged in the second Class-\""take especial care to guard against removal of any article after the Enemy shall have withdrawn. When the City is actually in your possession dispose of the Men & remaining property consistently with Justice, good Policy, & the Laws of the State.\""( l2)  L.B (ScHi).  1 Laurens' last extant letter to former South Carolina president John Rutledge was actually written on May 19, 1778.  2 See Committee of Congress Report, June 1, 1778.  3 Laurens inserted an asterisk at this point in the text to key the following note at the bottom of the page: \""A L\""-that is, Arthur Lee.  4 Laurens inserted an \""x\"" at this point in the text to key the following note at the bottom of the page: ' W L\""-that is, William Lee.  5 See JCC, 11:555.  6 Laurens may be referring to an expedition against St. Augustine, although Congress had just sustained Gen. Robert Howe's refusal to participate in an attack on East Florida proposed by the government of Georgia. See Laurens to John Houstoun, June 1, 1778, note 2. On November 2, 1778, Congress did authorize Gen Benjamin Lincoln, Howe's successor as commander of the southern military department, to undertake an expedition against East Florida, but the British invasion of Georgia the following month thwarted the plan. JCC, 12:1091, 1116-21.  7 See Laurens to Rutledge, May 4, 1778.  8 Arthur Lee had reported this intelligence about Spanish intentions in his February 10, 1778, letter to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, which according to the endorsement was received on May 18. See Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 2:491-92; and PCC, item 83, fols. 127-34.  9 For a discussion of Congress' acceptance of Gen. Thomas Conway's resignation, see Laurens to Washington, April 28, 1778, note 3.  10 Laurens' allusion to the old adage \""catch the bear before you sell his skin\"" was stimulated by the delegates' debate this day of a committee report on the purchase of \""cloathing and other Articles\"" for the Continental Army that might be left behind after the British evacuated Philadelphia. JCC, 11:564 65. This report was prompted by Washington's request for guidance on the subject in his May 31-June 1 letter to Laurens. Washington, Writings (Fitzpatrick), 11:498-500.  11William Henry Drayton and Thomas McKean. 12 The resolves on this issue that Congress approved on June 4 did not precisely correspond with Laurens' suggestions.

  Sir, York June 4th, 1778 I am ever loath to intrude on your Excellency, as I well know the great embarrassments attending your important sphere do not admit of any unnecessary or fruitless Correspondence, but I am as sensible of your attention to the most minute Circumstance which has a tendancy to promote the common Cause, therefore permit me to inform your Excellency that the want of Smelters of lead is the only remora now in the way of supplying your Army in the most speedy & ample manner with that necessary Article, now transported from distant parts of the Continent, from a vein of Ore in this State, within nine miles of the navigation of a branch of Juniata. A large quantity of Ore is at the pits mouth, a mill for stamping constructed, & a Furnace will be finished, I expect within ten days from this time, but Artificers of the above Class are so scarce in this young Country, that having tryed to obtain them by advertising and from Deserters from the Brittish Army, I am at length constrained reluctantly to trouble you on the Subject. Colonel Scammell hints an expedient of sending into Philada, to bring out such, with a promise of a handsome reward. I would most cheerfully give such reward, but know not how to set about so hazardous an enterprize. My own mind has suggested the probability of such Characters being in your own Army, and whether they, only three wanted, can serve their Country equally in the capacity of Soldiers. One Edward Harris a Sergeant of the 15th Virginia Regiment has been mentioned to me as a man of sobriety, integrity and ingenuity in analyzing Metals, but does not profess to be compitent to JUNE 4, 1778  the Business on a large scale, he has been spoke to in my behalf by Major Clark, and is willing to be enlarged on furlow to make a tryal.

It Seems a Cowardly Tory of large Landed Estate in York County had fled to the enemy in Philadelphia the winter past, & when he discovered the movements of the enemy shiping their Stores, baggage &c of late; Indicating their departure he applied to their General to know what He should do, the General replied he was busy & sent him to an under Officer.

The Tory Still dissatisfied told him all this was come upon him for being loyal & faithfull to the King & queried what shall I do, I expected protection. The officer replied go seek a  JUNE 5, 1778  passage on board some vessel &c. The Tory with vehement anxiety queried but what the Devil shall I do with my Estate, The Officer replied, Damn you! why did you not Stay at home & fight to defend it with your Country & so dismissd his applicant.

  Dear Sir, 5th June 1778 (1) I have before me Your Excellency's favor of the 1st (2) which reached me late last Night & at the Same time one for General Conway which I delivered to him.  Your Excellency put rather a hard task on me by desiring me Speak to Congress on behalf of General Conway after referring to Your Excellency's Sentiments of that Gentleman; nevertheless I had determined in the most proper & becoming manner to have presented the Marquis delafayette's message in his favor, had not the General himself put it out of my power.  JUNE 5, 1778  General Conway called on me this Morning & after some time spent in a manner which appeared to me very extraordinary he expressed his \""Surprize that I had delivered to Congress his Letter of 22d April intimating his desire to resign his Commission\""-said he \""had intended it a private confidential Letter, that he had also written to the president of the Board of War & expected I would have conferred with him upon the Subject, instead of doing so, I had made a private Letter public.\""(3) All this & much more of the same specie, were expressed in manner & terms altogether dissonant from the General's former soft mode of address. I had thought that I had learned to be surprized at nothing, but in this instance I discovered my mistake, I was greatly surprized at the weakness & wickedness of the attempt.  I replied to the General, \""if I have erred it has been unwittingly, Your Letter appeared to me to have been intended for Congress, I never had the honor of a private Correspondence with General Conway, it would have been improper in me to have conferred with the President of the Board of War, if a conference had been expected why had not the president called upon me. You injure me exceedingly by the imputation of exposing in public what was intended to be private. I feel my self satisfied that this behaviour is unprovoked & unmeritted, but General, the Letter is at hand, let us appeal to that. I have really forgot the Contents.\""  I then sent to the Secretary's Office for the Letter, the perusal of it Heightned my surprize. I shall take the Liberty of enclosing an exact Copy in order that you may judge Sir whether it had been designed to be private. The General has delivered me a Memorial directed to Congress,(4) I intimated that with his memorial, \""I should deliver also his Letter of the 18th [22d] April & take the sense of Congress whether it was private or public, that if it should appear I had acted improperly, I would make every becoming concession.\""  Accordingly I appealed to Congress, I could do no less under so gross a charge. The House were astonished & condescended to offer a Resolution in my favour, which I declined with thanks, adding \""that their opinion was satisfactory to me without further trouble-the Letter would always Speak for itself.\"" The General's Memorial was ordered to lie on the Table, & although I am sure there were Gentlemen present who had been disposed to speak in the General's favor, yet there was not a dissenting Voice.(5)  Your Excellency as a Man of honor & feeling I am persuaded will be surprized too at this very extraordinary circumstance, but how much more when you are told that on the 18th May the General wrote to Congress & apologized for the former Letter by saying he was an Irishman & therefore hoped proper allowances would be made for his mode of expression, which had not been intended to   give offence, or words to this effect for I have not the Letter before me.(6)  The Letter in question of 22d April is undubitably public.  On the 18th May the General acknowledges it to be so by apologizing for its tenor.  On the 4th June he modestly avers upon his honor that it was intended to be private & in the face of the Letter maintains that position.  Sir I am happy in a mind capable of forgiving the greatest injuries & incapable of Malice. I would now rather do General Conway a favor than requite his injustice but I desire never again to converse or correspond with him.(7)  I request Your Excellency will be so obliging to shew this to Colonel John Laurens & also the inclosed Letter.(8) I have taken up so much of your Excellency's time & have also so many other Letters to write as renders it necessary for me to conclude.  I shall have the honor of writing again in a day or two. Mean time I continue with the highest regard & Esteem.  ""

  My Dear son, York Town 5th June 1778 I wrote you a few hasty lines this Morning, immediately after which I had occasion to wish that a little dash of hypocrisy had been thrown into my frame. In came General Conway with a Letter in his hand & in an obsequious address, different from that of yesterday, asked me if I were sending Letters to Camp. I decently replied in the affirmative, desiring him to put his Letter upon the Table, it should be forwarded with other dispatches immediately. So far duty in Office demanded good manners on my part. He then asked in a low & soft tone \""did not the Marquis delafayette Mr President write you in my behalf\"" & was proceeding to further conversation, I felt the injury he had attempted, & instantly replied, I have really forgot General Conway & I must beg Sir you will excuse me.(1)  I had informed him yesterday Morning so very explicitly that the Marquis had writ to me & he had extorted from me repetitions of the same so very often, I judged it necessary to intimate that my memory was as defective as his own, & by begging him to excuse me, I meant, from all future conversation or correspondence. If this honest & frank proceedure is censurable then I have cause to wish for a little dash of hypocrisy, but upon a fair estimate of my past life & a review of a multitude of extraordinary circumstances which have chequered it, I find a Balance largely in favor of honesty & therefore I cast out the wish.  You will have seen my Letter of yesterday to the Marquis & General Conway's of the 22d April. A Copy of this shall be inclosed & also Copy of his Letter of the 18th May-lay these together & tell me if I could notwithstanding my general maxim resist against surprize at the audacity of a Man who should in rude language in my own House charge me in presence of one of my Secretaries with having made a confidential private Letter, public, to his prejudice-& repeating the same in a Memorial to Congress, charging me with the Memorial in order that I might exhibit & Read my own Indictment.(2) You will observe in this Letter of the 18th May he acknowledges the Receipt of mine the in which he had been informed that his former Letter of 18th [22d] April had been presented to Congress &c.(3) Can there be a stronger instance of effrontry than appears in his conduct by trumping up a pretence on the 4th June that his Letter was private, confidential & not intended for public view. Congress happened at the reading of his Memorial to be very full; every Member seemed struck with amazement & although there were several Gentlemen who I am sure would otherwise have pressed warmly for some kind of handsome dismission to him, there was not a dissenting voice to the Order for dismissing his Memorial  JUNE 5, 1778  without consideration. I' ll trouble you no longer about this compound of weakness & impudence.  You will oblige me by transmitting if you can procure the Philadelphia account of the late Military excursion, particulars of General Grant &c.  I am still of opinion that there is stratagem in Mr. Clinton's proceeding, possibly he may be preparing for withdrawing his Troops Upon the arrival of the expected Commissioners, from an opinion that we shall persist in our late Resolution.(4) Consider 'tis above a Month since he or his predecessor propagated the account of their intended removal, the object which required it, if any must be of importance-have his motives been consonant, certainly not. I therefore smile at the various opinions which I hear solemnly delivered, for the disposal of effects in the City & view them equally shrewd with his who sold the Bear Skin.(5) You must have another Ceremony, before he moves, for Exchange of Prisoners, he will find it very expensive to remove them by water & very troublesome & hazardous to take them a Land March through New Jersey where he must expect to be harrassed. In a word, 'tis impossible to trace minutely his designs-don't trust false fires-watch his motions & [be] double guarded.  My Dear Son, I pray God to bless you. Henry Laurens  [P.S.] Inclosed you will find a Dominica Gazette containing a Letter from Lancaster &c. When you have done with it I beg you will return it.

  Dear Sir,(1) York-Town. June 5th. 1778. Upon receipt of your favour of the 26th Ulto. I applied to some of the members of the Board of war respecting the Instructions they had given to General Pulaski for inlisting Prisoners of war, and was told they had given such, and had wrote to you about it; this made me think it unnecessary to write to you, but upon examining the Acts of Congress on this head I found the Board were wrong, and that no prisoners of war can be inlisted in that Legion, or in any JUNE 5, 1778  other Corps. Congress decided accordingly yesterday, of which you will be informed by the President.(2) Tho' we have a surplus of privates of the Enemy at present after exchanging our own, yet they have Citizens and may make more prisoners; besides from my knowledge of the human heart I am convinced that if these prisoners of war were to come to a close & hot engagement with the enemy, the fear of the latter in case of their being made prisoners would induce them to seek safety in flight.  Your favour of yesterday is come to hand, and my opinion, respecting the propriety of admitting the persons proclaimed traitors by Council, is as follows. The Proclamation amounts to no more than a charge of treason, the not surrendering by the day prescribed is full conviction, and the Act of Assembly pronounces the judgment (if I may use the phraze) or attaints the party.(3) Now if the Evidence amounts to no more than common fame, or public notoriety, that the party named in the proclamation had left his usual place of abode and gone into the city of Philadelphia, without some proof of an Overt-Act, such as bearing arms, or annexing his person to the troops of the Enemy as a pioneer, labourer or soldier, or furnishing them with provisions, or intelligence &c and he surrenders himself within the time limited in the proclamation, I should think he ought to be bailed. The Justices of the Supream Court, in Termtime, or any one of them, in the vacation, have a discretionary power to bail in all cases whatsoever, even for murder or treason; but the general rule is, if it stands indifferent or doubtful in the opinion of the Judge, whether the party is innocent or guilty, he ought to be bailed; if the evidence of guilt preponderates it should be done with caution; if it is clear the party should be committed and no Bail taken, unless for the cause of sickness, or an infectious disease prevailing & spreading in the Goal &c. Agreeable to this opinion I have admitted James Bracken of this county (whose name is inserted in one of the proclamations) to Bail, and shall in all other cases conduct accordingly; but I am not satisfied that a Justice of the peace can take bail in these cases, I think he must either send the party to a Judge of the Supreme court for examination or commit him.  After a sufficient time has elapsed for discriminating, the Sta[te may?] no doubt grant a general Pardon, excepting your cruel fellows & some men of property, whose estates really ought to be confiscated, tho' their lives are spared. Parricides should at least give some evidence of repentance before they are forgiven, and they deserve the punishment of suspence at any rate. The application and interest that will be made by the relatives & friends of the culprits for mercy will create respect to the Rulers, and their granting it on every reasonable occasion will reconcile & endear men to the   Government: besides Pardoning is a God-like power, and a God-like virtue.  I am, dear Sir, with my best respects to Mrs. Atlee, Your most obedient humble servant, Tho M:Kean  ""

  My Dear, York Town 5 June 1778 My last to you was of the Ist instant which you probably will receive from the Post Office Hartford. Nothing Material has occurred since then. We do not hear that the Enemy have left Philadelpa, but they undoubtedly will do so in a Very few Days if they have not already done it. The most of their Ships it is said are gone down to N Castle. A most dreadfull Anxiety excercises the Philadelphian Torys. The capital ones go off with the Enemy. Others less guilty determin to trust to the Clemency of their Country. Steps are taken to Obviate some Mischief which might be apprehended upon the first Evacuation of the City-so that I hope the Disorders which might be otherwise expected, will be prevented. It is supposed the Enemy will in the first Instance go to N York-from thence it is not improbable Many will go to the West Indies. Indeed I should not think it Very Strange if the whole should leave the Continent in a short Time, for if G Britain enters into a War with France the Forces which she has here will be wanted to Defend her own Dominions. If she shall chuse to Avoid this War and shall admit our Independence, which I JUNE 5, 1778  rather expect, her Troops will be unnecessary here. My own Opinion is that G Britain will not continue a Land War in this Country-and I am perswaded that the proud Spirit of that Nation is more humbled than it ever has been since it had an Existence. This great Variation in the Circumstances of our Affairs \""is the Lord's Doings\"" and it is truly Wonderfull. May We ascribe it, to that Great Cause which produces all the Good which We Experience.  I imagine that Congress will Return to Philadelphia within a forthnight or three Weeks as it is Very desirable to regain the Ground which has been lost. Altho for myself were I to continue in this Country during the summer I should much preferr being here than to be in the City.  I have heard Nothing from you since Brown came down. I hope that a mercifull Providence takes care of you and the Family. I trust it will not be long before I shall see you. You will know sooner than I shall when it will be-as it will depend upon my being releived.  I mentioned in my former Letter that I had been informed precisely of the Events of the last Election, by which it seems my Freind was greatly mistaken. Had it indeed been otherwise I should not have suffered but a Slight uneasiness.  Oliver will attend to the objects of Peace. The War will have but a Very Short Duration in my Opinion. The Tickets of which I took the Numbers are all drawn, Blank, so that We must Venture again. I Wish as you have Opportunity that you would let me hear from you. By a Letter from Mr. Elsworth I suppose it is probable that he will not be here sooner than by the End of the present Month.  A Recommendation of Congress goes by this Express to our assembly to suspend or Repeal the Regulating Act. My Love to my Children and Freinds. By the Blessing of God I do and have injoyed more Health than ever I did before on this Service. I am, Yours most affectionately, Oliver Wolcott  ""

  Dr. Papa, 7th June 1778. I think I acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 27th past in my past letter. I imagine the vines, by the dying of the old wood, must have suffered principally from the wetness of the winter, and of the month of April & if So, this mischief must have been encreased by the flatness of the beds in which they are planted. The failure of apples in the home Orchard must proceed from the nature of the Soil, and its exposition; the soil is stiff, cold, & livery.  Friday evening the Congress received letters from Ld. Howe, & Sir H. Clinton inclosing 3 acts of Parliat. two of them comformable to the drafts of bills, which you have seen, & the 3d An Act for repealing the Act for altering the Charter of the Massachusets Bay. Inclosed you have copies of the above letters;(1) they were directed to Henry Laurens Esqr. President of Congress. By the Acts it appears that 5 Commissioners are to be appointed to treat under the powers within the Acts; and from the Letters of Ld Howe & Clinton you will observe that Ld Howe is one of the Commissioners, but that Sir  JUNE 7, 1778  H. Clinton is not, from which circumstance I conclude that Sir Henry's command is to be but temporary, and that some person of distinction is coming out to be commander in chief, probably Lord Amherst.(2) Altho' it is mentioned by Ld. Howe, or Clinton that these Acts were just recd., we know the vessel which brought them, has been arrived upwards of 3 weeks. The answer of Congress, which was sent off yesterday is short, and to this effect.  The President in the name of Congress acknowleges the receipt of their letters & the Acts of Parliat. and refers them to the Resolves of Congress of the 22d April upon the bills (from which the Acts do not materially differ) for the sense of Congress upon the acts. He then informs them, that when the King of G B shall be seriously disposed to peace and to put an end to the unprovoked & cruel war which he has waged against us, we shall chearfully consent to put a stop to its calamities by concluding a peace with his B. Majesty, on terms consistent with our Independance, the interest of our constituents, and the sacred regard due to our treaties. I could have wished the words \""seriously disposed,\"" {'unprovoked\"" & \""cruel war\"" had not been thrust into this, otherwise unexceptionable, letter. Ld. Howe's & Clinton's letters are polite, they seem to have cautiously avoided any terms which might give offence; in this particular I wish we had imitated their example.  It is certain most of the Enemy's shipping have fallen down the river below Newcastle; it is equally certain that they have embarked their sick, wounded, heavy baggage & artillery, great quantities of military stores & merchandize, yet notwithstanding all these appearances, it is my own opinion, that the Enemy will not abandon Pha. till the fall, or till they are constrained to leave it by the superiority of our arms. If they should not acknowledge our Independance, they will take the field with their army light and unencumbered, and endeavour to try the fortune of a battle. I do not think they will acknowlege our Independance before next winter, unless the King of Prussia, and other powers of Germany should have followed the example of France. If the British Marine should not be greatly superior to that of France & Spain, it is my opinion the British court will acknowlege our Independance, & thus avoid a war with France & Spain in conjunction with us, which would probably end in the entire expulsion of the British from this Continent. Our General thinks the Enemy intend to march thro' Jersey to South Amboy. They have got and it seems are getting many boats there with an intent as it is conjectured to pass their army over from thence to Staten Island. A few more weeks, or perhaps, days will ease us of the anxiety of all conjectures on this account.  Gen. Schuyler writes to Governor Morris, a Delegate from New York, that he is informed the northern Indians are disposed to quit the British interest & to embrace ours. If So, this will put a stop the  cruelties the middle Indians are committing on the frontiers of this State. But to restrain their ravages we shall not depend on that event: a force is preparing to march agt. them to carry the war into their country.  Monday morning 8th June A 52 Gun Ship is arrived from France at Hampton in Virga. assigned by Mons. de Beaumarchais to his Agent here Mr. Francy; She has brought a most valuable cargo, the prime cost of which in France Mr. Francy assured me was a million of Livres.(3)er cargo consists of a great variety of articles, amongst others 8 thousand suits of regimentals.  Mr. Francy informs me that he has letters from France of the 29th March acquainting him that the King of Prussia had marched 60 thousand men into Bavaria, that they had taken possession of 3 towns & a fort from which they drove the Austrian garrisons, that the Emperor had ordered 60 [thousand] men to the support of his troops already in Bavaria. That war was declared between Russia & the Porte; that the French had detained all the English vessels in their ports in consequence of a refusal from the court of London to deliver up an American vessel taken by an English privateer on the coast of France, and which had been demanded by the Court of Versailles.  I wish the war between the Prussians & Austrians may not take off the attention of the French from their marine & approaching war with England.  P.M. 8 o'clock I recd. yours of the 4th instant by the post this morning. If you petition the Assembly for a repeal of the tender Law, I hope you will avoid all indecent & waste expressions in it. You may urge very forcible reasons in decent & moderate language. You ask me whether I think the continental bills will be redeemed according to their tenor? If peace should be concluded in a year from this I make no doubt, our debts will be paid off. Consider what Sums will be collected by taxes, from the amount of our own; consider the growing population of this country, the variety of its products, its fitness for navigation & commerce, and the freedom of our different governments, and then I believe you will no longer doubt the Public faith. Too many are interested in the debt not to pay it off; it will be the work of time, and perhaps a part of our paper currency may circulate in Europe; if so, the remainder will rise to par in a year or two after peace. It gives me the greatest Satisfaction to hear you continue to enjoy yr. health. I am, yr. affectionate Son,  Ch. Carroll of Carrollton P.S. I beg you will send Sam up so as to be here by the 20th instant;  send by him a £100 in large bills chiefly; every thing here is inconceivably dear; altho' I have kept no horses here my allowance will hardly make me whole; indeed I believe it will not.

  My Dear son, York Town 7th June 1778. I wrote to you the 5th & the same Evening late your favor of the 4th came to hand. Casting my Eye on my Copy Book just now I was startled at the dates prefixed there to Copies of Letters which I writ yesterday to the Commander in Chief, to Lord Howe & to Sir Henry Clinton all, May, instead of June. If the originals have carried the same blunder, I shall be much ashamed. 'Tis impossible to develop the secret from my Copyists memory because admitting the first error to have been mine, if his senses had been awake he would have pointed to the error immediately. If the Letter to the General is misdated I shall conclude both the others are. You asked me some time ago why I did not employ a Secretary, I'll tell you I don't know where to get a good one-& I can't bear any other. James (1) can Copy extremely well when he is attentive, but his constitution is not the strongest, he sometimes flags & some times nods. I do not wonder at it-but I do, how I hold it out. I have a sort of Secretary, a genteel decent Young Man but I get very little from him,(2) he has been spoiled in another office & has acquired habits which are to me very disagreeable. Congress meet twice a day, the consequence of which is delay of business there and intolerable confinement to the President.  The Idea of the Enemy's intended abandonment of Philadelphia, pervades every mind, & I am very certain our Cause suffers greatly from the general belief of an event being at hand, which we ought to think depends wholly on our own exertions & to act accordingly. Thirteen days have elapsed since the Enemy's draught of three days provision & Canteens filled with Rum-Women & children embarked, Hospital utensils & Boxes of Arms shiped, notice given to the Police & honest Mr. Coombes's intelligence. I should think none JUNE 7, 1778  but women & Children will rely upon any thing they [say] or trust to any thing they do-yet there is such confidence in their flimsey assurances. I was going on to write you a long Letter but an opportunity instantly presenting & being anxious to acquaint his Excellency the General with a recent act of humanity on the part the Enemy in the moment of treating with us I shall confine myself to the following extract from General Sullivan's Letter 26 May, just received.(3) The Chief Justice regrets we had not this intelligence before the Letters to Lord Howe & General Clinton were sent.  \""I beg leave to inform Congress that on the Night of the 24 Inst about 600 British & Hessian Troops at R Id embarked on board two Ships of War, two Tenders & about 30 flat bottoms, passed up the River & landed before day between Warren & Papasquash point, at daylight marched in two bodies for Warren & the head of Kukemull River where were about 70 flat bottom boats & one of the State Gallies, they burned all the Boats, 12 escaped & set fire to the Galley, this was afterward extinguished with much hurt to the Gally-then set fire to the meeting house at Warren & to seven dwelling Houses k retreated toward Bristol where the Ships had fallen down with the Hat Bottoms to receive them. They burned in Bristol 22 Houses among which was Govr Bradford's in their Tour every species of Cruelty was displayed, 20 of the Inhabitants were taken & carried off-almost every House was plundered without distinction between friend & foes. Some Women who had been long noted as their faithful friends were compelled by the Bayonet to stand while they were robbed of their Buckles, Rings, handkerchiefs &c &c. I received intelligence of the Landing about 8 oClock, the Country was immedy. alarmed, the Troops put in motion & lest an attempt might be intended upon this place or the Western Shore some part of the Militia were called in to guard them. The rest were Marched toward the Enemy, all the Massachusetts ordered to meet & oppose them, they assembled with great alacrity & marched with much expedition. Colo. Barton ordered to Muster what force he could on the Road to assist Colo. Crary's Regiment stationed at Bristol & had [got] into the Enemy's Rear. The Colo. with Crary's Regiment & such force as he had collected in all near 200, attacked their Retreat & I believe did them much injury-the Gallant Colonel dangerously wounded in the action. I arrived on the ground l/2 past 11 oClock. The Troops from this place & a large body of Militia were about 2 Miles in the Rear, many of them had marched near 20 Miles in less than four hours. When I arrived the Enemys Rear had embarked & gone near an hour. I know nothing of their loss-we had 2 or 3 killed, several wounded & 5 taken.\""  The Chief Justice charges me not to conclude without presenting his Compliments. Adieu, H L JUNE 8, 1778  [P.S.] If the General has not received the above it will be proper to communicate it. I am very full of bodily pain but supported by Spirits which are not worn out. You will receive 4 Letters inclosed-3 I believe from Harry,(4) he writes a fine hand.(5) I am almost determined upon sending for him.

An Answer was returned to his Lordship & the General in which they are informd that \""When the British King shall be seriously disposd to put an End to the unprovokd and cruel War waged against these united States, Congress will be ready to attend to such Terms of Peace as shall be consistent with the Honor of independent Nations, the Interest of their Constituents and the sacred Regard which they mean to show to Treaties.\""(1)  Will you permit me to recommend to your Circle Mr. Doree the Bearer of this Letter. He is a French Gentleman and is mentiond to me by my Friends in this Town as very deserving of Notice.  Be so kind as to call on my dear Mrs A and let her know that I am in health & have not Leisure to write to her at present.  My Regards to Mrs Savage, Mr Scollay & his Family &c &c.

  Dear sir, York Town 8th June 1778 My Colleague Mr. Drayton having shewn me about a fortnight ago the draught of a Report which he had prepared, stating charges against the General Officers who lately abandoned Tyconderoga & flattering me with assurances that he would soon offer it to Congress I delayed replying to Your Excellency's favor of the 29th Ulto.(1) hoping for ground to intimate that, that business was ready to be dispatched to Your Excellency for the further necessary order. But to my great mortification it continues to be procrastinated, some of the Gentlemen of the Committee it seems are or have been desirous of new lights; in a word Sir, I am quite in opinion with those Gentlemen who say \""the not proceeding in this matter is cruel & oppressive\""-although I am as well convinced, the delay has not been calculated or intended to distress the parties affected-it has arisen from a vapid desultory habit, which if I am not mistaken, I have seen, squander Millions & endanger States. I speak with warmth & I believe with equal truth. On my Country's account as well as from a feeling for the Culprit Officers I am really ashamed of our conduct respecting the particular affair in question-however as I can always take a decent freedom with my Colleague, who is really a diligent Man, I will not let him pass a day unreminded of the necessity for bringing forward his report. I sent off a Messenger to day with a Letter to Lancaster (2) at his request for collecting somewhat relative to the business & I think he hinted that when that ingredient should be obtained the Report would be complete.(3)  Frequent Items have been given in Public of the disagreements of our Commissioners-this day a private perusal of Papers treating on that subject gave me much pain.  I fear an investigation upon the arrival of Mr. Deane who is every hour expected will spread the trouble wide. I have suppressed all that has been written to me & have sealed my Lips except to Your Excellency & one other Gentleman. I know all the Gentlemen yonder, some of them very intimately, know their tempers & habits & think I can mark out causes, but I can only deplore their impolitic & I was going to say School Boy jarrings & dread the consequences of a heated & injudicious discussion on this side.  9th. Late last Night Your Excellency's public Letter of the 7th was brought to me.(4) I shall lay it before Congress at 10 oClock. Lord Abingdon's protest does honor to Mr Morris of N. York,(5) the merit of our Resolves of 22d April is fairly to be ascribed to him.(6)  I have lately much regretted that I had it not in my power to transmit to Your Excellency some of the English Papers which we had received & which indeed came originally into my own hands but  JUNE 8, 1778  judged it my Duty to present them to the House, where they were so, & so suddenly, dispersed as to deprive me of the reading even one of them, yet I dare not say, I'll take better care another time, my own duty will be to do, as I have done.  In order to save time I have sent to the Secretary's Office a Young Man to Copy the Resolves of Congress required by Your Excellency, & which will be found here inclosed.(7)  I am with the most sincere Regard & Esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's much obliged & most obedient servant,  Henry Laurens [P.S.] Your Excellency will do me the honor to accept this as private.

  Dear Sir June 8th. 1778 I fear I omitted to send the Resolve of May 5th with 3 past Packets. I shall be vexed if it does not reach you with the Ratifications as, on the Timing of it depends much of its Propriety.(1) I was strangely betrayed by its having been dated the 4th in a mistaken alteration, when A.B.C. were sent Eastward. JUNE 8, 1778  By Letters yesterday from Mr. Beaumarchais I find Mr. Deane is probably on this Continent so that we may know the exact State of our Account wth. Mr. Hortales.(2) The present Cargo in the fier Roderique is to be sold outright for Cash or Produce, Congress having the first Offer it belongs to Mr. Beaumarchais not to Hortales &c. I hope there is no mystery in this, for I really approve of the Thing. I am glad it does not belong to the Continent: but I wish to know whether any of those Vessels lately taken belong to Mr. B and whether this would not have belonged to H had it been lost. This may be an amusing Speculation for you.  Mr. D's Recall I find is attributed very much to Plots of A L.(3) You know this to be unjust, and that Facts are as in my Letter to Dr. Franklin.(4)  All things speak the Enemy's departure from Philada. Intending to pass across the Jersies to Staten Island they found the Militia to a Man ready to waylay them and that some Continentals were detached: They have therefore given an Air of Peace to their Motions, and asking for an immediate Exchange of Prisoners \""because they are going away,\"" they are levelling their Works, as we repeatedly hear tho the cautious Genl. has not yet told us the latter part but he was surprized that they \""still\"" remained on the 1st. They meant however to celebrate the 4th there-the birthday of the foolish King.  Mr. S A (5) has come forward, and Things go on very well here except that we want many Lessons on Finance. Give them to us-with a little Practicability, if you please, wrought into your nicest Systems.  Affectionately, J L [P.S.] Let Mr. A.L. see the inclosed.  ""

  Sir, 8th June 1778 York Your letter of the 2d instant was put into our hands this morning by Col. Smith, and referred to the board of war.(1) We sincerely wish the State of our cloathing at or near the army may be Such as to Suffer that Board to give the order in the extent you desire. Col. Smith will receive their answer tomorrow. We hope, and have the strongest reason to believe, our army will never again be exposed to the same inconveniences & distress they have hitherto suffered from the want of cloathing. We understand 8 or ten thousand suits are in the 50 gun Ship lately arrived in Virginia, and still larger supplies have arrived at the Eastward.  By all accounts from Camp & Philadelphia the Enemy appear to be on the eve of evacuating that city: it is conjectured they will march thro' the Jersies to South Amboy, where it is said a number of boats are in readiness to carry them over to Staten Island.  War between Prussia & Austria respecting the division of the late Elector of Bavaria's territories by the latest accounts from Europe is much to be apprehended: and Mr. Francy informed us that war was certainly declared between Russia & the Porte.  The French court had detained all English vessels in their ports in a consequence of a refusal by the Court of London to deliver up an American vessel captured on the coast of France by an English Privateer.  We inclose you copies of letters from Ld. Howe's & Sir Henry Clinton's letters to Gen.

  Sir, Pensylvania York Town June 8th, 1778 Mr. Marchant arrived at this Town the sixth Instant.(1) The Situation of Mr. Ellery's Family necessitates his Return in a few Days. Confederation, it is expected, will soon be taken up;(2) and if Congress should determine that, immediately upon the Completion of that Business, no State can be represented without two Members, the State we have the Honor to represent may not have that Share in the Common Counsells of the States, which Our Interests and Circumstances require. Solicitous this may not be the Case we hope One of Our Colleagues will soon give his attendance. We lament the Waste and Destruction made upon Our State by that more than Savage Barbarity peculiar to Britons; But we are utterly at a Loss to account for that cruel Desertion of Our Sister States, which has thus laid Our State bare to the Insults and Ravages of Our Enemies. This is a Subject we feel most pungently, and shall not fail to endeavour to excite in Congress a common Feeling with us, that if possible some Steps may be taken for our Relief.  It is expected the Enemy will very soon leave Philadelphia, but for what Quarters is uncertain. We hope the New-England States will hold Themselves in watchful Readiness. The Enemy ought to be expected in every Quarter, that so let them come where they will, They may meet with a proper Reception. A large Ship from France of Upwards fifty Guns is arrived to the Southward, with large Supplies for Our Army.

As to that, Sir, I shall not ask your consent, nor that of any person in or out of the army, whether my Precept shall be obeyed or not in Pennsylvania.

When you are ready and the boys put in order for school, you will be so good as to send Sam immediately for me. It will be as convenient for us to go by the place where the boys are to stay, in our way to Newcastle county, as any rout we could take.

In a very few days I expect Philada. will be evacuated by the Enemy, and on that event I must push there, and take a house, while rents are low.  Lord Howe & General Clinton have at last found out the way of writing to Congress. We had a letter from each, directed to Henry JUNE 9, 1778  Laurens Esquire President of Congress at York-Town, on Saturday morning; they let Congress know that they have it in command from His Majesty to lay their Acts of Parliament before Congress, and to communicate them to the Commander in chief of their Armies &c. Congress referred them to their determination on the 22d of April last, and let them know whenever their King is seriously disposed to put an end to the present unprovoked & cruel war, Congress will be ready to conclude a peace upon terms honorable to Independant Nations, and beneficial for their Constituents &c.

  My dear Hetty Mr. Henry's June 9. 1778 I got down here the Day after I left you & found a Number of Philadelphians hovering round the Camp in sure & certain Hope of soon entering the City-in which they have been much disappointed. There appeared on Friday every Reason to believe the Town would be evacuated in a few Hours, but that Evening the Commissioners arrivd, viz. Ld. Carlisle, Govr. Johnston & Mr. Eden-when an immediate Stop was put to all farther Embarkation, a great deal of Baggage was brought back & some Goods relanded. In short Appearances are now as much for their Stay as they were against it last Week. There has been no formal Annunciation as yet of the Arrival of the Commissioners but it is expected hourly. Most of those who have been mischievously active against us are going with them, but many of the Country Refugees have come out to sue for Grace & among them my Friend Lusely. Even Mr Galloway has made an Attempt for Favour, but Genl. Clinton would not permit him to go on with it, so that he is now going off with them, if they should go. On Saturday under the Protection of a Flag I went down as low as Vandering's to see what Mrs. Yard had done but found nothing. Jacob Baker has gone in to day & I have sent a Message by him to her. Mr. Pettit does not seem so well recovered as I had expected, his Hands are very much broke out, he sets out for York Town tomorrow both as a journey of Health & Business. The Army strengthens very fast & both Officers & Men make a much more reputable Appearance than they did formerly. There is the utmost Appearance of Harmony & that all Faction & Opposition of every kind has ceased. Mrs. Washington & the other Ladies except Mrs. Knox have left Camp. The Commissioners say positively that there is no French War & I am inclined to believe it. Many Persons are very sanguine that the Enemy must evacuate Philadelphia after having sent their Baggage &c. off but I doubt that Event is not so near as they wish but when the Operations of War will be & how soon the Campaign will open I am much at a Loss to determine. This Morning the current Opinion is that they will do what they should have done last Year, go up the North River & cut off our Communication with the New England States, but I do not see how they can leave this Army behind them with any Reputation, or what Success in that Quarter could ballance the Discredit of leaving Philada. & giving up the middle States. I came over from Camp on Sunday Evening with the full Intention of setting out early in the Morning for Fleming Town, when I received a Message from the General that I was appointed one of a Committee to arrange the Army with him & that the other Gentleman might be hourly expected. The next Morning I received a Copy of the Resolve & as it is a Business of much Importance & admitting of no  JUNE 10, 1778  Delay I concluded to stay rather than have it wait for me. I do not know how long it may take us but I should think it cannot exceed a Week-when I shall immediately return to you. By that Time some certain Judgment may be formed of the Enemy's Intentions of leaving Town on which my Journy to York Town will depend. I could wish to hear from my dear Hetty in the mean Time in which Case you will direct to me under Cover to Mr. Cox & Mr. Pettit in their publick Characters, so that it will be opened if they should happen to be absent.  I have given you all the News & would have sent you a Lancaster Paper if I had one-tho I do not recollect that there is any Thing of Consequence in it.  I am with Love to the Children & your Mamma, my dear Girls, ever faithful & affectionate, J Reed  [P.S.] You will find in some part of the Desk in your Room some Papers wrappd in a News Paper, viz. the Establishment of the Army & others relating to the same Subject.

  [June 10, 1778](1) Your Committee to whom were referred the Letter from Caron de Beau Marchais to the Committee of Commerce dated at Paris the twenty third of March last and the Letter from Chevallie to Congress dated at Hampton the 28th of May last beg Leave to report.  That having considered the said Letters it is their Opinion that the Mistery in which the Transactions of the House of Roderigo Hortalez & Co. hath been hitherto involved cannot be fully cleared JUNE 10, 1778  up at present and that it would be more prudent to wait the Arrival of Mr. Deane or at least of Mr. Carmichael who being more acquainted with those Affairs may throw Light upon them useful to Congress or those whom they may employ to investigate it. Your Committee are the more inclined to this from the Consideration  1. That the Continent being (upon every Principle) already much indebted to Monsr. Beau Marchais should the present Cargoe appear to be the Property of these States a proper Deduction from his Account may hereafter be made. &  2. That the Contracts entered into with his Agent Monsr. Franci will be amply sufficient for that Purpose should the Debt of these States not be so great as is above supposed.(2)  Wherefore your Committee are of Opinion that without entering into an Inquiry where there is not suflicient Evidence to attain to any fixed Conclusion it will be proper to consider the Cargoe of the Ship Le Fier Roderique as the Property of the said Monsr. Beau Marchais And to purchase from his Agents such Articles as may be necessary for the Use of these States.  In order to determine what Price may be given for such Articles your Committee beg Leave to observe that the Returns of the said Cargoe being to be made in Tobacco it will be necessary to estimate the same accordingly. That the Average Price of this Article formerly was about four Dollars per Ct. and at present about twelve, being three times the former Price. That if upon £100 Stg. in Commodities £100 be allowed for Charges, Freight, Insurance or Risque and Profit then calculating Dollars as high as five Shillings Sterling will be 800 Dollars which formerly would have purchased 20,000 Ibs of Tobacco and that Tobacco will now sell for 2,400 Dollars Wherefore there should be allowed from this State 2,400 Dollars for every £100 Stg. of Commodities. On the other Hand if he be allowed £300 Stg. per Ct. on the outward and the same on the homeward bound Voyage amounting to 900 Stg. or 20,000 Livres being the Price of 10,000 Ibs of Tobacco in France then Tobacco being here estimated at 12 DD the same would amount to 1200 Dollars on every £100 Stg. But further as it is the Interest of these States to state the Price of Tobacco low it may be proper to contract for it to be delivered at the Rate of 10 Dollars per Ct. in which Case the amount according to the above Calculations would be 1000 and 2000 DD per £100 Stg. Wherefore taking a Medium of 1500 may on the whole appear proper to limit the Price not to exceed the Rate 1500 D. or £450 Virginia Currency per 100 Stg. to be paid in Tobacco at a Price not less than 10 Dollars or £5 Of the same Currency.  Your Committee further observe that in order to avoid all Competition between Purchasers it will be proper that as the Governour of Virginia is in Treaty for the Cargoe to apply to him to purchase   for the united States such of the Articles as may be necessary for them under the Restrictions above mentioned.  And your Committee beg Leave further to observe that the said Monsr. Beau Marchais having by his Agent offered to Congress a Contract in the Alternative either to pay in France for the Goods he shall transmit with all Costs and Charges, Freight, Insurance, Interest, Commissions &ca. or that he shall transmit the same at his Risque to be paid for in America at the current Price. And Congress having chosen the former have thereby in the Opinion of your Committee exposed themselves to great Fraud and also to the Loss of the Goods which will not probably be transported with such Care when at the Risque of these united States as when on the Account of the Individual shipping them. Besides as it is probable that Goods will become much plentier by an open Commerce with France they will probably come much cheaper purchased here than in Europe. Wherefore they conceive it would be proper to alter the Contract with Monsr. Franci if he shall incline thereto. All the above disagreed.(3)  The Committee &c Report the following Resolutions (4)  Whereas by the Letter (5) of Monsr. Beaumarchais it appears that (6) the Cargoe of the Ship Le Fier Rodrique is to be offered to Congress to be by them purchased or such Part thereof as they may think proper in Preference of all others: And whereas his Excellency Patrick Henry Esq Governor of Virginia is in treaty therefor with Monsr. Chevallie the Consignee of the said Cargoe (7) Resolved that Govr. Henry be requested to purchase [for] the united States the Articles contained in the List hereto annexed being part of the Cargo of the French Ship Lefier Roderiques (8) as cheap as he can not exceeding the Price following to wit £450 Virginia Money for every £100 Stg. to be paid in Tobacco at ten Dollars per Ct. And that a Letter be written to his Excellency explaining the Principles of such Limitation. Agd.(9)  Resolved that the Commercial Committee be directed to confer with Monsr.

  Sir 10 June 1778 (1) Authentic intelligence received by Congress from many quarters leave it no longer doubtful in what manner the Enemy mean to conduct their plan of Conciliation. Under delusive appearances of pacific Acts and Peace-making Commissioners, already their Military Reinforcements begin to arrive, and already they have commenced the Campaign in many places with Acts of cruelty and devastation.  Indian irruptions and burning houses, in the moment of dispersing propositions for Peace, evince the insidious designs of the Enemy and demonstrate the necessity of wisdom in Council; of strength and vigour in the field. The former may be employed to distress the Enemy greatly, by withholding from them the provisions of America, and the latter by quickly collecting powerful Armies to take advantage of their present weakness.(2)  The present moment unimproved may be productive of most pernicious consequences, and the public safety demands strong and united efforts.  Experience hath shewn that the Marine force of our Enemies enables them to secure, for the support of their Armies, almost the whole of our exported provisions, and therefore Congress, impressed with the necessity of preventing the supplies derived to our foes from this source, and desirous of supplying the Armies of the United States, have, upon mature deliberation, laid an Embargo on provisions of all kinds, and they earnestly request the vigorous exercise of the powers of your State to carry into effectual execution this most necessary measure. JUNE 10, 1778  The urgent necessity for the provisions with which your State is to furnish the Army, induces Congress to press upon you, Sir, immediate and constant attention to this important business, and the present absence of the Enemy's ships from the Bay of Chesapeak may be improved by seizing the opportunity of water conveyance to the Head of Elk.(3)  ""

  Dear Sir, York Town Penna. June 10. 1778. I should have done myself the honor to have informed you of our arrival and of some other matters before this, but my worthy colleague on closing a letter a few days since acquainted me that he addressed it to you-and had given you such information respecting the ship and other affairs as he thought necessary.(1) I therefore hoped to be excused if I delayed writing for a short space. I trust the alteration in the vessel can by no means disconcert any plan of your's. How far it may benefit, or injure the public, I am incapable of Judging.  The enemy at Philadelphia for three weeks past have been doing and undoing-one day extremely busy in fortifying and the next in demolishing-in short their manoeuvres are so various as to render it utterly impossible to guess what measures they mean finally to pursue. From every circumstance however their intention to evacuate the City is beyond doubt; how long that step may be retarded by the late arrival of Commissioners from England is altogether uncertain. The Commissioners have directed their General to apply to General Washington to obtain a passport for a Dr Ferguson, Secretary to JUNE 10, 1778  their King's Commission, to wait on Congress. General Washington has submitted the matter, which is not yet determined upon.(2)  I hardly think Congress will have the honor of seeing those gentlemen Commissioners very soon, unless they comply with measures which from the present conduct of the enemy we have little reason to expect. They have come out for the pretended purpose of settling the dispute to the mutual advantage of both parties and their army have very lately commenced another campaign with marks of cruelty peculiar to themselves. The barbarities committed on the defenceless inhabitants of the frontiers of this State and of Virginia by the savage Tories and a few of the British troops are almost incredible; means are now devising to put a stop to such tragical proceedings.  I do not recollect any thing further worth communicating, but as any matters of that kind shall turn up you will doubtless have them from one or the other of us.  I pursued my plan relative to the small pox and had the disorder very favorable.  We had an agreeable journey enough for the times, though we were considerably hardshipped in passing through Connecticut being often pushed to find provender for our horses or entertainment for ourselves-occasioned partly by the multiplicity of travellers, but principally by the wisdom of partial regulations, that State you know having come fully into the mode of restricting prices. Before that happened I imagine a traveller must have met with most excellent fare; for we could scarcely ride a mile without reaching the sign of a sign. So powerful were the operations of the Act that nothing but the posts were left standing. I am too well acquainted with your generosity to attempt an apology for troubling you with the letter to Mrs Wentworth (3) and should she forward to your hands a letter for me, I must presume on your kindness so much further as to desire you to cover it in a line.  I am Sir, with great esteem your much obliged and obt very hble servt, John Wentworth Jr  ""

We have been in hopes ever Since we arrived here that we should soon get back to Philadelphia, But the accounts from thence are so various & Contradictory and the arrival of the Brittish Commisrs at that place makes the Enemys Design of Removal Somewhat Problematical. If they mean to Evacuate the place, I Expect it will soon be Effected, as Genl Washington  JUNE 12, 1778  has Removed our army towards the City. The latter End of May Genl Clinton & Lord Howe Sent the late famous acts of the Brittish Parliament to G. Washington and Requested leave to Send out a person to him, which He Refused & informed them that if what they had to Communicate to him was what came under the military Department, He Desired it might be Sent him in writing, but if it was of any other nature their applications ought to be made to Congress; the Begining of this month they sent the same acts in a letter Signed by Ld Howe & G Clinton Directed to the President of Congress Signifying their being authentick Copies & saying they wished they might have the Desired Effect, the Congress Directed the President to inform them that when the King of England was seriously inclined to put an end to the cruel and unprovoked war he had waged against the United States they would readily concur in all proper measures Consistent with the Rights of Independant Nations, The Interest of their Constituents & the sacred Regard they owed to Treaties.

My application to business for a few days past has been extremely intense, I dare not detain the present Messenger an hour, from these considerations I rely upon your Excellency's indulgence-and I must also rely upon the Chief Justice for giving to the Public in So. Carolina the present current interresting intelligence more copiously than my time and avocations will allow me to attempt.  We have advice from Mr. Bingham Esquire agent at Martinico that many, I think he says, all American Prisoners had been discharged from confinement in the English Islands-many of them had arrived at Martinico. If I were to measure the humanity of the English Governments by the practices of British Commanders and Officers here, the conclusion would infallibly be, that scarcity of provision had produced this extraordinary mark of Clemency.  The Indians Northward and Westward have taken their Lesson from the Savages at Philadelphia, New-York & R Island. In the very Act of negociating for Peace they are burning, murdering and Scalping. Congress yesterday voted 932,7431/3 Dollars for raising about 3000 men for carrying the war into the Indian Country-the proper Officers in the Northern department to be appointed by General Gates. General Mclntosh will command at Fort Pitt and against Detroit if we proceed.  An Enquiry is ordered by Congress into the conduct of Major General Mifflin and the Officers in his late department of Quarter Master General. There was a violent opposition of near four hours. 'Tis amazing to me, who am persuaded as a Man of honor, the General must wish for an investigation in order to satisfy the public who at present clamor exceedingly upon the subjects of neglect, mis-application, peculation &c. An enquiry will remove every groundless imputation.  The last authentic advices from Philada. are of the 9th Current.  The Enemy continued their preparations for removal, at that time they pretended they were to cross Delaware, march down the Eastern shore and embark at some convenient place below, now to me this appears Childish. Why hazard the crossing a river, the fatigue of a long march in the heat of Summer, the desertions which will infallibly happen, when all might be avoided by an easy and safe embarkation at the City and march in one tide 60-and if favoured by wind 160 miles-yet people swallow this and tenfold more gross propositions.

In the Midst of a Debate on the Report of a Committee on this Subject,(2) the Letters were brought in, having been receivd by our General & forwarded.(3) This Mode of Conveyance suited the Inclination of the House, they being, as I thought, at that Juncture ready to assent to a Proposition approving of the Generals Conduct in refusing to grant a Passport to the Messenger, and expressing themselves content that he should receive the Message & send it by a Messenger of his own. The Contents of the Letter, as far as they were read, appeard extraordinary indeed & showd plainly that their Design was to draw us back to a Subjection to their King. Some Expressions in the Letter gave particular Disgust to all the Members. The House adjournd till Monday when I think I may assure you the subject will be treated with becoming Spirit and Propriety.  I wish you would speak to some leading Member in the House of Representatives relating to the Resolution which was offerd concerning Dr. Lee. I have a Reason which strongly influences me to wish that such a Resolution may now pass. Justice & Policy as well as Gratitude require it. There are a few bad Men, one of whom you are not unacquainted with, who, so far from desiring that Respect should be shown to that patriotick & highly deserving Gentleman would rejoyce to see him disgrac'd.  My friendly Regards to your good Lady and all Friends. Adieu.  ""

  Sir York Town 13th June 1778 I had the honor of writing to you Yesterday by Messenger Boldon.  Within the present Inclosure you will receive an Act of Congress for repelling hostilities of the unfriendly Indians by carrying the War into their Towns & granting for that purpose 932,743 1/3 Dollars.  The News Paper Inclosed will shew you a late correspondence between Philadelphia & Congress.(1)  JUNE 13, 1778  Congress will some time to day determine on a proper answer to Sir H. Clinton's late attempt to obtain a Passport for Doctor Ferguson Secretary to the Commissioners to attend them at York Town without previously announcing the subject of his errand.*  I have the honor to be, With great Regard & Esteem, Sir, Your obedient & Most humble servant,  Henry Laurens, President of Congress [P.S.] This Messenger (2) having been long detained stands in need of Money. I have supplyed him with Sixty Dollars, please to inform the proper Officer.  *While Congress were this Morning in debate on this subject a large Packet from Head Quarters was ushered into the House & delivered to me. I suggested that this, holding up the Packet, might prove an attempt to mend the whole, & so it happened. Doctor Ferguson had proceeded with a Flag to Radnor but finding he could not obtain a Passport left his dispatches which were under a superb direction & triple Seals, the device of the latter, a fond Mother embracing returning Children, both, no doubt, projected for the occasion-here honour & duty bid me stop. Congress having heard me read two Pages of the Commissioners address gave me direction to seal up the whole & adjourned to Monday Morning.  I have a confidence in Congress that their future determination on this important subject will give the People satisfaction & do themselves honor on both sides the Atlantic.  Governor Johnson is liberal in addresses to particular persons, under his single signature, among others he has honoured me with a Letter much too polite to be sincere-he has sent me Letters from my old & best freinds in London all tending to the same point to wheedle us into resubjection, but if I do not misinterpret the intimations of one, a Man of as good sense as any in G Britain, & high in Esteem with the first Men on both sides at Court, these same Commissioners now are, or very soon will be, possessed of such Powers as will be acceptable at the Court House of York Town. You will be pleased Sir to receive this P.S. as the private respects of Your obliged & obedient servant, Henry Laurens  [P.S.] Lord Carlisle & Comp the Commissioners, adventured the 10th Inst under an escort of Light Troops to take an airing as far as German Town. I am in hopes if they repeat this frolic, which is certainly calculated for shewing themselves to the people, they will be introduced to an audience under an Escort of our own.  ""

  My Dear Son 13 June [1778] I thank you for your very sensible Letter of the 11th which came with the General's dispatches at past 1 o'clock just as Congress were about to adjourn.(1) How came those important papers to travel so very tardily?  JUNE 13, 1778  Congress I think determined properly to reflect a little, and I have no doubt but that on Monday their Resolutions will be equally proper.  I must in the course of duty send a special Messenger to His Excellency the General tomorrow Morning, by him I shall write again, probably he will be with you before this. This is chiefly intended to recommend to your Civilities Mons. Du Cambray and Captain Cottineau, both these Gentlemen I believe have Letters of introduction to General Washington.  If a certain Gentleman(2) should again venture to Germantown I wish he may be personally introduced at your Head Quarters by an Escort of Our Light Horse. He relies much upon the Letters which he has brought to private persons, many of which will not be so frankly and openly transmitted as those to you and me.

  Dear Sir, York-Town June 14. 1778.(1) Yesterday I was honoured with your favour of the 10th,(2) and thank you for the transmission of those from my dear and worthy friends Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning.(3) Had Doctor Ferguson been the bearer of these papers, I should have shewn that Gentleman every degree of respect and attention, that times and circumstances admit of.  It is, Sir, for Great-Britain to determine whether her Commissioners shall return unheard by the Representatives of these United States, or revive a friendship with the Citizens at large, and remain among us as long as they please.  You are undoubtedly acquainted with the only terms upon which Congress can treat for accomplishing this good end; terms from which, although writing in a private character, I may venture to assert, with great assurance, they never will recede, even admitting the continuance of hostile attempts, and that, from the rage of war, the good people of these States shall be driven to commence a treaty westward of yonder Mountains. And permit me to add, Sir, as my humble opinion, the true interest of Great Britain, in the present advance of the Contest, will be found in confirming our Independence.  Congress in no hour have been haughty, but to suppose that their minds are less firm in the present, than they were, when, destitute of all foreign aid, even without expectation of an alliance, when, upon a day of general public fasting and humiliation, in their House of Worship and in the presence of God, they Resolved, \""to hold no conference or Treaty with any Commissioners on the part of GreatBritain, unless they shall, as preliminary thereto, either withdraw their Fleets and Armies, or, in positive and express terms, acknowledge the Independence of these States,\"" would be irrational.(4)  At a proper time, Sir, I shall think myself highly honoured, by a personal attention, and by contributing to render every part of these States agreeable to you; but until the basis of mutual confidence shall be established, I believe, Sir, neither former private friendship, JUNE 14, 1778  nor any other consideration, can influence Congress to consent that even Governor Johnstone, a Gentleman who has been so deservedly esteemed in America, shall see the Country. I have but one voice, and that shall be against it. But let me intreat you, my Dear Sir, do not hence conclude that I am deficient in affection to my old Friends, through whose kindness I have obtained the honour of the present correspondence, or that I am not with very great personal respect and esteem, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble servant, Henry Laurens  Reprinted from Pennsylvania Gazette, June 20, 1778. Addressed: \""The Hon. George Johnstone, Esq Philadelphia.\"" Laurens sent a copy of this letter to Washington on June 18 that is virtually identical to the text printed here. See Laurens to Washington, June 18, 1778.  1 Laurens originally planned to send a private reply to Johnstone's June 10 letter, but because corresponding with the enemy was treasonable under Pennsylvania law and considered impolitic by many delegates, he decided instead to allow William Henry Drayton to arrange for publication of his letter in the Pennsylvania Gazette. See Laurens to John Laurens, and Thomas McKean to Ceasar Rodney, June 17, 1778.  2 Johnstone's June 10 letter to Laurens, which was also printed in the June 20 issue of the Pennsylvania Gazette, reads as follows.  \""I beg to transfer to my friend Dr. Ferguson, the private civilities which my friends Mr. Manning and Mr. Oswald request in my behalf. He is a man of the utmost probity, and of the highest esteem in the Republic of Letters.  \""If you should follow the example of Britain in the hour of her insolence, and send us back without a hearing, I shall hope, from private friendship, that I may be permitted to see the country, and the worthy characters she has exhibited to the world, upon making the request in any way you may point out.\""  3 William Manning's April 11 and Richard Oswald's April 12, 1778, letters to Laurens are in the Laurens Papers, ScHi. Manning, was a London banker and the father-in-law of John Laurens; Oswald, an old acquaintance of Laurens', was a Scottish merchant living in London who later served as one of the British negotiators of the Treaty of Paris.

Had they offered such terms before the Declaration of Independance, they would have restored peace & tranquility to the British Empire, but being short of Independance are now inadmissible.  I believe we shall return an answer to morrow; it will be in the spirit of our Resolves of the 23d [i.e. 22d] April.

  Sir Head Quarters June 13 [i.e. 15], 1778 I take the earliest Oppy. to acknowledge your Favour of the 30 April (1) & to thank you for your obliging Care in forwarding the Packets which accompanied it. The Partiality of my Friends in England has greatly overrated my Services & Consequence in the present Dispute;(2) I claim little other Merit beyond that of Zeal for the Interests of my Country & entertaining a very high Veneration for those illustrious Characters who have long tho unsuccessfully patronized her Rights & those of Mankind. America, Sir, has seen & admired your seasonable tho' unavailing Efforts to prevent the Dismemberment of the British Empire & place us on the great & generous Scale of equal Freedom with yourselves.(3) This must be your Consolation as it is your Glory, while the Event affords a most instructive Lesson to other Nations & Senates how to treat in future their Johnstone's & their Barry's, their Chathams & their Camden's. If it is within the Line of human Events to reconcile the People of this Country to a Submission to the Sovereignty of Brittain (4) the Ministry has in this Appointment (really honoured by Your Acceptance) shewn some Degree of Wisdom, as it may rescue them from the Imputation of repeating an insiduous Manuevre to divide, disarm, & enslave us.(5) But you will so soon receive the Sense of Congress on this important Point that any Opinion from me would be equally useless & improper. I will only say that after the unparallel'd Injuries & Insults this Country has received from the Men who now direct the Affairs of Brittain, a Negotiation under their Auspices has much to struggle with. I speak from no Authority but I can easily conceive that America would willingly exchange the Calamities of War for the Blessings of Peace & prove as faithful in Alliance as she has been great in Arms. If therefore the Resolution of Congress should be unfriendly to your present Views, if they should suppose  JUNE 15, 1778  that all Confidence & Affection the only Grounds of Harmony & surest Support of all Government are so erased as to leave no Hope of a happy Reunion, I cannot but Hatter myself that Men of Virtue & enlarged Views on both Sides of this great Question will endeavour to close the Scene of Blood on the only Terms now practicable & that Great Brittain will give up her visionary Schemes of Conquest & Empire for the solid Benefits she may yet derive from our Amity & Commerce. I will even hope, Sir, for your Aid in so good a Work. Should the same fatal Influences which blasted your firm salutary Counsils again frustrate your humane & generous Purpose, come to America, the future Asylum of the brave & virtuous from every Quarter of the Globe. She will think herself honoured to receive unto her Bosom so illustrous a Citizen, his Eloquence will not then be spent in vain nor his eminent Worth pass unrewarded.  My Desire to make the earliest Acknowledgment of the Honour you have done me has prevented my troubling you with a few Lines for my Friends in England who are interested in the Welfare of my Family.

  Dear Sir Camp near the Valley Forge, June 15. 1778 Your Politeness & Attention during my short Stay at York Town have left such Impressions on my Mind that I cannot but take every Oppy to shew my very sincere Regard & Respect. And as the late Intelligence from England is both interesting & curious I have taken the Liberty to inclose you Extracts from a Letter received from a Relation there formerly Agent for one of the States, & a letter from Governor Johnstone one of the Commissioners lately arrived.(1) If they are not otherwise useful they will for a few Minutes soften & releive that intense Application to Business which adorns the Patriot, while it weakens the Man. To these I have also added a Copy of my Answer to the Governor. The Opinion I have given is so universal on the great Subject of their Commission, that I cannot suppose there is the least Danger that the Reply of Congress will set our Claim upon lower Ground. And as Politeness required an Answer, Sincerity & Candour would not allow me to flatter him. One Part of  JUNE 15, 1778  my Brothers Letter which seems to intimate the Admission of our Independance, if claimed by a new Congress chosen after the present Terms are propounded, appears to me to deserve particular Attention as an insidious Manoevre to distract & divide us. Your good Judgment will lead you to make such Use of it as you think best to guard against the Mischief intended-indeed any Use you please of the whole except printing them which I do not conceive myself altogether at Liberty to do. The Fact alluded to in my Letter & [evidence?] of the base Duplicity of the former Commissioners is proved by their Letter laid before the House of Lords last Session of Parliament & now printed in the parliamentary Register sent me among other Papers by Governor Johnstone. Unless it can receive some Explanation I am not capable of giving it I cannot conceive more palpable Treachery & ineffable Meanness.  I cannot but congratulate you, Sir, on the respectable Appearance of our Army & their Improvement in Discipline & every soldierly Quality-On the Extinction of every Spark of Discontent & Faction against the best of Men & the Regularity with which the several Departments seem now to be conducted. To the latter I ascribe very much of the former, as the Attention & Care of the General being no longer called off from his Command to exercise the Duties of the Staff, his Time & Talents are devoted more directly to the military Duty of his Troops, the happy Consequences of which are more & more conspicious every Day. I have now been here near two Weeks (great Part of the Time waiting for Mr. Dana to complete the Business of the Arrangement of the Army) & can assure you that in the whole Time I have not heard a single Complaint of those Departments which formerly afforded so many, nor indeed of any other. I will not tax your Politeness with an Answer to this Letter, I know the Nature & Extent of your Engagements do not admit the Waste of a Moment, but I shall nevertheless do myself the Honour of communicating any Occurrencies here which are of Importance & not likely to reach you thro the publick Channel.  With every Sentiment of Respect & Esteem I remain, Sir, Your very Obed. Hbble Serv. Jos. Reed  P.S. As I have not Time to copy the Governours Letter I have inclosed the original which you will be so obliging as to return me under Cover when you have made what Use you please of it. Upon farther Consideration I have thought best to delay an Answer to the Governours Letter least as the great Subject is under the Consideration of Congress I might say too much or too little & have therefore only concluded to send a bare complimentary Letter of Acknowledgment which is not worth troubling you with.

I have had Thoughts of sending Home the Phaeton that you may ride out frequently which I fear you cannnot do at present, & which I think would do you a great deal of good, but the daily Expectation of finishing our Business & returning myself has hitherto prevented. But why do I say finishing--when we have not begun the other Gentleman not being yet arrived. I hope the next Time you write your Health & Spirits will admit a longer Letter, & let me know what Dennis says of himself as he refers me to his Letters to his Mamma & yourself for Family News. The two Letters which accompanied them 1 suppose from the Handwriting to have come from our new Relation. By the Time they must have been wrote, I suppose they were settled down solid Man and Wife & going on in the old patriarchal Style begetting Sons & Daughters. This is a Chance Oppy. being left at Moore Hall to find its Way to you & they are not the most careful there; on this Account I do not inclose your Brothers Letter which is very long & contains many Things both of a private & publick Nature which I would not have get out, but I will forward it by the very first Oppy. On which I can depend. If any offers from your Part of the Country I wish you would get him to call on me here. Or if you can get any Person to come on easy Terms, I want the Hessian Mare to sell & have the little old Horse for him to ride back, but he must remember to bring my Saddle & the blanket I formerly wore under it which lays in the Garret as the little Horse's Back is sore. Col. Lowry writes me he will pay you all possible Attention in any little Matters which from his former Kindness I cannot doubt. He writes me that my Horses are doing well but are very troublesome which I did not expect after making such an Alteration in their Condition. I would have Cyrus endeavour to raise them in Flesh & when he goes of Errands lead them together so as to use them to each other but on no Account to tamper with them in the Grass till I return. I have been disappointed in getting Cows from this Part of the Country so that we must either do with what we have or get them where we are. Ms. Yard has sent me out your Bobbin & a small Bottle of Howe's Acid to make Punch which I will send you by the same Oppy. as your Brothers Letter, but she cannot get out the other Things. I expect the Gentleman from Boston every Day by whom I sent for Lin- JUNE 15, 1778  nen &c. As soon as he arrives will forward my dear Girl what he brings. The British Army would certainly have left Philad. if the Commissioners had not arrived as they did & the prevailing Opinion is that they will go yet-at present it seems a dead Calm. The Commissioners have announced their Arrival to Congress in Form but no Answer is yet received tho hourly expected. We flatter ourselves when the Answer comes they will go off & commence Operations in some other Part of the Country. I have such an Acct. from our Friend in Town as makes me hope this will be the Case. She has sent me a Message desiring me not to leave the Neighbourhood & to come in as soon as possible. None of the Vessels are yet returned but they get the Provisions from Hand to Mouth by Boats. Sam cannot be heard of. I fear he is pressed, but you will judge whether Hannah should know it. I think rather not. I am very impatient to see you & the dear Children, their diverting Prattle & Company makes them every Day more dear. I was very near buying a Poney for Joe the other Day but had Resolution enough to get over the Temptation; I do not know whether I should do as well if it fell in my Way again. Kiss them all for me & endeavour to keep up your Spirits. I would not have you a dull, moping, dejected Wife for the World. As we have our joys & Pleasures, my dear Creature we must not expect them unmixed with some Trouble & Sorrow. It is not the lot of human Nature nor the Portion Providence assigns its Creatures. Let us therefore be resigned & endeavour to be chearful as it conduces to our own Happiness & promotes that of those about us.  I repeat again that I long to see you & shall rejoice to hear from you as often as you find Time & Oppy. & am my dear Love with unabated Affection, most sincerely yours, J Reed  P.S. Since writing the above our Commissy. of Prisoners has come from Germantown & says Mr. Loring assured him they should leave Philad this Week, that he had embark'd such Prisoners as were not to be exchanged & would send out those that where [were], which he has done this Day.

  [June 16? 1778](1) The great point may be to draw us into a conference.  For this purpose they offer to negotiate upon many matters beyond their powers under the Act of Parliamt.  They guard these extra propositions by asking things they cannot imagine we shall grant.  Our refusal therefore brings the real matters of negotiation within the Act.  But should they accede to those extra propositions, Parliamt. might & wou'd reject them.  The King has, or he has not a right to treat with us beyond the limits of the Act.  If he has not, every proposition intimated as a ground of treaty without the Act is insidious.  If he has, then they may be supposed to be instructed to accede to our claim of independance provided they find peace can be no otherways effected. This they may think necessary if they are informed of the substance of our treaty of Alliance.  Is it not wiser for Britain to acknowledge our Independance now, than to refuse it and thereby expose the few colonies she holds in America to be added to the Union.  If so we ought to conduct as if she was prepared to do it.  The King I think may treat with us by virtue of his prerogative, as Independant States.  For are we not in fact such?  Hath not our Independance been acknowledged by France?  Did she not ground her connection with us upon our having been in full possession of Independance ever since July 1776?  Have we not reason to expect other Nations will follow the example of France?  ""

  My Lords & Gentlemen [June 16, 1778](1)  I have reced your letter of and laid it before Congress with its inclosures. In answer I am instructed to inform you, that Congress ever ready to stop the effusion of human blood have been induced to hear your letter read thro out (2) and to consider its inclosures notwithstanding the very inadmissible and offensive things that are contained in the former. Tho It is impossible Congress can fail to be affected with the highest resentment at the indignity offered them by the indecent reflections you have thought proper to make upon his most Ch.

The Commission from his Britannic Majesty under which you act, a copy of which you have inclosed, and the Acts of Parliament on which the Commission is founded, being both formed upon the idea of the good people of these States being Subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, and proposing peace upon dependent principles and a return to the domination of a power that hath accumulated every injury and insult on their unoffending States, Congress consider them both as totally inadmissible, and cannot consent to any further communication on such grounds.

  Dear Sir York in Pennsylva. 16 June 1778 I thank you for your favor of the 5th which I received yesterday.(1) It is the only. satisfactory account I have received of the proceedings of our Assembly. The enemy have made many insidious attempts upon us lately, not in the military way, they seem tired of that, but in the way of negotiation. Their first, was by industriously circulating the bills of pacification as they call them, before they had passed into acts, in order to prevent our closing with France. These bills received a coment from Congress on the 22d. of April, which no doubt you have seen. The inclosed paper will shew you the second attempt from Lord Howe and Gen. Clinton, with the answer of Congress. The third movement happened very lately, when Clinton dcsired a passport from Gen. Washington for Dr. Ferguson to come to Congress w ith a letter from the newly arrived Commissioners Lord Carlyle, Wm. Eden esqr. and Governor Johnston. The General refused the passport until Congress should give leave. The letter from Clinton was transmitted here, but the impatience of the Commissioners did not suffer them to wait for an answer. Thro the medium of the General, leaving their Secretary Dr. Ferguson behind, the packet arrived containing a letter from the Commissioners with a copy of their Commission. Their letter is a combination of fraud, falsehood, insidious offers, and abuse of France, Concluding with a denial of Independence. The sine qua non being withheld, you may judge what will be the fate of the rest. An answer has not yet been sent. In due time you will have both the letter and its answer. I dont know whether to call Governor Johnston an Apostate or not. He has been in opposition to the Ministry and has spoken some speeches in our favor, but I believe he has never been a friend to American Independence. However, there seems no doubt but that he has on this occasion touched Ministerial gold. The others are notorious Ministerialists. It is amazing how the Court of London does mix pride, meanness cunning, and folly, with Gasconade, and timidity. In short the strangest composition is there formed that ever disgraced and injured Mankind. The King of Prussia has declared in terms explicit, that he would follow France in acknowledging our  JUNE 16, 1778  Independence and his hobby horse is, to become a maritime power. Yet he seems, by his movements disposed to quarrel with the Emperor about the divisions of the Bavarian dominions, the Elector being dead without Heir of his body, the next Heir who is the Elector Palatine must loose his right between the two great Spoilers. We have been long amused with accounts of the enemy abandoning Philadelphia. I believe they will do so when they can stay no longer, but not until then They have certainly removed all their heavy Cannon, Baggage &c. And fearing a French war every Moment, they keep in readiness to depart. We did lately shatter extremely a 20 gun ship belonging to the enemy in the North river, and sent her away to York, in no condition for service. I observe by our last delegation, that my enemies have been again at work, however, they shall not gain their point of withdrawing me from the public Councils.(2)  I am dear Sir your affectionate friend and obedient Servant, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  My Dear Sir Camp at Valley Forge, June 16th. 1778 Prompted by the dictates of Justice I cannot refuse giving you the trouble of a few lines in behalf of a Man of great Merit, that now wishes to attain that rank in our Army, which his usefullness & attachment to the General made him indifferent about on former occasions, when opportunity Offered for pushing his promotion, I mean Capt Gibbs of the Generals Guards.(1) This Gentleman commenced Soldier with the Battle of Lexington and has continued in the army ever since without absenting himself from Duty one Single day since that time; by accepting his present Command he lost the line of promotion in the Troops of his own State & has the Mortification to see many Colonels at this day, that must always have been under his Command, had he continued in that line.  His present Corps consists of 150 Men fine Fellows as you wou'd wish to see (100 of them was out with their Captain & Covered the retreat of the Marquis the other day). These are consequently equal in numbers to three Companies, & indeed to some of our Regiments, where then wou'd be the impropriety of appointing Capt Gibbs Colo. or Lieutenant Colo. Commandant of the Guards & of promoting his Second Mr. Livingston to be Captain therein. The Merit & l0 JUNE 16, 1778 past Services of these Gentn entitle them to it, and they have no other chance of promotion, I think they are personally known to you and therefore it is the less necessary to urge the point with a Gentn. of your liberal way of thinking. I came down here about ten days ago expecting to go into Philadelphia immediately, & shou'd certainly have done so, had not the Commissioners arrived at the Critical time they did; since then I have been prevailed on to stay, day after day untill Congress give them their Answer, which, it is expected here, will be such, as will send them off immediately. After that Answer is given I shou'd like to hold an hour or two's Conversation with my Friend, Govr. Johnstone, but have not yet determined on doing so.(2) I think he will be much mortified at his disapointed embassy & I cou'd wish to convince him that Great Britain may still be happy & Continue Rich, by forming a Commercial Alliance with us, on the same broad basis that other Nations do; it will be no difficult matter to convince any reasonable Man, that Great Britain wou'd still enjoy under such Treaties the greatest share & most valuable parts of our Trade, but the best & most liberal of the British Subjects feel themselves humbled, in the Idea of quitting their Sovereignty over us, & this with many will preclude all reasoning on the Subject. Whether Govr. Johnstone is of this Number or not, I cannot tell, but we hear he is strongly opposed to our Independance, altho unbounded in offers of every thing else; No offers must tempt us; they ought not to have a hearing of one moment, unless preceeded by an acknowledgement of our Independance, because we can never be a happy People under their Domination. I have frequently ventured to assert here, that Congress will not give up one Iota of their former resolves on this Subject, nor do a thing in the least degree inconsistent with their Public faith, plighted in the ratification of the Treaty with France. I am sure you will make my words good. I think Philadelphia will be evacuated the moment the Commissioners get an Answer from Congress, I shall then go down & will inform you, Whether things are left on such a footing that Congress can be well accomodated there and if they can I hope they will remove accordingly. My time for joining you is near at hand & I had rather it shou'd be in Philada than York Town. I long to take you & Duer by the hand as also some other Worthies your associates and with sincere regard remain Dear Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant,  Robt Morris P.S. Poor Phil Livingston.

  [June I6, 1778] All agree the terms are inadmissible.(1) Some think the insulting way that the whole letter so far as read is an insult; First as it is grounded on a supposition that we are so devoid of understanding and every sense of honor as to violate the treaties we 'have just entered into & give ourselves up to the mercy of those, who have demonstrated that they have the will if they had but the power to reduce us to abject slavery and that they would exterminate rather than not subject us. 2. As it accompanies these inadmissible terms with reproaches against that power which steps in to rescue us from destruction thereby supposing that we have not sense to feel nor spirit to resent abuse offered to our friend.  The question is in what manner to treat this letter.  1. Whether to enter into a train of reasoning & shew that from a regard to safety, & the faith due to treaties Congress cannot listen to terms short of independence, or  2. Leaving the Commissioners to draw that conclusion, to reject it on the footing of the insult contained [in] it, or  3. To unite these & comprehend both in the answer  The first is a temporising method & will shew that Congress have not a full confidence in the firmness & persevering spirit of their constituents: For such a train of reasoning cannot be for the purpose of enlightening the understanding or convincing the judgment of the Commissioners but of the people of this continent. What occasion for this if they are convinced of their independence & determined to support it. Besides it will inspirit our enemes as it will JUNE 16, 1778  convince them Congress have not a full confidence in the establishment of their independance or their resources for supporting it. For who but a simpleton attempts to prove a self evident proposition.  Second. Rejecting the letter on the ground of the insult, which may be considered as double in offering chains to freemen & abusing our frien[ds]; will carry all the force of reasoning on the first ground: It will do more, it will appall our enemies and inspirit the friends of the cause. The Comrs. will thereby see that nothing short of Independance will be listened to & must therefore come to that or break of[f] the conference; and that even admitting independance they must treat our allies with respect. It will carry with it to the comrs a conviction of the confidence Congress have both in their cause & resources, & must therefore force them to a speedier Declaration of their future powers if any they have.  3. Mixing both will only weaken the force of the reasoning on the second ground.  ""

Our foreign affairs have long been enveloped in impenetrable darkness; but the rays of light now beam in our political firmament, & reveal the objects to our sight. I trust we will not shut our eyes. We are Sir placed in the watch tower of America. We are stationed on this height, that we may seeing [see] the American affairs, interists in one grand & extensive view. We are placed high in The Imperial car of America that we may guide it with skil, lash on the sluggard, curb in the impetuous, & unharness & discharge the unruly draught. Oh Mr. P[resident] that we were wise, that we would but take notice of the precipice along which we are now driving. Oft Sir have we unknowingly in the night & in the day with our eyes wilfully shut rowled upon the extreem verge of this dreadful height-an invisible hand restrained our passing it.

I will take the liberty to say Sir, it is our indispensable duty to endeavour to conduct ourselves as may be most likely to conduce to the happiness of the People who seated us here, committing themselves to our impartiality, care & conduct.  JUNE 17, 1778  Sir, I know not how to account for it, but so it has happened, that it has accidentally general been my lot in every public Assembly or Council in which I have been placed, to move such subjects as draw upon the mover the displeasure of bodies of Men or of individuals. And I have done so, not I trust because actuated by a morose inclination, but because I thought it the duty of my Station. I have not stept into public life, I did not come into Congress to acquire friends but determinately & boldly to discharge the duty of a Citizen. Conscious that it is my duty to speak plainly & act decis[iv]ely I yet feel pain when in doing so any person feels distress or uneasiness. I am sensible sir, the subject I am agitating will unavoidably cause uneasiness in this House.

  York Town, June 17,1778 To their Excellencies the Earl of CARLISLE, WILLIAM EDEN, and GEORGE JOHNSTONE, Esqrs. British Commissioners.  As I have but a few moments that I can, in conscience, appropriate to a correspondence with your Excellencies, I trust this circumstance will, with you, excuse the abrupt manner in which I introduce myself, and my reflections, to your attention.(1)  Your letter of the 9th instant to Congress, your commission, and the acts of the British Parliament upon which they are grounded, are the fashionable subjects of curious enquiry, in how many points of view they are fallacious and incompetent to the object of your ostensible negotiation.(2) Although Congress cannot condescend minutely to animadvert upon your propositions, as your Excellencies are empowered to hear individuals, I flatter myself, so anxious is your inclination to restore peace, that you will for a moment honour me with your attention.  In your letter of the 9th instant, Governor Johnstone signed this position, \""Notwithstanding the pretended date or present form of the French offers to North-America, yet it is notorious that these were made in consequence of the plans of accommodation previously concerted in Great-Britain, and with a view to prevent our reconciliation, and to prolong this destructive war.\""  On the 5th of February, in the House of Comrnons, Governor Johnstone also signed this position, \""I have had a hint, and have good reason to believe a proposition will be made to Parliament in four or five days, by administration, that may be a ground of reunion; I really do not know the particulars, nevertheless, as I learn some preliminaries have lately gone from France, I think it cannot be deemed unfriendly to either country, to give you notice of this intended proposition, THAT you may in prudence do nothing hastily with a foreign power.(3)  The \""preliminaries\"" mentioned by Governor Johnstone, as \""lately gone from France,\"" were at that moment at sea, with Mr. Simeon Deane, and had been so some weeks; they were to the following purpose: \""That his Most Christian Majesty was determined to acknowledge our Independence, and make a treaty with us of Amity and Commerce. That in this treaty, no advantage would be taken of our present situation to obtain terms from us, which otherwise JUNE 17, 1778  Portrait of William Henry Drayton 118 JUNE 17, 1778 would not be convenient for us to agree to, his Majesty desiring that the treaty, once made, should be durable, and our amity subsist for ever, which could not be expected, if each nation did not find its interest in the continuance as well as in the commencement of it. It was therefore his intention, that the terms of the treaty should be such, as we might be willing to agree to if our state had been long established, and in the fulness of strength and power, and such as we should approve of when that time should come. That his Majesty was fixed in his determination, not only to acknowledge, but to support our Independence by every means in his power. That in doing this, he might probably be soon engaged in war, with all the expences, risque and damage usually attending it; yet he should not expect any compensation from us on that account, nor pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes, since, besides his real good-will to us and our cause, it was manifestly the interest of France, that the power of England should be diminished by our separation from it. He should, moreover, not so much as insist, that, if he engaged in the war with England on our account, we should not make a separate peace for ourselves, whenever good and advantageous terms were offered to us. The only condition he should require and rely on would be this, that we, in no peace to be made with England, should give up our Independence, and return to the obedience of that government.\""(4) These preliminaries were, by Mons. Girard, in the name of his most Christian Majesty, announced to the American Commissioners at Paris on the 16th day of December last. And in consequence of them, the Treaty of Paris, between America and France, was actually signed on the 6th of February, 1778. It is notorious that it was on the 19th day of February that Lord North introduced his propositions to Parliament for a re-union with America.  From this state of facts two points result. First, that the two positions signed by Governor Johnstone militate against each other in direct terms. Secondly, that so far were \""the French offers\"" from being \""made in consequence of the plans of accommodation concerted in Great-Britain,\"" that the latter were made in consequence only of the former; for the French offers were made on the 16th day of December. Governor Johnstone (connected with administration) on the 5th of February expressly says, he was then ignorant of any particulars of a plan of accommodation. On the 6th of February the French offers were compleated by a treaty; and it was not till the 19th of February that any plan of accommodation was communicated to the British Parliament. Your Excellencies, however, do not scruple, even in your first address to Congress, to assert a position, the contrary to which is known to be the fact. I will not charge you with a designed falsity: The people will use their discretion. At any rate, this conduct on your part warns them to be upon their guard against you.   Having thus vindicated the honour of our good and great ally the King of France, permit me to touch upon your propositions to Congress.  Your Excellencies offer us a seat for our representatives in your Parliament. Happily for us, we are too well acquainted with the insignificancy of the Scotch representatives there, to expect that American representatives can, in the same place, possess any importance; or that America can derive any advantage from such a representation .  As an alternative, you propose to send agents to our assemblies. But as we know they would be spies upon us, and agents to purchase our voices, we will have no such characters among us.  You propose to concur in measures to discharge the debts of America. By this, as our subjection is implied, so are restrictions of some sort upon our trade; of necessity, so is a diminution of our ability to discharge our debts. We know you cannot discharge the debts of your own nation, we therefore cannot expect that you will, or even desire that you should, discharge any part of ours. We are willing and able to discharge our debts, without your concurrence or aid. Your offer therefore wears the appearance of being officious and idle.  You propose to extend every freedom to trade, that our respective interests can require. Do we not know, that you have a natural inclination to monopolize trade? Do we not know, that your and our interest in the point of trade is in direct opposition? It is your interest that our trade should be limited-it is ours, that it should be unlimited-we there differ, toto coelo.  You propose a cessation of hostilities. Withdraw your forces by land, and hostilities there are instantly ended; you need not be anxious for a cessation at sea; on that element we have every thing to fear from you. If you mean fair, why then do you delay to do that which you seem to desire, and which that it be done rests entirely with yourselves?  Such are your principal offers in detail. Of how little value are they to us!  But you offer us every thing short of Independence. If you are serious, of how little value must such a connection with us be to you! Will your Excellencies condescend, with me, to view Great Britain and America under one Sovereign? The sovereignty in Britain; America possessed of powers of government but short of independence.  America, formed for empire, must naturally arrive at it; having tasted of it she will be ever anxious to possess it again; having by arms acquired a power but short of independence, she will encrease in reputation and ability to become independent, and this will encrease her desire to be so; her former success will possess her with  confidence and hope; experience will make her ever suspicious of the intentions of Britain: Hence, being in possession of powers, only short of independent, she will always be prepared to assert her rights, especially having in mind her naked condition at the sudden commencement of the present war. In such a formidable situation, design, accident, suspicion, or the breath of displeasure on either side, must, in a few years, break the cobweb by which you offer to hold her under the dominion of Britain. And is the acquiring dominion to be held by such a tie worth another campaign! Can it be worth the pursuit of a man of common honesty and common sense!  But supposing your offers to be, what they are not, of sterling value to America: How inadequate are your powers to the purpose of accommodation! The great Lord Abingdon puts this matter in the clearest point of view. In his most elegant protest on this subject, he says \""Although the Commissioners and the Congress be agreed, such agreement is of no effect till confirmed by Parliament; which is giving such advantage to Parliament, by knowing what Congress will do, and is of such disadvantage to Congress, by not knowing what Parliament will confirm, that the very inequality of the conditions will put a stop to accommodation.\""(5) If America enters into terms with you, see what might be the consequence-Your Excellencies must allow, that it is our duty to avoid them.  We have made a solemn treaty with France-the object is, the establishment of our Independence. If we treat with you upon the footing of Dependence, we at once break our faith with France, for ever lose all credit with foreign nations, and are, ipso facto, cut off even from the hope of foreign succour. In this situation you will absolutely hold us at mercy. Your King, Ministers and Parliament may refuse to ratify your engagements, for they have the power to do so. Governor Johnstone has long and ably pleaded the cause of America. Is he now come to our shore to invite us to surrender to the justice and mercy of our most unjust and vengeful enemies, who have for a long course of years treated us with the basest deceptions, and calumniated us throughout Europe: Enemies, who have starved to death our countrymen taken prisoners, loading them while alive and in their power with every insult. Enemies who gave stretch to their savage allies,(6) to murder our old and unarmed farmers, and their helpless women and children: Enemies who have plundered our country, burned our towns, and armed son against father, servant against master, and brother against brother, in order to subject us: Enemies who have moved even Hell itself to accomplish their purpose of blood, ruin and tyranny: Enemies utterly abandoned to corruption, destitute of public virtue, deaf to the voice of justice, and dead to the feelings of humanity; Can it possibly be expected that such enemies, after the expence of so many millions; the loss of so much of their own blood; the disgraces their arms have sustained;   the insults to which they have been obliged to submit from foreign nations, in their pursuit of our destruction, the impending ruin under which they have been driven by our opposition; I say, can it possibly be expected, that when such enemies, so provoked, shall find us lying at their mercy, they will ratify your Excellencies terms but short of Independence, and be content to hold dominion over us by so slender a tie as a cobweb! Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes.(7)  America is independent de facto et de jure. She will maintain her station at the expence of her last drop of blood. It is in vain to solicit what your arms, when most powerful, were not able to compel. You are no longer in that situation. America is more competent to the contest than ever she has been. Our resolution is fixed, nor do we fear \""the horrors and devastations of war,\"" with which, in the conclusion of your letter, you threaten us. France has acknowledged our Independence; the great powers of Europe smile upon us; we rely upon our own virtue and the favour of Heaven. If we continue firm, we shall continue independent. Farewell.  W.H.D.  MS not found reprinted from the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 20, 1778.  1 This is the first of four newspaper letters William Henry Drayton wrote to the Carlisle commissioners using his initials as a signature. The other three appeared in the Pennsylvania Packet on July 18, September 12, and October 29, 1778, and are printed in this edition of Letters under the dates July 3, September 4, and October 24, 1778. Although no manuscript drafts of these letters have been found, they are obviously written by a member of Congress and the use of Drayton's initials as a signature point unmistakably to his authorship. It is pertinent to note that Drayton published these letters on his own initiative, for as Josiah Bartlett, who was in Congress throughout the period the letters appeared, observed of the third one: \""The letter to the [commissioners] signed W.H.D. was wrote I suppose by Chief Justice Drayton member from So. Carolina as were the former letters under that signature.\"" See Bartlett to Whipple, September 12, 1778.  2 For a discussion of Congress' formal response to the commissioners' June 9 letter, see Samuel Adams to James Warren, June 13, 1778, note 3. Drayton was a member of the committee appointed on June 16 to draft a reply to the commissioners' letter, and the present address probably stems in part from his work on that body. JCC, 11:610.  3 Johnstone made this statement in a letter to Robert Morris, dated \""House of Commons 5 Feby 1778,\"" read in Congress on April 27. See PCC, item 78, 13:65 66; and Henry Laurens to Robert Morris, April 27, 1778, note 1.  4 Drayton is quoting a statement that Conrad Alexandre Gerard, the French official in charge of negotiating the treaties of alliance and commerce with the United States, made to the commissioners at Paris, \""by order of the king.\"" According to the commissioners, Gerard made this statement on December 17, not December 16, 1778, as Drayton asserts in the next sentence. Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 2:452-53.  5 See also Henry Laurens to George Washington, June 8, 1778, note 5.  6 Drayton is referring to Gen. John Burgoyne's notorious proclamation of June 20, 1777, threatening supporters of the patriot cause with the horrors of Indian warfare.

  Gentlemen, York Town, June 17th 1778(1) While I regret that Governor Johnstone has thought it proper to write private letters into these States, upon the subject of his public commission, and highly respect the determination of Congress to prevent a private correspondence with the enemy, I think I render a satisfactory service to the public in laying the following letters before them. The answer was written immediately after the receipt of Governor Johnstone's letter, but was not sent as was intended. However, thinking it too valuable to be lost, I prevailed upon my friend the President to allow it to be published, with the letter which gave occasion to it. I now send them for publication, and am, Gentlemen, Your most humble servant, W.H. Drayton  MS not found: reprinted from the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 20, 1778.  1 Drayton's letter was printed in the Pennsylvania Gazette as a preface to George Johnstone's June 10 letter to Henry Laurens and Laurens' June 14 reply, for which see Laurens to Johnstone, June 14, 1778, note 2. Johnstone's and Laurens' letters were published after Congress refused to allow the president to correspond privately with the British commissioner. See Laurens to John Laurens, this date. It is of interest that on June 16 Drayton had been appointed to a committee \""to prepare a resolution for preventing any correspondence with the enemy.\"" JCC,11: 608.

  York Town 17th June 1778 I have received the Letter from your Excellencies of the 9th Inst. with the Inclosures and laid them before Congress.(1)  Nothing but an earnest desire to spare the farther effusion of human Blood could have induced them to read a Paper containing expressions so disrespectful (2) to His Most Christian Majesty the good and great Ally of these States, or to consider propositions so derogatory to the honor of an Independent Nation.  The Acts of the British Parliament, the Commission from your Sovereign and your Letter, suppose the People of these States to be subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, and are founded on the Idea of dependence which is utterly inadmissible.  I am further directed to inform your Excellencies that Congress are inclined to (3) Peace, notwithstanding the unjust Claims from which this War originated and the Savage manner in which it hath been conducted; they will therefore be ready to enter upon the consideration of a Treaty of Peace and Commerce, not inconsistent with  JUNE 17, 1778  Treaties already subsisting, when the King of Great Britain shall demonstrate a sincere disposition for that purpose.  The only solid proof of this disposition will be an explicit acknowledgement of the Independence of these States or the withdrawing his Fleets and Armies.  I have the honor to be, Your Excellencies Most Obedient and humble Servant. Signed by order of the unanimous voice of Congress. Henry Laurens, President  ""

  Dear Sir, (Private) York Town 17th June 1778 I troubled you with a few private Lines on the 13 th by Crugier.  Congress have not determined their answer to the British Commissioners Address, although I foresee it will be a very short one. When that is finished the whole will probably be published, in the meantime I consider Sir your situation & distance from the Center of intelligence & conclude that the following brief account of the Address will not be unacceptable.  There is rather a repletion in the direction of the Paper leaving no room for cavil on that score.  The Commissioners after the necessary preface observe (1)-\""that in the present state of our affairs tho' fraught with subjects of mutual regret all parties may draw some consolation & even auspicious hope from recollecting that cordial reconciliation & affection have in our own & other Empires succeeded to contention & temporary division not less violent than those we now experience.  They wish not to recall subjects now no longer in controversy, observe that the Acts of Parliament which they transmit & refer to, passed with singular Unanimity.  They are willing to consent to a cessation of hostilities by Sea & Land.  To extend every freedom of Trade that our respective Interests can require. Who is to adjust this point?] To agree that no Military forces shall be kept up in the States without our Consent.  To concur in measures calculated to discharge the debts of America & to raise the Credit & Value of the Paper circulation.  To perpetuate our Union by a reciprocal Deputation in Parliament & in the several General Assemblies.  In short to establish the Power of the Respective Legislatures in each particular State, to settle its revenues, its Civil & Military establishment & exercise a perfect freedom of Legislation & internal Government so that the British States throughout North America acting with us in Peace & War and as one common Sovereign may have the irrevocable enjoyment of every privelege that is short of a total seperation of Interests or consistent with that Union of force on which the safety of our common Religion & Liberty depends.\""  The French Court are illiberally charged with insidious practices-this gives much offence. If all the fine things now offered had been tendered some time ago, admitting their solidity, there can be no doubt but that the People of America would joyfully have embraced the proposition-but now what answer can be given but that which was returned to the foolish Virgins-\""The Door is shut\"" more especially when we reflect that there is no solidity-because all is to be transmitted to Parliament for Ratification. \""And until such Rat- JUNE 17, 1778  ification no such regulation, matter or thing shall have any other force or effect or be carried further into Execution than is hereafter mentioned.\"" Here's a Boy's Card House tumbled down by a Breath.  \""If,\"" say Lord Carlisle, William Eden & George Johnstone Esquires, \""after the time that may be necessary to consider this communication & transmit your answer the horrors & devastations of War should continue We call God & the World to Witness that the Evils which must follow are not to be imputed to Great Britain\""-to whom are the past to be imputed? but are they not now in the very moment of pretended attempts to establish Peace burning, ravaging & murdering?

  My Dear Son, 17th June [1778] I will endeavor to discharge my debt to your favor of the 14th & 15th both received yesterday.(1)  You will know some time to Morrow the part which Congress will act respecting the late Address from the Commissioners. It is my duty to subscribe not to Comment when a Letter undergoes for two or three days the consideration & correction of a House of 31, but it is very admissible to say the long delay has given me much anxiety.  I wished to have returned Govr. Johnston, Mr. Ozwald & Mr. Mannings answers, but did not think the correspondence Lawful without leave of Congress or say judged it best to apply for leave, it was not unanimously granted & I preferred with drawing my petition to a denial, because this might have ruffl'd me. You will Smile with Some contempt when I explain this matter fully. If this refusal would be productive of the expected benefits I should be content, even rejoice it would be a politic measure-in the present case, all the weak & wicked, with whom Govr. Johnstone has corresponded & will correspond, will make him flattering returns. Those Gentlemen who would attempt to open his Eyes & persuade him to undeceive himself will not be heard-honor will command Silence to the latter-the former will laugh at Proclamations. However I will en- JUNE 17, 1778  deavor to Send you the Speeches which were intended to have been Spoken as well as the Letters received from Philadelphia. Possibly the General may spare time to peruse that from Mr. Oswald who, if I do not misconstrue him, only wishes for our Dependence, but does not expect it & hence I conclude the Commissioners are now or soon will be in possession of full powers to acknowledge the sovereignty of these States.  I do not like the history of Doctr. W nor the lodging he took nor the present conduct of the person with whom he made his first nights quarters.(2) They are all Suspicious & one or two more-very equivocal Characters.  There must be more in the Doctor's history than you have intimated otherwise he would not have found such ready access to the Table at head Quarters. This consideration suspends a full opinion but watch-watch-every thing in the shape of a Trojan Horse.  I shall be glad to know your Sentiments on the reformation of our Regiments merely for my own information but the business is intirely out of my line & there is a tenacity which is not to be bent by advice, but which does extremely well when it enjoys the Seeming honor of originating. Therefore if applications on this Score shall be found necessary let them be addressed directly to the House or to Some other Member, not the President, however glad he may be to know what is in motion. You shall hear more to morrow from your most affectionate Father.  ""

The allowance to me by Delaware will be £3 per day, most of which, if not all, I shall expend; however all I expect is to have my expences born. No other Delegate but myself from Delaware, nor likely to be for some time.  The Commissioners from Great Britain are, Frederick Earl of Carlisle, Richard Viscount Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, Knight of the Bath, William Eden Esquire, one of the Lords for trade & plantations, and George Johnstone, Esquire, Captain of a man of war, commonly called Governor Johnstone. They have sent a copy of their commission from their King to Congress, with a Letter directed to \""His Excellency Henry Laurens President & the other members of Congress at York-Town,\"" and call us States (not Colonies or Provinces) throughout. My old correspondent Dennys De Bert Esquire of London has written to me a Letter of recommendation of Governor Johnstone, in very flattering terms, as he desired an intimate acquaintance with a Gentleman of such abilities &c as myself; which Letter the Governor sent with the dispatches from the Commissioners.  The propositions of the Commissioners are-To cease all hostilities by sea and land-to be friendly & have the same privileges in both countries-To support and raise the credit of our paper money, to allow these States to be governed as they now are, or in whatever manner they please, as to their internal policy-To raise & pay their own fleets & armies, and that the King of Great Britain shall not hereafter keep any fleets or armies in any of the British States, without the consent of Congress, or of the respective States-to have a free trade & commerce for the mutual benefit of both Countries, and for this purpose the States to send agents to the British Parliament, who are to have a voice there, and Parliament to send agents to the respective States who are to have a voice there. In fine to any thing short of a total separation, to have the same Sovereign, the same Enemies & the same friends.  To these they have received an answer-\""Acknowledge our Independence, or withdraw your fleets & armies, and we will treat with  JUNE 17, 1778  you for peace & commerce &c.\"" This answer was agreed to unanimously, by 31 members, the whole number in York- Town.

  Dear Sir, York Town June 17th. 1778. Yesterday I was favored by your's of the 11th instant, (1) inclosing a draught in my favor for £90.0.111/2, for which I have given a rect. to Geo. Latimer Esquire. He will deliver you the ten thousand dollars, deducting the above sum.  This day you inform me the General Assembly are to meet. I should with pleasure attend them, but am afraid, tho' I should thereby act to the great satisfaction of many, yet some would take it amiss and charge me with deserting my Post, especially at this most critical period.  I have lived to see the day when, instead of \""Americans licking the dust from the feet of a British Minister,\"" the tables are turned. The Commissioners are, Frederick Earl of Carlisle, Richd. Viscount Howe, Sir Henry Clinton, Wm. Eden Esquire (one of the Lords for trade & plantations & Brother to the late Governor of Maryland) and Captain George Johnstone, commonly called Governor Johnstone. The last Gentn. sent me a Letter from an old Correspondent in London,(2) warmly recommending him as a Commissioner of peace, and begging that I would receive him among my friends, as he most ardently desired it &c. Several Members of Congress have received such Letters; but no Answers will be given by Individuals, it being treason to correspond with Enemies by the laws of Pennsylvania.(3) The Commissioners have sent us again the three Acts of Parliament, their Commission from their Sovereign, and their Propositions; wch. in brief are, to suspend hostilities by Sea and Land immediately, to join in supporting our Paper money, to agree that we shall govern ourselves in all cases, excepting matters of trade, and for the equal adjustment of that, the British Nation shall have Agents in Congress to have a voice there, and Congress or the several States to appoint Agents in Parliament, who are to have a voice there; and in fine seem willing to any thing but a total seperation; they desire we should have the same King; the same wars and the same peace. In my opinion their propositions cannot be fully supported by the Acts of Parliament. Be that as it may, Congress will again repeat; acknowledge our Independence or withdraw your JUNE 17, 1778  fleets and armies, and we will enter into treaty with you. This answer will be sent off to day, and as soon as it is received you may expect to hear the Enemy have evacuated Philadia., if that should not be done sooner.  Be upon your guard with regard to Letters from the Enemy; they intend to seduce, corrupt & bribe by every method possible. Keep the whole militia under marching orders, if you have the power. Warn the people to double their vigilance, and not be lulled with these pleasing prospects, lest they meet with some terrible stroke, when they do not expect it.  Present my best compliments to your good Brother Thomas, and tell him I am much instructed and obliged by his strictures on financeering and our paper money, but have not time to write to him. Also let Doctor McCall know, that I have reced. his letter, & wrote to the Commissary General of Prisoners &c. &c. and that Mr. Adams and myself will take every step in our power for the exchange of his son the Captain, and also Mr. Pope.(4)  Remember me with particular attention to Messrs. Read, Killen and the Gentlemen of the Assembly. Confederation is put off 'till Friday, tho' it has been the Order of the day for two weeks. New Jersey is in my situation with regard to Powers but they expect them daily.

  Dear sir York Town 18th June 1778. It has not been in my power with any convenience to make an earlier acknowledgement of Your Excellency's favor of the 11 th.  There were Letters in the Commissioners Packet only for Congress & particular Members then present in the House, one for Mr. E. Rutledge unsealed & several also unsealed were brought as being taken from the Express-the utmost caution is necessary in the present conjuncture of our affairs & therefore had any suspicious directions turned up, such should have passed under the Eye of Congress. The Idea of opening other people's Letter's is exceedingly abhorrent to me, but I think Congress have a power over Letters equal at least to that which necessity obliges them sometimes to exercise over persons; but Governor Johnson is too well hackney'd in the ways of Men to trust his deep schemes within our reach. JUNE 18, 1778  His private Letter to me, by the bye, is notwithstanding all his good sense, no proof of an infallible judgement, I am sure it is one, of his having mistaken his Man, I take the liberty of transmitting it, together with my intended answer(1) & the Letters from Mr. Oswald & Mr. Manning under this Cover for Your Excellency's perusal. There are some traits in Mr. Oswald's which strongly imply a determination on the part of Great Britain but reserved as the ultimatum, to submit to our Independence, I am much inclined to beleive the Commissioners now are or soon will be vested with powers for that purpose. Mr. Oswald is a Gentleman of solid understanding & quick perception, of a very large Independent fortune much exceeding a quarter of a Million Sterling, often consulted by Administration; for the goodness of his heart I refer you to this particular part of his Character, he is no place Man, but much Esteemed by the first Men of each of the political parties-great reliance may be placed on what he writes or even hints.  Yesterday there was an extraordinary Motion on our floor for calling upon Members to lay before Congress such Letters as they had received from the Commissioners or other persons, meaning persons in Great Britain on Political subjects.(2) I could not forbear offering some objections; it appeared to be a dangerous attempt to stretch the power of Congress. My Letters had been read by many Members & were at the service of every Gentleman who should request a perusal, but I could never consent to have my property taken from me by an Order from my fellow Citizens destitute of authority for the purpose. This circumstance & some remarks which followed have induced me to put Govr. Johnstone's Letter & my intended answer into Mr Draytons hands who is collecting materials for displaying the Governor's good designs & no doubt he will according to his usual tone add pretty severe strictures.(3) Among other Papers I transmit to Your Excellency Copies of the Commissioners Address to Congress & of their Commission. These are to be published by order. If no mistake was made a Copy of the Answer of Congress was sent to Your Excellency yesterday in my Public Letter.  I pray God to support & direct Your Excellency in this Moment of extraordinary tryal & am with the most sincere Esteem & Regard, Dear sir, Your much obliged & Obedient humble servant,  Henry Laurens ""

  My dear Sir York June 19th. 1778 I wrote you yesterday (1) that the Commissioners from the Court of G. Britain had received their answer which will put an End to the business of their Mission. Indeed they must have known from our repeated Answers to their General, our Observations on the bills before they had passed into acts, and the Treaty subsisting between America and France, that any Proposals short of Independence JUNE 19, 1778  would be rejected here. Their Injuries have been so great & so often repeated that they could not expect our return to their domination, & therefore in my Judgement their Views in carrying the Proposals of Treaty so far, were directed to the Reconciling their own People, & to give a colouring to their own Conduct in the Eyes of the Powers of Europe. Whatever may have been their Motives for persevering to Treat on such narrow Ground knowing as they did the Temper of America, the sudden abruption of all hopes of accommodation will immediately bring on some Determinations of considerable Moment respecting the operations of their Army. If they evacuate Philadelphia, and all their Movements & Preparations concur to shew they shortly intend it, their march will be directed to New York & thence up the North River.  Friday Evening the 19th. A letter from the General informs Congress that Capt. M'clean had taken Possession of Philadelphia, after the main Body had gone over to the Jersies, by the way of Coopers Ferry & three thousand had imbarked and proceeded down the River.(2) I hope we shall not expose ourselves to any danger from their Stratagems. I am anxious to know how the Commissioners received our final answer to their inadmissible propositions. These with the answers are inclosed. I wish to be informed how the People in Virginia stand affected as to the rejection of any Treaty or Communication, on the Subject of the late Acts of Parliament bearing the specious Title of Conciliation. If they could be prevailed on to make a vigorous Effort to raise a formidable army capable of resisting the augmenting powers of the Enemy, upon the principle of Self interestedness, & actual venality, as I do not expect it of them from Patriotism, they might the sooner go to the gratification of their Passionate fondness for Wealth, and the extension of that Commerce, the very Idea of which occupys every Faculty of their Souls.  Nothing has occurred since writing the foregoing, respecting the Enemys motions either by Sea or Land & the inclosed Paper contains an exact State of our politicks, so that I have nothing more to add than that I am most truly yr. affect. Friend, John Banister  My dear Mrs Bland (3) How is it that our correspondence is laid aside? Is it because a Person breathing this thick atmosphere, and inhabiting a Beotian Land, cannot produce a Sentiment that can claim the attention of a Lady of delicacy & Refinement? Perhaps there may be some thing in this Region unfavourable to the Flights of Fancy, & worse to the finer feelings of the Heart.

I send him back, and I shall return as soon as Mr. Chase or some other Delegate comes up, for I shall not be able to obtain leave of absence, unless our State be represented, which it would not be if I should go away before the arrival of another member.  By a letter recd. this evening from Gen. Washington we have authentic information of the Enemy's leaving Pha.; they evacuated it early yesterday morning.(1) Capt. M'Clean wrote to the General from the city of which he was in full possession. The General is not fully ascertained of the Enemy's destination: the general opinion is that certain. The General has put 6 brigades in motion towards Jersey & they are going to N. York whether by land, or by Sea was then un- JUNE 19, 1778  the rest of the army was preparing to follow with all possible expedition.  I desire my love to Molly & the little ones & Mrs. Darnall. I would answer little Poll's letter, but really have my hands too full. Please to present my compliments to your visitants.  Wishing you health and a long enjoyment of it, I am, yr. affectionate Son, Ch. Carroll of Carrollton  P.S. 20th June. I send you by Sam a packet from Joshua Johnson which Mr. Carmichael delivered to me. It contains newspapers, and I presume a letter, which I have not read, or even opened. As the perusal of the London newspapers, altho' of an old date, may afford you some entertainment, I send the packet by Sam. If the Enemy go to N. York, it is my opinion they will acknowledge the Independance of these States in 6 months time, and enter into a treaty of friendship & Commerce with us. I found my opinion on their not having declared war agt. France so late as the 28th April, when the Cornmissioners left England. Their finances are exhausted, they cannot procure Mercenaries from any Powers in Europe, their own People seem to be averse to the war; in such a juncture & situation of the affairs it would be madness to involve themselves in a war with the whole house of Bourbon, & carry on the present unjust & impolitic war agt. us.

We agree that you shall appoint a Naval Paymaster for your Department and hope you will be able to get some proper person for that purpose.

Congress has not yet fixed a Salary for the Paymaster-when they do we presume it will be adequate to the importance of the Office. Before this you will know that we have appointed Captain Barry to the Raleigh & as he is an active good officer, we have strong hopes she will shortly be manned.  Exclusive of the Vessels you have provided to carry dispatches to France, the sloop Providence will also be wanted for that purpose, and we request you will get her ready as soon as in your power. The Committee for foreign affairs will send off their dispatches to go by her in a day or two.(2)  We have only to repeat our former request that you will use your utmost endeavours to get our Vessels fitted for Sea and sent out together as Speedily as possible. We hope the news of the Bostons safe arrival in France may be true and congratulate you on the Enemys having been obliged to evacuate Philadelphia. We are Gentlemen, Your very Hble servants  P.S. We have received a Petition signed by Stephen Hill, Simon Gross, Joseph Adams, Adam Thaxter, Esek Hopkins & John Deamon.

  My Dear Sir, York Town June 20th 1778 I congratulate you on our army's being in possession of Philadelphia. We rec'd the intelligence this morning by express from General Washington;(1) the particulars of which important event and the  JUNE 20, 1778  circumstances and movements of the armies in consequence, I expect you will receive before this reaches you, and I believe we shall soon take leave of this dirty place and remove Congress to some place where we may be better accomodated. I make no doubt you have heard of the arrival of his Britannic Majesty's Commissioners, and of their letters being sent to Congress; I now enclose you a paper which will inform you of all the transactions of Congress relative to that affair which will I hope give full satisfaction to every honest American .  I have the pleasure to inform you that every member of Congress was firm and steady, never to make peace, but, on the principles of absolute Independence. I am sorry that the answer was deferred some days on account of the zeal of some members for sealing the letters up and sending the letters back without reading, in consequence of some harsh expressions against the King of France; however it was overruled as you will see and a more proper method in my opinion taken. What will be their next steps, time only can discover. In the packet to Congress were inclosed a great number of letters to the separate members, Some from Governour Johnstone to such of the members as he was acquanted with, and others from other persons in England who had any acquaintance with them. The enclosed from Robert Trail (2) came directed to you as a Delegate of Congress which was opened and I now enclose it to you.  As to Marine affairs, Congress are very sensible some very essential alterations are necessary and seem determined to attend to it, as soon as the Confederation and some other very important matters are finished. I wish I could inform you that I thought it would soon happen, but the multitude of business that is daily crowding upon us, and the time it sometimes takes to determine on some not very important matters makes me fear it will not take place so soon as I could wish. Besides the want of men in Congress acquainted sufficiently with Marine affairs is another great difficulty and causes that Committee to be filled with some persons like myself, unacquainted with the business they are ordered to superintend.  \""I heartily wish (with you) to see the American Navy respectable, and hope it will be put wholly into the hands of men whose private business does not militate with the public\"",(3) but I cannot be fully of your opinion that it would be for the public service to put an entire stop to privateering, as I think experience has Shewn that privateers have done more towards distressing the trade of our enemies and furnishing these States with necessaries, than continental ships of the same force, and that is in my opinion the greatest advantage we can at present expect from our Navy; for at this early period we cannot expect to have a Navy sufficient to cope with the British. However I am quite convinced that it might with proper management be in a  much better situation than at present and should be happy to see it soon take place.  The Congress is at this time pretty full. I know not whether you are acquainted with the President, Mr Laurens; I think him a very sensible, judicious man, acquainted with the world and makes an excellent President. Mr Drayton, the Chief Judge of So Carolina is a sensible judicious man, a good speaker, firmly attached to Independance and not given to the chicane common to lawyers. Mr R Morris from New York(4) is an eternal speaker, and for artifice a Duane and for brass equal to any body I am acquainted with. Mr. Adams from Virginia is a member; he informs me that he was innoculated with you at Elizabeth Town and desires to be remembered to you. On the whole I think we have a pretty good Congress and if we have nothing more to fear from British arms and policy than from their gold, I think you may make yourself perfectly easy as is your sincere friend & most obt servt, J B  [P.S.] Mr Wentworth desires to be remembered to you.

  My dear Sir. York in Pennsylva. 20th June 1778 Our enemies at N. York had contrived to distress us a good deal by a publication that the Boston was taken & carried into England. We were at first greatly concerned for our Friend, until we reflected on the lying genius of our enemies, and the improbability that Heaven would permit such a triumph of Vice over Virtue. Now we are made happy by an account from Boston that you are safely arrived in France. The Treaty with France was soon ratified here, desiring only that the 11th & 12th Articles might be reconsidered and omitted. Three Copies of the ratification have been sent away from hence near a month, and now 3 more are dispatching. The former dispatches would inform you the determination of Congress upon the English Acts of pacification, before we knew of our new Alliance, and these will acquaint you with the reception Messrs. the Commissioners from London have met with. The figure they cut is truly ridiculous. If this were all it would be happy for England, but she seems now to be a Setting Star. Two days ago the B. Army abandoned Philadelphia and our Troops are in possession of that City. The enemy are in the Jersies, but whether they mean to push for Amboy, or embark below Billingsport on the Delaware, is yet uncertain. The Jersey Militia are in readiness, & if our Army can cross Delaware in time, the gentry will yet get a parting blow. The friends to the future happiness and glory of America are now urging the Confederation to a dose, and I hope it will be signed in a few days. JUNE 20, 1778  All but a few Delegates have powers, and those that have not, come from Small States, that will undoubtedly fall in. Our next business is Finance, and this is a momentous point indeed. Every state exclaims we are overflown with our emissions of Money, yet all seem to be going on in the same beaten Track, and will I fear until invincible Necessity shall force a change. I wish to bring you, and my brother Dr Lee to be well acquainted. Republican Spirits who have so successfully labored for the liberty of their Country, and whose sole object is the security of public happiness, must esteem each other. The Continental Army is now on a much more respectable footing, both for numbers & discipline, and supplies of every kind, than it has been since the War began. It will give me singular pleasure to hear of your happiness at all times.  I am dear Sir most sincerely and affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Cannot Monsr.

I have seen your most elegant and most excellent letter \""to his Excellency Henry Laurens, the President, and other Members of the Congress.\""(2) As that body have thought your propositions unworthy their particular regard, it may be some satisfaction to your curiosity,  JUNE 20, 1778  and tend to appease the offended spirit of negotiation, if one out of the many individuals on this great Continent should speak to you the sentiments of America. Sentiments which your own good sense hath doubtless suggested, and which are repeated only to convince you that, notwithstanding the narrow ground of private information on which we stand in this distant region, still a knowledge of our own rights, and attention to our own interests, and a sacred respect for the dignity of human nature, have given us to understand the true principles which ought, and which therefore shall, sway our conduct.  You begin with the amiable expressions of humanity, the earnest desire of tranquility and peace. A better introduction to Americans could not be devised. For the sake of the latter, we once laid our liberties at the feet of your Prince, and even your armies have not eradicated the former from our bosoms.  You tell us you have powers unprecedented in the annals of your history. And England, unhappy England, will remember with deep contrition, that these powers have been rendered of no avail by a conduct unprecedented in the annals of mankind. Had your royal master condescended to listen to the prayer of millions, he had not thus have sent you. Had moderation swayed what we were proud to call mother country, \""her full-blown dignity would not have broken down under her.\""  You tell us that \""all parties may draw some degree of consolation, and even auspicious hope, from recollection.\"" We wish this most sincerely for the sake of all parties. America, even in the moment of subjugation, would have been consoled by conscious virtue, and her hope was and is in the justice of her cause, and the justice of the Almighty. These are sources of hope and of consolation, which neither time nor chance can alter or take away.  You mention \""the mutual benefits and consideration of evils, that may naturally contribute to determine our resolutions.\"" As to the former, you know too well that we could derive no benefit from an union with you, nor will I, by deducing the reasons to evince this, cast an insult upon your understandings. As to the latter, it were to be wished you had preserved a line of conduct equal to the delicacy of your feelings. You could not but know that men, who sincerely love freedom, disdain the consideration of all evils necessary to attain it. Had not your own hearts borne testimony to this truth, you might have learnt it from the annals of your history. For in those annals instances of this kind at least are not unprecedented. But should those instances be insufficient, we pray you to read the unconquered mind of America.  That the acts of Parliament you transmitted were passed with singular unanimity, we pretend not to doubt. You will pardon me, gentlemen, for observing, that the reasons of that unanimity are  strongly marked in the report of a Committee of Congress, agreed to on the 22d of April last, (3) and referred to in a late letter from Congress to Lord Viscount Howe and Sir Henry Clinton.(4)  You tell us you are willing \""to consent to a cessation of hostilities, both by sea and land.\"" It is difficult for rude Americans to determine whether you are serious in this proposition, or whether you mean to jest with their simplicity. Upon a supposition, however, that you have too much magnanimity to divert yourselves on an occasion of such importance to America, and perhaps not very trivial in the eyes of those who sent you, permit me to assure you, on the sacred word of a gentleman, that if you shall transport your troops to England, where before long your Prince will certainly want their assistance, we never shall follow them thither. We are not so romantically fond of fighting, neither have we such regard for the city of London, as to commence a crusade for the possession of that holy land. Thus you may be certain that hostilities will cease by land. It would be doing singular injustice to your national character, to suppose you are desirous of a like cessation by sea. The course of the war, and the very flourishing state of your commerce, notwithstanding our weak efforts to interrupt it, dearly shew that you can exclude us from the sea. The sea your kingdom.  You offer \""to restore free intercourse, to revive mutual affection, and renew the common benefits of naturalization.\"" Whenever your countrymen shall be taught wisdom by experience, and learn from past misfortunes to pursue their true interests in future we shall readily admit every intercourse which is necessary for the purposes of commerce, and usual between different nations. To revive mutual affection is utterly impossible. We freely forgive you, but it is not in nature that you should forgive us. You have injured us too much. We might, on this occasion, give you some late instances of singular barbarity, committed as well by the forces of his Britannic Majesty, as by those of his generous and faithful allies, the Senecas, Onondagas and Tuscaroras. But we will not offend a courtly ear by the recital of those disgusting scenes. Besides this, it might give pain to that humanity which hath, as you observe, prompted your overtures to dwell upon the splendid victories obtained by a licentious soldiery over unarmed men in defenceless villages, their wanton devastations, their deliberate murders, or to inspect those scenes of carnage painted by the wild excesses of savage rage. These amiable traits of national conduct cannot but revive in our bosoms that partial affection we once felt for everything which bore the name of Englishman. As to the common benefits of naturalization, it is a matter we conceive to be of the most sovereign indifference. A few of our wealthy citizens may hereafter visit England and Rome, to see the ruins of those august temples, in which the goddess of Liberty was once adored. These will hardly claim naturalization in either of those   places as a benefit. On the other hand, such of your subjects as shall be driven by the iron hand of Oppression to seek for refuge among those whom they now persecute, will certainly be admitted to the benefits of naturalization. We labour to rear an asylum for mankind, and regret that circumstances will not permit you, Gentlemen, to contribute to a design so very agreeable to your several tempers and dispositions.  But further, your Excellencies say, \""we will concur to extend every freedom to trade that our respective interests can require.\"" Unfortunately there is a little difference in these interests, which you might not have found it very easy to reconcile, had the Congress been disposed to risque their heads by listening to terms, which I have the honour to assure you are treated with ineffable contempt by every honest Whig in America. The difference I allude to is, that it is your interest to monopolize our commerce, and it is our interest to trade with all the world. There is indeed a method of cutting this garden knot which perhaps no statesman is acute enough to untie. By reserving to the Parliament of Great-Britain the right of determining what our respective interests require, they might extend the freedom of trade, or circumscribe it, at their pleasure, for what they might call our respective interests. But I trust it would not be to our mutual satisfaction. Your \""earnest desire to stop the farther effusion of blood, and the calamities of war,\"" will therefore lead you, on maturer reflection, to reprobate a plan teeming with discord, and which, in the space of twenty years, would produce another wild expedition across the Atlantic, and in a few years more some such commission as that \""with which his Majesty hath been pleased to honour you.\""  We cannot but admire the generosity of soul, which prompts you \""to agree that no military force shall be kept up in the different States of North-America without the consent of the general Congress or particular Assemblies.\"" The only grateful return we can make for this exemplary condescension is to assure your Excellencies, and, on behalf of my countrymen, I do most solemnly promise and assure you, that no military force shall be kept up in the different States of North-America without the consent of the general Congress, and that of the legislatures of those States. You will therefore cause the forces of your royal master to be removed, for I can venture to assure you that the Congress have not consented, and probably will not consent, that they be kept up.  You have also made the unsolicited offer of concurring \""in measures calculated to discharge the debts of America, and to raise the credit and value of the paper circulation.\"" If your Excellencies mean by this to apply for offices in the department of our finance, I am to assure you (which I do with \""perfect respect\"") that it will be necessary to procure very ample recommendations. For as the En-  glish have not yet pursued measures to discharge their own debt, and raise the credit and value of their own paper circulation, but, on the contrary, are in a fair way to encrease the one and absolutely destroy the other, you will instantly perceive that financiers from that nation would present themselves with the most aukward grace imaginable.  You propose to us a devise to \""perpetuate our union.\"" It might not be amiss previously to establish this union, which may be done by your acceptance of the treaty of peace and commerce tendered to you by Congress.(5) And such treaty, I can venture to say, would continue as long as your ministers could prevail upon themselves not to violate the faith of nations.  You offer, to use your own language, the inaccuracy of which, considering the importance of the subject, is not to be wondered at, or at least may be excused, \""in short to establish the powers of the respective legislatures in each particular State, to settle its revenue, its civil and military establishment, and to exercise a perfect freedom of legislation and internal government, so that the British States throughout North-America acting with us, in peace and war, under one common sovereign, may have the irrevokable enjoyment of every privilege that is short of a total separation of interests, or consistent with that union of force on which the safety of our common religion and liberty depends.\"" Let me assure you, gentlemen, that the power of the respective legislatures in each particular State is already most fully established, and on the most solid foundations. It is established on the perfect freedom of legislation and a vigorous administration of internal government. As to the settlement of the revenue, and the civil and military establishment, these are the work of the day, for which the several legislatures are fully competent. I have also the pleasure to congratulate your Excellencies, that the country, for the settlement of whose government, revenue, administration, and the like, you have exposed yourselves to the fatigues and hazards of a disagreeable voyage, and more disagreeable negociation, hath abundant resources wherewith to defend her liberties now, and pour forth the rich stream of revenue hereafter. As the States of North-America mean to possess the irrevokable enjoyment of their privileges, it is absolutely necessary for them to decline all connection with a Parliament, who, even in the laws under which you act, reserve in express terms the power of revoking every proposition which you may agree to. We have a due sense of the kind offer you make, to grant us a share in your sovereign, but really, gentlemen, we have not the least inclination to accept of it. He may suit you extremely well, but he is not to our taste. You are solicitous to prevent a total separation of interests, and this, after all, seems to be the gist of the business. To make you as easy as possible on this subject, I have to observe, that it may and probably will, in some in  stances, be our interest to assist you, and then we certainly shall. Where this is not the case, your Excellencies have doubtless too much good sense as well as good nature to require it. We cannot perceive that our liberty does in the least depend upon any union of force with you; for we find that, after you have exercised your force against us for upwards of three years, we are now upon the point of establishing our liberties in direct opposition to it. Neither can we conceive, that, after the experiment you have made, any nation in Europe will embark in so unpromising a scheme as the subjugation of America. It is not necessary that everybody should play the Quixotte. One is enough to entertain a generation at least. Your Excellencies will, I hope, excuse me when I differ from you, as to our having a religion in common with you: the religion of America is the religion of all mankind. Any person may worship in the manner he thinks most agreeable to the Deity; and if he behaves as a good citizen, no one concerns himself as to his faith or adorations, neither have we the least solicitude to exalt any one sect or profession above another.  I am extremely sorry to find in your letter some sentences, which reflect upon the character of his most Christian Majesty. It certainly is not kind, or consistent with the principles of philanthropy you profess, to traduce a gentleman's character without affording him an opportunity of defending himself: and that too a near neighbour, and not long since an intimate brother, who besides hath lately given you the most solid additional proofs of his pacific disposition, and with an unparalleled sincerity, which would do honour to other Princes, declared to your court, unasked, the nature and effect of a treaty he had just entered into with these States.(6) Neither is it quite according to the rules of politeness to use such terms in addressing yourselves to Congress, when you well knew that he was their good and faithful ally. It is indeed true, as you justly observe, that he hath at times been at enmity with his Britannic Majesty, by which we suffered some inconveniences: but these flowed rather from our connection with you than any ill-will towards us: At the same time it is a solemn truth, worthy of your serious attention, that you did not commence the present war, a war in which we have suffered infinitely more than by any former contest, a fierce, a bloody, I am sorry to add, an unprovoked and cruel war. That you did not commence this, I say, because of any connection between us and our present ally; but, on the contrary, as soon as you perceived that the treaty was in agitation, proposed terms of peace to us in consequence of what you have been pleased to denominate an insidious interposition. How then does the account stand between us. America, being at peace with all the world, was formerly drawn into a war with France, in consequence of her union with Great-Britain. At present America, being engaged in a war with Great-Britain, will probably  obtain the most honourable terms of peace, in consequence of her friendly connection with France. For the truth of these positions I appeal, gentlemen, to your own knowledge. I know it is very hard for you to part with what you have accustomed yourselves, from your earliest infancy, to call your colonies. I pity your situation, and therefore I excuse the little abberations from truth which your letter contains. At the same time it is possible that you may have been misinformed. For I will not suppose that your letter was intended to delude the people of these States. Such unmanly disingenuous artifices have of late been exerted with so little effect, that prudence, if not probity, would prevent a repetition. To undeceive you, therefore, I take the liberty of assuring your Excellencies, from the very best intelligence, that what you call \""the present form of the French offers to North-America,\"" in other words the treaties of alliance and commerce between his most Christian Majesty and these States, were not made in consequence of any plans of accommodation concerted in Great-Britain, nor with a view to prolong this destructive war. If you consider that these treaties were actually concluded before the draught of the bills under which you act was sent for America, and that much time must necessarily have been consumed in adjusting compacts of such intricacy and importance, and further, if you consider the early notification of this treaty by the court of France,(7) and the assurance given that America had reserved a right of admitting even you to a similar treaty, you must be convinced of the truth of my assertions. The fact is, that when the British Minister (8) perceived that we were in treaty with the greatest Prince in Europe, he applied himself immediately to counteract the effect of these negociations. And this leads me with infinite regret to make some observations, which may possibly be by you considered in an offensive point of view.  It seems to me, gentlemen, there is something (excuse the word) disingenuous in your procedure. I put the supposition that Congress had acceded to your propositions, and then I ask two questions. Had you full power from your commission to make these propositions? Possibly you did not think it worth while to consider your commission, but we Americans are apt to compare things together, and to reason. The second question I ask is, What security could you give that the British Parliament would ratify your compacts? You can give no such security, and therefore we should, after forfeiting our reputation as a people, after you had filched from us our good name, and perswaded us to give to the common enemy of man the precious jewel of our liberties; after all this, I say, we should have been at the mercy of a Parliament, which, to say no more of it, has not treated us with too great tenderness. It is quite needless to add, that even if that Parliament had ratified the conditions you proposed, still poor America was to lie at the mercy of any future Parliament,   or appeal to the sword, which certainly is not the most pleasant business men can be engaged in.  For your use I subjoin the following creed of every good American. I believe that in every kingdom, state, or empire there must be, from the necessity of the thing, one supreme legislative power, with authority to bind every part in all cases, the proper object of human laws. I believe that to be bound by laws, to which he does not consent by himself or by his representative, is the direct definition of a slave. I do therefore believe, that a dependence on Great Britain, however the same may be limited or qualified, is utterly inconsistent with every idea of liberty, for the defence of which I have solemnly pledged my life and fortune to my countrymen; and this engagement I will sacredly adhere to so long as I shall live. Amen .  Now if you will take the poor advice of one, who is really a friend to England and Englishmen, and who hath even some Scotch blood in his veins, away with your fleets and your armies, acknowledge the independence of America, and as Ambassadors, and not Commissioners, solicit a treaty of peace, amity, commerce and alliance with the rising Stars of this western world. Your nation totters on the brink of a stupendous precipice, and even delay will ruin her.  You have told the Congress, \""If, after the time that may be necessary to consider this communication, and transmit your answer, the horrors and devastations of war should continue, we call God and the world to witness that the evils, which must follow, are not to be imputed to Great-Britain.\"" I wish you had spared your protestation. Matters of this kind may appear to you in a trivial light, as meer ornamental flowers of rhetoric, but they are serious things registered in the high chancery of Heaven. Remember the awful abuse of words like these by General Burgoyne, and remember his fate. There is one above us, who will take exemplary vengeance for every insult upon his Majesty. You know that the cause of America is just. You know that she contends for that freedom, to which all men are entitled. That she contends against oppression, rapine, and more than savage barbarity. The blood of the innocent is upon your hands, and all the waters of the ocean will not wash it away. We again make our solemn appeal to the God of Heaven to decide between you and us. And we pray that in the doubtful scale of battle we may be successful, as we have justice on our side, and that the merciful Saviour of the world may forgive our oppressors.  I am, my Lords and Gentlemen, The friend of human nature, And one who glories in the title of, An AMERICAN.  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Gazette, June 20, 1778.  1 This is the first of four pseudonymous newspaper letters that Morris wrote to various members of the Carlisle commission as \""An American.\"" The other three appeared in the Pennsylvania Packet on July 21, September 19, and Octo-  ber 20, 1778, and are printed in this edition of Letters under those dates. Morris revealed his authorship of the first letter in his June 23 letter to John Jay-\""The answer to the Commissioners & the annotations signed an American were the product of your friends lucubrations\""-and there is a draft of the third in Morris' hand among his papers at NNC.  2 For a discussion of the formulation of Congress' official response to the Carlisle commissioners' June 9 letter, in which Morris played a leading role, see Samuel Adams to James Warren, June 13, 1778, note 3. Morris was a member of the committee appointed on June 16 to draft a reply to the commissioners' letter, and the present address probably stems in part from his work on that body. JCC, 11 :610.  3 Morris was the author of Congress' April 22, 1778, response to Lord North's earlier conciliatory proposals. See JCC, 10:374-80; and Morris to John Jay, May 3,  4 See William Henry Drayton's Draft Letter to Lord Howe, June 6, 1778.  5 This offer was made in Henry Laurens' June 17 letter to the Carlisle commissioners.  6 For a discussion of the French announcement to Great Britain of the conclusion of the treaty of amity and commerce with the United States, see Henry Laurens to George Clinton, May 11, 1778, note 3.  7 Contrary to Morris' understanding of the situation, the French had not yet informed the British of their treaty of alliance with the United States. Ibid.  8 Lord North.  Joseph Reed to Esther Reed My dear Hetty Philad. June 20th. 1778 I received your Favour yesterday at this Place which the Enemy evacuated on Thursday. I came into it the same Evening & it exhibited a new & curious Scene, some gloomy Countenances but more joyful ones, few very few Quakers visible even in the Streets, Shops shut up & all in great Anxiety & Suspence. I am now at Mrs. Yards who has been good enough to compleat the Memorandum of the Things we gave her. To which I have added since I came to Town a Qr. Cask of Wine (Lisbon), Some English Cheese, Porter, Plates, Dishes & some Knives & Forks. I directed Queen's Ware but found on Inquiry that China was only a Triffle dearer on which I ordered the latter & bought them with Continental Money only as dear again as with Gold. I have now almost as many Things as will load a Waggon. You will in your next tell me which I shall send or bring up to you. I send you indosed your Brothers Letter & the Parliamentary Register. The Printer got the News Papers away & has not returned them but I will take Care that he shall. I am very glad to hear that your Brother is so happily settled. Mr. Morris has done all in his Power to get the Affair settled he mentions, but has been used exceedingly ill by his Correspondents there who have refused his Draught tho they have Money in Hand for the Purpose. I hope it will be no real Detriment to your Brother as we shall now have a better Oppy. of doing what is proper. If your Mamma chuses the 10   Guins. you can pay her in Gold which she can do what she pleases with. The Rate of Exchange is too unsettled to put the Matter in any other Line.  I have rode my Horses a great deal of late, shall therefore let them stand a few Days perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday when I hope to have the Pleasure of seeing you at Fleming Town. But as this Letter will go direct to you I shall expect a few Lines before I set out. My Love to Mamma & the Children. My dear Hetty's Affect,  J Reed [P.S.] If my dear Girl would wish me to purchase any Thing more for her she will let me know. There will be Linnen enough. I thought Stockings for you had been in the Mem[orandu]m but found it not so. Would you have any & of what sort?  If this reaches you before Nurse sets out she can take the Hessian Mare & send her from Cornmans to Henry Conrads who will sell her for me. I have spoke to him on the Subject-the Saddle to be left at Cornmans or rather brought to Town & left at Mrs. Fords.  ""

  Sir, York-Town June 20th 1778 Mr. Collins arrived the Day before yesterday, and brought forward Instructions from the Councill of War.(1) By the last Letter from Mr. Ellery and Mr. Marchant, you'l perceive they were not unmindful of, and had not delayed to impress upon Congress the critical Situation of Our State and the late Ravages there committed.(2) There needs no Information or Complaint against the Clothier General. We shall, as soon as we have the least Prospect of Success, urge a further Supply of Monies to Our State, but it cannot immediately be done. We shall also push the Necessity of some armed Vessells for Our Bay; But we are rather fearful of not succeeding in such an Application. A Letter from Genl. Sullivan pointing out the Utillity would however strengthen Our Efforts.(3)  The Enemy evacuated Philadelphia last Thursday Morning; Three Thousand of their Troops were on Board Ship, falling down the River, the Rest were in the Jerseys, nearly opposite the City, their Destination uncertain. Our whole Army were immediately on the March; Genl. Maxwells with about two thousand Men had previously been ordered into the Jerseys. Genl. Arnold was ordered with a small Detachment to take the Command of the City. Congress have given their answer to the British Commissioners.

I am intirely Satisfied, as to his Acco. of the particular Subject which he mentions. You will probably hear before you shall receive this that the Enemy left Philadelphia the Morning of the 17t.(1) They passed over to the Jersy Side and it is said Went down to Billingsport where they have probably shipped. This last Circumstance is not fully ascertained. It is supposed that the Troops are destined for N York. Genl. Washington has moved after them. Genl. Arnold will as long as it is Necessary Command at Philadelpa.  I Enclose to you the Proceedings of the Commissioners and the Answer of Congress. This Answer as it was most unanimously given, will douptless dose the Correspondence unless G Britain will accede to the Terms which it proposes. As the Commissioners are using every means to make some Impression upon the Americans, their Conduct will be carefully Watched, altho I am fully of Opinion that every Art of theirs will be totally ineffectual. No Man except he is a most hardened Tory will hesitate a Moment wheither he shall adhere to the Independency of this Country, An Independency which G Britain must and will finally acknowledge.  Mr. Hosmere I hear is on his Way to Congress. But I do not hear JUNE 20, 1778  wheither any other Delegate is with him. I expect to Return soon- certain Matters of an Important Nature are now in Consideration which I should be much Satisfied to see determined before I leave Congress.(2) I hope they will be so within about the Course of a Week, after which Congress will undoubtedly adjourn to Philadelphia, thro which I shall probably Return home.

  Sir, York Town 20 June 1778 Before you will receive this you will doubtless be informed that the Enemy evacuated Philadelphia the morning of the 17t. They passed over to the Jersy Side, and it is said they have turned down to Billingsport, where it is supposed they will ship themselves. The Route which the Enemy have taken is not fully ascertained. Their Destination in the first Instance is supposed to be N York. As I well know Sir, you wish to be informed what overtures the British Commissioners have made, and the Determinations of Congress in Regard to them, I do myself therefore the Pleasure to Endose them to you. As no comments of mine respecting this Transaction can Assist your own Reflections, I shall therefore only observe, that I am in the fullest Manner perswaded that every Veiw of the Enemy to bring about a Pacification short of Acknowledging the Independence of these States will be found totally delusive. And if a Folly of a Very JUNE 20, 1778  singular Nature did not continually direct the British Councels I should flatter myself that they would admit the Independency of this Country immediately, and Avoid a War which they must otherwise be involved in, which would threaten the Very Existence of the British Nation. The Designs of these overtures might probably be, to Satisfy in some Measure the Opposition to the British Administration, accelerate their Loans, Prevent our Ratifying the Treatys with France, and divide the Americans. In every of these Veiws I trust they will be disappointed as they certainly already are in some of them.  We have no recent Intelligence from Europe. Congress I apprehend will Adjourn to Philadelphia within a Week or ten days. I am Sir with respect, your most Obedient, humble Servant,  Oliver Wolcott P.S.

  My dear Sir York Town June 21 1778 Although we are exceedingly pressed with publick Business at this Juncture, I cannot omit the opportunity that now offers of writing to you. The general Scituation of Affairs, and the particular Transactions between the British Commissioners and the Congress will be transmited to you by this Conveyance, by the Committee for foreign Affairs. Since I last came to this Place from Boston, several Gentlemen have arrivd here from France viz Mr Simeon Dean, Mr Carmichael, Mr Stevenson, & Mr Holker. Mr Carmichael comes strongly recommend[ed] by Dr Franklin & Mr Silas Dean; but Dr Lee in his Letter gives Reasons why he cannot place a Confidence in him. From a long Correspondence with Dr Lee, I conceive so great an Opinion of his Candor as well as inflexible Integrity & Attachment to our Country, that I cannot entertain a Doubt that he would suffer partial Considerations to operate in his Mind to the Prejudice of any Man. Such a Difference of Sentiments concerning a Gentleman who I imagine must be of some Consequence, could not take Place without at least apparently good grounds; and it may produce such Effects on this Side of the Water as may prove uncomfortable to us if not injurious to our Cause. Would it not then be doing some Service, to exercise your Prudence in endeavoring to investigate the real grounds of it, in doing which possibly some things may open to View of Importance and at present not thought of .(1)  JUNE 21, 1778  Dr Lee is a Gentleman of a fair and generous Mind. I wish therefore that you would freely converse with him upon this Subject if you think you can do it with Propriety; and let him know that I have lately receivd many Letters from him, which I have duly attended to and would have acknowledgd to him by this Opportunity, if I had Leisure.

  My Dear York Town June 21st 1778 I have Reced your letter of the 28th of May and it gives me great pleasure to hear you & the rest of the family are in a comfortable State of health and that Rhoda gains Strength.  I am well & by the favor of Providence I have had my health Ever since I arrived here, hope it will be continued to us all. The weather and air here is Dearer & I believe more wholesome than at Philadelphia.  Last Thursday the 18th Inst. our army took possession of Philadelphia, we had the account of it by Express from Genl. Washington yesterday morning: I Expect you will have the particulars before you Receive this more fully than I can at present inform you.  This Town is not large Enough to accomodate the multitude of people that have constantly Business with Congress. This lays us under great Difficulties and raises the price of Every thing to an Enormous heigth. Beside the Disagreable Manner in which these people Cook their victuals, and the sluttish manner of washing our linnen in Cold water only, which has already almost ruined mine, makes me willing to quit this place, tho I believe it to be a healthy place.  To get rid of these & many other Difficulties and to be nearer the army which is Removed Northward, I Believe Congress will soon Remove to some other place, I Expect to the City of Philadelphia; (1) and by the time this reaches you, it is probable we shall be packing up for that purpose. The Brittish Commissrs. have sent letters with their proposals to Congress and we have given them our answer.

On the 18th of this month Gen. Clinton with the British army (now under his command) abandoned Philadelphia, and the City is in possession of our Troops. The enemy crossed into Jersey, but whether with design to push for So. Amboy, or to embark below Bilingsport on the Delaware is yet uncertain. Gen. Washington has put his Army in motion, and is following the enemy into jersey. There has arrived here a Mr. Holker from France who has presented a paper to Congress declaring that he comes with a verbal message to Congress from the Minister of France touching our treating with Great Britain & some other particulars which for want of his paper we cannot at present enumerate.(1) The style of his paper is as from the representative of the Court, but he has no authentic voucher of his Mission for the delivery of this verbal message.

  Dear Sir 21th June [1778] I hold myself much indebted for your very obliging Letter of the 15th and for the right of perusing the papers which it contained, a pleasure which I reserve for a very early minute tomorrow Morning. 'Till this moment I had not found time to read yours quite through, and now but slightly, nor can I do more at present than to return very full thanks and a brief reply unless I would lose the opportunity of transmitting this by Colonel Pettit.  The Indosed Gazette will shew you Sir, the proceedings of Congress respecting the Commissioners, that I also have been honor'd with a Letter from Governor Johnstone introduced by two from my best Friends in England. And that you judged with Congress in with-holding an Answer to the Governor.  Congress seemed by no means disposed to consent that any private Character should correspond with him and I would not hazard a denial. Some strong attempts were made to have all Letters received from Governor Johnstone and from England through him laid before Congress. Many Gentlemen had perused mine and every one who should have asked might have done the same, but I don't relish compulsion unauthorized, to avoid misconstruction therefore I submitted to a solicitation for making his Letter to me and my intended Answer just in the shape in which I had carried it to Congress Public.  Mr. Manning's and Mr Ozwald's Letters are in the hands of Colo.  JUNE 22, 1778  John Laurens where, if your time will permit, I beg you will run your Eye over them. I think to make the latter a subject in next Gazette, if it reaches me in time, and to add an Answer which I had also written immediately after reading it, but which my Freind cannot now expect to have in any other way.(1) He will, from the tenor of his own Letter know the reply to be intended for him, although both will appear without names.  I have something of another nature to communicate, but am ashamed to keep Col. Petit waiting. I must therefore defer to another opportunity and condude the present by assuring you that I am, With great regard &c.  ""

  Honorable Sir, 22d June [1778] I had the honor of writing to you the 9th & 10th Inst.(1) by Messenger Wilkinson through Charles Town & on the 14th Inst. of receiving your Honour's Letter of the 16th April. Congress were so ardently engaged in business respecting the British Commission at Philadelphia at the time your Honor's Letter reached & for a few days after as deprived me of opportunity to present it before the 19th. It was then, with General Howe's Letters & one from the Honorable Mr. Speaker Committed to a Select Committee, from whom no Report is yet come up & possibly in our present crowd of business may not be made.(2) I am persuaded it will not be taken under consideration, for Several days, Congress Seem determined to suffer no other matter to come before them if possible to avoid it until they shall have Ratified Confederation. In these circumstances I have judged it proper to return your Messenger, whose expences are in this place intolerable, & I expect to have an opportunity of writing by Colo. Marbury full as early as I shall receive commands, if it shall happen otherwise an Express Messenger shall be dispatched.  JUNE 22, 1778  Your Honor will be pleased to receive within the present Inclosure an Act of Congress of the 17th Inst. for preventing all correspondence between the Enemy & private persons of the good people of these States, to which I take the liberty of adding four Copies of the Pennsylvania Gazette of the 20th containing the Commissioners Address to Congress, their Commission, the Answer of Congress &ca &ca & also an hand Bill Supplement, with the Duke of Richmond's remarkable Speech of the 5th March in the House of Lords.(3)  I have this Instant a Letter from General Washington dated 20th in the Evening.(4) He had then advanced within 10 Miles of Coriels ferry. General Lee with Six Brigades was to arrive at the ferry that Evening. The Enemy had advanced as far as Eyres Town & were repairing the Bridge which we had nearly destroyed for retarding their March, a pretty brisk firing had passed between the Enemy & part of Maxwell's Brigade in which a Deserter who had just come in says the former lost several Men.(5)  General Dickinson writes the Jersey Militia had taken up the Alarm & were in good Spirits, the obstructed Roads & Bridges or rather want of Bridges will render the Enemy's passage difficult. (6) General Washingtons whole Army will soon be up with them, between these & the Militia 'tis probable Sir Henry Clinton must run the Gantlet, & I hope will not escape without Several lashes. However this may happen, his whole conduct Still wears the aspect of Stratagem, he had certainly two days to March ahead of our Commander in Chief, he had made no further progress than 15 Miles & General Washington had travelled 40 at least.  I have likewise just received a Letter from Majr. General Gates Peeks Kill 17th June. (7) The Militia & draughts were coming in very fast & he \""thanks Heaven for the precious time the Enemy had so foolishly lost.\"" The General adds \""I think all preparations for an Indian War will be unnecessary other than those I have already placed in the hands of Brigadier General Stark, I wish this Country to steer dear of that Hornets Nest the Six Nations & their Allies, the Savages from my Country are enough to deal with at one time.\""  Thus far things in this quarter look well. I hope the prospect in the Sothern States are not more unfavorable.  I am in possession of a Letter written by a Gentleman of Character in London dated 10th April introducing Govr. Johnston & I believe under the Eye of the British Ministry in which among many humiliating concessions these remarkable terms appear.  \""Your paper Money shall not only be funded & Secured but if desired we will lend you two or three Million-lose not the feelings of Christians in the resentments of Men, as you have fought Nobly now act more nobly & forgive us\""-\""and the Door was shut.\""  People are thronging towards Philadelphia were General Arnold Commands by order of General Washington.

  Gentlemen, York Monday P.M. 22d June 1778 The Instructions of the House of Delegates of the 18th instant (1) we this morning received in a letter from Mr. Chase, and laid them before Congress; whereupon at our earnest desire, it was resolved to take into immediate consideration the amendments proposed by our State to the Confederation, altho' Congress had previously determined to take up the amendments offered by the several States in the order in which the States are ranged in the Confederacy, beginning first with New Hampshire, and so on.  This evening the 3 amendments offered by Maryland were debated and 11 States out of the 12 present, rejected the amendments to the 4th and 8th Articles, so that our State only voted for them. The fate of the most important amendment is not yet decided, the question being put off by adjournment till tomorrow morning, when it will probably be rejected by a majority of eight States out of twelve.  A Confederation at this critical juncture appears to Congress of such momentous consequence, that I am satisfied a great majority are resolved to reject the amendments from every State, not so much from an opinion that all the amendments are improper, as from the conviction, that if any should be adopted, no Confederation will take place, at least for some months, perhaps, years; and in that case, many apprehend none will ever be entered into by all of the present united States; the distractions probably consequent on such an event, and the many dangers and evils, which may arise from partial Confederacies (which you may more easily point to yourselves than we can express) have determined some States to accept the present  JUNE 22, 1778  Confederation altho' founded on principles not altogether consistent, in their opinion, with justice and sound policy. For if any amendments should be adopted, it will then be necessary to send the Confederation back to those States, whose Legislatures have empowered their Delegates to sign and ratify it in its present form; for instance, to New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and North Carolina, the Delegates of which States are positively instructed to ratify the Confederation, as it now stands, and some of them are directed to admit of no alterations, even litterary ones, such as would not affect the true spirit & meaning of any article, but only serve to elucidate that meaning and spirit by removing all ambiguity, and doubt.  In debating our second amendment, vizt to the 8th article, it was admitted on all sides to be the true meaning & intention of that article, that all lands, not only those already granted to, or surveyed for any person, but all lands hereafter to be granted to, or surveyed for any person, should be subjected to valuation, and considered as a part of the whole wealth of the State in which they lie. It was contended by several members that the meaning of the 8th article is clearly expressed, but confessed by some to be dark and ambiguous, who nevertheless voted against the amendment, for the reasons we have already assigned.  The amendment to the 4th Article was considered by every State, Maryland excepted, as unimportant; the Article not being liable, in the opinion of any other State to the objection made and consequences apprehended by Maryland.(2)  23d P.M.  Our third amendment has just been rejected by a Majority of one State;(3) the division was as follows.  Against the Amendt. For the Amendment N.

  Dear Sir 23 June [1778] My last private to Your Excellency is dated 13th Instant. I sent it to Governor Caswell for conveyance, as I did on the 20th one of the Pennsylva. Gazettes giving it a possible chance of reaching your Excellency earlier than this.(1)  The Enemy are now certainly out of Philadelphia, but their movements still wear the aspect of stratagem, they had certainly two days start of General Washington, & according to his advice of the 20th he had marched 40 miles or very near it, Sir Henry Clinton only 15. That Letter will be inclosed for your Excellency's information. I request Sir if you cause it to be published order the title to be a Letter from Camp and no name and the same or a similar restriction respecting General Gates' Letter which will also be enclosed.(2) JUNE 23, 1778  Admitting the Enemy to be in earnest meaning to penetrate the Jerseys, our affairs at present may be said to be promising. The roads in their way are much encumbered, Bridges broke up &c, surrounded by numerous hosts all in high spirits and thousands in the highest degree of resentment for great injuries received-their Officers and Men all in the dumps, and desertion determin'd upon by the latter in General and executed as often as opportunity offers.  Congress had granted 932,7431/3 Dollars for defraying the expence of an Indian War, which was at that time judged to be inevitable.(3) General Gates now gives us better hopes.  Rhode Island is still possessed by the Enemy and lately reinforced by some 4 or 500 Troops. General Pigot perseveres in ravaging the Country as often and as much as he can. He lately intimated by Letter to General Sullivan that as by the American Laws all Males from 16 to 60 are obliged to bear Arms he should capture as many such as he could, or all of such, which he might capture, should be considered as exchangeable for British Soldiers.(4) In pursuance of this Idea he is attempting to add Glory to his name by stealing Boys and reserving the right of ageing them to himself-this shews, to say the mildest, great distress on their part, from the detention of Mr Burgoyne's Men.  I troubled your Excellency some time ago with a request to obtain certain Evidence from Captain Senff and I hope soon to receive it in confirmation of what has lately been declared by other foreign Officers respecting the Colours which ought to have been surrendred at Saratoga, and which General Burgoyne like an honest candid Man declared had been left in Canada.(5) A copy of this declaration will be found Inclosed and may, with Captain Senf''s in general Terms and even with Comments, leaving out names for the present, be published.  Genl. Washington had sent on the Answer from Congress to the Commissioners who had left the City, and there the Subject rests.(6) You will observe Sir, in the Pennsylvania Gazette a Letter from Govr. Johnstone to myself, and my intended answer, made public by the great anxiety of many People to be informed, and indeed by an attempt of a Member of Congress to obtain an order that all Letters from Govr. Johnstone should be laid before the House. This appeared to me to be unjust and inefficatious. Congress have no power to compel & if the unwarrantable Order had passed, it would have produced Letters only from their Freinds who were not inclined to make them secret.  Your Excellency will find within the present Inclosure Copy of a Letter from Govr. Johnstone to a friend of mine in Camp(7) together with Copy of one from a Gentleman in London to my Friend-over these I have all power except printing-even this, I expect in a few   days, in the mean time it will serve for information to your Excellency and other Friends & fellow Citizens at home.  Colo. Malcom lately informed me that having heard one of the Enemy's ships lay near in North River he caused an 18 & 24 Pounder to be dragged down in the night with 51 shot, when the flood tide had made strong he opened his little masked Battery of Bushes and at the distance of 500 to 700 yards pierced her 47 times-when he had only I shot remaining a breeze of Wind favouring, the Swift, I think she is called, of 16 Guns cut her Cable and towed off, he took up the Cable and anchor and returned without loss. The Crew of the Ship, the Colonel, says passed their time in great confusion but fired not a shot in return.  We are now to the exclusion of all other business closely engaged on Confederation, if I judge right, Ratification of the original Act will be obtained in the course of this week. Were the various amendments to be fully discussed and alterations made I should not live to see Ratification.  When we have evidence of the Enemy's being fairly gone, Congress will turn their faces toward Philadelphia. General Washington has appointed General Arnold to command there, and 'tis probable the City is now under Whig principles again. People are flocking that way from all Quarters, some shamefully to the neglect of the most important duties.  I doubt much whether I shall have time to write to any other Freinds in Charlestown, although I must trouble your Excellency with Packets of Newspapers for a few. I add to the papers above mentioned the Duke of Richmonds very remarkable Speech of the 5th March-if your Excellency shall not have seen a copy earlier this will afford half an hours agreeable entertainment. In the first event your Excellency will be pleased to accept my meaning, and do me the Honor to believe me with great Esteem and Respect, Sir &c.(8)  ""

Washington with 13,000 men is in hot pursuit of the enemy. He was about crossing Delaware the day before yesterday. If our Army can come up with them before they embark, we may have a second edition of Burgoyne. Governor Johnsone tries every art to gain admission among us. He abuses his  JUNE 23, 1778  Masters, flatters America, and is willing to yield us every thing if we will be perfidious to our Ally and again submit to the domination of his King & Parliament. This Man possesses in abundance Scottish cunning and Scottish impudence. But it is too late in the day. The Sunshine of liberty and independence prevails over the dark arts of Tyranny and its Tools.  We hope in 6 or 8 days to ratify the Confederation (all but two or 3 small States, at the head of which is Maryland and all of whom I have no doubt will soon fall in) without amendments-after which Congress will adjourn to Philadelphia. I am dear Sir affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Sir, York Town 23d June 1778. On the Application of the Delegates of the State of New York Congress have given a Draft on their Treasury for the Sum of 100,000 Dollars.(1) This we have properly indorsed and my worthy Colleague Mr. Duer (who by the bye I assure you hath in various Instances rendered the most essential Services not only to the State which sent him but to the united States of which Congress are fully sensible) will transact this Business and as soon as the Treasury is so much in cash as to advance a considerable Part of the Money will return to the State. I am sorry to add that I fear the Public will [be] deprived of the Use of his Zeal and Abilities.  I have the Pleasure to perceive that a Spirit of Justice reigns throughout Congress inclining them to do every Thing necessary to quiet the unhappy Disturbances in the North Eastern Part of our State.(2) It is impracticable to force this Business on nor indeed can I as one Member answer it to myself to postpone the great Business of Confederation we are now engaged in even for a Moment. I enclose you the Public Prints from whence you will perceive that Matters of no small Importance occupied our late Deliberations. It is my earnest Hope that our Determinations may be agreable to those whom I have the Honor to represent. The very important Business of regulating the civil Departments of our Army and the numerous Train of et caeteras which go to the Composition of that more important Business of Finance will I hope be prosecuted with unremitted Attention upon our Arrival at Philadelphia. God knows when the great Business of this Continent will be compleated or rather arranged. Untill it is in some good Train I shall think it my Duty to exert the little share of Abilities which Providence hath entrusted to me for the Use of my Country. My Wishes as a private Man to be in JUNE 23, 1778  the State of New York in this most critical Conjuncture you Sir can readily conceive. My private Wishes however have no Right to interfere with my public Character.  I have the Honor to be, most respectfully, your Excellency's most obedient and most humble Servant, Gouv Morris  ""

  Dear Sir York the 24th of June 1778 I should long since have answered your favor of the 25th of May had it been worth while for any thing I had to communicate,(1) to interrupt your attention from the important affairs with which you are surrounded. It is indeed more from motives of complaisance than any thing else that I now write. But I cannot help congratulating you Sir on the enemies abandoning Philadelphia, because, let their motives be what they may, this step evidently proves their prospect of conquest here is vanished. I fancy Gen Clintons future operations depend much upon the Chapter of Accidents. A French war being avoided, efforts will continue to be exerted for sometime against us, but a foreign war must of necessity carry this Army to secure the now defenceless Islands of G.B. in the W.I. A war with France, in the better days of England, would instantly have followed the Message of Marquis de Noailles,(2) but the mean & wicked determination to enslave America, removes all thoughts of every thing but the accomplishment of their favorite object. The British Kings message to his Parliament, altho it shews mortified pride, and strong sense of insult, yet it clearly marks indicision, and doubt about the propriety of resenting the affront. We see by a publication of the enemy in the Newport paper that there is a great probability of Spain having acknowledged the Independence of these States, & joined in our Alliance. The Ambassadors of Spain & of G.B. were on the point of returning each to his respective Country. Of this event taking place, I had no doubt, so soon as the plate fleet should have reached old Spain. Should G.B. be engaged in war with the Bourbon family it [will] furnish us an opportunity of pushing the former quite off this Northern Continent, which will secure to us peace for a Century, instead of war in 7 years which the British possession of Canada, N. Sco. & the Floridas will inevitably produce. You have no doubt heard Sir that our last Assembly have voted 2000 Infantry to join the Army & a sum of money to foward Gen. Nelsons Cavalry.(3) The latter may soon be expected at Head Quarters. I am with sincere esteem dear Sir your most affct. & obedient servant,  R.H. Lee JUNE 24, 1778  ""

  To the Congress. [June-July? 1778](1) In the present Situation of our Affairs it must be evident to every Observer that America must be victorious if she can prosecute the War since it is impracticable for Great Britain to pursue it much longer. Now America can prosecute the War so long as she can keep an Army in the Field, but to keep an Army it is necessary to have Men to clothe, arm, Feed & pay them. To all these Purposes Money is the great Thing needful. A Paper Circulation may depreciate to such a Degree as no longer to answer the Purposes of Money. And this hath been the Case in a great Measure from the Want of Attention, Management and Method. To look thro the Causes of our Misfortunes may lead to the Cure. The Want of Men arises from sundry Sources. Ist. the short Enlistments at the Commencement of the War. 2 ly. the Advance in the Price of Labor & Commodities. 3dly. the enormous Bounties given by several of the States. 4thly. the great Sums paid for Substitutes in the frequent Calls of the Militia. 5thly. from the Want of Discipline by which Means Soldiers not only desert in great Numbers but no Attention being paid to their Manner of Living by their Officers they loose their Cloaths become sickly & finally die or are rendered unfit for Service. 6thly. from the Want of Cloathing, Blankets and the like & lastly from the Defects of the Hospitals by which many die & the Sufferings of those who survive prevent ReEnlistments.  The Money also hath depreciated from several Causes as I st. From the very Nature of it it was a Matter of very great Doubt among many whether it would not finally sink in the Hands of the Possessor hence the Aspect of our Affairs hath a manifest Influence upon its Credit. 2ly. From the many different Kinds of Paper Money Counterfeits became easy and therefore Men were less inclined to receive it. 3dly. The great Wages given to our Soldiery, The frequent JUNE-JULY ?, 1778  Portrait of Gouverneur Morris JUNE-JULY?,1778  Calls of Militia and after that every other Cause which hath caused great Emissions tends by the Quantity of the Money to lower it's Value. 4thly. The great Prices given for Commodities the natural Produce of the Country by the Servants of the Public from the Want of due Arrangement in the several Departments. 5thly. The Want of Oeconomy & Frauds in those Departments. 6thly. All those Laws which were framed to regulate Prices from that of Gold & Silver down to every other Article the necessary Consequence of which was to exclude such things or at least the greater Part of them from Commerce and therefore to raise the Price of the Remainder from the Scarcity, from the Plenty of Paper Money & from the Risque of breaking the Law. 7thly. From the Depreciation once begun arose a Depreciation consequent upon it distinct from other Causes since from thence the Possessors of Commodities would ask more than what would otherwise have been the Market Price foreseeing that tho' that Price might be the just Value at the Time of Sale it must soon become less, others also from this Depreciation would be led to engross and moneyed Men continually receiving their Debts in nominal Money of decreasing Value would be led to realize (or purchase any thing not perishable such as Land, Gold, Silver, Iron & the like) all which was taken out of the Circle of Commerce. 8thly. No Taxes having been laid and the Authority of the Governments in many Instances shaken it became doubtful with many whether even any Attempt would be made to redeem any Part of it and therefore, 9thly. When the Continent offerd to loan their own Money there being no visible Funds to pay the Interest Men were disinclined to trust them.  In order to restore the Value of Money it becomes necessary to lessen the Quantity & Kinds to provide Ways and Means to procure Funds for carrying on the War and to use Oeconomy in the Expenditures.  (1) To lessen the Quantity & Kinds of Money I would propose that every State should instantly by Law cry down their own Emissions and redeem them with Continental Loan Office Certificates and be duly charged by the Continent with the Interest of such Certificates.  (2) If Credit can be procured in Europe (of which more presently) to absorp a considerable Quantity of the Paper by selling Bills of Exchange.  (3) To gain a Credit to our Funds in Order to procure Loans and here  1st. The Payment of the Bills drawn for the Interest of the Debt will have a considerable Influence but it is necessary to extend that Influence into foreign Countries & gain Credit there, for which Purpose I propose  2ly. That the States should each pass an Act restricting their several Limits within a certain Line to be drawn for that Purpose  JUNE - JULY?, 1778  and declaring that the Residue shall appertain to the Congress of the united States in Consequence of which Cession the States which really Part with Territory to receive a Compensation by the Abatement of some Part of their future Quota of the Continental Debt. From this Land I would set off a well sized State for our own Soldiers, for Deserters from the Enemy and for such Gratuities as Congress or their public Ministers may chuse to make from a proper Distribution of which Land the Men of great Influence in Europe may be brought to favor our Cause. The Remainder should be divided into other large Districts by Natural Boundaries and be called by separate Name which should denominate our Funds and supposing these names to be A,B & C any Man in Europe who put into the Fund A should be entitled at any Time to so much Land in that Country as could be purchased there at that Time for his Debt by which Means we should be able to give Security for the Principal of our Debt which no Nation in Europe can do.  3dly. It should be an Additional Article in the Confederation that an Acknowledgement of 21/2 per Cent should be paid on the Value of all Commodities imported into America from any Port not within one of the united States and that this Acknowledgement and also every other Duty for the Regulation of Trade or otherwise laid should be paid to the Continent as a sinking Fund for the Principle & Interest of Debts by them contracted during the War. This Acknowlegement alone would produce from the American Commerce in 772 £125.000 Stg. equal to 1,250,000 Dollars of our present Money at least and if we add 250,000 for what would arise from other necessary Duties over and above the Cost of collecting the Whole this would make 1,500,000 Dollars which would be the Interest of a Debt of 25,000,000 Dollars at six per Cent. The Post Office also properly regulated would in Time produce a very considerable Remedy without Burthening the Community it being rightly observed that this is the most agreable Tax ever invented. But as these would yield little or nothing at present I would propose  4thly. that a Capitation Tax of one Dollar upon every Inhabitant be paid as a sinking Fund at present and that this be faithfully and honestly applied notwithstanding any Exigency to pay the Interest & Part of the Principle or where the Interest is payable in Europe there the Principle of the public Debts at the same time taking Care that the Debt of highest Interest be paid first.  (4) In Order to raise the Value of the Money which is always a saving to the public it will be proper.  Ist. To take off all Restrictions upon the Sale of every Commodity Gold and Silver not expected.  2dly. As soon as a State of the public Debts can be made out after adopting the other Plans proposed to publish such State and thereby undeceive the Public who think it much greater than it really is. JUNE-JULY?, 1778  3dly. To devise a proper Mode of calling all those to Account who have received any public Monies and provide Checks in the further Issues of which more hereafter.  (5) In providing Money for the public Exigencies I would observe that from January to January Congress should Vote a particular Sum, for Instance 20,000,000 Dollars of which 10,000,000 should be raised by the several States by Tax and the Remainder on Loan in America and as at present 27 Livres Tournois are equal to 15 Dollars supposing Exchange to fall so low as that a Dollar shall be worth two Livres then a Credit of 20,000,000 Livres Tournois will enable us to buy up a Sum of Paper Money equal to the whole Tax by which Means the Cash will be in the public Coffers in Advance and the Credit of the Money at Home just as high as we chuse to make it for by this Means the public will not be indebted to its own Subjects one Shilling more after borrowing 10,000,000 Dollars than before, and the circulating Medium will be 10,000,000 less and as the foreign Debt is to be paid in Produce whenever the Money is made valuable the Produce will become cheap & the Debt consequently small, for Instance, 5 Livres as above will purchase 2 1/2 Dollars which in the State of New York will purchase one Bushel of Wheat but the Money being made valuable as above the Wheat may be bought for one such Dollar, that is for the same Money two Bushels and an half of Wheat may be purchased which in France will sell for twenty Livres Wherefore 5 Livres borrowed and invested in Paper now will pay twenty Livres hereafter or in other Words the Debt is lessened 3/4 tho By pursuing the above Plan with Judgment it will be very easy to regulate the Value of our Money which ought not be very high for the following Reasons. Ist. The Pay of our Soldiery is now fixed at 6 1/2 Dollars per Mo. which at par Exchange is 1/Stg. per Day but at present about 4d 1/2 or less If Exchange be lowered to 2 l/2 Livres for I Dollar in Paper the Pay of the Soldiery will be 6d per Day. 2dly. The Money being below Par thus much, that is 2 1/2 instead of 5, We shall by paying our Interest in France give in Effect 12 per Cent which will finally bring all our Money into our own Coffers so as that our Subjects will eventually be our Chief Creditors the Good Reasons for which in sinking the Debt are obvious. 3dly. It will enable us to regulate our Contracts for Supplies to the Army as we please of which more hereafter. Many other Reasons will shew themselves in the Course of time.  These Means being pursued to get Money and render it valuable the next Consideration is to be cautious in the Expenditures without which it is impossible to provide Funds even could we mortgage the Mines of Potosi. (I) The Treasurey Board, the Navy Board, and the Commercial Board, I am unacquainted with but I must confess that I wish to see all this Business executed by Commissionr[er]s.  1. The Treasury Board should consist of three Parts, the Treasurer,  Auditor & Comptroller. The Auditor should be a Gentleman of Great Industry, Accuracy & Integrity & have in his Office at least six Gentlemen each of them a good Accomptant & faithful which six should form two Chambers, one of Dues the other of Claims. The former should adjust all Accompts brought into the Treasury for Payment, the other All Accompts unsettled where it is supposed that the Public Money lies in the Hands of Individuals. These Accompts being Adjusted should be laid before the Auditor (who should be impowered by the several States to call Persons to accompt by particular Process) and he should examine them & mark them thus Audited for the Sum of this Day of 177 , and sign it, He and the several Chambers under him always taking Care that exhorbitant Prices are not allowed if charged. Copies of these Accounts should be kept in his Office marked filed & Entries made in his Books of the Sums audited and on what Accounts and make Monthly Returns of such Entries made to Congress, then the Accounts with the Vouchers referred to should be handed over to the Comptroller whose Business it should be to examine them anew and see from whom and to whom the Sums audited are payable & pass the same and make proper Minutes thereof in his Books and draw Bills on the Treasurer comformable to the Manner in which such Accompts are passed (to which the treasury Seal is to be put) and make monthly Returns to Congress of the Accompts by him passed. The treasurer is simply to receive and pay Money taking Care that he pay it only to those duly authorized to receive it, to keep the Check Accompt of the Loan Office & the like and ought also to render monthly Accompts to Congress.  The Navy Board or Board of Admiralty ought as I conceive to be submitted to five Intelligent Sea Officers well acquainted with maritime Affairs and otherwise qualified as Men of Business. Untill our naval Affairs are a little more reduced to System it must require Great Knowlege in Sea Affairs upon a large Scale to qualify a Man for a Seat at that Board. Nor shall we find for many Years Persons duly qualified to act in it from having made such things the Object of their Attention as a Branch of political Science. These Persons should from Time to Time make Report as should the Board of War, the treasury Board & the like to an Executive of which more hereafter.  The Commercial Board should consist of the five most intelligent Merchants to be met with. At present it will be their Duty to attend simply to the Commercial Concerns of the Continent but such a Board ought to exist for the Purpose of continually collecting, comparing & examining the Commerce of the Several States, the Course of Exchange &ca &ca by the Help of which they would be enabled to give Information from Time to Time what Laws, Treaties & Regula-  tions would be proper and beneficial, what Number of Seamen could be had in Emergencies & the like.  The Board of War being at present in Commission I shall say Nothing upon that Chapter only that Men of Experience, of Business & acquainted with the Resources of America should be always upon that Board which for many Years Yet to come will have infinite Concerns to attend to. For whether we have Peace or not I state it as certain that we must have some Soldiers & many Magazines of Artillery, Field Equipage, Ammunition & military Stores &ca.  I will here take an Opportunity to observe upon what must strike the Observation of every Gentleman acquainted with our public Affairs It is that a Body such as the Congress is inadequate to the Purposes of Execution. They want that Celerity & Decission upon which depend the Fate of Great Affairs. Other Reasons not less cogent might be adduced Wherefore it might be proper especially during the War to have either a Committee of three or a single officer such as Chief of the States Who should superintend the Executive Business, receive the Reports of the several Boards of the Secretary for foreign Affairs and the like and prepare the whole in the Form of Memorials for the House where there Authority is necessary & where it is not there to perform the necessary Acts.(2)  (2) The Next Thing which demands a most serious Attention is to involve all the military Affairs of the Continent into one Department which would prevent a Variety of Abuses by which the public is injured in many Respects but particularly by the Destruction of Vast Sums of Money. Thus there are at present a Commissary's Department, a Quarter Masters Department & an Hospital Department to the Northward and no army besides the several Departments clash in Purchases double, treble or quadruple the Number of Persons are employed in procuring the same Articles and the like not to mention the absolute sineCures &ca but the Detail is infinite.  (3) As to the several Staff Departments of the Army viz the Quarter Master's, Commissaries & Hospital in their order.  1. The Quarter Masters Department is open to such an Endless Train of Frauds from the very Nature of the thing that it is impossible to devise any adequate Checks. A thing which hath never as I can learn been done by any Army. The only Way to keep it within any Bounds is by examining the Accounts frequently, the Vouchers accurately, taking Care that the Purchases and Expenditures agree & that Losses, Casualties & the like be properly ascertained, after all the Head of the Department is most to be depended on if he is vigilant, industrious & honest he may do much towards preventing Frauds. Further a constant Return should be required of his Deputies, their Pay & Appointments &ca. where they are &ca. This Detail should be monthly. I would observe particularly that the Article of Forage alone is ruinous without accurate Managemt. Wherefore   there should always be in the Army a Forage Yard and Rations of Forage delivd. with Accuracy as also at the several Magazines and Receipts taken without which the Expenditures should not be allowed. At present any of the Depy. Qur. Mrs. may purchase on the Contl. Acct. & sell on his own Acct. without being detected.  2. The Commissaries Department upon which but too much is to be said. Generally I will venture to affirm that every Step is capitally defective. Let me be indulged in a small Detail. A who is a Commissary of Purchases buys 100 Cattle whose Average Weight is in Beef 400, Hide & Tallow 100, in the whole 50,000 wt. for these he gives Certificates at 25 per Ct. Advance upon the Market Price supposing that to be 1/ then his Certificates are at the Rate of 1/3 and to color it the Cattle estimated and marked accordingly to weigh on an Average 600. 50,000 wt. @ 1/ is £2,500 to which add 1/4 or £625, the Price Charged is £3,125, the Difference he pockets by purchasing the Certificates at a Discount by the Intervention of a third Person. These Cattle are driven at the Public Expense during all Seasons favorable or unfavorable to the Camp. When they get there they consume Forage for which the Army is always in great Distress, grow lean, some of them die, some when killed returned unfit for Use, some sent out of Camp into the Country to be fattened, of the Beef, some putrifies almost all the Tallow is lost, a great Part of the Hides lost, many of them much damaged, the Heads are thrown away, the Entrails & Filth serve to generate putrid Diseases, the Horns are lost, the Feet from which Oil to curry all the Hides might be extracted are also thrown into the general Mass of Corruption, finally the Beef itself in the Hot Weather renders the troops liable to Diseases of a bilious Kind. I say Nothing of the purchases of Spirits, of Vinegar, of Bread, of Pease &ca. &ca.  The Remedy I would here propose is 1st. To contract within particular Districts of Country with Individuals for the Cattle of that District as thus to be delivered at some Place on the Banks of the Rivers Susquehannah, Delaware or Hudsons (where it is to be presumed the Enemy could not penetrate) at a certain Time from so many thousand to so many thousand Wt. of Beef, the Beef to be weighed as thus, the four Quarters, the Hide & the rough Tallow at so much per Pound. At these Places should be the public works necessary and Magazines of Salt, Nitre, Allum, Pot or Pearl Ashes, Barrills &ca. &ca. The Cattle should be here killed the Beef cut into Mess Pieces of 4 1b. each and 50 Pieces put in a Barrill with a proper Proportion of Salt, Nitre (or Pot Ashes) & Allum to preserve it. The Hides taken proper Care of. The Tallow made into (Candles & Soap. The oil extracted from the Feet. The Tripe taken Care of and the Heads made into portable Soap. It is worthy of Observation that those who contract with the Crown in Ireland clear nothing but the Horns & Hoofs by their Bargain. It may be said that the Transporta-  tion of Provisions would be by this Means rendered too expensive to which I answer that the Transportation should be by Water as much as possible and if there be 40 Miles Land Carriage for the Provision of 20,000 Men it will require daily twenty good Teams being eighty Horses whereas the same Men would require 40 large Oxen per Day and with 5 Days Provision before Hand there would be a constant Demand of Forage for 400 large Cattle instead of eighty Horses.  As to Purchases of Flour they may I am confident be better made by Contract than at present as may the Baking Business for which the Contract should be that the Quarter Master provide ovens & Fuel and that the Contractor deliver so many Pounds of Bread as he shall receive of Flour.  Spirits & Whiskey ought by a Resolution to be fixed at a certain Standard in the Delivery to Soldiers for otherwise great Frauds may happen of which more hereafter.  Vinegar which I will venture to say is absolutely necessary to an Army should be procured by Contract in very large Quantities at different Places by which Transportation would be saved and the Article itself if not used one Year be infinitely better the next. So much for the Purchases but in the Issues a still more terrible Scene opens upon us, to trace which let us suppose a Regt. to consist of 500 Rations daily & take the year @ 350 Days, & examine the Perquisites, private & public Frauds.  1st. Perquisites.  500 Rat. Salt Prov. 50 Days is 130 Blls. in each of which is 1/4 of a Bushel of coarse Salt @ 40 Dlls per B. 1300 Dlls. 20 Rat. daily on an Average to the Sick in the whole 10,000 @ 1/5 of a Dollar 2000 Perquisites. 3300 Private Frauds.  500 Gills of Rum or Whisky for abt. 250 Days, 125,000 from which deduct 1/3 (sometimes more) and add Water leaves 40,000 say 32,000 or 1000 Galls @ 4d per Gall is 4,000 For Rat. not delivered, scant Weight & Measure &ca &ca say 20 Rat. for 350 Days, 9000 @1/5 1,400 Private Frauds. 5,400 Public Frauds.  500 Rat. fresh Beef @ 11/4 for 300 Days & usual Allowances for Wastage is abt. 200,000 from which the Real Weight killed viz 240,000 deduct 1/6 for false Returns of Wt. by issuing Comy. of Brig. is 40,000 @ 1/8 5,000 Absent on Detachments, With Leave, Deserters &ca. always  some wherefore suppose the whole Regt. abt. 10 Days in the Year during which time they draw Provisions elsewhere is 5000 @ 1/5 1,000 For setling back Rations they give (due Bills) wherefore the whole Quantum being issued & due Bills given to such as do not draw the whole say 20 Daily for 250 Days. 5,000 @ 1/5 1,000 Public Frauds. 7,000 The Account then stands thus Perquisites 3,300 Priv. Frauds 5,400 Public do 7,000 15,700. Peculation on 500 daily, or 157 on 5 Suppose 100,000 Rat. daily issued is three Million Dollars. If to this be added the Frauds in purchasing, Losses from Mismanagemt. &ca. which may be fairly stated at two Millions more this will be five Millions, or 50 Dollars on each Ration supposing them worth 1/3 each to the Public then for a Year it is 120. Now if as the Case is at least 3 Rat. be delivered out on the Continent for every soldier actually in Service then each Soldier must be estimated at 360 Dollars per Annum to feed him from which is peculated & wasted in different Ways to the Amount of 150 Dollars, on the whole it will appear that at least 5 times as much is paid as is necessary. But to remedy this.  1. I observe that for this Purpose as well as many others, it is absolutely necessary to procure Muster Masters and Adjutant Generals well acquainted with their Business and possessing Industry and strict Integrity. These Officers are the great Checks of an Army particularly the former who should at every Muster make Return to the Genl. & to the Board of War noting in the same all Differences between the Musters and the Returns.  2. The Officers of every Rank except Genl Officers should be confined to the drawing of but one Ration which if not drawn should not be paid for and a Subsistence Money equal to their present Rations should be allowed in Lieu of what they are now entitled to Under this Head also we may comprehend another Abuse & the Remedy. No Officer should be allowed to keep a Soldier as his Servant but should be allowed the Sum of 8 Dollars per Mo. to pay & subsist his own Servant.  3. No Ration should be allowed to the sick but the same ought to be specifically drawn for by the Surgeon who in his sick Return should also return the Provisions drawn for to the End that the Orders if improper may be corrected by his Superiors and such Orders should be copied by the Clerk of the flying Hospital weekly & transmitted to the Commissary General. From this Regulation also the  frequent Absence of Surgeons from their Regts. would be prevented a thing much to be lamented at present.  4. No Rations should be drawn unless for those present fit for Duty and where officers on Command & Detachments not joined &ca. draw Provisions either of Commys. or Inhabitants, they should be charged with the same and obliged to pay therefor unless within a Month Copies of their Receipts are by them filed with the Commissary Genl. or his Deputy or Agent, this being the only Means of checking the Waste occasioned by Detachments.  5. The present Pernicious Practice of serving out Rations to Artificers in Places where they can find Subsistence should be stopped since among many other Evils which arise from it the Infinity of Commissaries is by no Means the least.  6. The Quarter Masters in drawing Provisions should be obliged to make duplicate Returns of their respective Regts. & of the No. of Rations drawn and duplicate Receipts of the specific Articles & one Copy of each should be filed with the Adjutant Genl. who should weekly annex to the same a Copy of the Weekly Return of such respective Regt. & send the same to the Comy. Genl. who should be allowed proper Clerks of the Check to examine and check the same.  7. When any Spirits shall be delivered out below the Standard the Qur. Master should be obliged to make up in Quantity the Defect of Quality.  3dly. of the Hospital Department I will venture to affirm generally that it is replete with Abuses of the greatest Consequence.  Ist. In the very great Number of Persons employd in it which partly arises from the Number of Departments into which it is divided.  2 ly. In the Ignorance of many of its Members owing to the Promotion of improper Persons to higher office originally than they had Right to expect &  31y. In the Want of Method and Arrangement throughout or rather in the pernicious Systems adapted.  As this Business is not that to which I am most adequate, so on the other Hand I will venture to say that from Inquiry & Attention I have put myself in a Situation not to be quite ignorant of it. By the last Returns prior to which a great Number were discharged it appears there were in Pay of the Cont. 1 Director Genl., 3 Deputy Directors Gen., 2 Assistant Deputy Directors Genl., 3 Phisicians Genl., 3 Surgeons General, 3 Phisicians & Surgeons Genl., 3 Apothecaries General, 30 senior Surgeons, 36 Junior Surgeons, 56 Surgeons Mates and seven Apothecaries Mates over and above all the Regimental Surgeons & Mates & over and above what may be in the Southern Departt. Here it is worthy of Remark that from Ist Jany. to the Ist May all the Sick of our Army were Attended by I Senr. & 2 Junr. Surgeons as also 3000 Patients innoculated. To remedy the   Evils in this Business, I would propose to institute a Medical Board to consist of a chief Director Genl., Inspector Genl. & chief Phisician & Surgeon. These three should examine all medical Men Candidates for Office & give Certificates according to their talents. Moreover the Chief Director should mark out the several Places for erecting Hospitals, who should attend at them and the like. The Inspector Genl. should visit & examine the Hospitals from Time to Time & the Conduct of those whose Business it might be to take Care of them & the like, and the Chief Phisician & Surgeon should receive regular transcripts of the Diseases & Wounds with the Prescriptions & Operations & examine the same. Under these Gentlemen should be one Purveyor and three Assistants, one Commissary & such Deputies as Occasion might require, 4 Surgeons & Phisicians, 8 Senior Surgeons, 16 Junior Surgeons & 32 Mates, I Apothecary, 2 Assistants & as many Mates as Circumstances might require. These with occasional Detachments from the Regtl. Surgeons in Times of great Sickness would be amply sufficient for an Army of fifty thousand Men if one-fifth were constantly in Hospital besides Accidents. By this also Men of Science might be got into the Service, a thing which would save the Lives of many brave Soldiers.(3)  4. The Cloathier Genls Department will require considerable Attention but for this Purpose it will be proper to appoint a special Committee to examine into this Matter & report some Method of putting Cloathing into the Hands of the Regt. Paymasters with the Prices to be charged the troops.  Finally as to every Department.  It should be an unalterable Decree that whenever any Person in the public Service either in the Quarter Masters, Commissaries or Medical Departments shall be guilty of trading or of following any other private occupation such Person should be discharged & forfeit all the Pay & Appointments of his Office.  And to all this let it be added that exact Discipline in an Army is essential to Oeconomy & without it no possible Arrangments can be effectual. G.M.  ""

I had many things to propose respecting my Domestick concerns, but  JULY 1, 1778  as I am kept so ignorant of the present State of them, I must Submit to suffer them to go on without my Interference.

The Two Armies Engag'd in the Jersies, we forc'd them from the Field & Encamp'd on the Ground, The Loss on either Side not yet known, theirs much more than ours, they have lost some Field Officers, among their Slain is Col Monckton, brother to General Monckton; as soon as particulars come you shall know them. I inclose Copy of a few Lines Rec'd from General Washington.(1) Col. Walter Steward, whom you know, is wounded & several other of our Officers whose names I do not Recollect; a Captain in Col Jackson's Regimt. it is said is mortally wounded, but I cannot learn his name. Jackson's Regiment was order'd from hence to harrass the Rear of the Enemy. This will be a dear Remove to General Clinton's Army, it is the universal opinion that should Clinton reach New York, his army will be lessen'd 4000 in effective men; Desertion has taken very deep Root. This Battle has so discompos'd, & Ruin'd Clinton's Army, that it is hardly possible they should be able to effect any Operations this year; in short the Game is over with them. Do Congratulate all my Friends, give them the Substance of this Scrawl, I write in great haste, being much Engag'd in the Business I came from York Town upon.  Remember me to every Friend, I will write them as soon as I get settled, have not got Lodgings, have some thoughts of Taking Mr. Williams's house, if I should, & I find I must Tarry here, I shall take the Liberty of Sending for you, but have come to no Determination.

  My dear Sir Philade July 3d 1778 Yesterday I arrivd in this City and to day I have the Pleasure of receiving your Letters of the 10th & 18th of June, the last of which inclosd the News Papers of that Day. I observe a Paragraph under the Head of Paris the 15th of April, mentioning the Arrival of Mr Adams a few days before. I hope it is true; but I wonder that no Notice was taken of it in a Letter from Portsmouth of the 22d of the same Month, which mentions the sailing of the Commissioners from St Helens on the 21st and this was taken from a London Paper of the 25th ten days after the announcing of his Arrival in Paris.(1) Capt Courter brought us nothing new from France. You have commonly had News from Europe earlier than we, though not so authentically. Your Papers give us brilliant Accounts from that Quarter. \""Spain has this day avowd her Acknowledgement and Support of the Independence of America\""-\""It is expected that Holland will be the next Power to recognize the Independence of America\"" &c &c. These Things we expected to hear of before this Time. They are the Effects of Instructions given to the Agents of Congress so long ago as while they were at Baltimore in Decr. 76, (2) and at a Time when the Enemy were striding through the Jerseys. Our Affairs were then at a low Ebb indeed; but Nil desperandum was the Motto of the true Patriots of America. Heaven has since done great Things for us, for which, I fear, we are not so thankful as we ought to be. Our Army has gaind considerable Advantages over the Enemy since they left this City. The Particulars are not yet come to Hand. You will doubtless have them before I shall be able to inform you of them. I now begin to promise my self the Pleasure of seeing the Liberties of  JULY 3, 1778  our Country establishd on a solid Foundation. It will then be my most earnest Wish to be releasd from all publick Cares, and sit down with my Family and a little Circle of faithful Friends in the Cottage of Obscurity. There we will give Thanks to the God of Heaven for the great Things he has done for America, and fervently pray that she may be virtuous, without which she cannot long enjoy the Blessings of Freedom.  I am greatly concernd for my dear native Town, lest after having stood foremost in the Cause of Religion & Liberty she should lose her Glory. We may say inter Nos, Her Principles & Manners have had great Influence in securing the Liberties of America. But has she not exchangd her manly Virtue, for Levity & Luxury and a Train of ridiculous Vices which will speedily sink her in Contempt. I am affraid the Cry of too many is, Quaerenda Pecunia primum est!-\""Get Money, Money still, And then let Virtue follow if she will!\"" The inordinate Love of Gain, will make a shameful Alteration in the Character of those who have heretofore sacrificed every Enjoyment to the Love of their Country. He is the best Patriot who Stems the Torrent of Vice, because that is the most destructive Enemy of his Country. Adieu my Friend. S A  [P.S.] My Friendly Regards to Mrs Savage, Mr Scollay &c &c.

  Dear Madam July 3d. 1778 I have this Afternoon received your Favour of June 12th and at the same Time a Gazette from Boston, of later Date, in which I find a pleasing Entry in Regard to Mr. Adams's Arrival in France. It is so likely to be true from the blundering Manner of it that I venture to congratulate you upon it.  Mr. Thaxter is not yet arrived here,(1) but is expected hourly. He will heartily participate in the Joy of your Family.  Disgrace pursues the Army of our Enemies in their Passage from this City. The particulars are not yet come to Hand of the Battle at JULY 3, 1778  Montmouth; but we know it has been very fatal to the best of the British Troops. I shall communicate the partial Account this Day to Mr. Adams, and acquaint him with the Health of his dearest Friend and her little ones.  Nothing can exceed the Filthiness of the Houses which have been occupied by the Enemy here; but, externally, the central Part of the City does not appear much abused. The northern Liberties as they were called are gone intirely, and Southwark has been much injured. The Schuylkill appears from five miles Distance; so totally have the Woods and Orchards been destroyed.  I think you need not apprehend a Visit from the shattered Army now at Sandy Hook. The Desertion which prevails must shortly ruin it. When the foreign Troops were sent for to support the broken Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the British Divisions, it was answered that many of the Officers were willing to obey but none of the Soldiers.

  My Lord. Philadelphia July 5. 1778 While I present my thanks for your favour of the 30 ultimo, I snatch the opportunity to present my personal thanks for your distinguished services on the 28th, (1) services glorious to yourself, & truly important to the United States. The Hero Stirling has done much, very much to raise the resources of the States to Sterling value.  Your Lordships name & actions are in every mouth & ear: they will give employment to the pen of the historian. My Lord, you have far advanced in the road of Fame: it is a dangerous defile: you have my most affectionate wishes, that you may pass it with glory & safety.  I need not tell your Lordship, how happy you make me by honouring me with your correspondence. As I flatter myself you will continue it, I beg leave to tell you how you may make it more agreeable to me. It will be made so, by being more particular respecting your own proceedings. I am My Lord with the greatest respect, Your Lordships most obliged & humble Sert. Wm. Hy. Drayton  ""

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia 5th July 1778 I wrote you four days ago by Mr. Armstead who promised to send the letter (1) to Mount Airy by his Servant from Fredericksburg. Since that we have had a more accurate account of the battle in the Jersies from Gen. Washington. The number of the enemies dead buried by our people was 252, and several graves besides on the field in which they had buried their dead during the Action. Upon the whole, the battle was fairly won by our Army, & the best troops of Britain beaten in an open field. The whole loss of the enemy in killed, wounded, & deserters is at least 3000 since they left this City. The American Army is now at Brunswick and will presently proceed to the North river. Gen. Conway came here the other day, and having been informed of some disrespectful words spoken of him by Gen. Cadwallader, the former challenged the latter and they met on the Common yesterday morn. They threw up for the first fire & Cadwallader won it. At the distance of 12 paces he fired and Shot Conway thro the side of the face, on which he fell & was carried off the field. He is supposed not to be in danger unless an unforeseen inflamation should produce it. We had a magnificent celebration of the JULY 5, 1778  anniversary of Independence yesterday, when handsome fireworks were displayed. The Whigs of the City dressed up a Woman of the Town with the Monstrous head dress of the Tory Ladies and escorted her thro the Town with a great concourse of people. Her head was elegantly & expensively dressed. I suppose about three feet high and of proportionable width, with a profusion of curls &c. &c. &c. The figure was droll and occasioned much mirth. It has lessened some heads already, and will probably bring the rest within the bounds of reason, for they are monstrous indeed. The Tory wife of Dr. Smith, has christened this figure Continella, or the Dutchess of Independence, and prayed for a pin from her head by way of relic. The Tory women are very much mortified notwithstanding this. As we have left York, and Dunlap publishes a Gazette here, I have entered your name with him instead of Hall & Sellers, & I shall pay him for your years papers. 1 have directed him to send me your paper weekly, whilst I stay, that I may inclose it to you. We have heard nothing from the English Commissioners since our answer from York, and I suppose they conclude us less liable to be amused since the late drubbing we have given their Army. I this day went round the enemies lines. They pass from Delaware to Schuylkill so as to include Govr. Hamiltons House about 200 yards within the line, and consist of very strong redoubts at a quarter of a mile distant from each other, and the spaces between guarded by very thick Abbatis made of Apple Trees fast staked down, and the ends of the twigs sharpened. All the houses, except Bush Hill, for a considerable distance without & within the lines are burnt down. My love to Mrs. Lee and kind remembrance to all friends in Richmond. I am most affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  ""

Yesterday I Recd yours of the 4th & of the 13th of June, and am very Sorry to be informed that Rhoda is not so well as She was for some time before. However I hope & trust She is better again, and in due time will Recover her former health & strength if it is for the best & consistent with the will of the great Ruler of all Events. If she should JULY 6, 1778  Remain in a poor State of health, I would have you use your discretion about taking the advice of Dr. Rowe or Ordway & any other you may think proper; But you know my opinion, that proper Exercise, air & Diet & to keep the mind as Easy & Contented as possible in Such Disorders, is of much more Service that a multiplicity of Medicines, Tho some I make no Doubt will be useful.  I have not time to write you any news at present as I am looking out for a place to board at & find Great Difficulty in procuring a place, I write this in a tavern where I put up at present, I will try to Enclose you the latest news paper, which will inform you of the news here. Give my Respects to Mr Thurston & tell him I will Endeavor to answer his letter next post.(1) I have not had time to view the City & Know what Destruction is made by the Enemy, will inform more next post.  I can now inform you & my Children that there will be no Difficulty in Deviding our prize money in the Lottery as Every one of the Tickets in our family are Blanks. The Nine that I took to Sell are all Blanks Except one I sold to Mr Peterson & one I sold to Mr Griffing, they have each a 20 Dollar prize.

Charles Chace is well; Mr. Wentworth had a fever for about 10 or 12 Days with a Billious vomiting & purging, much like Mr Thurstons last fall, but began to mend on Tuesday & was much more Comfortable when I left him, hope he will be here in a week or ten Days from this time.  I Expected to have Sent this off this morning but the post not Seting of till to morrow I have time to write a little more.  Genl Washingtons account of the Battle in the Jersies I have inclosed, The Enemy are getting aboard their Ships by the last account and it is the Common opinion that the whole of them will Soon quit the United States.  2, of the Clock afternoon, the post has just arrived & Brought me your Letter of the 20th June which has made my mind Easier about Rhoda, hope She will continue to mend. I Dont think of any thing proper for me to advise her to use more than I formerly mentioned to you, The Tincture of antimony in Small Doses may likely be Serviceable, however you & Dr Gale will be able to Judge by the opperation. I hope hereafter our letters will Pass to & from Each other Quicker & more certainly than before as this place is 60 miles at least nearer to you than York Town.  I hope Sally is well as hers was only a Great Cold. I am Glad to hear there is a good prospect of the fruits of the Ground; About ten   Days preceeding last Thursday was as Severely hot, at York Town as was Ever Known so Early in the year: Thursday & Friday we had Severe Thunder & Setled to a Steady rain which Cooled the Air finely.

  Dear Sir [July 6? 1778](1) After a most tedious Journey thro Heat and Wet, having been sick five Days by the way, I reached York Town just soon enough to accompany Congress to this place, four Days more of travelling in the hottest Season I ever felt brought me to Philadelphia, where I am at present settled in Lodgings with Mr Sherman at his old Landladys Mrs. Cheeseman & have almost cooled down the fervor which the Extreme heat on the last Stage of my Journey had kindled in my Blood.  Congress before they left York Town had gone thro and considered all the Objections & Amendments proposed by the different states respecting the Articles of Confederation, and upon the whole, to deal impartially, rejected them all and determined to adhere to the Articles as they were settled, Nine States will ratify them as they stand, the remaining four have yet neglected to Instruct & Impower their Delegates to ratify, but it is expected they will soon do it.  Enclosed are printed Copies of General Washingtons Letters giving an Account of the movements of the Army in New Jersey & of the Battle of the 28th Ulto.  The Genl. says five or Six Hundred Deserters is the least Number that have come into his Army, besides these, there are upwards of five Hundred which came directly to this City & here took passes for such places as they chose to retire to, and many more, it is said, are gone directly into the Country, without going to the Army or coming here, a number of which I saw myself at Lancaster. There is a Letter in Town from Lord Sterling in which he gives it as his Opinion that the Enemys Army is lessened Three Thousand by Desertion, skirmishes and in the late Battle since they left this City.  The Tories here tell us that General Clinton is directly to leave JULY 6, 1778  the Continent and draw off his Myrmidons, that he has positive Orders to do it, that some are to go to the West Indies, some to England, a little Time will discover the Truth of this Story.

  My Dear son, Philadelphia 6th July 1778 I have before me your acceptable favors of the 30th Ulto. & 2d Inst.(1)-these afford subjects for the exercise of a grateful heart. I thank God for the deliverance of our great & good Commander in Chief & of our Army, from the Snare which had been set for them, for the escape of you my Dear fellow Citizen from the danger to which your duty had necessarily exposed you-& while I bless God for the providential interposition in our favor, I congratulate with my Country Men on the partial Victory gained over our Enemies on the 28th June at Monmouth.  Repair your particular loss immediately by purchasing one of the very best Horses you can meet with & more than one or two if needful, draw on me for the Amount or tell me how I may remit a sufficient Sum. JULY 6, 1778  The term Snare shews the present sentiments of my mind, that my former jealousies respecting the conversation with an old friend at the lines, the reception & lodging Doctr W. (2) were not groundless- these circumstances will naturally recur to your own-but antecedently to either of these, a conversation at York Town, tete a tete which, if the Gentleman had ever been sincere, discovered a change, together with some ungracious hints applied to an Officer whom you & I love, had alarmed me.(3) You will admit too that there were grounds for my suspicions of Sir H.C.'s(4) sincerity in his pretences to leave Philadelphia, at least you will grant the justness of my observation that the whole of that Officers conduct in this City carried the face of Stratagem. Had these not subsisted, a concerted Plan by which our Army was to have been disgraced, perhaps ruined, he would not have subjected himself to the fatigue & hazards of loss by various means, in a Land March, or if necessity had obliged him to undertake it, his Army would have been far enough out of the reach of Ours. Whatever is is best. I now hold my self as much indebted to the Man I suspected, as I am to Judas-whose example in all cases ought to be followed by Men of his disposition.  Certainly for my Country's sake I rejoice at the late happy event, certainly for your sake, but I have a feeling of joy respecting your General which, uncommon as such impressions are on my mind, stronger for an Individual than for a general good, for an Individual stranger than for one so very nearly bound to my heart, seems to overbound all other joy. There are rational grounds for this apparent excess which shal1 be explained to your conviction & satisfaction whenever I am so happy as to take you into my Arms.  I thank you very much my Dear son for the minute Account of the transactions at Monmouth. Such intelligence enables me to make acceptable transmissions to my friends at home, & without such I should be very barren, for notwithstanding the advantages which I might avail myself of, by the first possession of public Letters from all Quarters, yet the executive parts of my Office & the constant interruptions which I am subject to from visitors, seldom leave me time enough to peruse Letters attentively before I present them to Congress, where they are parceled out to different Boards & Committees & are seen no more by me.  My good friend the Chief Justice has written to you again (5) & I am sure you will make him proper returns-but enter nous, I must tell you that I expect to hold my first place in your correspondence. He has written long circumstantial Circular Letters, to which I had contributed not only all the materials in my power but assisted him also by the Loan of my Secretary which consequently increased my own labour. My Idea was that these Addresses were to have been signed by all the Delegates from So. Carolina or at least that I might upon principles of Justice claim the honor of adding my signature to his,   & so I intimated to him. He jocularly replied, he should not labour for A B & C-& has continued to send forward his dispatches without admitting L. to a fair Coparceny or favouring him with an explanation. L. is not possessed by an appropriating Spirit, he is always happy in fair mutual communications with his friends, but when it becomes necessary he knows how to take care of himself without breaking the line of harmony. His friends in Carolina expect from him ample Accounts of all public affairs & he knows it would vex them to see him forestalled or eclipsed. The Chief Justice is collecting materials for History,(6) every Gentleman will chearfully cast in his Mite for the benefit of Posterity, none more heartily than myself, all I covet is the quiet enjoyment of my own. I often hint to my friend that he loses the enjoyment of Riches in avidity for gain. You know, moderation, & submission to events, have been the lines of my walk.  You will learn from other hands that General Conway received on the anniversary of Independence a Pistol Ball on one side of his Nose which passed to the back part of the Neck where it was extracted by a very light scission. How this came to pass & the condition in which he Lies, the subject is not for me to dwell on.  How can you expect me on the Banks of Rariton, not even the pleasure of riding there with you, the highest but one this World has in Store for me, can tempt me to abandon or neglect my Post, your example instructs your Father, I submit to the painful Separation with chearfulness.  I must now although I have not said half I wish to say take leave of you, & address a few respectful Lines to your General, to the Marquis & to Baron Stuben but before I conclude it will be proper to assure you I shall pay every mark of respect to those worthy heroes enumerated in your Letter when opportunity presents. I now live in a House & in a stile somewhat better than those which I had patiently humbled myself in, from the 28th September to the 27th June at York Town-somewhat below the rank of my Overseers, I have now a Bed for a friend, & Board for half a dozen or more every day. Come see for a fortnight how I live, & let me tell you, you will feel it whether you come or do not come.  Adieu My Dear Son. Persevere in your Duty, God will bless you & make your Father happy. Henry Laurens  [P.S.] Your General transmits his dispatches by a common Messenger. I Love & reverence him.  If there shall happen any remarkable circumstances in the Trial of General Lee which are not set forth in the general proceedings of the Court Martial to be transmitted to Congress I request you note them to me.  Doctor Read, a young Gentleman from Georgia, with whom you  were formerly acquainted goes to Camp with a view of improving his knowledge in Surgery by attending in the Hospitals. If you can facilitate his attempts I am persuaded you will.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July 7th. 1778 I inclose you an account of the action of the 28th June, a day that I imagine will be remembered by Clinton all his life. It is very remarkable that we have never fought a battle but what some of our General Officers have behaved ill, & thro' whose means, it has been principally owing why we have not been so successful, as the bravery of our troops have intitled us to be. Had Lee's conduct been such, as we had reason to expect from him, in this action, in all probability we should have gained a Compleat victory. The body he commanded was the cream of the army, selected for that Service. When the General came up & found him retreating he was very much provoked indeed, & when he asked Lee his reasons for doing so, he replyed: the service he was sent upon, was impracticable to be performed, & that Genl. Washington knew that he had given it as his opinion in the Council that it was so. The General ordered him to retire to the rear & with all the intrepidity, & coolness, that he so eminently possesses put himself at the head of the troops, led them back again, and conquered. The troops he had to contend against were the Granadiers, light infantry, & Cavalry of the British army, but both our Officers & Men were determined to Conquer, & nothing could stand against them, when led on, by their Great & illustrious Commander. Some of the Deserters who have come in since the action, say, that it is allowed by their Officers, they have never yet been so shamefully beaten, not that the loss of Men, have been so great, but that their choicest troops were defeated. It is said that the foreign troops peremptorily refused to fight. There was not one of the General's family, except himself, but what was either wounded, or had their horses shot.  We are thrown into a good deal of confusion with regard to the Confederation. Before we left York Town, Congress proceeded to the consideration of the armendments offered by the different States to the confederation, every one of which have been rejected. It was then ordered to be ingroced, to be ready for ratification when we came to Philadelphia. Now that it is so, Mr. Laurens, Mr. Drayton, & Mr. Hutson say they will not sign it, because they do not think themselves authorized by our instructions to do so, unless the other twelve States will agree to sign it likewise. Maryland has refused to  JULY 7, 1778  ratify. Mr. Heyward & myself are of a different Opinion, & think we are Authorised, notwithstanding One or even two States were to refuse, nor do I apprehend that inconsistency will arise in the Confederation, from the Defection of one or two States, which these three Gentlemen seem to imagine.(1) However they mean, I believe, to write their sentiments on the subject, either to the Presidt. or to you, to be laid before the Assembly.(2) I do not think it necessary for Heyward & myself to write on the subject, in our public Characters, as we think we are authorised to sign it, but as three are necessary to a final Ratification we must wait for your decision. This I am clear in, from what I have seen, & known, since I have been in Congress, that if we are to have no Confederation untill the Legislatures of the thirteen States agree to one, that we shall never have one, & if we have not one, we shall be literally a rope of sand, & I shall tremble for the consequences that will follow, at the end of this War. France I have good reason to think would never have entered into the Treaties, she has done with us, had she known we were not Confederated, & when the present misunderstanding comes to be spread abroad, I am afraid it will give such an Alarm that those powers, who have lately shewn so good a Disposition to an Alliance with us, will immediately fall back, & stand aloof, untill they can see on what footing our jaring interests are to stand. But suppose they were ever so well inclined who are they to enter into an Alliance with? It can't be with the United States. Nor can I conceive they will ever do it with such a body as Congress at present is, bound together by no other Law, than that of the bare necessity of the present situation of our affairs, & lyabel to fall to pieces, from the Ambition or caprice of one or two States, but the Alarm will operate still more strongly still when it is known, that we have attempted to confederate & can't. All Europe for some time past, have looked upon us, as in a State of Confederacy. But the greatest danger in my Opinion yet remains. Is not the Sovereign will & pleasure of Congress at this time the law of this Continent? Some men may deny it, & will, but a late Act of theirs (I mean the case of the Embargo) proves it beyond a doubt.(3) If they can do this, they can do anything else. Are they bound by any Law? Have they any line marked out for their Rule of conduct? No they have not. And it's my sincere belief that some men wish it to continue so. As an individual I have very strong objections to the Confederation, exclusive of what were pointed out by our State,(4) but still, I would rather have this, than none. I think it is beyond a doubt that in the course of the next six months, Great Britain would have offered us our own terms, for peace she must have. But when they come to know that we have begun to split, Why it's just the very thing they have all along been endeavouring to effect. Divide & Conquer, has been their favourite maxim. This will to be sure encourage her to risque another Campaign, it will certainly be their  best policy to try the experiment, & they will hardly let so favourable an opportunity slip, without doing something. I have wrote to you for leave to come home in December; (5) for God's sake procure it for me, & I'll be dam'd if ever you catch me here again. Those who have dispositions for Jangling, & are fond of displaying their Rhetorical abilities, let them come. I never was so sick of any thing in my life. This is all under the rose tho', for notwithstanding it's only my private sentiments of things, yet I would not wish to impress on the mind of any one, the least disrespect of Congress. I should be obliged to you for the particulars, respecting the application now made with regard to the Confederation, when decided upon by you.  The enemy are now almost all over on Staten Island. Our army are moving slowly up the No. river. I am, Dr. Sir, with the most sincere regard, your most Obed. servt. J Mathews  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 7th. 1778. On Thursday last Congress met at the State-House, when 13 cannon were discharged on Market street wharff; and on Saturday the Anniversary of Independance was celebrated at the New Tavern, where there was an elegant entertainment, & a fine band of musick. The firing of a vast number of cannon proved that there was no want of powder.  My time has been taken up principally in taking the surrender of the persons proclaimed, and writing recognizances of bail. Not one has been yet committed, nor has any evidence appeared except the general charge in the proclamation, notwithstanding I sit daily in  JULY 7, 1778  the Court-house from 9 to 11 oclock, and sometimes to 12, having James Young and John Ord Esquires, two of the Justices of the peace here, as assistants to inform me of the abilities of the persons who offer themselves as sureties, and to hear accusers, if any should offer. The Inhabitants appear to be either afraid of one another, or the Whigs cannot yet believe that their friends have the government of the city.(1)  The General Assembly are called by the Council to meet here on the 4th day of August next, in which month we shall be obliged to hold courts of Oyer &c. for Philadelphia, Bucks and Chester. The Supream court must be held on the 24th September being the usual time, and after that we shall find it necessary to go into the other Counties.  Generals Conway and Cadwalader fought a duel on Saturday on the common, as tis said, when the former was shot in the cheek bone and fell the first fire. The wound is said not to be dangerous, and I know nothing of it but by common report, and therefore have not sent for Mr. Cadwalader, especially as it might be attributed by uncharitable persons to resentment rather than justice, as, I have heard, he has made use of very unseemly expressions respecting the Government, and acted in such a manner as savours too much of weaknes and vanity.  Enclosed herewith I send you the Pennsylvania Packet which give an account of the battle of the 28th last near Monmouth CourtHouse in the Jerseys. General Lee's sentence is not yet known. The Army did well, but had some officers done their duty, it would have terminated in a compleat victory.  Just now I am favoured with your letter of the 3d instant, and for the reasons you assign think it would be for the public good to admit the Chalfants to bail; at all events no public injury can arise from it. James Fitzpatrick is likely to do so much mischief, that I have not a doubt if these young men apprehend him they would get a pardon.  Near forty of the principal persons named in the proclamations of Council have rendered themselves to me, and are to take their trials in the city. We are likely to have business enough in our Stations.  Please to present my compliments to Mrs. Atlee. Adieu, Dear Sir, Your most obedient servant Thos M: Kean  ""

It seems as if on every Occasion we are to be convinced that our political Salvation is to be as through the fire. I scarcely know whether I am more distressed that any Person engaged in the Cause of America & to whom she has entrusted her Safety could be capable of betraying her Interest in the critical moment of decision, or more really gratifyed & pleased that the supreme disposer of human Events is continually baffling not only the formidable & open force of our Enemies, but also the more dangerous & secret Efforts of false or lukewarm Friends. The General I allways revered & loved ever since I knew him, but in this Instance he has rose superior to himself. Every Lip dwells on his Praise for even his pretended Friends (for none dare to acknowledge themselves his Enemies) are obliged to croak it forth. The share that his family (for whom I retain a real friendship) has in the Honors of the day has afforded me real Pleasure, and among the rest none more than that of your Lordship.  The Congress have not made a House 'till yesterday. I am afraid I shall have my Hands full here, and I am not greatly elated at the Prospect.  We have undoubted Intelligence of the sailing of a French Fleet for this Country, under the Command of Vice Admiral Count de Estang consisting of 12 Ships of the Line, 6 frigates & two xebeques. I have reason to believe the French Ambassador is on Board, an English fleet lay at St. Helena ready to follow them, consisting of Eleven Ships-I of 90-9 of 74-and one of 64 Guns.(2)  I am sorry to inform you that there is also intelligence of the Settlement of Wyoming being cut off by Coll Buttler with about 1000 lndians Tories & British Troops.(3) It is supposed that Carlisle will soon be the frontier of this State as the Inhabitants are flying in from all Quarters.

  Sir Philadelphia July 9th. 1778 We have now the Pleasure to inform You that the Articles of Confederation are ratified by nine States, to wit the tour New England States, New York, Pennsilvania, Virginia, North & South Carolina, and the Ingrossed Copy with a proper form of Ratification is signed by the Delegates of said States except those of North Carolina which were not present. The remaining four states are called upon to impower their Delegates to ratify. Georgia it is supposed will not hesitate; Maryland, Delaware & New Jersey had their Objections, but it is hoped and expected they will not prevail to prevent their uniting with the confederated States in ratifying the Articles.  There were many Amendments proposed from the States, but none were adopted; it seemed to be the Opinion of Congress that an immediate Confederation was of greater Moment to the Interest of the States, than any present Alteration of the Articles to accomodate the Opinion of particular States on the Amendments proposed.  Yesterday an Express arrived from Boston with Dispatches from France, which advise that the Count D'Etaing an Admiral of France sailed from Toulon with a Squadron of French Men of War consisting of twelve sail of the Line, Six Frigates and three Chebecs bound for Delaware or Chesapeak Bays on board of which is Monsieur Girard, Minister plenipotentiary from the Court of France to the  JULY 9, 1778  united states. That this fleet sailed from Toulon the 15th April last, and that an English Fleet of Eleven Ships, one of ninety Guns, nine of Seventy four & One of Sixty four sailed from St. Hellens the Twenty fourth of April, and that Seventeen Sail of the Line, which were to be joined in a few days by eight more, lay in the road of Brest ready to put to sea to watch the motions of the English fleet.  We are this day (1) advised by Mr. Blair McClanighan of this City a Gentleman of Character, just returned here from Maryland that the Fleet under the Count D'Etaing, mentioned above arrived off Chincioteage in Maryland two or three days ago, & proceeded directly for Sandy Hook, that it consisted of a Ninety Gun Ship, two Eighty and nine Seventy fours & Sixty fours, Six Frigates & three Chebecs, that they had four Thousand Land forces on board, this Information he had from a Gentleman, who piloted the Fleet in & was landed at Chinciotegue, who likewise informed that the Admiral told him that War was declared against England at Paris the 19th Day of May, and that this Fleet was destined to shut up Genl. Clinton in Philadelphia, but will now attempt to pound him in New York. We beg leave to Congratulate your Excellency upon this important Event.(2)  Genl.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 10 th 1778 An Express arrived Yesterday from Boston with Dispatches brought in there by a vessell on a short passage from France. By these we learn that Admiral the Count D'Etaing sailed from Toulon the 15th of April last with a Fleet of twelve Ships of the Line, Six Frigates and three Chebecs, bound for Delaware or Chesapeak Bay. That an English Fleet of Eleven Sail of the Line sailed from St Hellens the 24th of April to intercept the French Squadron, and that seventeen Sail of the Line lay in the Road of Brest ready to put to Sea and pursue the English Fleet.  This Day Mr Blair McClanighan of this City a Gentleman of Character returned here from Maryland & informs that the Count D'Etaings Squadron arrived off Chinicoteague in Maryland Three days ago, & immediately bore away for Sandy Hook. He had his Intelligence from a Gentleman who piloted the squadron in to Chinicoteague, and was landed there, who further told him that war was declared against England at Paris the l9th day of May, that Monsieur Gerard Minister Plenipotentiary from the Court of France to the united states is on board the Fleet, and may be daily expected in this City, that Four Thousand land Forces are on board the Fleet, that their Object when they left France was to shut up General Clinton in Philadelphia, the English Ministry prevented this by ordering the precipitate Retreat we have lately seen executed, that they will now attempt to block up the port of New York, & favour an attack upon the Main body of the Enemy there from our Land Army.

A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions were proposed from Different States, which have taken up much Time to Consider. After long Debates, all are rejected. It seems to be the Opinion of Congress that a speedy Confederation was of more Importance than to endeavour further to accommodate the Articles to the Opinion & Views of particular States. It was ratified in form by nine states yesterday, the Delegates of the remaining four, to wit, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland & Georgia, are expected soon to have powers sent them, when it will be compleated.

  Dear sir Philadelphia July 10 th 1778 Tho I wrote you so lately (1) I cannot forbear availing myself of this Opportunity to give you the Important News we have just received.  An Express arrived from France via Boston yesterday (2) with Dispatches for Congress. By these we learn that Admiral Count D'Etaing sailed from Toulon the 15th of April last with a squadron of Twelve sail of the Line, Six Frigates & three Chebecs bound for Delaware or Chesapeak Bay, that an English Squadron of Eleven Sail of the Line left St. Hellens the 24th of April in pursuit of them, and that 17 Sail of the Line lay in the road of Brest ready to put to Sea and Intercept the English Squadron.  Yesterday we had Intelligence from Maryland that Count D'Etaing's Squadron arrived off Chinicoteague in that State three Days ago, & immediately took pilots on board & bore away for Sandy Hook, that he had four Thousand Land Troops on board, who are to act in Conjunction with our Army, while the fleet blocks up the Port and Intercepts Supplies. Our further Advice is that War was declared at Paris against England the 19th day of May (but of this I have yet some scruples)-That Monsr. Girard is on board the Count D'Etaings fleet, he comes in Character of Minister & plenipotentiary from the Court of France to the united States, and is accompanied  JULY 10, 1778  by our old Friend Mr. Silas Dean, they may be expected every Day in this City.  Thus you see a Grand scene is opening which, if we have Wisdom to Act our part Well, will probably terminate in the compleat Establishment of our Independence, Liberty & Happiness. I hope the Inhabitants of Connecticut, if called & needed, will exert themselves by one Vigorous push to drive this Consuming Army of Locusts from our Coasts, this Once done there is reason to hope the war will only Thunder on our Coast, and that we may be free from these Bloody, cruel, Inhuman Inmates in our Quarters.  The Articles of Confederation were ratified in Form Yesterday by the Delegates of nine states. The remaining four, Viz. New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland & Georgia, are waiting for their full powers which are soon expected when that very Important Business will be compleated.  My Heart bleeds for Wyoming. The Tories and Indians under Colo. Butler, the British Superintendant of Indian Affairs fell upon it the Third Instant, and have ravaged it with more than Indian Cruelty & Barbarity.

We hope soon, if any of the miserable Inhabitants have escaped the Carnage, to have a more full & particular Account.(3)  July 11. Mr. Dean is expected here this night. We had Letters from him to Day & from Count D'Etaing.(4) The fleet have taken the Rose Frigate, an Eighteen Gun Ship & chased the Roebuck on Shore, five or six Mercht.

  Sir 10th July [1778](1)  Congress intent upon the present and future security of these United States has never ceased to consider a Confederacy as the great principle of Union, which can alone establish the Liberty of America and exclude for ever the hopes of its Enemies.  Influenced by motives so powerful, and duly weighing the difficulties, which oppose the expectation of any plan being formed that can exactly meet the wishes and obtain the approbation of so many States, differing essentially in various points, Congress have, after mature deliberation agreed to adopt without amendments the Confederation transmitted to the several States for their approbation. The States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island & Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virga., North Carolina and South Carolina have ratified the same & it remains only for your State with those of and to conclude the Glorious Compact, which, by uniting the wealth, strength and Councils of the whole, may bid defiance to external violence(2) and internal dissention, whilst it secures the Public Credit both at home and abroad. Congress is willing to hope that the Patriotism and good sense of your State will be influenced by motives so important, and they request Sir,(3) that you will be pleased to lay this Letter before the Legislature of in order that if they judge it proper, their Delegates may be instructed to ratify the Confederation with all convenient dispatch, trusting to future deliberation (4) to make such alterations and amendments as experience may shew to be expedient and just.

I have delivered Your Excellencies Letters in favor of Marquis de Vienne and Monsr.

A large Mail arrived a few days ago in Congress from France, I found it to contain many Packets for Monsr.

  Sir, Philadelphia 10th July 1778. I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency by Major Putnam the 8th Inst.  Congress while sitting before Noon received intelligence of the following import.  Mr. Blair McLenahan said he had seen a Capt. Selby or Selwin off Chincoteague who had fallen in with the French Fleet Eastward of Bermuda. The Admiral had taken him on board & injoin'd him to Pilot the fleet to this Coast, the fleet arrived near Chincoteague in the Evening of the 5th Inst. There they found the Ship Lydia of 26 Guns from New York on a Cruise-she was sunk by a French Frigate of 36 Guns. On Monday Capt. Selby was sent on Shoar in order to procure Pilots; he engaged six to go on board the French fleet upon Wednesday. The Fleet consisted of the Admiral Count d'Estaing of 90 Guns-2 Ships of 80-8 of 74-1 of 64-4 of 36, & said to have 12,000 Men. They had taken a Ship of 18 Guns from Providence before they had made the Land.  War was to be declared against England by France & Spain on the JULY 10, 1778  l9th May. They had originally intended for Delaware but hearing that the Enemy were gone to New York they required Pilots to conduct them to Sandy Hook, they had then six Months provision on board.  Your Excellency will perceive by the inclosed Printed Paper that a Fleet had been prepared at Portsmouth in order to intercept or annoy this Fleet of which 'tis possible the Count d'Estaing may be ignorant as he sailed from Toulon the 13th April.(1) 'Tis possible also that a Check may have been put upon that by a Fleet from Brest. Be that as it may, Count d'Estaing should be apprized of this important circumstance & also of the strength of the British Marine power in New York, which from the best accounts we have been able to collect is made up of the following Ships.  Boyne 70 Guns. Experiment 50. Phcenix 44. Eagle 64. Preston 50. & many Frigates St. Alban 64. Renown 50. Ardent 64. Chatham 50. Sommerset 64. Isis 50. Trident 64. Vigilant formerly 64. Centurion 50. Roebuck 44. I shall endeavor to reach Count d'Estaing with the necessary advices on the Coast of New Jersey or off the Capes of Delaware. Your Excellency will, if he shall have proceeded nearer Sandy Hook endeavor to meet him with a Letter where it may reach him, & you will also concert measures for improving the force under Your Excellency's immediate Command & that under the direction of Major General Gates, in the present critical conjuncture.  Your Excellency will also if you have a more exact Account of the British Fleet at New York make proper corrections upon the list above enumerated.  I have the honor to be, With the highest Esteem & Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient & most humble servant,  Henry Laurens, President of Congress [P.S.] It is almost unnecessary to intimate to Your Excellency the propriety of opening & keeping up a correspondence with the Admiral Count d'Estaing.

The Terms of your Letter to say nothing of the Publication seem to me to be such a Deviation not only from the Line of Frindship but even of Civility which I might have expected from you as can only be excused by the Embarassments & Anxiety of your Situation.

The Additions & Corrections I made to the Acct. received from Gov.

I am very sure so far as my Pen was concerned nothing of that kind was intended, but the reverse. Tho not a Soldier by Profession I have seen enough of Armies to caution me against forming hasty Judgments of Men or Actions from mere Report. Tho I heard much therefor on that Day I suspended my Opinion & if you will again read the Paper with Attention which I cannot think you yet have done I am sure you will see a favourable Construction put on every Part of your Conduct. When compared with the official Account since published by Congress it must appear even to yourself to contain Matters of Praise & Approbation. It says that you did attack & drove the Enemy for some Time & at last only retired toward the main Army on Account of the Enemy's great Superiority of Force. It made your Numbers short I believe of the Reality but therefore more favourable to your Conduct. What does the Acct. sanctified by publick Authority say, that you brot 5000 instead of 1500 Men, that you retreated without making any Opposition except by a small Party under Col. Butler which was successful & in short that your Conduct was Matter of Surprize & Mortification to the Commander in Chief. It is admirable to every person I have conversed with first & will be so to the whole world. In what Circumstance the first Publication was unfavourable to you & secondly, Why you should attempt to destroy the Veracity of That Account & thereby fully establish the Credit of one which so much wound your Feelings so sensibly. Upon the whole tho I cannot admit that the Epithet you have applied to it as invidious, dishonest & false are by any Means proper & as you have only made a general Charge without pointing out wherein it is false & dishonest I cannot tell how much of this unhandsome Language I am to take to myself or whether any. But this I can & shall say that the Additions & Alter  ations I made were strictly true & founded chiefiy upon my own Observation & you will excuse me for differing entirely with you in supposing I could possibly know nothing of the principal Part of the Action as that I believe will be allowed to have been after I met you [. . .] from which Time till the Close of the Affair I was either with the General at his Desire or reconnoitering in Front but chiefly the former where all Intelligence came & from whence the Movements were directed. I am at a loss to know what Individuals you mean whom you censure as directing & giving Opinions without Authority. If you had any Reference to Gen. Cadwallader & myself I shall not hesitate to say the Charge is unwarrantable as we gave no Directions nor did we on any Occasion offer an Opinion but when requested by the Commander in Chief. As Gentlemen of the Country we had a Right to attend the Army as Volunteers & as Frinds to the General to Attend him at his Desire without being liable to Censure for either. That I entertained a very high opinion of your talents & Abilities in common with my Countrymen & that they were displayed much to the Advantage of this Country & your own Honor during our Retreat from Kingsbridge to Peeks Kiln in 1776 are sentiments which I have on every Occasion expressed & that in the Affair of Fort Washington Genl W. manifested an Indecision of Mind which if unamended would shade the brighter Parts of his Character are Facts equally true: but I can easily conceive that more Experience & happier Arrangements may have given him greater Confidence in his Troops as well as in his own Judgment. From long Acquaintance & (close Observation I think him to [. . .] clearly of Opinion)  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia July 11. 1778  GLORIOUS NEWS. I have but a few Moments before the Express goes off, to inform You-That a French Fleet is arrived on this Coast commanded by the Count De.Stang, 1 Ship of 90 Guns, 4 Do. of 80 Do., 2 of 74 and 5 of 64 and four Frigates. Congress this Day recd. a Letter from the adml. dated Delaware Bay. The French Ambassador Monsr. Gerard & Mr. Deane in a Frigate are now coming up the River. The adml. also forwarded Us a Letter directed to Congress from the King of France & signed by His Majesty addressing us in the most respectful and tender Manner.(1) The French Fleet have sailed for, and before this are at Sandy Hook, to attack the British Fleet. Genl. Washington is pushing forward in order to cooperate with the Admiral.  Another British Fleet is however hourly expected-So that it's possible How's Fleet may refuse to give Battle, & should the other British Fleet come on the Coast, The Count De. Stang may put into Newport Harbour. Congress have hinted this to Genl. Washington to be improved upon, so that Measures may be taken to call in a Force sufficient to opperate agt. the British Forces on the Island, but this upon a Supposition that the Count De.Stang should think proper to push for Newport Harbour. I give you a hint of this, That Genl. Sullivan and the Force he has may be preparing for such a possible Event, and that our Millitia may be called upon, not merely as in Course of Duty, but as Volunteers, upon so glorious an Occasion to stand ready to step forward if called upon which I have not a Doubt they will to a Man, to rid Themselves at once by an easy Effort under the Blessing of Heaven, of the vilest Banditty that were ever suffered to curse the Earth. I have the Honor to be your most humble Servt. Hy. Marchant  P.S. The Rose Frigate formerly commanded by Wallace was taken by One of the French Frigates upon Their arrival off Chesepeak Bay. The Roebuck of 44 guns at the Mouth of Delaware was drove on the Maryland Shore. Her Crew cut her Masts & fled a Shore where they must fall into Our Hands, & the Ship as she is one of the finest in the British Navy will be a fine Acquisition. The Frigate coming up the River, has two Prizes with her, They sunk a British Privateer of 26 Guns, just as they made Land. H.M. JULY 11, 1778  You'l Excuse a Scrawl for the Love of the Matter.  ""

  Gentlemen Philada July 11th 1778 Your Several Letters lately received have not been considered because of the obstructions created by a removal of Congress from York Town to this place where as yet the committee have not been able to get themselves properly fixed for business. The sense entertained of the increasing importance of your Department will secure a close attention to it from this Committee and every care shall be taken to furnish you with the money requisite for the proper Accomplishment of the ends proposed by your appointment. The immediate design of this Letter is to inform you of the arrival on the Coast near the Capes of Delaware of a French squadron consisting of 12 ships of the Line and four frigates under the command of the Count D Estaing Vice Admiral of France who is proceeding immediately to Newyork there to act in conjunction with the Army of the united states for destroying the fieet & army of the common enemy in that Harbour. Congress being determined to give every possible aid to the execution of so salutary a purpose has directed us to order all the Continental frigates and armed Vessels within your Department to be immediately made ready for Sea and dispatched one after another as soon as each can be prepared, to join the Squadron of France and to act in such manner as the Count D Estaing shall judge most proper for distressing and destroying the enemys force upon the Coast of North America. (1) Congress trust to the bravery and good disposition of the American seamen that they will on this great occasion step forth with alacrity and exert themselves in supporting our freinds who have come so far to assist us to vanquish an enemy too long triumphant upon the Sea.

  My dear brother, Philadelphia 12 July 1778 I had prepared a letter for you three days ago intending to have sent it to Chantilly by a Mr. Muse, but he slipt me without calling for my letter. Since that the Count D'Estaing, with a French Squadron under his command, has arrived in Delaware Bay, and last Thursday morning he proceeded to N. York with determination to loose no time in attacking the English in that Harbour. On the 19th of May he declared war against G. Britain on board his fleet then at Sea, and since that he takes every English Vessel that he meets with. The strength of this fleet is one 90, one 80, Six 74, Three 64 & one 50 with 4 frigates and between 10 & 12,000 men on board.  In this fleet came the French Ambassador Monsr. Gerard who is JULY 12, 1778  expected in Town every hour Carriages being sent to Chester for him. Silas Deane is also arrived in this fleet, and I expect that he & Carmichael will soon begin to intrigue. We have received a very polite Address from the Count D'Estaing inclosing us a copy of his powers from the King of France which are plenipotentiary to treat with Congress. The King styles us his most dear friends and great Allies. The Count says that nothing but the necessity of immediately executing the duties of his Office as Commander of the Fleet would have permitted him to delay paying his respects to Men famous thro Europe for their wisdom and firmness. We have been very busy in Marine Committee this morning, altho 'tis Sunday, directing fresh provisions and Water to be sent to this fleet.(1) Gen. Washington is directed to Cooperate with Count D'Estaing in offensive operations against the common enemy. We may expect good events from this if Keppel with his 11 sail of the Line do not interrupt us too soon. He was in St. Helens the 19th of May bound to N. America. But we expect he will be narrowly watched by the Brest fleet which consisted of 25 Sail of the Line ready for Sea. Thus the Ball begins to open, and the guilty Sons of G. Britain upon the eve of making severe retribution for the heavy crimes both in the east and the west.  The Ambassador is arrived, and during the course of dinner I have had an opportunity of conversing largely with him.(2) I find that the King of France considers the King of Englands message upon Marquis Noailes communication of our Alliance as anouncing hostility and determines to act accordingly. With effective hostility indeed, but witht. a formal declaration of war in Europe, for this he says, we must wait until Spain is ready. The flota was not arrived on the 10th April. Monsr. Gerard seems rather above 50 years of age, is as grave as a Frenchman can be, and he is a wise well bred Gentleman. We are told that many of the first Nobility of France solicited his mission in vain.  I am much grieved to hear that my honored friend Colo. Tayloe grows worse. Is it impracticable for him to visit the Springs? The Indian irruptions I expect will be presently quieted by the Army under Mc.Intosh going to Fort Detroit, and the expedition into the Seneca Country. These must wall and keep every Indian at home.  My love to Mrs. Lee and respects to all friends. Most affectionately yours, Richard Henry Lee  P.S. The post this day brings me no letters from the N. Neck except from my friend Mr. Page.(3) I have none from Susquehannah or Potomac. From Boston we learn of a quick arrival that brings account Lord Chatham died on the Ist of May, he was forming a party against the Independence of America, which he has lately thunder'd against in Parliament and was opposed by the Duke of Richmond with great spirit & force of reason.(4) Stocks fallen greatly, and the   Kingdom in much confusion-40 frigates recalled from N. America. But Count D'Estaing wont let them get out of the Harbor of N. York. [It is?] true that Capt. Jones has carried a 20 gun Ship of the Tyrants into Brest with 3 other prizes. He had a severe conflict with the Ship of War & killed the Captain & first Lieutenant, killed & wounded 42 men, lost 8. He landed at Whitehaven & fired the shipping in the Harbour, and did them other damage, where he also spiked 30 or 40 pieces of Cannon.(5) R.H. Lee  ""

The frigate Chimere, and the two Vessels with her, will be dispatched immediately with as much water as we can find Casks for; the enemy lately here having destroyed every thing of this kind that they could discover.

The same Commissary has general orders to furnish your Excellency [with] such further supplies as you may please to direct.  The accidents of wind and weather may possibly prevent the Chimere from arriving with water so soon as it shall be wanted, and therefore I am to inform your Excellency that in Little Egg harbor JULY 12, 1778  or Thoms river, neither of them far from the Hook, fresh water [may] be conveniently obtained.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July 13th 1778 I this day rec'd your favor of the 20th ulto.(1) The account of the money you rec'd of the Marine Committee I procured and was enclosed in Mr Wentworth's letter to you of the 20th ult (2) which I hope you have rec'd. Your letter to the Marine Committee of the 20th ulto came by today's post and will be considered as soon as opportunity permits: the removal of Congress to this City has greatly retarded business. We have not yet procured proper offices for our several Boards and Committees-hope in a few days we shall be better accomodated and attend with more alacrity to business. The Congress meets in the College Hall, as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City. Some of the genteel houses were used for stables and holes cut in the parlor floors and their dung shovelled into the cellars. The country Northward of the City for several miles is one common waste, the houses burnt, the fruit trees and others cut down and carried off, fences carried away, JULY 13, 1778  Photographic Reproduction of College Hall 270 JULY 13, 1778 gardens and orchards destroyed-Mr Dickenson's and Mr Morris' fine seats all demolished-in short I could hardly find the great roads that used to pass that way. The enemy built a strong abattee with the fruit and other trees from the Delaware to Skuylkill and at about 40 or 50 rods distance along the abattue a quadrangular fort for cannon and a number of redoubts for small arms; the same on the several eminences along the Skuylkill against the City.  Mr Wentworth was taken Sick the 21st ulto, with a fever and a bilious vomiting and purging which lasted him near ten days and hindered me from leaving York Town till the 2d inst. when I left him better-have not heard from him since-hope to see him here in a few days.  The confederation was Signed last week by the delegates of the New England States, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina; North Carolina have sent their ratification of it, but had no delegates in Congress to sign it. This day a delegate is arrived from Georgia (3) who says he is authorised to sign it in behalf of that State. New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland have objected to it and not authorized their delegates as yet to sign it. Congress have wrote to them and I have reason to think they will accede to it.  In forming a plan of Govt. for our State, I hope particular care will be taken to form a proper Executive Body to see the Laws carried into execution; our present plan is more deficient in that, than in any thing else. When I came to Congress the President asked me if our Govr. had rec'd any letters from him for eight months past, and seemed very uneasy that he had rec'd no answers to his letters; I excused the matter as well as I could-but really Sir, is it to be expected that our very worthy president (who by the way is only paid by the day as other members, a small sum not sufficient to half maintain himself) should be at the trouble to receive, file, copy and answer from time to time all such public letters without any compensation; to do it properly he ought to be allowed a Clerk for the purpose and receive something handsome for his own time. No State in the Union is without some such executive officer or body and I am persuaded no State can long exist with any tolerable degree of order and dignity without it. Some supreme executive power must be somewhere lodged separate from the Legislature, no matter by what name it is called, whether Governor, President of the Council, or Executive Council; but such a power there must be to act, when the Legislature is separate and cannot act, otherwise there is at such times a partial dissolution of the Govt. Beside the impropriety and danger many States think there is in the Leglislative and Executive being lodged in the same body. Such a sort of Executive as the Governor of Connecticut is possessed of, I should think would answer the purpose very well.  The occasion of my writing the above is owing to a paragraph of  a letter I received from Major Philbrick wherein he informs me the Convention voted that the Supreme Executive should not be wholly separate from the Leglisative.  As to news here I beg leave to refer you to my letter of this date to General Whipple (4) and request you to inform him of such parts of this as you may think worth communicating.  I am with respect your friend & humble servt, Josiah Bartlett [P.S.] Pray did Mr Paine, Woodward and the others on Connecticut River join you in Convention? How did they like what was done? Will they join in forming a plan of Govt. &c. &c.(5)  ""

  My Dear Sir, Freehold July 13th. 1778 I do myself the Honor to address you upon an affair to me of the most serious and alarming Importance. The Honorable Council and Assembly of this State have not thought proper to invest their Delegates with Power to ratify and sign the Confederation; and it is obvious that unless every of the thirteen States shall acceed to it, we remain an unconfederated People. These States have actually entered into a Treaty with the Court of Versailles as a Confederated People and Monsieur Girard their ambassador Plenipotentiary to Congress is now on our Coast with a powerfull Fleet of Ships, which have taken Pilots on Board for Delaware. He probably may be landed by this Time, and will at all Events be in Philadelphia in a few Days. How must he be astonished & confounded? and what may be the fatal Consequences to America, when he discovers (which he will immediately do) that we are ipso facto unconfederated, and consequently, what our Enemies have called us, \""a Rope of Sand\""?  Will he not have just Cause to resent the Deception? and may not insidious Britain, knowing the same, take Advantage of our Disunion? For my own Part I am of Opinion She will never desist from her nefarious Designs, nor ever consider her Attempts upon our Liberties fruitless and vain, untill she knows the golden knot is actually tied. I left Congress last Wednesday Evening. The Affair of Confederation was to be taken up next Day. The Magna Charta of America was amply engrossed and prepared for signing. Ten States had actually authorised their Delegates to ratify; a Delegate from an eleventh (vizt. Georgia) declared he was so fully possessed of the Sense of his Constituents, that he should not hesitate to subscribe it.(1) New-Jersey and Maryland only stood out.(2) Mr. Chase, one of the Delegates from that State, told me the Day I left Philadelphia, that he imagined the Determination of Maryland would depend much upon that of New-Jersey, and thought if our State should acceed, theirs would also-he therefore concluded to go immediately down and try what could be done. I at the same Time assured him I would write you on the Subject on my Return. I ought to inform you, Sir, that the Objections stated by New-Jersey were read and considered by Congress, and after being entered at large on their Minutes, a Question was taken, whether Congress at that Time judged it expedient to take up the said Objections so as to admit any Emendations in the Plan of Confederation, or not? and it passed in the Negative.(3) In Consequence of which they remain both upon the Journal and Files to be taken up and considered at any future Time when they may be called for.  I expect my Colleagues will soon address you on this Subject. I JULY 13, 1778  left Doctr. Witherspoon, Doctr. Elmer &c Mr. Boudinot at Philadelphia, whither I expect to return in a few Days.  I should have been much more uneasy, when I was last at Princeton, and should have taken more Pains to convince the Members of the Necessity of granting the Powers of Ratification to their Delegates, had I not been encouraged to expect, that the Legislature would not rise without doing it; at the same Time supposing the Reason, why they were witheld at that Juncture, to be, that their Objections might have the greater Weight with Congress. Indeed I all along expected Doctr. Witherspoon would have brought on such Powers with him, especially as I hoped the Honorable Houses would be clearly of Opinion, that it were better to confederate under all the Disadvantages they apprehended, than that the general Union should be broken or even greatly endangered.  I know not Whether I ought to say any Thing respecting the Objections themselves; some of them are perhaps not very essential. The Obtaining an Admission of several of them would doubtless be of great local Advantage to this State; but every State must expect to be Subjected to considerable local Disadvantages in a general Confederation. Indeed upon the whole I am fully [of] Opinion, that no Plan can or will ever be adopted more equal, or less generally injurious to the confederating States than the present. I also declare it as my Opinion that if the general Business of Emendation were to be fairly taken up in Congress to morrow, several Alterations would be made exceedingly disadvantageous to the smaller circumscribed States, and which perhaps might more than counterbalance the obtaining what we apply for. As to the grand and capital Objection respecting the Lands &c.(4) I will only observe, that in Case we never obtain an original Quota of them, we shall only loose a Share in the prime Sales of them, which will probably be very low, while we shall inevitably reap a permanent and encreasing Benefit from the rapid & enormous growth of the larger States; for surely in Proportion to their Extent and Population their Quota of the public Expence & Debt will be encreased, while ours will be proportionably diminished. What avails it therefore to us, whether five Pounds of our national Debt be paid by the Accession of a Subject to this State, or whether our Quota be really lessined five Pounds by the Settlement of a Person in the State of Virginia at the Distance of a thousand Miles from the Atlantic? For my own Part I think we shall have greatly the Advantage of these enormous unwieldy Governments; nor do I judge it unlikely they will soon find it necessary to sue for the curtailing their own extravagant Jurisdiction.  In the Settlement of our Soldiery & the foreign Deserters at the Expiration of the War, we shall incur considerable Disadvantage; however as the larger States will doubtless rejoice to have their Frontiers immediately enlarged, and will vie with each other in  Courting so great an Accession of Inhabitants, there will probably be no greater Expence than barely that of locating the Lands, our Quota of which cannot be any very considerable Sum.  I congratulate you on the signal Success of our Arms in this Neighbourhood on the 28th of June. Great Plunder and Devastation have been committed among my Friends in this Quarter, but through the distinguishing Goodness of Providence my Family & Property escaped, & that almost in a miraculous Manner.  I wish you to take the above Representation into your serious Consideration, and, if with me you shall judge it a Matter of sufficient Importance, that the Legislature may be as speedily as possible convened to deliberate and determine thereon.(5)  I am Dear Sir with great Esteem Your most Obedt.

But I own, I did not expect that the most ridiculous Folley would have taken so early and large a Stride as it appears to have done in the Instance you mention.(2) It cannot in my opinion be supported by any Principles of Truth & Propriety and discovers a Degree of Servility shocking to sober Humanity. And yet a Conduct so void of common Sense will find Advocates among many who never had and never can have a Spark of that Republican Feeling which you have always possessd. These People are formd to be Asses & Slaves; Let them remain so. But surely they ought not to be advanced to Places of Influence, to spread by their Examples, the Principles of Servility and Slavery  JULY 14, 1778  among the People. I will take an Opportunity when I am at Leisure to answer your Letter of the 26, which I have communicated to my Friend Colo Lee.(3) Yesterday I made a short Visit to Monsr. Gerard. If I can form any Judgmt of him, his Manners would suit our Country. But I expect to be better acquainted with him soon. Mr H____has asked & obtained Leave of Absence & is going home! Adieu.  ""

  My Dear Philadelphia July the 14th 1778 I had not the pleasure of Receiving any letter from you by yesterdays Post, Shall Expect one by the next. It give pleasure to hear from my family more Especially to hear they are well. By the favor of Heaven I have had my health as well since I came from Home as I had it for sometime & I think rather better than usual. Hope it will be Continued if for the best. God grant you & the Rest of my family may Enjoy an Equal Share of Health of Body & peace & contentment of mind.  We have had some Exceeding Hot weather here, it is now a little Cooler. We are troubled with one of the Plagues of Egypt which the Enemy left here when they Evacuated this place, I mean Swarms of flies. They are much lessened Since cleansing the place of the Filth & Dung &c &c Tho they are still very troublesome. I wrote you the 6th Inst. soon after I came here & a Line with Mr Thurston the 11th by Express which I hope will Come Safe to your hand. On Sunday about two o'Clock Mr Girard the French Ambassador made a Publick Entry into the City from Chester 15 miles Down the River where the Ships Stopt for want of wind to bring them up. He was attended by three members of Congress who were ordered to Conduct him to Lodgings here. 13 Cannon were fired when He Dismounted at his Lodgings. I was introduced to him the same Day at the Presidents Lodgings about an hour after his arrival where he Came to pay his Respects to our President. He is a pretty Large Man not very fat about 50 years old as I guess, Speaks English tollerably well  JULY 14, 1778  for a Frenchman, was Richly but Decently Dressed, Behaved with Ease &c Dignity without any of the foppish airs of your low bred French men. He has the Sole power of ordering the Count de Estaing the French admiral with his Squadron as he pleases.  The names of the French Line of Battle Ships in the Squadron are, the Languedock 90 Guns, Tonant 80, Caesar 74, Zele 74, Hector 74, Protector 74, Marselles 74, Guerrier 74, Fantesque 64, Province, 64, Valliant 64, Sagittaire 50 Guns.

  My dearest Love Philadelphia July 14th. 1778 I am distressed to account for your total Silence, not having recieved a Line from Home since my departure: my [fears] are raised in proportion to my Anxiety for your welfare and Comfort. I have wrote you several Letters lately, by different Opportunities. Yesterday I had the Honor to dine with La Sieur Gerard Minister plenipotentiary to his most Christian Majesty. He is about 50 Years of Age, appears to be a Modest, Grave, decent, cheerfull Man-highly pleased with our Country and the Struggles we have made for Liberty. A Committee of Congress were appointed to wait on him at Chester.(1) On their Arrival a Barge with 12 Oarsmen dressed in Scarlet trimmed with Silver, were ready to recieve them. When the Barge was half way to the Ship, she lay on her Oars and fifteen Guns were fired. When they came to the Ship her Sides were Manned & our Committee were recieved on the Deck by the Marines with posted Arms. At the Gang way they met the Plenipotentiary &c &c and were conducted into the great Cabbin, where the Compliments of Congratulation being given they returned to the Shore in the same Manner and with the same Ceremony, accompanied by the Sieur Gerard, Mr Deane &c &c. Here were four Coaches with four Horses our Committee had prepared, in which they returned to this City, when they were saluted with 15 Guns. We have had an Acct. yesterday, that one of our Armed Ships called the Ranger of 18 Guns & 123 Men, being on the Coast of Ireland, the Drake a frigate of 20 Guns & 158 Men was sent out to take her, but after an Engagement of 65 Minutes, she struck to the Ranger, Capt. Jones-having lost the Capt., Lieut. & 42 Men. Capt. Jones lost the Cap of his Marines and about 8 Men. After this the Ranger sailed into Whitehaven, burned all the Ships in the Harbour, and spiked up about 30 Cannon in the fort & came off. [During?] his Passage he took 5 Prizes besides the Drake. Whitehaven is on the Coast of England in the Irish Channel.  JULY 14, 1778  I am very happily situated here, considering my absence from a beloved Wife. Am under great Obligations to Mrs. Franklin for her kind attention. I shall soon be quite settled when I hope to have some leisure, to write you fully. We are preparing for a publick Reception of the Sieur Gerard when he will have a publick Audience. I will let you know the Ettiquette used on this Occasion. I know it will tend to divert your lonely moments, altho' I confess I should prefer another mode, was it in my Power.

  Sir, July 14th. 1778 Yesterday came to hand the Letters which you were so obliging as to inclose to me the 2d Instant. I thank you for your Care and congratulate you upon the fair Prospect of ruining the Plans of our Enemies if not of also destroying many of themselves by the Cooperation of General Washingtons Army with the Fleet under Count D'Estang wch. is before this Time at Sandy Hook. The Count is plenipotentiary as to military Operations. Should he find it best to visit Rh Island first I hope you can find Voluntiers enough to cooperate instantly with him. A small spirited Number would be sufficient for the Purpose. Every armed Vessel which you have in port should be ready for Business. First Moments are precious. The Enemy must not have Time to recover from the Surprize which this unexpected Activity of France will occasion. Several of their Vessels have been taken by this Fleet of our Allies.  Mr. Hancock setts off Tomorrow and will give you many particulars which I now omit.  Your obliged, humble Servant, James Lovell  ""

  Dear Sir, July 14th. 1778. Your Satyrveimic favor of the 30 of June came yesterday to hand. I enviously thank you for it; for you write like a man happy by the side of a charming woman, and whom nothing can vex. I will now only say you ought to be here at this period as a balance to the days of vexation you have formerly known in the service of your country in this rotten hearted State. Though our own Navy has dwindled Sadly, we now hold up our heads upon the strength of our allies by sea. The Count d'Estang is plenipotentiary for co-operation with General Washington and has proceeded immediately to Sandy Hook. The Languedoc is a very swift sailor, and though called a 90, has upwards of 100 carriage guns and 1200 men. The enemy have many ships, but their fifties half manned will not be able to stand an engagement with double manned 74's & 64's of the French. Mr. Hancock sets out for Town to morrow and will probably gain Some intelligence in his rout which being published in the Gazettes at his arrival will reach you and discover interesting events of the joint operations of France and America.  Nine States have Signed the Confederation and there is no doubt but Georgia, Delaware and Jersey will soon sign. Maryland will take airs and plague us, but upon our determination to confederate anew, 12 will do as She has always done before-come in without grace.  J. P. Jones has behaved to your liking-his conduct alone will make England keep her ships at home. My love to your friends, J.L.  ""

  Sir,(1) Philadelphia July 14th. 1778. Your agreable Favour of the 2d Instant, I recd. yesterday. As Congress was designed by its Institution to be a true Representation of the Minds of its Constituents; So that Body finds itself happy when Acts and Resolutions of material Consequence, merit the Universal Approbation.  The Scene brightens, grows more and more interesting, and calls for new and fresh Exertions of Senatorial Wisdom. We advance into the  Circle and Standing of mighty Nations-Adepts in all the Pollicy of Peace and War. May Heaven protect Our Youth and prove the Friend, Protector and Councellor of America!  JULY 14, 1778  I shall inclose you the Paper of this Day; which will render many Observations useless.(2) I had the Honor last Sabbath of welcoming in Person the Plenipotentiary of France to these United States. Grand and important is the Year 1778. We behold with Wonder and Astonishment a Leap of at least a Century. Sturdy indeed and wonderfully Successfull thro' Divine Assistance, have been the efforts of the well sinewed American Confederacy.  As I was present at, so I never was Witness to a more elevating and unspeakably joyous Interview than that between the Plenipotentiary of His most Christian Majesty, and the President of Congress in the Name and Behalf of the thirteen United States of America. It was reciprocally easy, graceful, Endearing and Noble. May it presage a happy Issue to the American Struggle and a growing and undecaying Glory that shall diffuse its grateful Influences thro' the World.  You inform me the Enemy are mowing the Islands (for us I hope). I expect They will soon leave Rhode Island. They must gather in their Forces-and I hope They will find enough to do beyond Our Coasts.  I should be surprised indeed to find The Towns in our State at present not in a Situation to be taxed, thrown out of a Representation. Can there be a Man that apprehends the Doctrine of Taxation & Representation used agt. Great Britain, to be in Point. Who are the greatest Sufferers, those who pay Taxes, or those whom the Enemy have deprived for the Present of any Ability to pay any? Who may be presumed to be most attached to Our Cause-or can it be supposed that with Their Estates they have lost the Powers of Wisdom to advise in Councill, or Hands to fight in the Field? Tenderness to Tories uniformly Enemies to Our Existance, and Listening Ears to the Female Prophetess, are dangerous Symptoms.  I am greatly pleased that Genl. Sullivan's Exertions gains him Confidence and Honor with our State. Should the British Troops continue there still-And the French Fleet by & by enter our Harbour-I hope the Genl. will signalize himself, and will have a noble Train of Volunteer Spirits following his Example and supporting his Measures.  I have in my Turn Sir to acknowledge Your Politeness, for a Long Time while in another publick office in the State, and during the Time I have had the Honor of a Seat in Congress, in favouring me with your interesting Paper. As I know you would choose to be informed, that so abuses may be rectified if possible, The Post before the last, of yesterday, & the Post before that brought me no Paper; which from the regular manner in which you have pleased to supply me, I attribute to some Abuses in the Post-Offices.  I have given you a long galloping Letter, but as I have not often Time enough to oblige You to submit to so great a mispenditure of Time in reading, You'l excuse it.

As I shall enclose to your Excellency the newspaper of this day, I have no occasion to add, but that I had the honor of being present the last Sabbath at the most interesting interview that ever took place in America, or perhaps in the world, between Monsieur Gerard, the Plenipotentiary of France, and the President of Congress, on the part of the Sovereign, Independent United States of America.  This interview was most cordial, generous and noble. In my turn, I had the honor of personally congratulating his Excellency upon his safe arrival, and giving him a hearty welcome to the United States of America.

  My dear sir, Philade July 15 1778 Mr H. (1) informs me that he will certainly set off for Boston immediately after Dinner, and being now in Congress I have Time only to write you a short Letter.  The Sieur Gerard will soon have an Audience in Congress, in the Stile of \""Minister Plenipotentiary of his most Christian Majesty the King of France.\"" Would you think that one so little of the Man of the World as I am should be joynd in a Committee to settle Ceremonials. It is however of some Importance that we agree upon Forms that are adapted to the true republican Principles; for this Instance may be recurrd to as a Precedent in Futurity.  The Articles of Confederation were signd last Week by seven States. North Carolina has sent a full Ratification of it, so the Mem- JULY 15, 1778  bers of that State will sign when they arrive which is expected in a few Days. Congress has written a Letter to the States of Georgia, Maryland, Delaware & Jersey pressing them to authorize their Delegates to joyn in this most necessary Transaction.(2) I believe there will [be] no Difficulty except with Maryland, & she will finally accede. The Articles have undergone no Alterations.  The French Minister arrivd in this City on Lords Day, and the day following, last Monday, the Delegates of Massachusetts Bay paid him their Compliments in Town. I know not that those of any other State have observd this Ceremony. It appeard to us highly proper. We were receivd with Politeness and heard some handsome Things said of the State we have the Honor to represent.  The Minister plenipotentiary deliverd to Congress a Letter from his Sovereign expressd in the strongest Terms of Affection & Friendship.  I can at present add no more than to inform you, that your Nephew, the son of my old Friend James Otis Esq, came into this City a few Days ago with the Intention of purchasing some Necessaries, but being destitute of Cash his Friends were under a Necessity of supplying him with the Sum of twenty pounds Lawful Money for the Repayment of which I have taken his written Request to his Grandfather, agreably to his own Proposal. I have indorsd the order and inclosd it in this Letter. I know not whether this will altogether meet with Approbation. I was the rather inclind to interrest my self for this young Gentleman, because I have been satisfactorily informd that he has behavd well in his military Character. I gave my best Advice respecting his Morals When you receive the Money you will please to repay to Mr. Hancock fourteen Dollars and thirteen & two thirds to Mr Dana, (both which Gentlemen will be at Boston shortly) and the Remainder to Mrs A., upon Notice of which I will account with two other Gentlemen concernd, Mr Holten & Col Pickering.(3) I remain Your very affectionate, S A [P.S.] Mr Dana desires his particular Respects to you.

  Dear Sir 15th July [1778] I confirm and beg leave to refer to the preceding duplicate of a letter which I had the honor of writing to you the 23d June by way of Maryland.  I could now if circumstances permitted fill two or three pages with important Intelligence and nothing would give me more pleasure than devoting an hour or two to your service or amusement, but I am limited. I was not allowed to write a single line to any body by Mr. Archibald Brown who left me the 9th Instant, and I believe waited on the road a day in expectation of Letters from me. At present I must be brief and refer you for particulars where you can find them in papers which will be wrapped up with this, and to our friend Mr. Lowndes, to whom I shall send other papers and write a little more copiously. You will learn also almost every thing from the Chief Justices communications, he devotes all his leisure minutes to collecting and transmitting news, and I help him upon all occasions with materials. He is a perfect Miser in gathering but very liberal in diffusing and by his means Carolina will be fully informed, the great end will therefore be answered and I must avail myself of the advantage of so good a Colleague. If I have any objection to his conduct 'tis that he will not frame public Letters to be subscribed by all the Delegates which ought to be done, but here he is a Miser again, why should I write, says he, for A.B.C. From one and another you must therefore expect to collect all that is fit and necessary to offer.  You will have such free access to the Papers in the hands of His Excellency as will save you the trouble of reading here, what passes away like a shadow, news only begets appetite for more and never satisfies. When you are told that Monsr. or Le Sr. Gerard is arrived, you will be anxious to learn the reception he has met, and the important concerns he is charged with-That Monsr. Le Count d'Estaing had passed Barnagat and had anchored off Sandy Hook, there will be a chasm, and a painful one too on your mind until you hear whether he has Burgoyned the British Fleet and Army at New York or caught a Tartar.  Informing you that I have transmitted orders to General Washington to co-operate with the French Vice Admiral to dispose of the Army under General Gates at North River, and to call in the aid of the Militia from the six northern and eastern States (1)-the wonder will be, whether General Pigot surrendered his garrison at Rhode Island, or made his escape, or maintained his ground? When I tell you that hitherto Congress have only talked of a Table but seem to evade all Measures for covering one, either with an House or Viands,(2) that I am forced every day to entertain Delegates, Strangers  JULY 15, 1778  and sometimes Minister plenipo. you will naturally ask, will Mount Tacitus, Mepkin &c support the expence? I can assure you their produce must be uncommonly ample if they answer in the affirmative. If my diurnal Account amounted at York Town to near fifty Dollars, what will be the sum in Philadelphia, I hope not much more. Be that as it may, I must bear it until the Celebration of All Saints-the first time I ever wished for the arrival of a Saints day since I left school; then by the Grace of God I mean to break Up.(3)  You will see that Your friend Colo. Laurens has again been in the way of danger and honor, besides having his horse fall under him by a deadly shot he has received a slight contusion from a spent ball which he has not mentioned. I learnt it from Colonel Boudinot.  When General Lee's tryal is ended, you shall be informed of certain particulars which had excited my jealousy of my old friend antecedent to the march from Valley Forge-he has written two Pieces and caused them to be published in the Jersey Gazette relative to the Battle of Monmouth. I have not read them, but have been informed they contain no proofs of his discretion.(4)  I intend to draw on Mr. Nutt for eight hundred and ten Pounds Sterling,(5) which will produce me here at least ten thousand two hundred and sixty dollars, perhaps five hundred and forty more. I am offer'd 475 Currency for 1 Sterling, and am taught to expect five for one. You will take this under consideration in lodging the attachment, if he pays my Bill the expence of the attachment will of course be mine, e contra, the precaution will be found to have been necessary.(6)  ""

  Dear Sir 15th July [1778] I had the Honor of addressing your Excellency the 27th Ulto. through the hands of Governor Henry via Williamsburg. On that day I left York Town and arrived here the 30th-from various impediments I could not collect a sufficient number of States to form a Congress earlier than the 7th Instant; one was the offensiveness of the air in and around the State House, which the Enemy had made JULY 15, 1778  an Hospital and left it in a condition disgraceful to the Character of civility. Particularly they had opened a large square pit near the House, a receptacle for filth, into which they had also cast dead horses and the bodies of Men who by the mercy of death had escaped from their further cruelties. I cannot proceed to a new subject before I add a curse on their savage practices.  Congress in consequence of this disappointment have been shuffling from Meeting House to College Hall the last seven days & have not performed half the business which might and ought to have been done, in a more commodious situation.  The several Papers which your Excellency will receive within the present cover, No. 1 to No. 15 will contain much Intelligence of our Public Affairs, and more minutely than my time will allow me to repeat in a Letter, wherefore Sir, I beg leave to refer to these and to request you will communicate to Mr. Wells all that your Excellency shall judge proper for publication, he is very good in sending me his Gazettes and other Intelligence and my duties will not always permit me to make exact and direct returns.  On Sunday last the Committee appointed for the purpose received Monsr. Gerard at Chester, and under a respectible Cavalcade conducted him to temporary Apartments at General Arnold's, where the Committee, a few other Members of Congress including myself dined with him. On Monday he dined with me, walk'd an hour in the Evening and yesterday Morning Monsr. Girard breakfasted with me and explained his Mission for the information of Congress. He intimated to me his powers for appearing in the Character of Minister Plenipotentiary, or more simply a Resident; \""that which he should assume awaited the determination of Congress respecting the public Character of their Minister or Ministers at the Court of Versailles, who without full powers would in many instances find themselves incapable of accomplishing essential services to these States.\""  He marked the distinction of Ambassador, a character in which he did not appear, and put into my hands Copy of the Kings' sign Manual appointing him Minister Plenipo: another by which he is appointed Consul General in the several United States with powers to depute and several other Papers,(1) Copies of some of these Your Excellency will find among the numbers abovementioned. No. [ ] respecting Prizes which may be made by American Vessels of War is another mark of the good will of our illustrious Ally and ought to be published immediately.(2) These Papers I laid before Congress and reported all the necessary articles of conversation with Monsr. Girard. A Committee of three are appointed for considering & reporting upon the subject and upon a proper mode for receiving Monsr. Girard in form.(3)  The Court of France probably could not have discovered a Man in Europe so equal to the task assigned the Minister Plenipotentiary   as is Monsr. Girard-a Man of Politeness, Good Breeding and affability without troublesome ceremony. Of good sense and quick perceptions without shew or ostentation, and well read in the History of Man. Very seldom, Sir, do I suffer myself to pronounce an opinion of any Man upon so short and slight an acquaintance; even the present Case, although I have seen many marks which induce me to believe well of this Gentlemans candour and integrity of Heart, I proceed in my judgment not a step beyond visibility, and keep as I hold we ought all to keep upon every Stranger in high Character, all the necessary Guards awake. One article of Conversation with Sier Gerard I ought not to omit, I think it important, and that it will please Your Excellency. With a view of learning what reception at home those French Gentlemen had met, who had returned some eight or nine Months ago murmuring and dissatisfied; I took occasion to intimate some concern at the disappointment which many of them had suffered, and in honor of Congress added brief Accounts of what had been granted to numbers of French Officers now in our Army, that it had been impossible to gratify the wishes of every one for grade, that in general such as had been Commissioned by Congress had performed good service, and done honor to their Nation, that some of these Gentlemen from their bravery and propriety of conduct were held in the highest esteem &c. &c. Mr. Gerard replied, The Court had seen with pain so many French men applying for permission to resort to the American Army, very few of whom had received encouragement, the Court were sensible that crouds of Foreigners applying for Commissions would tend to embarrass Congress, that since his arrival in Philadelphia there had been many applications made to him for recommendations, every one of which he had refused to listen to, and that I might rest satisfied Congress would never be troubled with Petitions under his auspices.  Mr. Silas Deane is returned to Congress in pursuance of an Order in the last Winter, the dissentions among our croud of Commissioners at Paris are become notorious and I was going to add scandalous, particulars have been imparted to me in several Letters, but I have hitherto sealed my lips, and I hope Congress will, by a judicious seperation, supercede the Call for investigation and avert the impending evil of keeping jarring minds in one employ.  Mr. Deane has delivered me an handsome testimonial in his favor from Monsr. Vergennes, one of the Ministers at the Court of Versailles, signed by the Kings order and accompanied with his Majestys' Picture in a Gold Box, superbly surrounded by two rows of Diamonds.(4) Le Sier Gerard speaks of and entertains him with distinguishing respect. Doctor Franklin has also written to me, expressing an high sense of Mr. Deane's merits (5)-those who differ in opinion with the Doctor, say all these recommendations are mere etiquette  and partiality. I shall form no conclusion until I learn much more than has hitherto come to my knowledge. I believe they are all good Men, but I know there are in some of them vile tempers, which alloy their general goodness.  Inclosed herein your Excellency will find a Bill dated 4th June 1778 by the Marquis de la Fayette on Messrs. John Crips and Comp. for seven thousand dollars, and a Promisary Note by Archibald Browne Esqr. 7th July for £1726.5.-Carolina Currency, sums which I supplied those Gentlemen respectively as a good means of removing so much out of the public treasury here into our own, and shall with the concurrence of my Colleagues remit all that remains after ascertaining a sum necessary to be reserved for the use of the Delegates, unless Your Excellency and the Privy Council shall otherwise direct.  I had relied on my Colleague the Chief Justice for the frame of a general Address from the Delegates from our State to Your Excellency, accounting for our proceedings respecting Confederation, but am disappointed, I believe he has written fully on the subject in his private Letters to Your Excellency,(6) to his Advices therefore I beg leave at present to refer, but I shall urge the propriety and necessity for laying before the Legislature from whom we derived our authority, a proper report of our conduct.  I foresee I shall be obliged to detain this Messenger a day or two, in which time articles of Intelligence will accumulate, whatever happens worthy Your Excellencys notice shall be transmitted in the Packet which shall be kept open to the last moment. I have taken the liberty to refer the late President (7) and Mr. Gervais as well as Mr. Wells to Your Excellency for news, in my present circumstances 'tis barely possible for me to keep pace with my public duties, my own private concerns receive not the smallest attention from me.  Your Excellency's favors of the 28th May and 17th June lie before me, (8) and I had intended to pay the respect due to them by this Messenger, but 'tis now impossible. I therefore intreat your indulgence, Sir, until the next-and that you will be assured I Am with very great Esteem and Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's &c.  ""

  Dear Sir, Philada July l5th 1778. Colo. Williams never gave me the certificate of our appointment untill a few days ago when we parted, he chusing to be inoculated for the small pox at Alexandria. I was then hurried & did not examine it, not having the least reason to doubt but that the powers given to the Delegates were the same as usual, however on producing the Commission it was so worded as to make it absolutely necessary that all the Members should be present to give us a right to vote. As it may be a long time before Mr. Harnet arrives or Colo. Williams gets over the Smallpox I have thought it my duty to write to you by express, requesting that your Excellency would be pleased to mention whether one Gentn. by the design of the Genl. Assembly cannot vote, if so you will be pleased to send a Commission for that purpose; but if no alteration can be made pray inform Mr. Harnet that it is absolutely necessary for him to repair to Philada. without delay. I find my self in a disagreeable situation wch. is the reason of my application to you, I was told that the Assembly expected that the Delegates were upon the same terms as formerly.(1)  Mr. Gerrard a French Minister is here He is to reside in America. War is declared by France against England-a large Fleet from that Nation arrived at Sandy hook several days ago & are gone to New York to take possession of the British Fleet there, we expect to hear of an action every hour  General Washing has crossed the No. River, & General Gates is in the neighbourhood of King's bridge with a considerable body. Our force will be upwards of 20,000. The French have 3 or 4000 men more than they want to man their ships who may be disposed of as Genl. Washington thinks proper, so that most Gentn. are of opinion we shall soon be in possession of New York, in short our affairs seem to be in as good away as we could wish.  Mr. Deane is in Town, he is highly recommended by the King of France. I beg your Excellency will let me hear from you as soon as possible. I had almost forgot to tell you that Genl. Lee is under an JULY 15, 1778  arrest, what the sentence will be is not known, however he has made it a quarrel with Genl Washington & of course you know he must fail. I shall write you by every opportunity. I am with due respect, Your Excellency's most obt. hble Servt. John Penn  P.S. Some matters of very great Importance will soon come on, it is the wish of the Southern States that No. Carolina should vote as I am confident it was not the design of the General Assembly to alter our old mode of one Delegate's representing the State, I hope your Excellency will send a Commn. for that purpose, however the Clerks may have expressed the resolution of the Assembly, or we shall have nothing to do or say this year.

The loss of the buildings, of the current rents, & of considerable arrearages which must take place is considerable, & not merited by a person who has sacrificed already so much of his interest, & his whole time for several years to the service of his country.

  [July 16-30, 1778](1) Fully sensible of the blessings which are likely to flow from the treaties between France & these United States, it is with true pleasure Congress view those engagements at once demonstrating his wisdom & magnanimity & commanding the Reverence of all Nations. His beneficent attention to the rights & Happiness of Mankind has gained to him the veneration of the virtuous Citizens of America & intitle him to gratitude of their latest posterity. It is the hope & opinion of Congress that the Confidence His Majesty reposes in the firmness of these States will receive additional strength from every day's experience of their conduct.  Had the Independence & Repose of America depended solely on the King your Master, there is no doubt, but that both had been long since established. That lust of domination which has drawn so much blood, must ever be detested.(2) By deception, fire & sword these States were driven to assume a station among the Nations of the Earth to which they were intitled by laws human & divine.(3) They could not but virtuously endeavour to sustain a war brought upon them from afar: a war arising from a lust of domination ever to be deplored: a war prosecuted by the enemy with a degree of outrage & cruelty, as disgraceful to their arms & counsels, as unprecedented among civilized Nations. Maturely reflecting upon the ruinous consequences of a passive conduct America met the attack aimed at every thing her People held valuable & dear, when she scarce had arms to oppose the shock:(4) the unexpected conflict reduced her to the last extremity, but relying upon the justice of her cause she had no apprehension for the event. During the progress of the war the Divine interpositions in her favour became manifest; & in no instance more conspicuous than in moving the heart of your Sovereign in favour of our exertions. He has the glory of being the first Prince in Europe who declared himself a friend & ally to the oppressed United States alone struggling in defence of rights not confined to them but extended to all mankind. That same lust of domination which origi- JULY 16, 1778  nated the war yet prolonges & extends its calamities. America wishes to sheathe the sword & stop the further effusion of blood. The King of G. B. pretends to have sent commissioners to restore peace;(5) but such a peace as would benefit these United States is not in their hearts-at least they have not acceded to any condition preparitory to that end, which Congress has proposed. Hence it is with pity & concern Congress view the necessity of continuing the war & they are determined by every means in their power to fulfill those eventual engagements formed between France & these United States which from the hostile measures & designes of the common enemy have compleatly acquired positive & permanent force & operation.  The arrival of the Naval force so wisely sent by His Most Christian Majesty to cooperate with the arms of these States under God promise the speedy establishment of that Peace which is the object of the Alliance between the two Nations. The common enemy deaf to the voice of reason, are to be roused to a sense of justice only by the din of Arms. We trust that our combined efforts will secure the Independence of N. America in a peace promoting the true interests of France, America, Europe & Mankind. Nor do we doubt but that those who administer the powers of government within these United States will in all things labour to confirm & cement that Union with the Subjects of France, the beneficial Effects of which have been already so sensibly felt.  Informed of your past conduct in the affairs of these States, it is with the most cordial pleasure Congress receive you Sir, as His M. C. M. Minister Plenipotentiary, & they are perfectly satisfied that you will endeavour to obey your instructions in such a manner as will intitle you to the confidence & friendship of the Representatives of the United States of America.

  [July 16, 1778](1) Dear Sir, Private. Philadelphia June 10th 1778.  It gives me great pleasure to find your name among the list of Congress, because I am persuaded from personal knowledge of me and my family and connections you can entertain no jealousy that I would engage in the execution of any commission that was inamicable to the rights and privileges of America or the general libertys of mankind. While on the other hand your character must be so well known that no man will suspect you will yield any point that is contrary to the real interest of your country and therefore it will be presumed we will loose no opportunity from false punctilio of meeting to discuss our differences fairly, and that if we do agree, it will be on the most liberal, and therefore the most lasting terms of union. There are three facts I wish to assure you of. First that Doctor Franklin on the 29th of March last in discussing the several articles we wish to make the basis of our treaty was perfectly satisfied they were beneficial to North America and such as he should accept. JULY 16, 1778  Second that this treaty with France was not the first treaty that France had exacted and with which Mr. Simeon Dean had put to sea, but granted and acceded to after the sentiments of the people of Great Britain had fully changed, after the friends to America had gained their points for reconciliation, and solely with a view to disappoint the good effects of our endeavors. You will be pleased to hear the pamphlet wrote by Mr. Pulteney (2) was a great means of opening the minds of the people of England to the real state of the question between us, and that it has run through 13 editions. The third fact is that Spain unasked, had sent a formal message disapproving of the conduct of France. These I will engage to prove to your satisfaction. I beg to recommend to your personal civilities my friend Doctr. Ferguson. He is a man of the greatest genius and virtue and has always been a steady friend to America. Private.(3)  ....................................................................................................... ... If you follow the example of Britain in the hour of her pride, insolence, and madness and refuse to hear us, I still expect, since I am here, to have the privilege of coming among you and seeing the country, as there are many men whose virtues I admire above Greek or Roman Names that I should be glad to tell my children about. I am with esteem & affection, Dear Sir, your friend and servant,  Geo. Johnstone.  The Substance of the above Letter is truly diverting. Let it be remembered that it is to a Member of Congress and informs him of what? Why that Doctor Franklin on the twenty ninth of March, approved the Propositions of which Govr. Johnstone was the Bearer. At the Moment of receiving this Letter the Gentleman to whom it was directed had before him the Treaties executed with France & signed by Doctor Franklin. One of two Things must be the Case either Govr. Johnstone believes what he says or he does not; if the latter he is a Knave if the former a Dupe. The next piece of Information is that France exacted as he is pleased to express himself another Treaty which had been sent to Sea by Simeon Deane. Unfortunately again Mr. Simeon Deane was on the Spot to meet the false Allegation. But the third glowing glaring Stroke of Intelligence is the Conduct of Spain. Govr. Johnstone will learn in a very few Weeks what will be the Conduct of his most Catholic Majesty. And I venture to pledge myself that it will be found as different from his Representation as Light from Darkness.  ""

  Sir 17th July [1778] Your Excellency's Letter of the 25th Ulto. reached me in this City.(1) Here many impediments prevented the forming Congress earlier than the 7th Instant. On the 8th I had the honor of presenting that Letter and the pleasure of perceiving an high degree of indignation kindling in the minds of Members as I advanced in unfolding the villianous attempts of the Enemy against Your Excellencys' Person. This indignation was discernable even in Gentlemens countenances, but more strongly marked in expressions suitable to the occasion which broke forth from many quarters of the House. The Letter was committed, but our attention almost ever since that period has been drawn to the businesses which Your Excellency well knows, naturally arise from the arrival of a Minister Plenipotentiary in the City where Congress sit-And the fleet of an Ally on the Coast which Congress wished to have cleared of Enemies-from these considerations Your Excellency will not be surprized that a report has not yet come up from the Committee.  A Gentleman who says he is of Jersey, has pressed me closely for a Commission and instructions for a private ship of War equipped by him in that State. In order to put the business in the best course I have in a seperate Packet folded four Commissions, Instructions and Bonds and directed the Packet to Your Excellency.

  Philadelphia, July 18, 1778 To their Excellencies the Earl of CARLISLE, Sir HENRY CLINTON, and WILLIAM EDEN, and GEORGE JOHNSTONE, Esquires, British Commissioners.  Your letter to Congress of the 11th instant, induces me again to request your Excellencies attention to the reflections of an individual.(1)  If I can penetrate the sentiments of Congress, I may assure you that your reply was unexpected; for it was with reason imagined you JULY 18, 1778  would have understood their answer of the 17th of June: (2) That was a full and plain return to your letter of the ninth; and it was taken as a natural consequence, that the correspondence between the Congress and your Excellencies was then ipso facto suspended, until you, being fully authorized to do so, had acceded to one or other of the explicit preliminaries they proposed. It appears your Excellencies discernment has been misconceived-I am sorry for it.  You say, Congress propose to you, as matter of choice, one or other of two alternatives, as preliminaries necessary even to the beginning of a negociation for peace; one, \""an explicit acknowledgment of the Independence of these States;\"" and you add, \""you are not inclined to dispute with Congress about the meaning of words.\"" Why then do you construe that explicit alternative as applicable to an inexplicit dependence upon Britain? By your construction, our ideas of language are totally different. We cannot conceive that a state of independence can possibly admit of an state of dependence: If you called the night, day, we should as clearly understand you. I beg your Excellencies will allow me to throw out another reflection upon this abstruse subject.  \""You are not inclined to dispute with Congress about the meaning of words; but so far as by the independence of these states Congress mean the entire privilege of the people of North America to dispose of their property, and to govern themselves without any reference to Great Britain, beyond what is necessary to preserve that union of force, in which our mutual safety and advantage consist;\"" so far their independence, you say, is fully acknowledged in your letter of the 10th of June, you forget, it is dated the ninth, adding you \""are willing to enlarge that independence.\""  In the first place, I would ask your Excellencies, whether you mean to include the people of the two Floridas, Nova-Scotia and Canada, under your terms, \""the people of North America.\"" I believe you do not; but we mean to raise them to the rank of independent freemen. Again, you say, you have offered us such an independence, as is calculated but to preserve the union of the force of America and Britain in the hand of the latter, and you now offer \""to enlarge that independence.\"" If you are serious and mean something, you must mean the independence we mean, which is, to preserve the force of America independent of Great-Britain, not in union with Great Britain and in her hand. There can be no intermediate degree of independence between that which is but calculated to preserve the union of the force of America and Britain, and the degree we demand. If you enlarge that degree, which is but sufficient to preserve that union, the union cannot be preserved, and the independence of consequence becomes compleat: We ask nothing more; we will accept nothing less. If you understand the term independence as we do, why are you not explicit? If you do not, why do you   delay to draw the line between the independence you offered and the enlarged independence you offer? You ought to do this; we are plain men, and cannot divide that, which from the nature of it we think indivisible.  As to the other alternative of withdrawing your fleets and armies, you openly and at once refuse \""to begin with this measure.\"" Here we understand each other clearly, and this point is settled at once. This proceeding on your part is conspicuous, because it is singular; and as it deserves, so it receives my commendation. Your reasons, in support of your decision, are of no consequence to Congress: I believe they neither asked, expected or wished for them. It was their business to demand; their reasons remained with themselves; it was your business to grant or refuse. It was known you would not grant the demand if you could possible avoid it; and it was not doubted but that your ingenuity would furnish you with reasons for your refusal. However, as Congress have nothing to do with the principles of your conduct, I will dismiss them without any further observation upon them.  \""In making your declarations, you do not wait for the decision of any military events;\"" but \""shall abide by the declarations you now make in every possible situation of your affairs.\"" I admire the magnanimity of your sentiments; they are worthy an old Roman, or modern American; you will be pleased to pardon me if I add, they are not a la mode d'Anglaise; and also, not to be offended at this phrase of expression: For as all America is intent upon learning the elegant language of our ally of France, in order to improve our friendly correspondence, so such phrases naturally slip from our tongues and pens. The air of America seems to have produced a sudden effect upon your Excellencies; indeed, all animals feel the effect of a change of climate. The rulers in England, as they are in a very different climate from that which you now enjoy, so they are in a habit of thinking and acting very different from yours. They regulate their demands, refusals and concessions, according to the \""situation of their affairs;\"" you declare you will not. As this is a striking contrast, perhaps it may be disputed; and as I know your Excellencies are able disputants at the point of the tongue, pen and sword, I think it is but prudent to place the subject out of all dispute; I shall endeavour to do this, by drawing it up in the following manner: In the years 1774 and 1775, when America was destitute of arms, your King and Ministers were deaf to her supplications for redress of grievances.  In the years 1776 and 1777, when America had but a raw soldiery, and scarce the appearance of a regular army, your king and Parliament having 45,865 and 48,616 effective regular forces, amply supplied in every respect, besides 22,337 seamen assaulting these United States on all sides, your rulers breathed nothing but unconditional  submission on our part. On the ninth of March, Lord Camden declared in your House of Lords, that this high tone continued so late as the 16th day of February last, and that it was suddenly altered on the 17th, when your rulers resolved, to use his Lordships expression, \""to bend their knees before America.\"" The alteration of the situation of their affairs, was the occasion of this sudden change. At this point of time, by the returns from America, it appeared that the British army had by death, desertion and otherwise, lost 19,581 men; that 5336 men had been taken prisoners, that the sick amounted to 4639; and that the navy had lost 4314 seamen.(3) Capitals as these losses were, yet the men in power breathed unconditional submission, till finding that a treaty between France and America had been signed on the 6th of February, and feeling the mortal blow to their tyranny, on the 17th of February Lord North and his coadjutors, goaded by the situation of their affairs, bent their knees before America, upon the bills which your Excellencies presented to Congress in the form of acts of Parliament. It is thus plain to a demonstration, that your rulers are deaf, demand or concede, according to the situation of their affairs; and notwithstanding your heroics, you must concede, for you are but instruments in their hands. On the 28th of June last, you sunk beneath the arm of America; (4) France now confines your haughty flag to the port of NewYork, and threatens you with destruction.  But you would have the treaties entered into by Congress communicated to you, both for your own consideration and that of the constituents of Congress, who you say are to judge between them and you. Your Excellencies are then inclined to appeal from Congress to their constituents? How little are you acquainted with the disposition of the people of America! Sir Henry Clinton has seen a similar appeal by Lord and General Howe in their proclamation dated the 19th of September, 1776; our affairs were then in the most ruinous situation; and are you yet to learn that the appeal was rejected! Can you gravely expect that your appeal will now be sustained, now that our affairs are not only en bon train, but that we have every moral assurance of decisive victory, and success! Are we not masters of the field, which we never before have been? Are we not in pursuit of your forces? Has not your grand army retired to Islands for safety? Are you not at war with the House of Bourbon? Does not the House of Bourbon prosecute the war in conjunction with the United States? The fleet of France at this moment holds you blocked up at New York, and daily seizes your ships in sight of your flags displayed in vain parade. Your inferior army is full reduced by draughts to the defense of your capital in Europe; a proof that you will receive no more land reinforcement. You are upon the brink of perdition, and yet you pretend to hold dominion over us, and to reason us into an independent dependence-a jargon of words-a very chaos of ideas.   Your Excellencies have been so long in the school of deception, and seem so fond of the art, that for want of other subjects to practice upon, you are resolved to deceive yourselves. If this contributes to mitigate the uneasiness of your present situation, continue to enjoy the artifice a little longer, I cannot but pity your distress.  You think yourselves intitled to a full communication of the powers by which Congress conceive themselves authorized to make treaties with foreign powers, and you add, you do not find promulgated any act or resolution of the Assemblies of particular States, conferring this power on them. Whatever you may think upon this point, I believe I may venture to assure you, Congress do not conceive themselves answerable to you on the subject. They know their own powers, they know they are answerable to their constituents for the due exercise of them. However, I will endeavour to satisfy you substantially in this point, and to do it the more agreeably, I will state a fact and use your own stile of argument.  On the sixth of May, Congress announced to the United States, that they had ratified treaties of alliance and commerce with France: This is the 18th of July, and have your Excellencies heard that any one of the United States has {'promulgated\"" any censure upon Congress for such ratification? As, because you do not find promulgated any act or resolution of the Assemblies of particular States conferring this power on them, you infer, they have no such power: is it not more reasonable, that as two months and an half have passed since Congress announced their act to their constituents, and you do not find promulgated any act or resolution of the Assemblies of particular States censuring Congress for this exercise of power, therefore you ought to infer, that the constituents of Congress think they did not exceed their authority? Politicians should never say more at any time than is necessary. You produce a negative argument, and an answer in the same manner is quite sufficient. Having thus far touched the subject of your Excellencies letter, I take the liberty of addressing myself in particular to his Excellency Governor Johnstone, and that in presence of his colleagues. I have no ambition to have a tete a tete with the Governor.  A letter has been laid before Congress, signed Geo. Johnstone, dated Philadelphia, June 10, 1778, directed to the Honorable Francis Dana, Esq; (5) and among other things the writer says, \""there are three facts I wish to assure you of.\""  First, \""That Doctor Franklin on the 29th of March last, in discussing the several articles we wish to make the basis of our treaty, was perfectly satisfied they were beneficial to North America, and such as she should expect.\"" Decisively to destroy this position, I have only to state two or three points.  The Honorable Silas Deane has informed me, that a secret negoci-  ator from Britain did arrive at Passy, immediately preceding the 29th of March last, and applied to Doctor Franklin. That he himself left Paris the first of April, in order to embark at Toulon for America. That at Toulon he received a letter from Doctor Franklin, dated the 7th of April. Mr. Deane put the letter into my hand, and with his permission I extracted the following paragraph. \""The negociator is gone back apparently much chagrined at his little success. I have promised him faithfully, that since his propositions could not be accepted they should be buried in oblivion\"".(6) With every American I have no doubt but this testimony by Doctor Franklin, will greatly outweigh the testimony given by Governor Johnstone and his negociator, who has divulged the propositions he desired the Doctor to bury in oblivion. But there was design in this conduct-it is so obvious that I need not point it out.  Second, \""That this treaty with France was not the first that France had exacted, and with which Mr. Simeon Deane had put to sea, but granted and acceded to after the sentiments of the people of Great Britain had fully changed,\"" meaning with regard to the measures to be pursued with America, conciliation instead of coercion.  Upon this second article I must observe, that the Honorable Silas Deane, to whom I read it, and who was at the Court of France during the whole time of any negociation there for a treaty between France and America, assures me that France never \""exacted\"" any terms from America but those contained in the treaties of the sixth of February, and that Mr. Simeon Deane had never put to sea with any other treaties. That it is true he had put to sea preceding this period, but only charged with the declaration of the Court of France, delivered by Monsieur Girard on the 16th of December to the American Commissioners, of whom Mr. Deane was one, and with letters from the Commissioners informing Congress, that the treaty would be formed agreeable to that declaration, a declaration which I have already stated in my letter to your Excellencies, of the 17th of June, at York-Town. And thus from the express authority of the Honorable Mr. Deane, Governor Johnstone stands fully confuted.  As for the third fact \""that Spain unasked had sent a formal message disapproving of the conduct of France,\"" I have only to say, that as I cannot offer evidence against it, for argument I will admit the fact may be so; and what then? Will governor Johnstone pretend to say, Spain now disapproves the conduct of France? It is known to the world that France and Spain are in the most perfect confidence together. France is now at war with Great Britain. Governor Johnstone now knows this fact, and I assure myself that he does not doubt that Spain is either at this moment also at war with Great Britain, or very shortly will be. A few weeks will ascertain this matter, and demonstrate that the Governor is content to catch at a   straw. When his Excellency wrote this letter on the 10th of June, he had then to learn, that the Count D'Estaing had sailed from Toulon; and that the Spanish plate fleet had arrived at Cadiz.  I now call upon Governor Johnstone relative to a more serious subject. His personal honour is interested: The following particulars are not unworthy his notice.  A letter signed by him, dated Philadelphia, June 16th, 1778, and directed to the Honourable Robert Morris, contains the following paragraph:  \""I believe the men who have conducted the affairs of America uncapable of being influenced by improper motives. But in all such transactions there is risque; and I think whoever ventures should be secured, at the same time that honour and emolument should naturally follow the fortune of those who have steered the vessel in the storm, and brought her safely to port. I think Washington and the President have a right to every favour that grateful nations can bestow, if they could once more unite our interest and spare the miseries and devastations of war.\""(7) Than this I cannot conceive a more genteel bidding for secret services. The offer by common implication reaches every Member of Congress; every man entrusted with public authority for the maintainance of the independence of America. The attempt is horrid! Has not Governor Johnstone for years past declaimed against bribery, corruption, undue influence! Then he was anti-ministerial-now he feels the effects of ministerial favour. But if this does not shew the Governor in a clear point of view, let him be seen through another medium: The Honourable General Reed inclosed to me the following particulars signed with his name: \""On Sunday the 21st June, a few days after the evacuation of the city of Philadelphia by the British troops, the subscriber received a written message from a married lady of character, having connections with the British army: expressing a desire to see him on business which could not be commited to writing. Attending the lady agreeable to her appointment, in the evening, after some previous conversation respecting her particular connections, the business and characters of the British Commissioners, and particularly of Governor Johnstone, were the subjects of general conversation, which becoming more confined, the lady enlarged upon the great talents and amiable qualities of that gentleman, and added, that in several conversations with her he had expressed the most favourable sentiments of the subscriber, and it was particularly wished to engage his interest to promote the object of their commission, viz. a reunion between the two countries if consistent with the subscriber's principles and judgment; and in such case, it could not be deemed unbecoming or improper in government to take a favourable notice of such conduct, and that in this instance the subscriber might have l0,000£. Sterling, and any office in the colonies in his Majesty's gift.  To which, finding an answer was expected, he replied, he was not worth purchasing, but such as he was the King of Great Britain was not rich enough to do it. Here the conversation ended. JOS. REED. (8)  It is needless for me to make any reflections upon such particulars. I bid your Excellencies farewell. W.H.D.  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, and Daily Advertiser, July 21, 1778.  1 The RC of the Carlisle commissioners' July 11 letter \""To His Excellency Henry Laurens The President and other The Members of Congress\"" is in the Peter Force Collection, DLC, and bears the following endorsement by Charles Thomson: \""Letter from Carlisle, H Clinton, Wm Eden, Geo Johnstone. New York 11 July 1778. Read 18.\"" Congress resolved this day not to answer the commissioners' letter because they failed to accept either of the congressional preconditions for peace negotiations-recognition of American independence or withdrawal of the British army and navy from the United States-and then ordered this resolve and the commissioners' letter to be published. As a result, both appeared in the July 21 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet, together with Drayton's open letter to the commissioners of this date.

Examined in Congress July 16 1778. Chas. Thomson secy.\"" See also Gouverneur Morris' Notes on George Johnstone's Letter to Francis Dana, July 16, 1778.  6 In a section of his December 21, 1778, memorial to Congress that first became available in 1928, Silas Deane offered a fuller account than Drayton of British efforts to enlist Benjamin Franklin's support for Anglo-American peace negotiations:  \""Within a Day or two of the Commissioners being presented at Court, which was on the 19th of March, 1778, Doctor Franklin informed me of the arrival of an Agent from the british Ministry, with proposals, which were to be made secretly to him. Doctor Franklin after waiting on him shewed me a Copy of them which he afterwards gave me to bring to America. The Fleet from Toulon then ready for sailing, and his Excellency Monsr Gerard, & myself on the point of setting out from Paris, Doctor Franklin waved giving him a positive Answer, until we should be well on our Journey. On the 7th of April, he wrote me as per Letter of that Date, that having engaged that the proposals should not be communicated, as he had positively rejected them-he desired me instantly to destroy them without either copying or communicating them to any one. I complied instantly on the Receipt of his Letter, with his request. On my arrival in America, I was informed that the british Commissioners had declared that those Propositions had been shewn privately to Doctor Franklin at Paris, & that he approved of them. To contradict this Assertion, I have produced Doctor Franklin's Letter,   & related the Circumstances of that Transaction in as few words as possible.\"" Charles M. Andrews, ed., \""A Note on the Franklin-Deane Mission to France.\"" Yale University Library Gazette 2 (1928): 59-60.  The relevant section on this issue in Franklin's April 7 letter to Deane reads:  \""The Negociator is gone back apparently much chagrin'd at his little Success. I have promised him faithfully that since his Propositions could not be accepted they should be buried in Oblivion. I therefore desire earnestly that you would put that paper immediately in the Fire on receipt of this, without taking or suffering to be taken any Copy of it, or communicating its Contents.\"" Ibid., pp. 65-66.  Although neither source identifies the British \""Negociator\"" who approached Franklin, Samuel F. Bemis has plausibly conjectured that the person in question was Paul Wentworth, a British agent who before the conclusion of the Franco American alliance had been employed to sound out Franklin and Deane as to the prospects for a settlement between Great Britain and the United States.

AppletonCentury Co., 1935), pp. 58-60, 68n.21.  7 See Robert Morris to Gouverneur Morris, June 16, 1778, note 2.  8 A text of this statement in Joseph Reed's hand is in the Pierre Eugene Du Simitiere Papers, PPL.

  [July 18, 1778] 18th. My Letter has been kept open, and the Messenger detained in hopes of procuring one Morning or Evening for filling a page or two of News to you, but all such expectations are vain. I must therefore, again refer you to my Friend; to his Excellency as first Magistrate without attention to my respect for the Man, he is justly entitled to the first fruits of intelligence-you will there learn all I could say in a dozen sheets.  Your friend Colonel Laurens is detached upon a very honorable Embassy by his General to Count d'Estaing, (1) his knowledge of the French tongue in some measure qualifies him for the errand and I JULY 18, 1778  trust he will not be found deficient in other necessary qualifications, making reasonable considerations for his Youth, when I learn particulars from him, you shall be informed. 'Tis highly probable, Count d'Estaing's squadron will capture many English Vessels while Iying at Sandy Hook, but I have doubts concerning their getting within; the large Men of War draw 25 to 27 feet water-if they fail at that place, I think Rhode Island must be their next object, there they must succeed.  My best Compliments, Love and Respects to Mrs. Gervais, Mr. and Mrs. Manigault &c. &c. &c. My Dear friend, Adieu  ""

  Dear Sir 18th July [1778] I had the honor of addressing you under the 10th and the same date in public letters which this will accompany. The subjects contained in those are now obsolete, nevertheless I do not think it proper to suppress them. Georgia has at present only one Delegate in Congress who alone cannot on her part ratify confederation.(1) I am very unhappy from having received no further commands from Congress respecting poor little Georgia; in hopes of such I had detained the Bearer three days, but the arrival of a French squadron and a Minister Plenipotentiary has accumulated the labours of Congress insomuch that many necessary considerations for the benefit of particular States unavoidably lie dormant. The First hour of leisure I will give Mr. Telfair all the aid in my power to bring his state on the tapis.  Count d'Estaing is exceedingly chargrined at the impracticability of attacking the English ships of War, who lie in his sight within Sandy Hook-his large ships draw too much water for the Bar and keep him without where prizes are daily dropping into his net, and not a few very valuable. I presume he has already lessened the number of British Seamen 500. If he proceeds to Rhode Island he will probably recover that place, capture the Garrison said to be upwards of 3000, make prizes of some ships, and secure a good Harbour.  I shall have the honor of writing to you again in a few days, at present must content myself with subscribing Dr. Sir, With great Regard and Esteem, Your Obedient Humble Servt.  P. S. I send you a few News papers.  JULY 18, 1778  ""

  Sir 18th July [1778] I have with pleasure executed an Order of Congress by signing and delivering a Brevet to the Marquis de Vienne to rank Colonel in the Army of the United States of America.(1) My pleasure as an individual would not have been less if my name had been ordered to a full Commission. Such an one I make no doubt will be readily granted if the Marquis de Vienne shall think it more valuable than the present, when he shall be returning to his Native Clime. Your Excellency cannot conceive the embarrasment which is often occasioned to Congress by granting Commissions to foreign Gentlemen to the prejudice of rank to many of our own home born Officers who have served the public with honor from the very commencement of the War.  The Board of War have not yet reported on the application in favour of Monsr. Touzard, possibly there may be policy and good will towards that Gentleman concealed in the delay-requests do not so well succeed, when crouded together.(2) Be this as it may for I know not how it be, when Gentlemen recommend an A or B a Foreign Gentleman of great merit to receive a Commission far above any which he had formerly enjoyed it is natural, and Your Excellencys Candour will admit that it is also just, for other Gentlemen to produce in contrast the merits of American Officers in the Army who are and must be content to wait for grade until they shall be entitled to advancement in due course.  When it is urged that French Gentlemen have come a long Voyage and at great expence to serve the United States the reply without observing that the Act was voluntary is that many of our American Officers have abandoned their Homes, all their domestic happiness, the education of their Children, the improvement of their fortunes &c. &c. and in the course of three years hard duty have advanced gradation to the heighth of Captain or Major and have the mortification of being commanded by Gentlemen who had held Lieutenancies in their Native Country, and who were promoted here after one battle to Lieutenant Colonels, Colonels, and in some instances As it is said to higher ranks-such opposition my dear Marquis, is not to be answered by an ingenious mind. Your Excellency must not think me from these observations less devoted to your serv- JULY 18, 1778  ice upon every occasion in which your own impartiality and wise discernment shall be pleased to command.  The Marquis de Vienne is so polite as to afford me the present opportunity of Paying my respects to your Excellency and at the same time of acknowledging the receipt of your Excellencys favor of the 15th Instant.(3) Conscious of being greatly in arrears, I am grieved that I cannot go back to several Letters which your Excellency has lately honored me with, and which require such notice as my present circumstances will not allow me to go into. Surely I shall be Blessed with one day in the course of next week which may be applyd to a serious review of the Marquis de la Fayette's Letters, I will embrace the first leisure hour for this purpose. I know I am immensely in debt, I do not want candour to acknowledge, and I trust Your Excellency will find that I am not deficient in honesty to pay to the utmost of my abilities. At present indulge me Dear Sir, in confining myself to that which lies immediately before me.  I have the satisfaction to assure Your Excellency that from the first moment we were apprized of the arrival of Count d'Estaings squadron on this coast, Congress have vigorously pursued every measure for facilitating and effectuating the Vice Admirals operations against the Enemy. We were not unmindful of the great utility of Advice Boats-but alass! such are not to be built in so short a time as we can write the name, and you well know Sir, the Enemy while they had possession of this river stretched an unsparing firebrand over all our navigation which they could reach and could not carry off, consequently they have left us very little, and none of the sorts which you allude to. I have great hopes that Count d'Estaing will find means for supplying himself with necessary Vessels for contingent services upon the Coast and within the Harbour of New York. In the mean time Congress will in every respect contribute to his success and the mutual honor and benefit of the Alliance.  But here comes Alarquis Vienne and indeed has been waiting half an hour in the Audience Room, theres for you Dear Marquis. I am not quite so squeezed up as at York Town where Miss Katy and your Humble Servant lay within very narrow bounds and without the smallest breach of decorum. Yes Sir, I have now what Mr. Burgoyne could not obtain in America, a little Elbow room. How happy should I be to be honored with the Company of the Marquis de la Fayette at the consumption of a great Turtle tomorrow in addition to Monsr. Girard &c. &c.-but I flatter myself the time will soon come, when without impeachment of honor or danger to the State Your Excellency may sit quietly under the Roof of Your Excellencys much obliged &c.

Upon a very cursory view of the performance I pronounced it exceedingly childish and a little insolent. The opinion of Congress will be seen in a transcript of their Act upon this occasion, which will be also inclosed. I think I can guess what Your Excellency's opinion will be. You see Sir, it is to be published, and therefore it is wholly at Your Excellency's disposal.(1)  When Congress were on the point of adjourning, Your Excellencys' Letter of the 17th was brought in to me, and I immediately presented it to the House, but I received no order, therefore I speak to it only private. Your Excellency's opinion respecting common Lands will have my simple voice, provided we agree in the necessary preliminary Lines.(2)  The Inclosed Courier de L'Europe (3) was sent to my Lodge, intended as I have learned for Doctor Witherspoon who had promised to say Grace for me at Dinner today, but went suddenly out of town. I have a right to convey it to the Dr. through the best Channel, this will Answer two good purposes.  Believe me Sir, I continue with the most perfect Esteem and Regard, Your Excellencys' &c.  ""

I am in possession of sufficient matter, but time, precious time, has flown from me and left but a moment to intimate that I have particularly requested His Excellency the President to communicate to you the whole of my transmissions to him.

Gerard that it is altogether unnecessary to urge Your Excellency to give these dispatches the quickest safe passage to the Vice Admiral.  Prizes are finding the way into Delaware, one laden with Rum, Limes &c. intended for the Enemy's refreshment embraced one of our Wharves the Evening before last & I learn a Rich Ship is on her way up.  I have this moment Received a second Letter from the British Commissioners. If I dared to venture an opinion from a very cursory reading of the performance, it would be that this is more puerile than any thing I have seen from the other side, since the commencement of our present dispute, with a little dash of insolence, as unnecessary as it will be unavailing. If the Marquis de Vienne will indulge me till I return from Congress Your Excellency will find a Copy of that Letter within this. At present as he is on the Wing I must send to obtain his permission & in order to be quite ready in case he shall refuse to wait, conclude this with respected assurances  JULY 18, 1778  of being, with the highest Esteem & Respect, Dear sir, Your Excellency's Obliged & Obedient, humble servant,  Henry Laurens, Private.

  Dear Dennis Philad. July 19, 1778 The Inspection which this Letter may probably undergo will restrain me from answering fully yours received by Gov. Johnstone.(1) The Sentiments it contain'd are in my Opinion not unworthy your Character as a Friend to America or a Patriot of Brittain, but as the Passions of Men on both Sides the Atlantick are highly fermented, I have only made such Use of it as a prudential Regard to all Circumstances would require. The Object of it both at the Time of writing & ever since has been unattainable. America will endure the Extremity of human Woe before she will ever submit to the Sovereignty of that Power which has so oppressed, insulted & distress'd her. My Opinion is with my Countrymen fully upon this Point & therefore I cannot give the Commissioners the smallest Encouragement. To a Heart so open, candid, & generous as yours I do not wonder that the Professions of great Men apply with greater Efficacy than they ought. The Voice of Peace is soothing to a humane Mind, but a Peace which does not at least promise permanent Tranquillity by being founded on mutual Interest or reciprocal Affection has nothing which can attract the Wishes of a wise Man. We rnay possibly forgive you the Injuries we have received but it is not in your Power to forgive us. You must be sensible that you have given us Cause of such lasting Enmity that you neither can nor ought to trust us. But I am entering upon a Subject which I had determined to avoid. As I have not nor shall see Governor Johnstone in his publick Character I shall only say that his Attachment to our Cause had very much endeared to this Country & I should feel a real Concern if he should be found to be one in the long List of Apostates from Virtue & publick Honour which have blackned the English History for 50 Years past. If any Thing could sanctify the insidious Manuoevre the Agency in it of such Characters would do it, but we are got far beyond the Influence of private Characters. Measures not Men are attended to & if the whole Knot of illustrious Characters who have so ably contended for our Rights & those of Mankind had landed on this Shore with the same Terms they would have met with the same inauspicious Reception. I had answered very shortly Govr. Johnstones Letter before some Transactions were disclosed which give too much Reason to suspect he has deviated from that Line of Integrity which adorns a publick Character. The Touch of Corruption has been tried under his Auspices, & to the eternal Honour of my Country as well as Reproach to the Seducer without the least Success. You know the Correspondence I held with Ld. Dartmouth before these unhappy Contests & with what honest Sincerity I warn'd him of the Consequences of those fatal Measures. I have not lost all Affection for England nor Feeling for my Friends in it. I would therefore urge them JULY 19, 1778  by every Motion dear to the human Heart to lose no Time in closing the Scene of Blood on the only practicable Terms of a foederal Union. A thousand Circumstances concur to give you a great Share of our Trade, our Remittances in my Opinion will be better than formerly & we are not so fond of War as to continue it one Moment beyond the severest Necessity. You have made a sufficient Sacrifice of human Blood & Treasure on the Altar of false Dignity-the farther you proceed the more disgraceful will be your Fall-for nothing short of Omnipotence can now check the rising Glory of this Western World. Your truest Policy is therefore to call Home your Fleets & Armies, acknowledge our Independance & as you have been such unfortunate Gamesters Try now for a saving Game of your Islands in the West Indies & your Debts in this Country.  Now as to private Affairs-your Situation as to Mr. Thompson has given me much Concern. From the Situation of the two Countries it was impossible to make your Remittances, & our not being possessed of the Deeds is an insuperable Bar to our drawing the least Benefit from the Purchase.(2) In the Year 1775 I remember I desired you to forward them to Barbados but I have never heard that it was done. I wish you had taken the Advantage of the Oppy. by Govr. Johnstone as he sent me all your Packets with great Politeness unopened. I must now repeat my Request that you would either by conveying Duplicates to France to be forwarded hither or by some other Oppy. enable us to relieve you from your Embarassment. In the mean Time you may rely upon it that every possible Step will be pursued for this Purpose. The Dutch will undoubtedly preserve a Neutrality, perhaps you could get them conveyed to some Dutch Island or to St. Croix where the Name of Willing & Morris is well known & much respected.  I have now intirly taken Leave of the Army having had another Escape on the 28th June in the Battle of Monmouth when my Horse was again shot under me, & have taken my Seat in Congress of which I have been a Member now more than a Year. I have also been strongly sollicited to accept of the Government of this State to which I can be unanimously appointed, but now the Liberties of my Country are secured & its Independance established my Ambition & present Intentions are to remain a private Citizen & attend to the Advancement of my Family & Fortune both which have been neglected while I attended to the publick Interests. I wrote you so fully the State of my Family in my last(3) that I need say no more than that they are well & remain in their Country Situation till the Fall. Your Mother & Sister were made very happy by yours & Sirs. D B's. Letters & could they have availed themselves of this Oppy. would have said every Thing tender & affectionate to you both. The Intrest we take in your Happiness must naturally excite the most pleasing Sen-  sations to see you thus possessed of one of the finest Means of it-for after all it is  The cordial Drop which Heaven in our Cup has thrown To make the nauseous Draught of Life go down.  The great Events which have happened in this Country within a few Weeks will I hope e'er long open a surer & more frequent Channel of Correspondence, which I doubt not you will improve as I need not say that we wish to hear from you as frequently as possible. In Consequence of your Letter I have received from Mr. Miller 4800 Dolls. Continental Money which he reckons at 4/6 Stirlg. making in that Case £1080 Stg. but as that is not the current Exchange I have only given him a Receipt for so many Continental Dollars. In the Uncertainty of the Payment of British Debts & a general Opinion that at most they are only Debts of Honour I did not chuse to return the Money but rather to leave it to future Settlement, for it is certain that it would take 19,200 Dollars to purchase £1080 Stg. At all Events by this Mode you cannot lose your whole Debt & if a better Mode takes Place with others I will endeavour to avail myself of it-if not you must submit. I shall put it into our Funds in your Name & keep the Certificates by me subject to your Order.  I am much grieved at the Account you give me of my Brother John. Aware of his Failings I put him into a Line of Duty & Expence which I supposed he had sufficient Capacity for, but as he has no Fortune & is only a half Brother I do not mean to subject myself to a fruitless Expence in attempting to raise what I fear is naturally groveling & low. I shall therefore be glad you would if possible fall upon such Measures for preventing any farther Expence as you think most effectual & not suffer him to contract Debts unauthorized upon the Presumption of my Payment on Acct. of his Connection. I have educated him & done all in my Power to enable him to provide for himself, all at a considerable Expence & with very little Prospects of his Advancement in the World. My own Family now has its Demands upon me which I must comply with.  You desire me to pay your Mamma 10 Guineas which I will do as soon as I can procure them, but they are now in this Country as Medals in yours-not to be procured but at a great Expence of our Paper as you may judge by the Rate of Exchange. As she does not therefore stand in any immediate Want of any Thing & every Day appreciates our Paper in which my Money lays I will do it whenever she requires it.  As this is an unexpected Oppy. I have wrote in great Haste & in many Places I fear scarcely legibly which in such Case you will excuse.  Every kind Wish & most affectionate Regard attend you & Dr. Mrs. DBerdt from Yours most sincerly, JR  P.S. The Messenger waiting a little longer I take up my Pen again to advise you to lose no Time in making such Arrangement of your Affairs as will enable you to profit from the future Trade to this Country it will be very great & very lucrative. The first Step will be to establish as far as Circumstances will permit a Connection in the several trading Cities in Europe especially in France, Spain, Holland & Portugal which will give you Weight & Credit here. And if availing yourself of whatever Knowledge you could procure of the pacifick Intentions of your Court & leading to a Settlement of the Dispute you could send out a parcel of Goods chiefly Woollens, hard Ware & Manchester Manufacturies & to arrive as early as possible directed to my Order it might produce you something very handsome. If you have any Doubts I will take equal Risque with you-for tho my Profession has not been of much Service to me lately-my Fortune has not been impaired by the War but otherwise from Circumstances not within the Compsass or Propriety of a Letter.(4)  ""

  My dear sir Philada. July 20 1778 (1) Last Saturday a Letter was brought into Congress from the British Commissioners. You have it in the inclosd News Paper with a short Resolution upon it.(2) This shuts the Door and it will remain shut till they will be pleasd to open it again. Governor Johnston has acted so base a Part as to hint the offer of Bribes to the President and every other Member of Congress, as well as the General, as you will see in the printed Letter to Mr. R. Morris. By this he has in my Opinion forfeited the Character of an honest Man and exposed himself to  JULY 20, 1778  the just Comtempt of the World.(3) I hope some Strictures will be made in the News Papers on this, as well as the disrespectful and even insolent Language in the Commissioners Letters, not so proper to be noticed by Congress. I have lately been well assured that a Bribe of ten thousand Guineas has been offerd to a Gentleman of Station & Character here. He refusd it, as you might well suppose, with proper Resentment, telling the Lady who negociated this dirty Business, that the British King was not rich enough to purchase him.(4)  Mr D,(5) of whom I may hereafter have much to say to you, is arrivd with the Sieur Gerard. I have long ago made up my Opinion of the American Commissioner, & have not yet alterd it. That of the French Minister is a sensible prudent Man, not wanting in political Finesse, and therefore not to be listend to, too implicitly. The French Squadron lies off Sandy Hook. I have inclosd the Names & Rates of the Ships that compose it; together with those of the British Ships in the Harbour of N York as deliverd to the Marine Committee by a Prisoner lately escaped from thence. Their Force bears no Proportion to each other. I am told that this is a favorite Expedition of Count DEstaing himself, proposd by him (6) to the French Court, and that his Reputation depends upon the Issue of it. What Foundation there is for this, I do not know. From the Character of this Admiral, I make no Doubt he will fully answer the reasonable Expectations of the King his Master and of America. Mr. Ds political and commercial Friends, some of whom I suppose are in Boston, are disposd to give him great Eclat, on Account of the Aid afforded us in sending this Squadron. His Interest is represented as having been very forceable in procuring it, and the News Papers mention the Tokens of great Respect shown to him by the King & his Ministers at Versailes. The Truth, as I conceived it is, The total Overthrow of Burgoyns Army was an Event which it was thought, would produce Overtures from Britain, and France was apprehensive of our listening to Terms and compromising Matters. Hence it was, more than from any other Cause or the Interest of any Individual, that a Treaty was facilitated and agreed to; and to secure us in their Alliance and support us in our Independence was, I suppose, their Intent in sending this Squadron as well as the Purpose of Mr Gerards Mission.(7)  I have not yet answerd your Letter of the 26th of June. I declind it until I could assure you that the Sum you wishd for, for the Use of your Department, was granted.(8) I now have the Pleasure of acquainting you, that it is done and the Money will be orderd on as soon as it arrives here from York Town, which is every hour expected.(9) I am in Pain about the Ship in your Harbour. Her Owners neglect to put her into Repair, and I fear, some of her officers for Want of Skill and Experience will be at a Loss what to do with her  if she should meet with a Storm. What a Pity it is that an honest old Pilot, who used to steer successfully through Rocks and Quicksands has lately been dischargd from Service! And that he should suffer this hard Usage, only because unknown to him, One who was a hearty well wisher to the Voyage, and was anxious that Capacity and Merit should always govern Promotions, had ventured to declare him the fittest Man to take the Command, when it was thought a Commander would be wanted. Vanity and Avarice, which create an insatiable Desire of Places and Preferment, without Ability or Intention to fulfill the Duties of them, if gratified, would effect the Ruin of a Country. It would be the Glory of the American Republick, to find Men having no ruling passion but the Love of our Country, and ready to render her the most arduous Services, with the Hope of no other Reward in this Life, but the Esteem of their Virtuous Fellow Citizens. But this, some tell us, is to wish for more than it is in the Power of human Nature to give.  I find Mr Dana an excellent Member of Congress. He is a thorough Republican, and an able Supporter of our great Cause. I am satisfied it would be for the great Benefit of our Country if you and he were to form an intimate Connection with each other. This I am the more desirous of, because I have no Idea of your being long secluded from the publick Councils. He will go home shortly.  Adieu My Friend. S A.  P.S. I shall take it as an Act of Kindness if you will call on Mrs A & let her know I am well-not having Leisure to write to her by this Post.  ""

  Hond. Sir Philadelphia July 20th 1778 I have Received your favor of the 3d Inst. This Day with the order of the Committee of Safety to Mr Wentworth & my Self to apply to Congress for Two Hundred Thousand Dollars in behalf of our State, And will take the Earliest oppertunity to lay the Same before Congress.(1) JULY 20, 1778  The Enormous Sums of money it takes to Supply the army & navy at the present advanced price of things, and the great Desire of Congress to avoid as much as possible the Emission of more bills of Credit, will I fear retard the Business, and perhaps lessen the Sum granted, But I shall use my best Endeavors that the Requisition may be Complied with.  The former commissions and instructions for armed vessels being Judged very Defective, The Congress some time ago appointed a Committee to make a new Draft & lay it before the Congress for their approbation, but by reason of the multiplicity of Business, it has not yet been Done; as soon as any are printed, I will Endeavor to send some forward to our State.(2)  I am sorry to inform you, that Mr Wentworth is not yet arrived here from York Town; He was taken Sick about the 20th of June with a fever & a Bilious vomiting & purging, Remained bad about ten Days, and occasioned my tarrying with him till the 2nd Inst. when I left him better, and was in hopes to have seen him here before this time, But I was Just now informed by Secratary Tompson's Lady who left York Town last Wednesday, That a few Days after I left him, He had a Relapse, but was again better before she left the place.  The Confederation is agreed to by all the States, Except New Jersey, Delaware & Maryland, and I have Signed it in Behalf of our State, but as the Power to Ratify was Given to the Delegates in Congress, I have some Doubt (as have some others) whether my Signing it is a Sufficient Ratification notwithstanding our appointment authorises us severally to Represent the State in Congress, and if Mr Wentworth should not be able to Come here soon & sign it, I Earnestly Request the State to give some order about it.  As I am informed that the Legislature of our State is to meet the Begining of next month, I Desire their attention to the appointment of Delegates to meet in the new Congress that is to be Convened the first Monday in November, agreable to the Confederation: and I would Beg leave to Remind them, that after that time no State Can be Represented by less than two Delegates at a time in Congress, so that if two Delegates only are Sent, and Sickness or any other misfortune should prevent the attendance of one of them in Congress (as has unhapily been the case most of the time since my arrival) the State will have no vote.  Your answer to several letters sent by the President of Congress to our State has been Receivd & read, and I am glad to be informed by you that in future all such letters will Receive an answer as soon as may be after their Receipt.(3)  I am Sensible Sir, that the present Plan for the Government of our State is in nothing more defective than in the want of a proper Executive power whose Duty it should be to Receive & answer all   letters sent to the State, and see its good Laws Carried into Execution: Ours is the only State in the union (I Believe) who are destitute of such a power and I sincerely hope our Convention will take proper care of that very necessary & important article in their Plan for the future Government of the State.  I am with greatest Esteem & Respect, your most obedient Servant, Josiah Bartlett  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 20th 1778 Since I wrote you last week nothing very material has happened. Mons Girard has informed Congress that the King his master, has left it to Congress to receive him as Minister Plenipotentiary or as a simple resident; that he had two commissions and would produce that which would be most agreeable; that it was expected our Ministers at their Court would be entrusted with the same commission we should choose to receive Mr Girard in; signifying at the same time, that it was the wish of the French Court he should be received as Minister Plenipotentiary, as it would be doing more honor to these States, and would be entrusted with greater powers, which would be a great advantage at the distance the two States were from each other and he likewise requested a public audience as soon as convenient. The Congress have agreed to receive him as Minister Plenipotentiary but the adjusting the ceremonial has taken some time and is not yet agreed on, nor the day appointed. Beside he will be rec'd in the State House which was left by the enemy in a most filthy situation and the inside torn much to pieces and is now cleansing and repairing for the purpose.  Mons Girard is appointed Consul General for the United States, with power to appoint others under him at the several respective ports. The conduct of the French Court at this time, the several letters from the French King to Congress and the behavior of Mons Girard seems to indicate a greater degree of sincerity in that Nation than my prejudices formerly allowed them. In short I believe they design to attach us firmly and fully to their interest hereafter. JULY 20, 1778  Last Saturday we rec'd another letter from the British Commissioners dated at New York the 11th inst: they seem much dissatisfied with our answer to their former letter, dispute our authority to make treaties, demand to know the nature of the treaties we have entered into, intimate that we are not the representatives of the people and threaten to submit to the people at large to judge between the Congress and them. The Congress resolved that as the Commissioners had not complied with the terms we had laid down in our answer to their last, no answer ought to be given to this and ordered it to be published. If it comes out before the post goes out, I will try to send it for your perusal. Sundry letters rec'd by private members from the Commissioners are ordered to be printed, which will I think convince the world (if it is not already convinced) of the meaness and depravity of the Commissioners. They have not only in a polite manner in some of their letters hinted at bribes to be given to bring their purposes to pass, but have actually (by means of a woman in this City) offered ten thousand guineas to one of the members of Congress and any office he should choose, for his assistance in carrying their plan of reconciliation into effect. Probably similar offers have been made other persons who may not yet have informed of it.  As the Commissioners are now to apply to the people at large, since they find they have nothing to hope for from Congress, probably the leading men in the different States may have an offer of some of their gold; So you had best prepare yourself for the attack.  The French fleet have taken a number of British vessels and are sending the prisoners by land to this city and the French Minister has requested Congress to provide for them which cost he will pay.  I am Sir, your friend and humble servant,  Josiah Bartlett ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia July 20th 1778 The condition of our affairs is much changed since last I had the pleasure of writing to you, as by the favor of his Most Christian Majesty we now are become Masters of the Sea, on our own Coast at least. Ten days ago arrived in the Delaware a French Squadron commanded by Count D'Esteing consisting of 12 sail of the Line and 4 frigates, having of Seamen and land Troops 11,000 Men on board. There is one Ship of 90 guns, one of 80, 6 of 74, three of 64 and 4 frigates. Having missed the English here, they have proceeded to N. York in quest of them, and are now before that Harbour, the depth of water being unfortunately insufficient to admit such large Ships. The English, whose fleet is inferior, are well contented to remain within the Narrows, and suffer Monsr. the Count to intercept every Vessel coming to N. York. He has already taken 15 Sail. But the French Admiral being an Officer of great activity and spirit, he seems not content with this small work, and therefore I believe he will go immediately to R. Island where he can easily destroy the Ships, and with the assistance of our force there, make prisoners of 2000 British Troops on that Island. With this Squadron came Le Sieur Gerard Minister Plenepotentiary from his most Christian Majesty. He is a sensible well bred Man, and perfectly well acquaint with the politics of Europe. From him I learn that the Court of France consider the Message of the King of England to his Parliament and their answer, upon the Count Noailles notification of our Alliance, as a denunciation of War on the part of G. Britain, and that they mean to Act accordingly, without an express declaration, leaving this last to England. We are busied now in settling the Ceremonials for the reception of foreign Ministers of every denomination. And I assure you it is a work of no small difficulty. When this is finished, Monsr. Gerard will have his audience in Congress-I suppose this week.(1) Gen. Washington has crossed the N. River, and will cooperate with the Admiral in Measures to be concerted against the Common enemy. The B. Commissioners have sent us a second letter, very silly, and equally insolent. The preleminaries insisted on by Congress (an acknowledgement of Independence or a withdrawing of their fleets and Armies) not having been either of them complied with, this letter is to receive no answer. We have detected  JULY 20, 1778  and fully exposed Govr. Johnstone, who under the plausible guise of friendship and Virtue, has endeavored to bribe Members of Congress-The whole body indeed as well as individual Members. The confederation is ratified by 10 States, (2) there remains only Jersey, Delaware and Maryland; but I suppose their obstinacy will e'er long submit to their interest, and a perfect coalition take place. I am, much hurried, tho with great esteem, dear Sir your most obedient Servt, Richard Henry L[ee]  ""

To them that behave well in this World, the next will be a World of Happiness indeed-but to such as do ill here, it will be a world of everlasting Torment. God grant that when we have all left this World, we may not be parted from each other in the World to come; but that all, Father and Mother, Brother and Sisters, may meet together, never to part again, but live a whole Eternity with God and Christ-with Abraham, Isaac & Jacob, and all other good Men & Women and Children who have gone there before us. Remember that God hates a Lye, and every thing that is dishonest-and that you must always be chearful and willing to do your Duty to God and Man, and to your Parents and to love one another and all good People, and that you must try to perswade naughty Children to behave better and to quit all their wicked words and ways, if they would ever expect to be happy.  I was pleased to see Billys Mark, He will in good Time I hope learn to write his Name. I wish Miss Sally & Betsy may begin to learn him his Letters, and how to spell. Betsy I think minds her Hand-and I think considering the Length of the Letter Miss Sally needed no Appology. I have shewn the Letter with great Pleasure and it is much admired. There was but two or three Words misspelt, and one or two Errors in Grammar, and which I am sure Miss Sally could correct herself if She had had Time to look it over again. For Instance She spelt the word School-Skool. Miss Sally has been very industrious to have read the Books She mentions twice over. I rejoice that She does not forget her Bible-her Catechism & Prayers. I am glad to find Mr. Pemberton has been with and that he kindly advises you. I will agree with him, that You may not make a Task of your Grammar. Indeed my dear Child I know you love your Book so well, that I think it needless you should task yourself with any Book. I think a good and edifying Book will never be a Task to Miss Sally, I hope it will not with Miss Betsy. A little Exercise in Cyphering now and then I think is very well. I am also pleased that You take such Notice of the Business of the Farm, and that you are able to give me so good an Account of it.  Your Curiosity is excited to know the Meaning of the Tow upon some of the Trees. I got some small Twigs from Trees of another Sort of Apples and Pears and cut off a Limb and stuck the small Twiggs into it, to grow, and wrapt the Tow & Clay round to keep  JULY 21, 1778  the Rain out. Mr. Webster will explain it to you further if you ask him.  Are you like to have a good many Pears, Peaches, and Apples? have you any Currants? And how have You been for Strawberries, huccleberries and Blackberries? I hope I shall continue to receive Letters from You. We have a Gentleman from France called a Plenipotentiary, that is, having full Powers and Authority from the King of France to join with us, his advice and to assist us against Our Enemies-And the King of France has also sent us a great many large Ships, to assist in taking the British Ships & People, and to drive them away from this good Land which Heaven gave to Our Fore-Fathers, and to us their Children, and which the King of England and his wicked People have been endeavouring to take from Us-And I hope by the Blessing of God that We shall by & by have Peace thro' all this Country, and that you may live to grow up and enjoy it with Thankfulness to God, and never forget what great Things the Lord hath done for You.

  Dear Sir(1) Philadelphia 21st July 1778 As I have not had the pleasure of a line from you since I left London in October 1774, I know nothing more of my Account than appears in the state which you delivered to me while I was with you, except that the Ship Heart of Oak had been sold and one fourth part of the Amount passed to my Credit. The former balance 1/4 of the ships value together with growing Interest according to my computation will Amount upward of £850 Sterling.  You cannot have forgot the motives which induced me to leave a balance in your hands for a considerable time before I left England as well as at the time of my departure. You had repeatedly intimated to me that the use of the Money would be a convenience to you and you know I had another friend who would have been equally glad to have had the little deposit lodged in his hands, but delicacy towards you forbad my drawing it out of yours. The same consideration for you has restrained me from securing myself and giving your honor or Credit the smallest wound by means which have been often practised on both sides the water. I reflected that the use of such means being extreamly expensive in these times would also give a deep wound to your Purse.  The time is come when I find it convenient to myself to draw for a part of the sum which I suppose stands to my Credit in your Books. I have therefore under the present date passed a Bill on you payable at thirty days sight to the Order of Sarah Yard for eight hundred & ten pounds to which you will give due honor, and pay the whole,(2) if the balance due to me extends so far or so much of it as my said balance will reach, and send the remainder of the whole as you shall judge proper to determine to my friend William Manning Esquire, who I am sure will find means for shewing my Draft compleat honor, but I dare not indulge a thought so injurious to your Character as a Man of Honor and gratitude as that you will send the bills out of your own house, even admitting it shall appear I have overdrawn a few Pounds. The time is not very far distant when a free correspondence will be opened between your kingdom and these Confederated United States. In the mean time let our whole conduct distinguish between private mutual faith and honor, and the necessary unavoidable Acts of authorized public seizures and hostilities. I have been tenacious on my part in all my proceedings during this little War to avoid every Act which might prove a Bar to a revival of those happy friendships in Great Britain which I had long enjoyed.

  To the EARL of CARLISLE. My Lord, [July 21, I778] As you, in conjunction with your brother Commissioners, have thought proper to make one more fruitless negociatory essay, permit me, through your lordship, once more to address the brotherhood. It is certainly to be lamented that gentlemen so accomplished should be so unfortunate. Particularly, my Lord, it is to be regretted that you should be raised up as the topstone to a pyramid of blunders.  On behalf of America I have to intreat that you will pardon their Congress for any want of politeness in not answering your letter.(1) You may remember, that in their last letter they stated certain terms as preliminaries to a negociation.(2) And I am sure your lordship's candor will do them the justice to acknowledge that they are not apt to tread back the steps they have taken. In addition to this it so happens that they are at present very indifferent whether or not your King and Parliament acknowledge their independency; and still more indifferent as to withdrawing his fleets and armies.  You mistake the matter exceedingly when you suppose that any person in America wishes to prolong the calamities of war. No, my lord, we have had enough of them in all conscience. But the fault lies on you or your master, or some of the people he has about him. Congress when Sir William Howe landed on Staten-Island, met him with their Declaration of Independence. They adhered to it in the most perilous circumstances. They put their lives upon the issue; nay their honor. Now in the name of common sense how can you suppose they will relinquish this object in the present moment?  I am fully of your lordship's opinion, when you decline any dispute with Congress, about the meaning of the term Independence. They would have infinite advantage over you logically, but what is worse, they are politically in capacity to put upon the term just what construction they please: Nay, my lord, eventually Great-Britian must acknowledge just such an independence as Congress think proper; they are now in the full possession and enjoyment of it. How idle in you to talk of insuring or enlarging what is out of your power and cannot be encreased.  You give two reasons for not withdrawing your fleets and armies. JULY 21, 1778  The first is, that you keep them here by way of precaution against your ancient enemies. Really, my Lord, I was at a loss for some time to comprehend the force of this reasoning, or how a body of men in this country and a large fleet could protect you against an invasion from France. And I am even now perhaps mistaken, when I suppose your sea and land forces have been kept here to draw the attention of your enemies to this quarter, and leave their coast exposed, that so you may have an opportunity of invading France. If this was the object, it hath had the desired effect. Your armies are doubtless assembled in readiness for the descent, which, considering the unprovided state of that country, cannot but prove successful; and therefore I congratulate your lordship on the fair prospect you enjoy of seeing your Sovereign make his triumphant entry through the gates of Paris.  Your second reason for staying here is to protect the Tories. Pray, my lord, ease your mind upon that subject. Let them take care of themselves. The little ones may be pardoned whenever they apply. The great ones have joined you from conscientious or from interested motives. The first in having done what they thought right will find sufficient comfort. The last deserve none. I offer you this consolation, my lord, because we both know that you cannot protect the tories, and because there is every reason to believe that you cannot protect yourselves.  You have, it seems, determined your judgment by what you conceive to be the interest of your country, and you propose to abide by your declarations in every possible situation. I rather imagine that you are determined by your instructions; but if otherwise, surely, my lord, you are not to learn that circumstances may materially alter the interest of your country and your conceptions of it. The decision of some military events which you did not wait for, would put you in a situation to speak to Congress in much more decent terms than those contained in your last letter.  But you want to know, my lord, what treaties we have entered into. In pity to your nerves Congress have kept this knowledge. It will make the boldest among you tremble. As we are not about to negociate at present, there is no need of the communication. However, to satisfy your curiosity as far as an individual can, I pray you to recollect, that the Marquis de Noailles told you his Court, when they formed an alliance with America, had taken eventual measures.(3) You cannot but know that a French fleet is now hovering on the coast near you-draw your own conclusions, my lord.  It is a most diverting circumstance to hear you ask Congress what power they have to treat, after offering to enter into treaty with them, and being refused. But I shall be glad to know by what authority you call on them for this discovery. The Count de Vergennes had a right to it, but the Earl of Carlisle certainly has not. Let me   add, my lord, that in making the request there is a degree of asperity not suited to your situation. When you were in the arms of victory we pardoned an insolence which had become habitual to your nation. We shall revere it if preserved when you are reduced to the lowest pitch of wretchedness. But in the present moment, when you certainly cannot terrify, and have not suffered so as to deserve pity, such language is quite improper. And it forces from me certain facts which I am sorry to mention, as they shew your masters to be wicked beyond all example.  When they found that an alliance was actually on the carpet between his Most Christian Majesty and these States, they offered to cede a part of the East-Indies, to give equal privileges in the African trade, and to divide the fisheries, provided they might be at liberty to ravage America. And when that would not do, they told the French Ministry that it was absurd to treat with Congress; that they were faithless; nay, that the bargain was actually struck for the purchase of America, and money, to the amount of half a million, sent over to pay the price. These, my lord, are facts-facts which will hang up to eternal infamy the names of your rulers.(4) The French, my lord, laughed at the meanness and falshood of these declarations. But they suffered themselves to appear to be deceived. They permitted you to flounder on in the ocean of your follies and your crimes. You and your brethren, I find, are directed to play the same game here; to call our allies faithless; to tell an hundred incoherent fictions about our treaties, the substance of which you confess yourselves at this moment ignorant of. And what is the very complication of absurdity, you pretend to tell Congress the manner in which the negociations were carried on, when Mr. Deane, the principal negociator, on their part, is on the spot to give information. For shame. For shame. It is for these reasons that Congress treat you with such utter contempt.  There is but one way left to sink you still lower, and, thank God you have found it out. You are about to publish! Oh my lord! my lord! you are indeed in a mighty pitiful condition. You have tried fleets and armies, and proclamations, and now you threaten us with news-papers.(5) Go on, exhaust all your artillery, But know, that those who have withstood your flattery and refused your bribes, despise your menaces-Farewell. When you come with better principles, and on a better errand, we shall be glad to meet you: Till that moment, I am your Lordship's most obedient And most humble servant, AN AMERICAN.(6)  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet and Daily Advertiser, July 21, 1778.  1 Morris is referring to the Carlisle commissioners' July 11 letter to Congress, for which see William Henry Drayton to the Carlisle Commissioners, July 18, 1778, note 1.  2 See Henry Laurens to the Carlisle commissioners, June 17, 1778-a letter Morris himself drafted.  3 See Henry Laurens to George Clinton, May 11, 1778, note 3.  4 Sometime near the end of 1777, according to a statement made by the French foreign minister Vergennes to the Spanish ambassador in Paris, count dsAranda, Great Britain offered to grant France, if French ports were closed to American shipping, Cape Bretons Nova Scotia, and a liberal share of the Newfoundland fisheries.

5767,dg010276,1778,New York Delegates to George Clinton,"""New York Delegates to George Clinton
  Sir, Philadelphia 21st July 1778. Just before we left York Town (in Conjunction with our Colleague Mr. Lewis) we moved for, and obtained from the Congress, an advance of 100,000 Dollars for the Use of the State, and for which they are to be accountable.(1) The Reasons were as follows: We found, by various Intelligence laid before Congress, that the Savages were about making an Irruption upon our Frontiers, & from the probable Evacuation of Philadelphia, it was not unlikely that the British General would again pursue his favorite Object of Hudson's River. In this Situation of Affairs, it appeared to us that money might be wanting in our Treasury, which we had Reason to believe was not very full; and, further, we were informed that our militia remained unpaid for Services formerly done, and, therefore, might not turn out with their usual Alacrity. These Things were laid before Congress, and they, (surprized at the moderation of a Demand which we venture to say from any other State in similar Circumstances would have been at least three Times as great), instantly made the Grant: The adjournment to Philadelphia, the Change of political Circumstances by the Battle of Monmouth, and arrival of the French Squadron (on both of which Incidents we heartily congratulate your Excellency) and the want of a safe Opportunity, have delayed the sending forward of the money.  We have further to observe to your Excellency, that the Com JULY 21, 1778  plaints of our Fellow Citizens who are unpaid by Commissaries, Quarter Masters and the like, have been laid before Congress; but unfortunately the Complaint is universal, &, therefore, it is objected that a general Remedy is necessary. In this Situation, we have it in View, to obtain a Recommendation to the State to liquidate and adjust those accounts, in like manner as their own accounts are liquidated and adjusted, and this money may be of Use in discharging them. Besides this, it is to be further observed that the Continent are very considerably indebted to our State, and the accounts will be settled with greater Ease full than empty handed. Mr. Duer would have gone forwards long ago, but Mr. Lewis was under the Necessity of going to Baltimore to bring up his Family, and the State would have been unrepresented if Mr. Duer had left this Place. We hope that the arrival of Genl. Schuyler or of Mr. Lewis will soon put it in his Power to return to the State.(2) We do ourselves the Honor to enclose to your Excellency, a Report brought in but never yet read upon our Vermont affairs.(3) We think it short of what is necessary, and shall, therefore, urge Congress to such amendments as may render it more equal to the Purposes proposed to be answered by it. It is possible, Sir, that our Constituents may be led to believe, that there hath been a Remissness in their Delegates in not urging this Business with a Degree of Rapidity which in their Opinion would have ill answered the wise Purposes of the application. Your last Letter on this Subject is now before us,(4) and we shall do ourselves the Honor to present it, as soon as the matters necessary to the audience of the French Minister shall be adjusted, which is not yet done, so dilatory are the Proceedings of our Body. The Presenting your Excellency's Letter, will afford a proper Opportunity to call for and urge the Report; the amendments to which will be, if within our Power such as are stated on the enclosed Paper. We are with greatest Respect Your Excellency's most obd't & humble Serv'ts.  Wm. Duer, Gouv'r Morris, ENCLOSURE (Copy)  The Committee to whom was referred the letter from Gov'r Clinton, of the 7th of April, A. D. 1778, with the Proclamation enclosed, take leave to report the following resolutions, viz:(5)  Resolved, that the independent government attempted to be established by the people styling themselves the inhabitants of Vermont cannot derive any countenance or authority from the Congress of the thirteen United States of America.  Resolved, that no number or body of people within any part of the United States can be justified in attempting to form & establish any new independent State within any part of these United States,  without the consent of the State or States in which they are & were included at the time the Congress were at first elected & convened for the Safety & defence of these United States, & the approbation of Congress.(6)  And it is recommended, in the Strongest terms, to the people aforementioned, & all other the good people of these United States & any particular State interested or claiming to be interested in the premises, to refrain from all acts of violence & coercive measures, as they regard the peace & welfare of these States.  The Committee who brought in this report were: Mr. Huntington, of Connecticut, Mr. J. B. Smith, of Pennsylvania, & Mr. Francis Lightfoot Lee, of Virginia.  Amendments intended to be proposed to the Report:  Resolved, that no man or body of men can of right on any territory within North America form or establish any State, (other than those which were called the British Colonies, Provinces, or Plantations in North America,) without the Special consent of that State within which such territory shall lie, & the approbation of Congress.  Resolved, that Congress do highly reprobate all attempts to set up, form, or establish any new State or government, as tending to break the Union of the States they represent, to produce civil wars, & to destroy the peace, freedom, & happiness of America.  Resolved, that Congress have not given & will not give any countenance or authority to the discontented subjects of the State of New York, Styling themselves the inhabitants of Vermont, but do disapprove of their proceedings.  Resolved, that it be most earnestly recommended to the persons aforesaid, forthwith to submit peaceably & quietly to the jurisdiction, government, & authority of the said State of New York, & that they represent unto the said government any grievances they may labor under.  Resolved, that the State of New York be requested to forbear, for the present, all coercive measures to compel the submission of their discontented subjects, & also, on a proper representation, to redress the grievances they labor under, if any there be.(7)  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 3:567-70.

But Philip Schuyler-whose March 25, 1778, election as an \""additional Delegate\"" was not noted by Burnett- did not attend Congress until 1779. Burnett, Letters, 3:1vi-lvii. An important reason for General Schuyler's delay was that he was yet awaiting the outcome of the   inquiry into his role in the loss of Fort Ticonderoga in 1777, the effect of which was discussed by James Duane in an August 22, 1778, letter to John Jay, See Jay, Papers (Morris), 1:492-93.  3 There is no evidence in the journals of when this report was submitted to Congress.  4 Governor Clinton's July 8 letter to the New York delegates on the \""late extraordinary Proceedings of the Government of the pretended State of Vermont in ordering Drafts to be made in that Quarter for filling up the Continental Regiment, commanded by Col.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 21st. 1778 I wrote to you the 15th Inst. by an express informing you, that by the Commission Col. Williams obtained it would require the three Delegates to be present before the State could have a Vote, and then indeed we must be all of one Opinion. As there are several Gentlemen here that represent the State they belong to singly, and as I proposed to our Assembly that they would choose four Delegates confining two to be here at a time, which was not done, the Members saying they would proceed the old way, I am induced to wish that your Excellency would send a Commission giving all or either of us a right to vote until November, when I think the confederation directs two (1) I mention this again lest some accident should happen to the Express.  Monsr. Gerard the French Minister is here, he is a very polite well bred man, Mr Deane says he has been our first friend in France. The French Fleet cannot get nearer to New York than Sandy Hook, on account of their size, they have lately taken thither Transports loaded with provisions going to Lord Howe. We had a curious letter from the Commissioners lately, calling upon us to know by what authority we presume to make treaties with the King of France, or any JULY 21, 1778  other foreign power, declaring we had no authority delegated to us for that purpose by the Assembly's of the different States, before or since the supposed confederation; the answer was short, \""that the British Fleet and Army not being sent away, nor the Independence of America acknowledged, no answer be given.\""(2) Enclosed is a News paper. I hope Sir you will forward a Commission by the first Opportunity as desired unless you find some express resolution to the Contrary, of the Assembly.

I had some Difficulty to prevent the Extracts from your Brothers Letter published in the same Paper.(1) You will perhaps wonder at this as supposing it contains nothing disadvantageous to him, but I assure you a very different Idea was entertained of it in Congress & I only got it withdrawn on the Plea of personal Favour. I hope my Disclosure of Govr.

We have no authentick Acct. of the Proceedings of the French Fleet at New York farther than that they cannot get into the Harbour for Want of Water. They take Prizes hourly of Vessels arriving from every Part of the World & a great Number of Prisoners are now on the Way to this City.  Mrs. Yard not remaining in Town,(3) after much Deliberation upon all Circumstances I have concluded to go into Mr. Cox's House which is now in my Possession with vvhat necessary Furniture Mrs. Yard spares me-to get Numa to keep a sort of Batchelor Table for me. My Reasons are that in the Ist Place it is very difficult to get  JULY 21, 1778  good Lodgings even at 30 Dollars per Week, the few Boarding Houses being extremely crowded. I pay Rent for this House if unocupied & as a Number of Persons are continually calling on Business of various Kinds I must have some Persons to give Answers. You when you come or any of the Family in the mean Time will have a House to come to. In short tho it may be somewhat more expensive it will be attended with Conveniences. Mr. Pettit is soon expected in Town who will also want such a Home.  Numa had done nothing with your Memorandum but I have since taken it in Hand-tho Prices are yet very extravagant but for your Comfort they are falling.  I wish to have my Books got down as Oppy. offer & for that Purpose would have you write to Mr. Forman that whenever he sends empty Waggons towds Trenton he would direct them to call upon you when you can occasionally forward the Books & such Articles as you do not want to Trenton where the Shallops can take them up.  I am in some Expectation of going to Camp to finish the Business which the moving of the Army interupted. If so I shall see you pretty soon. If not I fancy the Month will come round, but whether present or absent I am my dear Hetty's faithful & affect.  J. Reed P.S. I wonder Mr. Lowry does not come down.

  Sir Philadelphia 22d July 1778 The Arival of the French fleet added to the Battle of Monmouth seams to put our affairs upon a respectable Footing and Difuses a general Joy among the friendly Inhabitants of this City. However I must freely own I dont feel myself so compleatly flushd. upon this Occation as many do: I cant say but it may be attended with the happy Consiquences expected, but when I view the Matter upon a larger Scale sundry Questions suggest themselves for our Consideration. I was fully of Oppinion that the War was drawing to a speedy issue. I lookd. upon the present Campaign as the last & that we had before us every prospect of Success, and our Independe as fixd. Upon this View of the Case I would quere whither the arival of this Fleet will not be a Means of lenghtening out the War, and also lay us under an Obligation of affording France an armd. force in Case they Need it which as the Case may be circumstanced as to time, place &c may be very disagreable to our Northern people. Besides would it not be much to our Advantage had we settled the present Controversy in our favour without a foreign Aid.  Under such Ideas I have never been fond of the assistance of any foreign power. However I am no adept in Politicks, nor do I pretend to determine those Questions either Way. I only hint some things that have ever been upon my Mind & leave the Decission to abler Politians or future Time. Should be glad of your Sentiments upon those Matters.  The Seiur Gerard with Mr. Dean arived in this City (if I mistake not) the 12th instant;(1) he has not as wet been admitted to an Audience.

  Sir 22nd July 1778 I was honored with your favor of the 30th Ulto. three days ago.  Congress are not disposed to grant Marine Commissions for Vessels in distant States unless descriptions more special than those you left are laid before them; in order therefore to avoid as much as possible any disappointment to you and to promote the general Interest of the Allied Powers of France and these United States I shall transmit by this conveyance to His Excellency Governor Caswell a number of Commissions, Instructions and Bonds, from whence you may obtain so many as he shall judge proper.  From the conversation at York Town when you were going to Camp I had expected you would have received it at your return and that some Plan for your proceeding on a voyage in joint concern would have been reduced to writing, but as you did not even touch  JULY 23, 1778  upon the subject, I concluded you had determined your Affairs to go in some other Channel, and now a concern in the extent you mark, would not be convenient to me even if I were as much disposed as I was at York, because I had the very day before your Letter reached me agreed to draw for a considerable part of the Money I had lodged in England.(1) Besides I cannot venture to risque the good opinion of my friends by an attempt to persuade them into an Association where so large a sum as £6000 Sterling is required on their part, without having a Plan of particulars for their consideration. Hence Sir, you will after one moments reflection perceive how impossible it is for me to return a more direct answer-and will govern your future determinations accordingly.  We have received no certain account of a Declaration of War, but beyond all dispute hostilities are mutual between France and England, and captures made upon every occasion. Already the Count d'Estaing has taken a great number of British ships, and some he has destroyed, among them it is said five armed Vessels, and I know he is exceedingly chagrined, because he cannot get into Sandy Hook with his large ships. His intention was to have tried the powers of the English squadron under the command of Lord Howe at New York- failing in this place the Admiral is gone to Rhode Island, where he may play a smaller Game than he had aspired to-but will render much service to the common cause.  You perceive Sir, from this intelligence, which is the best I can give, that you are at liberty to enrich yourself from the spoils of the Enemy-an Enemy who a very little time ago panted for our destruction and had avowed their designs to accomplish it.  Accept my wishes for your prosperity, and believe me to be with great Regard, Sir, your Obedient Servant.  ""

  Dear Brother Philada. 23d July 1778 A few days ago I recieved a Letter from you informing me of your promotion to Surgeon of Col. Shrieve's Regiment. I am not at all surprized at the attempts to supplant you in that Birth. The numerous greedy appendants of the Army who are incessantly fawning upon the heads of every department and soliciting for every post that happens to become vacant, render immediate application & a resolute claim of right necessary in order to obtain that which is justly due to an honest and meritorious man. I hope you will use your endeavours to discharge the duties of your present Station faithfully, & JULY 23, 1778  to the general satisfaction of the particular Corps to which you belong.  The complaints of the Officers of the Army which you mention I acknowledge are in general but too well founded. But when you reflect upon the rapid progress of our political affairs, the multiplicity of business Congress have had to transact, & the many difficulties they have had to surmount; I am convinced you will readily percieve that Congress is often unjustly complained of. The depreciation of our paper Currency is irremediable at present, as it arises in a great measure from the superabundency of it in circulation. But as our affairs now begin to wear a smiling aspect, & as we are beginning to sink our bills of credit by Taxes, the value of our money will indubitably soon begin to appreciate. This in my opinion ought to afford some satisfaction to those who are at present sufferers in the service of their Country.  You inform me that your present situation renders it necessary for you to have a Horse. The price will undoubtedly be extravagant. I hope however you will have the good luck to get one that will answer your purpose on reasonable terms.  I have very little reason to believe that any new regulations respecting the medical department in the Army will take place this Campaign, Congress having too much business on hand of a more general & important nature to attend to that matter.  I remain (in haste), Yours &c, Jonathn. Elmer  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 23d July 1778 (1) As I have nothing public in charge for your Excellency I must request you Sir to indulge me in this private for the cover of six Marine Commissions, Instructions & Bonds, and of a letter to Capt Cottineau. The Captain applied to me in York Town for a Commission for his own ship, and for one or two which he said he intended to equip and to form a little squadron. Congress are not inclined to grant Commissions for vessels in distant States, unless special descriptions are previously laid before them. Your Excellency will be capable of judging of the propriety of Capt Cottineau's pretensions, and will act as you shall think for the benefit of the public. At this critical moment 'tis highly probable demands will be made on your Excellency for all that remains after Capt Cottineau shall be supplied.  I am told no less than twelve prizes lately taken are advertised for sale on Tuesday next at Egg Harbour. Vice Admiral Count d'Estaing has captured a much greater number at Sandy Hook, some  JULY 23, 1778  of them armed vessels, and some very valuable, but we have not learned particulars. The Admiral finding his large ships of too great a draught of water for the Bar of the Hook after lying several days in view of the British Squadron within, sailed as we are informed for Rhode Island where he must be content to play a smaller game than that which he originally had in view. If General Pigot and his Garrison shall be compelled to surrender, the thing will not be very inconsiderable .  I take the liberty of enclosing to your Excellency two of the latest news papers.  I am anxious that Congress should resolve to hold no conference with men who have dared to tempt them with bribes of Gold, and I trust that through the endeavours of some diligent Patriots in the House, those men will be compelled to return, the bearers of their own impeachment, will be held up to the severe resentments of their much injured Countrymen, and their names transmitted to posterity in characters which will render their memory infamous.  I have the honor to be with great esteem & respect, Sir, your Excellency's Obedient Servant. Henry Laurens.  ""

  Sir [July 23, 1778] In Conjunction with my Colleagues Duer & Lewis I lately obtained from Congress an Advance of 100,000 Dollars.(1) Mr. Duer has received the Money and will forward it by the first safe Opportunity. If I might at this Distance advise I would give my Opinion that A Law should be passed directing the Treasurer and auditor to pay all Demands by the Subjects of the State against the Continent untill such Day and under such Restrictions as might be most proper on a Consideration of all Circumstances. Then the Continent being made Debtor in our general Accounts with all Monies advanced for them & receiving Credit for the Sums they have advanced & for our Quota of Taxes a Ballance might be struck & if against us paid. By these Means a very considerable Sum would either remain in the Treasury to sink our Emissions or at least be in the Hands of our People to pay future Taxes & furnish themselves with the foreign Articles necessary for them and which Nothing but that can obtain. After all this should there be still which I rather wish than Expect a considerable Sum in the Treasury it might perhaps be properly lent to the Continent. I hope that the Restoration of our Territory at both Ends of the State will enable us soon to put our particular Finances upon the most respectable Footing.  I am sorry to hear from several Gentlemen that the Recommendation of Congress to pardon the disaffected under certain Limitations (2) hath given Uneasiness to Persons in the State of New York.  JULY 24, 1778  And I almost wish to know whether they are among those who were steady in Times of great Doubt & Distress because I have observed that such Men from a natural Fortitude of soul are much more inclined to Mercy than those who are under a Necessity of manifesting an extraordinary Zeal. But be this as it may the Lenity & active Spirit of the State I represent were too generally felt and acknowledged by the Members of Congress to suppose they meant a particular Relation to that State. Neither would it be proper to suppose they had any particular Views. I will only mention Facts. When this Recommendation came out it rendered the Troops which they call new Levies worse than useless to the Enemy as another Manoeuvre of a similar Kind had the Germans. The British Officers candidly acknowledged the Wisdom and that they felt the Force of the Policy. The State of Pensilvania did not. They issued a Proclamation in the Light and Nature of a Proscription against hundreds some of them the meanest of their Citizens.(3) The Greater Part staid in the City and I daily have the Mortification to meet capital leading Tories not only in the Street but I have seen them in Company. Not a Man hath been and I will venture to say Not a Man will be condemned. How a New Yorker feels on this Occasion I leave you to judge. At the same Time I do myself the Justice to declare that as a Man I freely forgive every of them every Thing which personally they may have meant against me. But as a Statesman I think Great Examples necessary to deter the small Fry who on almost all Occasions ought to have much pardoned to their Ignorance, to their Prejudices, to their Situations, to their Dependences, their Connections and the thousand things which combine to lead such Men into Evil.

  Sir 2 4 th July [1778]  I received much satisfaction by learning from Mr. Zahn that you continued at Mount Tacitus. I hope I shall find you there or in some other of my Plantations where you shall think you may be most serviceable. My return to my own Country hardly depends upon my will; my interests and my inclination call loudly for it, but already I have received several applications requesting me not to leave Congress so early as the first of November, which day I had lately named. I will not finally determine until I shall have seen our public affairs two Months further advanced, in the mean time if leisure can be found at Mount Tacitus I desire about five thousand square feet of Cypress may be provided and shingles sufficient to cover an House of about 50 feet square; there must also be a large quantity of boards and plank for inside work, and also flooring boards of the best Pine. I mean to build a log House such as I have seen and lived in, at York Town, where they are neat, wholsome, durable and built at a very moderate expence. Mr. Zahn will speak to you on this subject and you will be governed in your proceedings by his advice and direction.  Except one visit of the Gout last Winter I have enjoy'd my usual good health ever since I left Carolina. That stroke of the Gout was extreamly severe, confined me a month and kept me lame near three months. You must have heard from time to time all public occurrences in this part of America up to the middle of the present Month, what follows and the newspapers which you will find inclosed with this will give you a pretty full Account of the present state of Affairs.  The French fleet which lately arrived on this Coast is now Iying off Sandy Hook, unfortunately there is not water enough on the Bar for their large ships, otherwise the whole English squadron at New York would fall into their hands, these are at present block'd up, and the French fleet have taken a great number of Prizes some of them armed ships, and some with gold and silver and valuable Cargoes.  General Washington has now an army upwards of 20,000 Men-all in high spirits and I hope we shall soon learn of his having accomplished some important Act. Every one whose opinion I have heard,  JULY 24, 1778  say, if general Lee had done his part at the battle of Monmouth, Sir Henry Clinton would have been reduced to circumstances little, if any thing, better than those which Burgoyne experienced last year. The General's trial before a Court Martial is not yet ended.  While I was at York Town I lived in a stile much below that of my Overseers. All the room I had for my Office and lodging, was not near so large as the Hall at Mount Tacitus, more than once I have been obliged to dine upon bread and cheese and a glass of Grog- here I fare much better, but in both places I have found hard work enough and at so enormous an expence as would astonish you to hear of-but thank God there begins to be a ground for hoping we shall obtain an honorable Peace before another year expires-this however is not to be relied on, we ought therefore to persevere in every endeavour to oppose and repel the Enemy.  The cruelties of the English, exercised upon our People who were their Prisoners is not to be parallel'd in History of Civilized Nations -nor indeed are they exceeded by the practices of the barbarous Indian Allies of our Enemies.  The Indians have scalped and butcher'd and burnt many of our inhabitants-these means were cruel and severe but death soon ended all pain. The English have starved our People, suffer'd them to lose their limbs by frost and to linger out a miserable life for many days and weeks, have refused to let us cloath and feed them- they have compelled our friends to drink unwholsome water when good water was in plenty wasting before their Eyes, they have smother'd them in Prison Ships, killing every night five, six, and more, have kick'd, beat and abused, have loaded Officers with Irons and a thousand other savage Acts they have been guilty of-sometimes murdered the Masters of families, burned all the houses, goods and provisions and left poor helpless Women and infant Children exposed to the rigor of frost, snow and rain without food or covering. A volume might be filled with Accounts of their barbarities-in several instances of which even General Howe and General Clinton have been directly concern'd. But thank God their hands are now bound up, they are confined within their Lines at New York-from whence deserters come into our Camp 6, 8, 10 of a day, lately a Cornet of Horse and a Captain of their new Troops deserted and came over to General Washington. If time permitted I would give you further information, but I have many other Letters to write by this conveyance. I must therefore close this, assuring you I continue Your friend And Humble Servt.

  Sir 24th July [1778] I have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's several favors of the 4th, 8th and 16th Instant, which have been in due course presented to Congress, but hitherto I have received no commands in return.(1) Supposing Your Excellencys' Messenger, who will be the bearer of this may have been employed for the special purpose of bringing your favor of the 20th (2) and that expences are consequently increasing every day; I have judged it best to dispatch him without further delay. I have Men here employed as Messengers in constant pay, one of these shall conduct to your Excellency such Resolves as Congress shall form on the last mentioned Letter immediately after the Act shall be sent to me. That Letter had been committed to the Board of War on Monday last, a Report was made yesterday, and after some Debate re-committed. If I dare judge of opinions not yet delivered Congress will coincide with your Excellency's respecting the intended expedition against Detroit, and the further raising troops of horse.(3)  The Intelligence from your Sea coast must have been founded on the little Actions between some of Count d'Estaing's squadron and the Lydia Privateer of New York of 26 Guns and the Mermaid Frigate.(4) The Lydia was destroyed-the Mermaid driven on the shoals on the Coast of Maryland where the sequel of her history is probably known: we have not learned it yet.  Count d'Estaing lay many days at Anchor near Sandy Hook mortified by looking at Admiral Gambiers' squadron within, and perfectly safe from his assaults. The Large French ships draw too much water for the Bar, many British Vessels were taken by the French fleet while Iying at the Hook, five of them armed, two said to be British Frigates, but we have received no Account of particulars. The Count must by this day have arrived at Rhode Island where he must be content with playing a small game, not very small if he has the good fortune to Burgoyne General Pigot and his Garrison. I entertain some hopes that Congress will Resolve to hold no Conference with Men who have attempted to corrupt them by bribes, and to divide the good People of these States, that those Men will be made the bearers of their own Impeachment, exposed to the resentments of their injured Countrymen and their fame transmitted to Posterity in Characters which will render their memory infamous. I have the prosecution of this measure very much at heart. I take the liberty of inclosing this days newspaper, and remain with great Respect & Esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's Obedient Humble Servt.

  Sir 24th July [1778] In the recess of Congress I am called upon by His Excellency Le Sr. Gerard, Minister Plenipotentiary from his Most Christian Majesty to the United States of America in order to obtain from Connecticut such aids as His Excellency Count d'Estaing, Vice Admiral of France, commander of a squadron of ships of War of his Most Christian Majesty may stand in need of, admitting Count d'Estaing shall proceed from Sandy Hook to Rhode Island.  I have therefore taken the Liberty in the name of Congress to address your Honor requesting you to afford all the assistance in your power to Count d'Estaing upon His Excellency's requisition for the general service of the French fleet, and for facilitating the Vice Admiral's intended operations, particularly that a sufficient number of skilful Pilots may be held in constant readiness for conducting the fleet if necessary into New London.(1)  From a reflection His Excellency General Washington has undoubtedly written to you on this subject as well as from a certain persuasion that your Honor will upon every occasion chearfully and vigorously contribute to promote the service of his Most Christian Majesty our good Ally, in which the safety and welfare of these States is strongly interwoven, I have intimated to Monsr. Girard the present application will scarcely be necessary. Be this as it may 'tis with great pleasure I embrace the opportunity of assuring your Honor of the continued good wishes, Esteem and Respect with which I have the Honor to be, Sir, Your Most Obedient &c.

  Gentlemen July 24th 1778 We have received your sundry Letters of the 12th, 24th & 29th ultimo and of the 4th, 7th & 8th Current to which we shall now reply in their order. To yours of the 12th ultimo. Our letter to you of the 11 th instant will convey our Instructions for every possible endeavour being exerted in preparing for Sea the continental Vessels of war in your department and for sending them out one after another to join the squadron of France under the command of vice Admiral the Count D Estaing; therefore we hope before this will reach, that you will have despatched the Warren and that others will shortly follow. We enclose herewith a Set of Signals received from the French Admiral, copys of which you will deliver to our Commanders enjoining great secrecy and in case of necessity that they destroy them.(1) We approve of your having purchased A Schooner for bringing round the flour and Iron from Sinepuxent. In a Letter from William Smith Esqr our Agent in Maryland of the 18th instant is the following Paragraph. \""I am sorry to inform you there is the greatest reason to believe Captain Whippy of the Schooner Loyalty is Captured by the enemy in his outward bound passage from Sinepuxent-he had on board upwards of 900 Barrels flour and a quantity of barr Iron, and I am informed he was so imprudent as to go to sea when three oL the enemies Cruizers were in sight-they were seen in chase of him, and as he is so dull a sailor, there is very small hopes of his having escaped.(2) The Swan, Captain Stiles, arrived from Boston at Sinepuxent about the 23d ultimo, her Cargo of flour and Iron was all ready and doubt not she is despatched before this.\"" Should the Schooner be taken it will be a disapointment and we think Captain Whippys conduct will be highly reprehensible. To yours of the 24th ultimo. The estimate of Monies wanted in your Department hath been laid before Congress who have granted the full amount.(3) We therefore send you five hundred & Twenty four thousand by the Bearer according to his Receipt enclosed-this large sum we hope will be fully adequate to all your wants, and enable you to prosecute with vigour the business of your Department, we have no doubt but that you will render the expenditure thereof as beneficial to the public as possible.  To yours of the 29th ultimo. We are much pleased to hear of Captain Summers Success and the arrival of his Prizes. To prevent delay and inconvenience hereafter as was the Case with regard to the  JULY 24, 1778  Brigantine Resistance being without a Commander, we empower you to appoint to any Vessel under 20 Guns any Captain that may be unemployed in your department.(4)  We shall lay before Congress the Sentences of the Courts Martial relative to Captains Manly and McNeill.(5) The Account you give of the Hamdens Stores has determined us to Countermand the orders we formerly gave to build a hull Accomodated to them, therefore we desire you may drop that plan. When a proper opportunity shall present and you may think Mr. Pecks Talents in the construction of Ships will be useful to the Public, you will please to give us notice. We shall overlook Captain Waters mistake and consider his appointment the first opporty.(6) We enclose herewith an order of the Board of War to their Agents in the Eastern States to furnish you with Blankets, Duck, Oznabrigs, Coarse Linnen, Stockings and Coarse Cloths, lead, Copper &c. which they may have in their possession, and you may want for fitting out the ships of war in your Department. As most of these articles are essentially necessary for the Army and will be much wanted in the Winter we request you will be sparing of them as possible.  To yours of the 4th instant. We inclose herein a Resolve of Congress of the 15th November 1776 respecting the Bounty allowed for Men and Guns taken from the enemy at sea. It is the opinion of this Committee that Men of War and Privateers are the only Vessels that comes within the meaning of this Resolve, therefore on all Vessels coming within this discription the Bounty is to be paid but none other. We have ordered the Navy Board here to make a return of the British Seamen that are Prisoners within their district, when they do we shall attend to your proposal of Exchanging them for ours at Halifax and will write you. For the present we desire you will engage Pilots for our Ships of War on the best terms you can. We wish to know your reasons for having Pilots established in the Navy-we apprehend they are founded on some local custom with you with which we are unacquainted. You will also inform us what pay and share of Prize Money should be allowed to Pilots. We never have allowed any Commission to any of our Captains for disbursing Money, and would by no means have that Custom introduced. As we do not think proper that the Public should be concerned with individuals in Vessels of War we cannot accept of Mr. Ginons proposals.  To yours of the 7th instant. We do not approve of going into the custom of allowing travelling expences to the officers of the Navy, but on account of the particular circumstances attending Lieutenant Leeds of the Brig Resistance we make him a gratuity of the amount of his account viz £56.17.9 which you will please to pay.  To yours of the 8th instant. As you think the ship Queen of France will do for a Cruizing Ship we desire she may be equipped accordingly and the Command of her given to Captain Joseph   Olney. The One half of the sea Books you mention you will please to send forward to this place.  It is our desire that you have the accounts of the building, fitting &c of the Hancock & Boston frigates compleatly settled and examined and sent forward to us. It is also our desire that you keep seperate and distinct accounts of all Vessels ordered to be built within your Department, and that you regularly furnish this Committee with the Cost of each when fitted for the Sea; and that afterwards you keep seperate and distinct accounts of the Disbursements of each Vessel and furnish us with them in that manner. You will direct the Commanders that sail by your Orders to inform this Committee of all occurrences that may happen on their Voyages.  You will please to hold a Court of Inquiry on Captain Johnstons conduct relative to the loss of the Continental Brig Lexington of which he was Commander.(7) Mr. Bradford the Agent at Boston hath lately remitted to us a bill drawn by Otis & Andrews on the Clothier General James Mease Esqr. at this place for 29,6511/3 Dollars being for Prize Goods which they purchased of him. We desire you will inform Mr. Bradford, that he is to charge this Bill to your Board and not to the Marine Committee, as he and all other Agents in your department are to settle their transactions with you. We shall shortly transmit you the Money for the above Bill.  We are Gentlemen, Your Hble servants  P.S. We send this Letter by Post being anxious to communicate the contents-the 524000 dollars shall be sent off immediately after it.  ""

  My dearest Love Philadelphia July 26t 1778 I have just been made exceedingly happy by the Reciept of your Packett of the 15 Inst. enclosing Mr. Pintards &c. I have wrote you 8 or 10 lately but this is only the second I have recd. I know not of JULY 26, 1778  any mode of assuring you of the importance of a Letter from your Valuable Pen, but by referring you to your own feelings on the like occasion. To recieve a Letter from any Friend is agreeable, but to be honored with a sweet endearing Letter from a dearly beloved Wife-the Wife of your Youth and the Partner of all your Joys, & Hopes & fears, is Indulgence, Gratification and next to Possession itself. I must beg that you will not let a Post pass without a Line, if it is but to say that you are well. Mr. P. informs me that he has sent me a Hat, if so pray forward it to me by some very safe Hand-send it to Princeton and it can easily be sent on from there. How kind is our gracious God in protecting my Dear Family amidst the surrounding Evills, that others have been liable to. Poor Mr. MacWhorter, I pity him greatly altho' he has reason to rejoyce in the goodness of a merciful God in the midst of Judgment.(1) But indeed I scarcely live a Day, without some striking fresh call to praise our God for his Goodness and to say that his Mercy endureth forever. I have lately experienced it in removing my disorder in so speedy a Manner. Could We but live answerably to such mercies it would increase our Happiness to the summit of Earthly felicity. I have nothing new to tell you only that the French fleet is gone to attack Rhode Island by sea, while 5000 Men under Genl. Sullivan attack by Land. God grant them success & take the Glory to himself.  I dare not think too much of my beloved Wife & dear Family, as I know it is apt to have too great an Effect on my determinations-to say I begin to hanker after the leeks & onions of Egypt is but to give the mere Shadow of the real feelings of my too anxious Heart-I often am in evening-but enough I must impose Silence on my Heart & Pen. Suffice it to say, that neither Love, Esteem, Friendship nor any of the tender, delicate & finer feelings of a Heart alass too, too sensible towards the Object of its affections, are no ways lessened or impaired by a disagreeable & unwilling Absence from the delightfull Subject of them.  I have wrote you to endeavour to store the Sugars with you, or send them on to me hence, as you find it convenient-the first will be best.  If the Teams belong to Mr. Messereau, you must let them have money to bear their Expences taking their reciepts. If they go back to Boston, they must take some Load back.  Let my Dr Susan know how much I am obliged by her Letter. It deserves an Answer as soon as I have leisure. I am pleased to see that she is improving.  Love & a Kiss to her. Remember me to the Familys Sister & all Friends as if named.  I am my Dearest Love with the greatest Sincerity & Esteem, Your truly Affect. & loving Husband, Boudinot  ""

  Dear Sir 26th July [1778] I thank you for your favor of the 15th,(1) particularly for those Polite and kind marks of your friendship for me which you are pleased to express, and shall endeavour to merit the continuance of your Esteem.  The favorable Events which you allude to make a proper impression upon my mind. I view them as Harbingers to an honorable Peace, and the Universal acknowledgment of American Independence, but a Man who has paid some attention for fifty years to the continual fluctuation of Human Affairs, feels not those raptures from the appearances of good Fortune which had been wont to seize his Heart between the Stages of 20 and 40-perhaps a moderate degree of anxiety for permanizing present advantages may appear to younger Men an alloy of Happiness. I feel as if led by it into the true Sphere.  Many days have past over since I heard any thing from the Fleet or from His Excellency General Washington. Count d'Estaing has been making Prizes in great numbers and of great value in sight of the Enemys squadron safely anchor'd behind Sandy Hook extreamly chagrined at finding his own Ships drew too much Water to admit his coming nearer to them. The Newspaper which I shall here inclose will further inform you. I can add nothing on this head but that Mr. Gerard and myself conjecture the Admiral is gone to Rhode Island. The choice of le Sieur Gerard for the Minister Plenipotentiary displays the Wisdom of His Most Christian Majesty's Councils. I will venture to say in one word France does not contain a Man better fitted for the People among whom he is to reside, with whom he is to Negociate, than is this Gentleman, nor have I a lower opinion of the Competency of Monsr. Girards' Abilities for Negociating nor of his Integrity.  The Letter which you sent to the Commercial Committee was deliver'd to me by that Board and immediately presented to Congress(2) The House order'd it to be returned to the Committee, and that they should after full consideration make a special Report. This happened yesterday Morning, Congress did not rise 'till near four o'clock P.M., this is Sunday, consequently the Report cannot be JULY 26, 1778  made before tomorrow, but considering the business which we have to transact with Mr. Girard I rather think nothing will be done in your Affair before Wednesday; to prevent anxiety therefore to yourself and perhaps some expence I submit to your Servant's importunity to return and you may be assured of hearing from me by a special Messenger without the loss of one minutes time after I shall have received the commands of Congress. And if I form a right judgment from the sentiments of particular Members you will be convinced that Congress have in view nothing short or that you can in our present Circumstances require in favor of Monsr. Beaumarchais, and in fulfilment of the Contract lately entered into.(3) Some Gentlemen who were at my House last Evening discovered much displeasure at the Orders which you say have been given for consigning public Cargoes to Mr. Ross. I will not trouble you with my own opinions or conjectures, it would be altogether improper to do so since you are acquainted with my sentiments and more especially as your complaints are now before the proper Tribunal and will very soon receive an Answer, I trust a satisfactory answer.(4)  I am glad you have made no purchases on my account. I have found it necessary to go into very large expences since my return to Philadelphia for such Articles as I had requested you to procure, and the extravagant prices demanded for every species forbid laying in double stocks-but I would except the article of Claret which you say is good, therefore, if it can be purchased at a price not exceeding 30 or 32 dollars per dozen bottles, & you find a good opportunity for transporting it soon I request you to send me four of five boxes, containing as I compute 20 dozen little more or less. I have now an house almost as elegant as that in which I have enjoyed the company of my friends at York Town. I shall be happy to see Mr. Francy and to pass an opinion on his Claret.  Within the present Cover you will find two Letters for yourself which are all that have come to my hands in your absence-one for Versailles from Baron de Kalb, two for Martinique and one for the Cape transmitted to me by Marquis de la Fayette, for all these I request you to procure safe and speedy passages.  Your Dispatches for Baron Steuben and Captain Landy shall be sent forward this Morning.  I have the Honor to be, With great Respect &c.  ""

  My Dear Son 26th July [1778]  Members of Congress and Citizens in general are under uncommon anxiety to hear from His Excellency the Commander in Chief-and to learn something further than we know of the present position of Count d'Estaing's fleet. You know very well how I feel, we are not new acquaintance-improve the present moment; events will be produced in due course. This maxim smooths much the path through Life.  Doctor Scudder is not a Free Mason, you have had many escapes, but I submit it to your wisdom and Philosophy whether it be necessary to tempt the fates or to brave them, and to your friendship whether a person so dear and so much beloved is not entitled for the sake of his Connections to ordinary protection. I shall never be surprised until I hear you have in one instance attended to the preservation of your Life by means which the bravest Man on Earth would not blush to adopt.  From Charlestown I learn they had lately captured Bachop a second time, and with him or in company with him in another Privateer which had long infested our Coast the very infamous Osbourne.(1) General Howe had advanced on his march towards East Florida as far as the Bank of St. Johns, the Season of the Year will not allow me to entertain very sanguine hopes of his success although the Enterprizing, never failing Colonel Williamson with 1000 of his own trusty Men were with him. I had intended to have written you a full sheet but the patience of Le Chevalier Failly who has been waiting above two hours in the Parlour must be near expiring. I have been all that time producing this scrap, six words at a time between interruptions.  P.S. I send in the Packet with this, four Letters for yourself and sundry for Head Quarters and the Camp. I am sorry nothing lies on me for paying my Respects to the General. I have no public commands and will not be so unkind as to take up a moment of his time with Ceremony-but I love and pray for him. There is a Letter in the Packet for his Excellency the General from Don Juan De Miralis who appears to be a worthy old Castilian. I have much of his company.  JULY 27, 1778  ""

  My dear Sir Philada. July 27 1778 Capt Manly has obliged me with your favor of the 5th.(1) He and McNeil are here with different Views. The one to obtain another Ship, and the other to get the Sentence of a Court Martial reversd. Perhaps both may be disappointed. I have receivd a Number of Letters by both. To yours I shall pay a particular Regard, because I am well satisfied you never suffer Prejudices to divert your Attention from the great Object-the publick good. \""Manly is a blunt, honest and I believe brave Officer.\"" I observe your caution, and am pleasd with it; for I think it is a fresh Proof of your Integrity. Manlys Bravery is an Article of your Belief. His Bluntness & Honesty are Matters of Certainty. I have not yet lookd into the Papers; but I recollect to have heard, when they were read, the Want of Experience imputed to him, and some thing that had the Appearance of blaming him for not giving any Signals for the Direction of the Ships under his Command. This it must be ownd, strongly implys a Want of Discretion. Does the Character of a blunt & honest officer intitle him to the Command of a capital Ship if he is deficient in Point of Experience & Discretion? Especially if he has had the Misfortune of losing one already. \""McNeils Address is insinuating-His Assurance great-He will tell you fine Storys\"" &c. I should think he had taken his lessons out of Hutchinsons political Book, if I had not Reason to believe that he used to despise him most heartily. When I advert to a Letter from another of my Friends, I find him \""open & sincere\"" \""His Temper naturally warm, which he has sometimes indulgd in speaking his Mind freely of Persons in office.\"" This you know has always been deemd an unpardonable Sin, and I am affraid it always will be. To be sure it always will be so deemd by that Kind of Men in office, who meet with none to hinder them from persisting in the most egregious and expensive Blunders, but the open, sincere & warm Friends of the Country. We all know, says my Correspondent, his Zeal & Sufferings for our glorious Cause.\"" Such a Character, I must confess, commands my Friendship; but it has no Consideration in the present Appeal. Has he had a fair Trial? I pay a proper regard to the Decisions of Courts Martial, and shall not give my Voice for altering them, but when Error, Partiality or Injustice shall appear plainly to my own Satisfaction.(2)  Our Navy Officers must not expect to pick & chuse for themselves. JULY 27, 1778  They ought to be content with such Appointments as are given to them. Indeed Appointments should be made with more Judgment than I think they can be by any Set of Men at three or four hundred Miles Distance. For this Reason I movd that they not be made by the Navy Board, which obtaind in a certain Degree, as you will see by a Letter from the Marine Committee.(3) Had this been the Case before, Olney would have remaind in the Resistance, and Bush must have waited for another. If the Queen of France is a better Vessel, it will turn out not to the Disadvantage of Olney. While we have more Captains in Commission than we have ships to give them, there must be Disappointments, Envys, and Suspicions (oftentimes unreasonable) of each other. This is the Make of Man and we may as well think of stopping the Tide as altering it. \""The Appointment of Cap Landais affords an ample Subject for the observations of Speculatists, & the Resentment of Navy officers.\"" I think he is, as you observe, an ingenious & well behavd Man; and if he is an able & experiencd officer, as we are assured he is by those who ought to give us the best Information, it is a Pity that two very good Lieutenants should leave the ship & the service on that Account. I hope others may be found to fill their places. \""It is an opinion that I was Landais chief Patron.\"" This is a mistaken Opinion. You discover yourself on this occasion, as you are disposd to do at all Times, Partial in my Favor. If I was in any Degree instrumental in the Promotion of Landais, it was because I really thought him a considerable Acquisition & that he would be eminently useful to our Navy. And I am apt to believe it would have been thought a judicious Appointment, if there had not been a fanciful Predilection in favor of another. Even the Name of the Ship may have given Disgust to some Men.(4) I hope when Manly is provided with such a Ship as will please him, the Difficulties or obstructions in the Way of getting the Alliance manned will be removed. I am sure your Exertions will not be wanting to forward the Service.  July 29. Yesterday I sent you a fresh News paper by the Post which I intended as an Apology for not writing to you. I kept this Letter open, knowing that Mr Dod the Express was to set off soon, and designing to say a few things in Addition to what I just hinted to you in my last. But I must defer it till another opportunity. I shall be obligd to you if you will give my Respects to Mr Storey & tell him that his Petition with a Number of others was put into the Hands of Mr Lovel when Mr H[ancock] left this City. We will take the first oppty to present it, and endeavor to get his Wishes answerd.(5) Adieu my Friend.  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 27th 1778. Your's of the 12th instant is just rec'd and am glad to hear that our conduct to the British Commissioners has given general satisfaction.(1) By their last letter they seem to threaten us with an appeal to the people at large; I hope and believe they will gain no great advantage by that measure.  I am fully sensible of the force of your arguments against privateering and if some proper methods were taken to restrain it to proper bounds, I make no doubt the public would be much benefitted by such restrictions; but (for want of a competent knowledge of those affairs I make no doubt) I am not quite satisfied that a total prohibition would be serviceable. The Congress have some time since determined as soon as possible to take up the Marine affairs and make some very essential alterations in it and also the affair of our money which seems to be going to confusion by the enormous rise of every thing, but when it will be done God knows. The almost innumerable letters and business that daily crowd upon Congress for want of regular Boards, properly appointed and filled, and the time it takes in such large Assemblies, to transact business, keeps us forever behind-hand in our affairs and I am sorry to say that sometimes matters of very small importance waste a good deal of precious time, by the long and repeated speeches and chicanery of gentlemen who will not wholly throw off the lawyer even in Congress.  Till we get into better regulations as to our Marine Affairs, I am persuaded no class of men are so much wanted in Congress as men acquainted with that business, for though Navy Boards are established, yet there is a constant appeal to the Marine Committee of Congress, who I am sure are at this time inadequate to the business. I hope our State will have wisdom enough to appoint you to relieve me here in the fall and that you will have virtue enough still to forego your own private interest for the public good and will accept of their appointment and without flattery. I really think you would be very serviceable to the public here, especially in the Marine Department. If I knew you would not attend Congress I should be glad  JULY 27, 1778  you might be appointed one of the Navy Board at Boston, for I am sure that Board does not attend sufficiently to the business.  Mons. Girard has not yet had the ceremony of an audience but believe it will take place some day this week; the ceremonials are agreed on by Congress and the House clearly cleansed and fitted up. The Minister seems urgent to have it as soon as may be.  The French fleet are gone to Rhode Island and you will hear of their operations sooner than we. The Admiral seems very desirous of doing something to effect and was greatly mortified when he found there was not water sufficient for his large ships to go up to New York. I have nothing to write you in the new's way-have sent you a paper or two by which you will see what is stirring here.  Please to inform Col Langdon I rec'd a letter for Mr Wentworth, which by the superscription I believe came from him and shall keep it till Mr. Wentworth arrives here which I hope will be the latter end of this & beginning of next week.  Remember me to Col Langdon, Mr King, Mr Gain's, Col Wentworth and all friends and believe me to be your sincere friend, J. Bartlett  [P.S.] As this is erased, blotted and huddled together in a shameful manner please to destroy it as soon as read for I have not time to write it over.  ""

  My dear Brother, Phila. July 27th 1778 Your letter of the 12th came only to hand this day by Post, amazing delay, but I have spoken to the Post Master on this business until I am tired. It astonishes me that neither you or my other friends receive my letters, altho I write so many. To you I have not missed above one post since we parted & then I wrote by Mr. Armstead. I trust that before this gets to hand you will have received my letters in which I have given you a full account of the transactions in the Jersies, of the arrival & progress of the French Squadron, & of the coming of a Plenipotentiary from the Court of France to Congress. The Squadron is gone to Rhode Island to make a sweep there as the large Ships of this fleet cannot find water enough to enter the Harbour of N. York wherein the English Ships keep themselves close. I understand that measures will be taken to prevent egress from York or succours getting in. It is this day confidently reported that 27 sail of the provision fleet from Cork have fallen into the hands of Count JULY 27, 1778  D'Estaing, this is not yet certain, but we know such a fleet has been long & daily expected. We understand the enemy are greatly distressed for provisions in N. York, particularly of the bread kind. Gen. Washington has sent 2 Brigades to join 3000 Men under Gen. Sullivan to assist in the business of Rh. Island. Where you are nothing better can be done than to inform the people and prevent their being imposed on.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 27th 1778 Your favor of the 13th came this day to hand. I will not go into an examination of Dr & Cr in correspondence, but I give you warning that I am about turning bankrupt. I find it to be totally impossible to do my duty to the public and at the same time pursue as I have done the fulfilment of private epistolary devoirs. New scenes of parade and interruption attend the multiplied foreign business. A multitude of circumstances connected with the books of our Committee (1) are now to be eclaircised by those who have most attended to those books for months past. Mutual jealousies having prevailed, as you know, the time is come for mutual explanations. This makes work for me in particular, as having been uniformly connected with foreign applications and much also with foreign correspondence.  I cannot find Gazettes for all my friends, and therefore must refer you to the Boston Papers or to Dunlap's which is doubtless sent to your printer weekly. General! Read (2) will probably be at the head of this Govt which will thence acquire strength and permanence. Maryland, Delaware and Jersey have not yet signed the confederation. Count d'Estaing is gone for Rhode Island not finding water enough at the Narrows of New York. I hope Sullivan will do credit to himself and New Hampshire by cooperating with the Count.  The Minister Plenipotentiary from France will have his public audience in a day or two of which more hereafter from your's affectionately, J.L.  28th. With the Mumps or something of the kind I am out of the way of Gazettes, this morning at my lodgings, but am told there is nothing material in print.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. July 27th. 1778 I perswade myself you will excuse the Freedom I take on this Occasion as it arises solely from the Interest I take in the Reputation of your Office & the Share I had in getting you into it. In a late Application for Money laid before Congress there were some Expressions of Discontent which seemed to give Offence to some of our Members who think a great deal of & feel a great deal for the Dignity of Congress.(1) As you have accepted the Office there appears to JULY 27, 1778  me not only a Propriety in the Thing itself, but that it is your Interest to stand as fair as possible with them. You will have Accounts to settle with them in future; Allowances perhaps to ask & possibly future Favours to request.

  28 July 1778 I have very carefully examined everything that was reported about your case (according to your letter to the committee and the one that you privately wrote to me).(1) I have thus taken note of only the articles of your contract on which your complaint rests, and I have presented it to Congress, which not wishing to decide without having the report of the committee, transmits to us your letter and my observations. I hope that this report will be made in two days. Congress is busy at this moment with matters so serious that it is impossible to interrupt them, but understand that I will seize the first moment to resolve your case. I know how important it is to you not to delay for one moment the ship you say will be ready to set sail.  I am well informed about every obligation that America has to Mr. de B[eaumarchais] not only through the particulars that you have given me, but also through a private conversation that I have had with Mr. Deane on this subject and my opinion is that Congress cannot make too great an effort to recognize the outstanding services that he has rendered us and to promptly pay off the debt that it owes him.  The ships which you mention in your letter to the committee were consigned 15 and 18 months ago; as they were entrusted to Mr. Ross, who accordingly made advances to Congress, it is not possible to change their consignment, but our report will be that the first  JULY 28,1778  ships that are dispatched must be directed to Mr. Beaumarchais, and if the Virginia, which you say is to be sent to our agents and is loaded with 355 hogsheads of tobacco, is in condition to set sail, we will direct that it must be delivered to Mr. de B[eaumarchais].(2)  I have just formed a trade partnership with Mr. Deane and a few other delegates, who are prepared to raise as much capital as we shall have need of and who besides have a great deal of influence in their own state. We wish to have join us a powerful firm in France, which according to what Mr. Deane tells us will have such an interest in becoming acquainted with us that there is no doubt it will accept without hesitation the proposition that he will make to it. I will go myself to France next November, but I want to see you before, having many things to tell you on the subject.(3)  ""

General Washington joined by General Gates is now with a very respectible Army at White Plains. Count d'Estaing finding it impracticable to enter with his large ships Sandy Hook, sailed the 21st Instant for Rhode Island.

  [July 28, 1778] I have received your private letter and the one that you wrote to the committee:(1) both dated the 15 instant. Allow me to tell you that the style is a little too ardent, the complaints that you make regarding the orders that I gave for the consignment of two vessels to Mr. Ross are not founded, because these orders were given not only before the existence of your contract, but even before your arrival on the continent. The Congress owes a great deal to this same Mr. Ross who some time ago received notice that these vessels which you mention were dispatched to him, as soon as the bay was free and their destination cannot be changed, but have faith that we are all very prepared to carry out the obligations that we have made with you so as to pay back what the Republic owes to Mr. de B[eaumarchais], and as for me to prove to you how much I am disposed towards it I have proposed to the committee to send the vessel JULY 28, 1778  the Virginia loaded with 355 hogsheads of tobacco. Our report on this subject has not yet been made to Congress,(2) but I do not doubt that it will not consent to change the consignment of this ship which was not directed to the agents in order to pay back someone his notes and as the one that you claim is one of the oldest ones, it is just that they busy themselves to discharge it. The conversations that I have had on this subject with Mr. Deane confirm my opinion that we have great obligations to M. de B and that we must not avoid any occasion to show our recognition of it.(3)  ""

I heartily Condole with you on the News of the death of Your Brother, Congress have Accepted Your resignation.(1)  I should with great pleasure have recommended Mr Pierce to have filled the vacancy had it not appeared by your Letter to Congress that by the junction of the two Armies the office was become unnecessary, but I did mention him in Congress as a person well qualified for Such an appointment, and whose continuance (for Some time at least) might be necessary to close the Accounts, he being perfectly Acquainted with the business. It was Supposed that if the money was delivered over to Col. Palfry he could do what was necessary without any Special appointment by Congress.  A Treasurer of loans has lately been appointed, whose business is to Sign loan office Certificates & Bills of Exchange, & Send them to the loan officers in the Several States; and, to receive all Bills of Credit called in to be Sunk &c with a Salary of 2000 dollars per annum.(2) I nominated you for that office but your Friends in general were of opinion that you would be wanted for a more important one that of a Commissioner of the Treasury Board.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, July 31st, 1778. I take the Liberty of recommending to your attention & Civilities, the Bearer, Mr. Vial, a Frenchman who came to America on commercial views, but has been unfortunate in being captured, & losing thereby his whole adventures in Goods.  Having made his Escape from New York, he is going to Virginia, on a visit to some of his Countrymen there, at present, & proposing to reside in our Country untill his Connections shall send him in a Cargo. I wish you to render his Time agreeable to him, if he should visit our Neighbourhood.  When I have the happiness of returning home, I shall make it my care to render this Gentleman every Service; as I am by no means of opinion, that the having experienced in Some Strangers, a Turn to deception, should deter me or you, from affording Consolation to the distressed, where there is a probability that the object of such civility possesses a considerable share of Merit. There is besides in this Man, an appearance of Candour, & I wish to indulge my feelings in his favour. From experience of the Gentleman's Sentiments & Consistency of Character, you will be capable of judging, whether it may be advantageous to enter into commercial views with him.  I write this in Congress, & must be brief. The English army of our Enemies is now in a very fair way, to experience the utmost distress, & perhaps may in the End meet a similar Fate, to that of Burgoyne. The French fleet, on one side, have blocked up the Port, while our army numerous, & extremely provided with every thing necessary, is on the White Plains, Its numbers greatly augmented by a junction of the Troops, under Command of General Gates, with the Grand army. The Count D'Estaing (it is probable) may get Possession of the Provision fleet, expected from Cork.

  31st July [1778] I Am this minute favor'd with Your Excellency's very obliging Letter of the 24th.(1)  The British Commissioners, for, in the Act of one, there is good ground for charging the whole, having by various means attempted to bribe Congress and thereby offer'd the highest possible affront to the Representatives of a virtuous Independent People, are in my humble opinion rendered wholly unworthy of the further regard of Congress in their Ambassadorial character.  Viewing them in this light I have been from the first reading of their last Address (2) under that kind of anxiety which had possessed my Mind when there was some cause for apprehending that General Burgoyne and his Troops would have slipt thro' our fingers into New York or Philadelphia, an anxiety to which I am a stranger, except in such momentous concerns.  I have for several days past urged my friends to move Congress for a Resolve that they will hold no conference with such Men, assigning reasons in ample, decent terms-to transmit the Act by a flag to the Commissioners, and make them the bearers of their own indictment; they will not dare to withhold the Resolve of Congress from their Court. Thence it will soon descend to the Public at large and expose themselves and their Prompters to the just resentment of a deluded and much injured Nation, whose deplorable circumstances I must confess deeply affects my heart. These Commissioners will be also held up in scorn at every Court in Europe, and finally be transmitted to Posterity in Characters which will mark their Memory with Infamy.(3)  An immediate display of the intended bargain and sale will discourage the impudent, polemic Writers on American Affairs in London, or invalidate their bold assertions and give force to the declarations of Congress.  If we leave the story to be related after Governor Johnstone's departure from this Continent, he will confidently deny the fact and how few in the World will be thenceforward well informed? Attack him Letters in hand upon the spot, his guilt will be fix'd from his own confession, for he cannot deny.  I am not commonly tenacious of my own Ideas, but in the present, as in the former case, I feel as if I clearly perceived many good effects which will be produced by a proper Act on our part. Justice is due to our own Characters, to the present age of America and future Generations will with much satisfaction dwell in history upon the transactions of Congress with these corrupt insidious Emissaries.  If a predilection to my fellow Citizens when standing in competi- JULY 31, 1778  tion with strangers, of no more than equal merit, be criminal I must own myself not free from guilt.  From habit I am disposed to give countenance to strangers, and I have beside endeavoured, for obvious reasons, to be civil to such French Gentlemen as have called upon me, hence my conduct had been mistaken and I discover'd at a certain time that my friends had expressed doubts whether my courtesy had not been carried to excess. I had the happiness soon to convince them that good manners and plain dealing were not incompatible. Upon this occasion I intreat Your Excellency will excuse the freedom which I take of sending with this extracts of Letters written by me in answer to applications from foreign Gentlemen for employment and promotion in the Army;(4) the same sentiments have always governed my replies in private oral importunities. I have carefully avoided amusing or flattering any of them.  I have often regretted the hesitation and indecision of our Representatives, on some occasions, and perhaps as often, their precipitancy on others respecting foreign Officers-as a free Citizen I hold myself warranted to speak with decent freedom of the conduct of those whom I have appointed my Attornies, respectful animadversion tends to produce reformation.  From the fluctuations which I allude to have sprung, to speak in the mildest terms, many inconveniencies. Your Excellency's experience may call them Evils. The dilemma to which we are now reduced in the case of the elder Lanuville is one instance; if encouragements tantamount to promises are of any weight this Gentleman must receive a Brevet to rank Brigadier General the middle of next Month.(5) At his first arrival he presented a Memorial in which was set forth the vast expence which had attended his voyage & journey to York Town.(6) He solicited the grade above mentioned or an immediate negative; intimating that in the latter case he would return to his own Country. A direct Answer was not return'd, he was amused from time to time: an increase of expence and the plea of flattering hopes strengthened his claim. At length he was put into a state of probation. Certificates which he produced of his abilities and assiduities in the character of \""Inspector of the Northern Army\"" were expressed in terms somewhat higher than merely favorable.(7) I eyed the Paper signed by General Parsons with some degree of jealousy as I read it, but it did not become me to paraphrase, and it passed unnoticed by every body else. On this ground I have said, he must obtain the Brevet in a few days; you would smile Sir if I were to repeat the principle upon which the delay is founded. This Gentleman is now gone with an intention to act as a Volunteer in the suite of Marquis de la Fayette, and I understand him, he means soon to return to France.  The younger de Lanuville your Excellency is informed has ob-  tained a Brevet to rank Major-what title had he to this promotion?(8) Were I to draw the Gentleman into comparison with Major Gibbs and many other worthy Officers, I should answer, none. But he has only a Brevet. Your excellency is appriz'd of the restrictions on that kind of Commission by an Act of Congress of the 30th of April (9) and I trust the good sense of my Countrymen will lead them to reflect and distinguish properly, and to make some allowances.  Your Excellency will discover in one or more of the extracts the strong desire of French Gentlemen for printed Commissions. I dont know what peculiar advantage they might have had in view but in opposition to them and even to some attempts here, I have always confin'd myself to the mode of a simple Certificate in pursuance of the Resolve of Congress referr'd to in each case.  In the first conversation I had the honor of holding with Monsr. Girard with a view of learning what reception those French Gentlemen had met, who had return'd some 8 or 9 months ago, murmuring and dissatisfied to France; I took occasion to signify my concern for the disappointment which some of them had suffer'd, and in honor of Congress made brief recitals of Commissions granted to many French Officers now in the Army, observing that it had been impossible to gratify the wishes of every one for promotion. Mr. Girard reply'd His Court had seen with pain so many Frenchmen applying for permission to resort to the American Army, and that very few had receiv'd encouragements; the Court were sensible that crowds of foreigners pressing for Commissions would tend to embarrass Congress, that since his arrival at Philada. he had been solicited in many instances for recommendations, every one of which he had refused to listen to and added I might rest satisfied, Congress would never be troubled with Petitions under his auspices. In this sensible declaration methinks I discern sound Policy, be that as it may it will in some measure relieve Congress. I most earnestly wish our noble friend the Marquis could be persuaded to adopt the determination of Monsr. Girard.  Very soon after I shall have the pleasure of conversing with Baron Stuben, his pursuits-in the journey to Court will be known to me.(l0) I shall be equally explicit on my part and your Excellency shall be as candidly informed, if it shall appear to be necessary.  On Thursday the sixth of August Congress will receive Monsr. Girard in his public character. Your Excellency will find within the copies of the intended Address of the Minister and Answer of the Representatives of the thirteen United States of America. (11) Speaking as a Citizen I cannot forbear disclosing to you Sir, that there is a reluctance in my Mind to acknowledgments of obligation or of generosity where benefits have been, to say the least, reciprocal-this Opinion has not been formed since I read the Address and Answer,   as I am warranted to say from the Extract of a Letter to Monsr. Du Portail.  After hours of disputation shall be exausted the point will remain moot.  Among other Papers I take the liberty of inclosing copy of a curious performance of a Mr. Maduit which is believed to be genuine.(12) If he is not delirious at the present time, his friends must conclude that he was raving from 1774 to the commencement of the present Year, time employed by him in dinning the Coffee houses with his cries against the Inhabitants of these States and against their Claims, down with America! I will not further presume on Your Excellency's moments but to repeat that I continue with the most sincere and respectful attachment and the highest Esteem, Sir, Your Excellency's &c.  ""

The confidence we ought to repose in public authority, and the respect due to it, should prevent our forming hasty judgments, or passing unguarded censures upon its measures. A writer in yesterday's paper infiuenced, I have no doubt, by very laudable motives, thinks the Executive (Council inexcusably negligent, in passing silently over a late attempt to corrupt a Delegate of their State.(1) Justice to those vigilant and upright Magistrates requires it to be known, that they have deliberated upon it with attention and decided with wisdom. No person conversant with law can suppose the attempt direct treason by any statute or act of Assembly, now in force; and would any lover of his country, or friend to mankind, wish to see the doctrine of constructive treason, that engine of tyranny and iniquity, introduced into governments founded in freedom, and reforming the best systems in Europe? I hope not. Besides, Mr. Printer, a very slight attention to the transaction will shew, with what guarded nicety it was managed; how cloathed with circumstances of fairness, and made dependent only on its being reconcileable to principles of conscience and virtue. Every one will have his private opinion of the intent, but a court of justice must judge of the whole-can presume nothing, and must make a strict construction of penal laws Hence we see how difficult it is even in Britain, that hot bed of venality and corruption, to detect and punish offences of this nature, notwithstanding the many salutary laws for that purpose. Ineffectual exertions of power weaken and disgrace government-the wise Magistrate will ever avoid them, nor aim his blow without at least a moral certainty of hitting his mark. Upon these principles, and others equally weighty, the Council resolved to leave Governor Johnstone to the infamy attending detected baseness, and both he and his instruments the consciousness of having well deserved it-A line of conduct which they did not adopt with due consideration, and which I am bold to say is justified by many respectable opinions in this city.  A Signer of the Association. AUGUST 1, 1778  MS not found; reprinted from John Dunlap's The Pennsylvania Packet, or the General Advertiser, August 1, 1778.  1 For the censure directed at the Pennsylvania Council that was printed in the July 30 issue of Dunlap's Pennsylvania Packet and to which Reed is here responding, see Reed to Timothy Matlack, July 30, 1778, note.

  Dear General Philadelphia 2 Augt. 1778. I was in your Debt. It is my Fate always to be so with my Friends. But beleive me my Heart owes Nothing. Let me add that you can do me no Favor so great as to comply with your Wishes except an Opportunity to serve the Public which indeed is your highest Wish as you have evidenced fully to all the World & particularly to your Friends. I feel the full Force of your Reasoning.(1) The Faith of Congress is in some Measure plighted to Mr. De la Neuville but it is not their Intent that his Brevet shall give Command. I will take care to get this expressed by a particular Resolution.(2) The Baron has a Claim from his Merit to be noticed but I never will consent to grant what I am told he requests & I think Congress will not. At least they wont if I can help it. I this Instant was informed of the Opportunity for Camp which goes immediately. Let me however congratulate you on the Affair at Monmouth. On the whole Affair. It might have been better it is said. I think not for you have even from Your Enemies the Honor of that Day. You have Enemies. It is happy for you that you have. A Man of Sentiment has not so much Honor as the Vulgar suppose in risquing Life & Fortune for the Service of his Country. He does not Value them as highly as the Vulgar do. Would he give the highest evidence let him sacrifice his Feelings. In the History of last Winter Posterity will do you Justice. Adieu.  Beleive me sincerely yours, Gouv Morris  ""

Charles Chace is just taken Sick of a Dysentery & Something of a fever. Whither he will be bad is uncertain but I hope he will not. He seems at present pretty bad for the time. Mr. Wentworth is not yet arrived here from York Town where I formerly wrote you I left him Sick, nor have I heard from him for a week past, he was geting better when I last heard from him.

However I have as yet Enjoyed my health very well by the favor of Providence and hope I shall Continue so to Do.  I wish you would inform me what letters you Receive from me, that I may Know whither any of them miscarry.  I have no important news to inform you of.

  Dear Sir, 4th August 1778. In a confusion of papers I cannot make a particular acknowledgement of your favors according to their dates.

  Dear Sir 5th August [1778] The date of my last private Address which went by Messenger Sharp is the 15th July.  I have now in view Your Excellency's several favors of the 28th May, 17th June and 6th July.(1)  Nothing has been done in the arrangement since the return of Congress to Philada. and it appears to me that nothing will be done while the Army continues migrative. I am very sensible Your Excellency will in the mean time have experienced much inconvenience and trouble from the demands of our local Continental Officers for Commissions. The terms in which our Carolinian Regiments were originally established, as far as I know, are singular and entitle the officers to claim all the benefits which were held up to them- and I am persuaded Congress will not contend the point when fully and clearly explained, but every attempt to this end has been overrul'd by the repeated reply \""we cannot interfere in or consider these mat- AUGUST 5, 1778  ters until the Army Arrangement is finished.\"" From this consideration, and from that of the peculiar circumstances of the troops in our State, I am also persuaded that Congress will not censure the Executive, should they advise Your Excellency to grant so many Commissions as shall appear to be absolutely necessary. I am farther confirmed in this opinion from the silence of the house when they were informed that Your Excellency had granted from necessity a few Commissions subsequent to the Act of the 31st Decr.(2) And theretore I shall inclose with this 20 signed Commissions, submitting these and my private sentiments to your Excellency s final determination referring at the same time to the Act above mention'd compared with the circumstances of our Regiments.  The testimony from Captain Senff is extreamly wanted; (3) from the late humiliations of Great Britain I shall not be surpris'd to see by one of the first Packets a ratification of the Convention of Saratoga, immediately after which, the remaining troops will be hurried away; and from the repeated breaches of faith in the Ministers and officers of that Nation I shall be as little surprized to hear that those troops had immediately landed in New York or Charlestown; admitting the practicability and their opinion of the utility of such an Act.  I am much affected by the relation of my fellow Citizens conduct in opposition to your Excellency's Proclamation of the 13 th of June. (4) The Act of Congress upon which that Proclamation was founded was well intended, but it passed after much contention and proves to be the most unpleasing to the states in general of any determination of Congress within my experience. There is a distinction made by Tories between moral private honor and Political honor in the practice of which Men of the first Character have been detected and driven to a necessity for explaining in order to preserve some Character which has rendered every Man coming within the description suspicious in the highest degree. It would be tedious and probably unnecessary at this date to adduce particular proofs in the conduct of General Sir William Howe, Sir H. Clinton, Sir Wm. [i.e., George] Johnstone, Governor Franklin and twenty etcetera. Nevertheless nobody here thinks your Excellency was faulty in pursuing the Recommendation of Congress in terms of the Proclamation, and by advice of the Privy Council.  I was well aware the embargo would press heavily on our State, and upon that occasion I desired to deliver my sentiments to Congress from the Chair. Your Excellency may rest assured I shall watch the earliest opportunity for recommending to Congress a revocation of the Act. In the mean time it may merit our attention whether other states pay that implicit obedience to such an Act of Congress as we do in South Carolina and our future submission with or without Remonstrance may be warranted by the discoveries which shall be made.  AUGUST 5, I 778  The General Gazette of the 4th Augt. will shew Your Excellency what respect has been paid to the Resolve of Congress by this State. I am determin'd to introduce Vice President Bryan's Proclamation into the house;(5) Your Excellency shall be duly and as speedily as possible inform'd of the reception which my application shall meet with. My Countrymen will Act accordingly. I must do them the justice to say, they have hitherto acted with as much uprightness and fidelity in the common cause of the Union as any State of the thirteen. I will say nothing that shall appear to be invidious, altho' I ave feelings against the expressing of which I can scarcely resist.  My Ideas relative to the views of the Court of Madrid were exploded at the time of reading the Treaties with France. I eneavoured to impress them upon the mind of my Colleague the Chief Justice, and now the Eyes of many Gentlemen begin to be opened. Part of Your Excellency's Letter from the words \""I am extrearmly appy to the words \""I mean to the public\"" I presented to Congress: 'twas extreamly approv'd of, and committed, instead of saying to the grave, I will only intimate that no Report has been made thereon.(6) Your Excellency \""would be very unwilling to change situations with me undoubtedly, and for very obvious reasons. Nevertheless I ave a thousand times wished most anxiously, and do at this instant ardently wish that you were here a Representation from South Carolina either with or without me. Yourself, Sir, and a few more whom could name, without meaning to disparage the present Delegates or any individual of them, are extreamly wanted in General Congress. is remark excites very serious reflections in my mind, important perhaps beyond your Excellencys apprehensions, but I feel a necessity for reserving a disclosure to a future opportunity. Happy shall I be to see such amendments in Public Measures as will render disclosure unnecessary-I esteem the capture of Bachop and Osborne a fortunate stroke in favor of all the States. Georgia and South Carolina receive the most immediate benefit.(7)  ""

  My Dear Friend 7th August [1778] I am compel'd as usual to refer you for news to His Excellency the President, and to Newspapers which will accompany this.  Since my last of the 15th Ulto. I have received your obliging favors of the 2nd and 6th of that Month.(1)  I am well satisfied with your determination respecting Monsr. Jaussaud; I have a long Letter from Mr. Delagaye but tis French, and I have not yet read it.  Your Packet to Colonel Laurens is gone after him, perhaps it may overtake him at Rhode Island(2) where he is sent by his General, with private orders and Messages to General Sullivan and probably to Count d'Estaing. I am glad he is found useful and to be trusted with important charges. AUGUST 7, 1778  I tell you my dear friend, our situation which you say \""is certainly much more promising\"" is not what you believe it to be; don't start when I say it is deplorable. I am sorry for Pompey and Tom. You judge right with respect to Cuffy and March. Mr. Bayley & all the rest of my affairs are under your direction and controul. Whatever you have done, or shall do respecting those affairs will meet my thanks. If you have paid Mr. Blundell, a dead loss of the sum will be sustained.  Dispose of Lewis Roux as you shall judge most for his advantage, consistently with his inclinations and also with his circumstances. I cannot expect to see him before the middle of December.  The Act of Congress in favor of Tories reformed was well intended but has produced no good effects,(3) indeed from experience I am now of opinion that the most honest men amongst them do not hold themselves bound by any promises made to the most honest Men among those whom they stile Rebels; the latter, therefore, are guilty of falling in the extreme when they trust them. You know, Sir, I had formerly more charity for my neighbours & for Mankind in general. It is but of late that I have learn'd of the distinction establish'd by our Enemies between moral and political honor, however, I do not say there is not one of the persons called Tories whom I would not rely upon. There are certainly exceptions. Captain James Willings' expedition will end as I prognosticated in the beginning of it. These States will incur a heavy debt, loss of lives, and receive no kind of benefit from it. It was the project of a private Member without the knowledge of Congress-a Member who has done and does what he pleases.(4)  The name of new hope is very applicable to a Plantation whose buildings and improvements have been burned and destroy'd.  Bachop certainly promis'd me he would never bear Arms against America, provided he was allow'd to return to St. Augustine on his Parole, but I presume he has been regularly exchanged-even in that case from repeated declarations which he made to me he is very criminal for cruising upon our Coast-pray has he repaid the money I advanced him?  Your President is not unpopular in Congress. I am sorry he is so, as you say at home. A sound conscience shields the Mind against all attacks of tongues and Pens.(5)  I am rejoyc'd to learn of Mrs. Gervais's perfect recovery. I salute her and the children with my best Respects-I grieve for your friend the elder Mr. Trapier.  Well but Sir! surely such full tables as I perceive mask'd in your Letter of the 6th of July is not a proof of unpopularity.  If Monsr. Galvan is looking for promotion, he takes the wrong road.(6)  You will be inform'd by His Excellency the President my Ideas  about the Embargo-this was also a well calculated and well design'd Act of Congress, but abuses are creeping in.(7) I shall be as attentive as possible, and upon the earliest discovery ring an Alarm. I beg you will present my best Compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Manigault. I hope to find time for writing to my worthy old friend next week. Remember me also to every other friend, and be assured I remain with the highest esteem and affection Dear Sir &c.  P.S. Have you sold my last years' Indigo? and for how much. If you have not purchas'd the Negroes woolen cloathing yet, delay a Month or so, or until I write again on the subject.  Mr. Drayton two days ago told me a story which almost surpris'd me, that General Gadsden has again endeavour'd to injure me, by a groundless charge or insinuation, that I had presented the Letter, intimating the resignation of his Commission, either improperly in the manner, or at an improper time. All his suspicions have been equally unjust, but it has not always been in my power to prove it as I shall do in the present case. His resignation was tendered to Congress the 2nd of October by Mr. Hancock. I was order'd in the Chair the 1st of November. It is true I said nothing upon the occasion; neither did any Member in the house, except those who said \""accept it,\"" \""accept it,\"" I was not one of them. I should have been very cautious had it been put to a vote, even of giving my voice against it. 'Tis probable I should have withdrawn upon such an occasion-the risk of offending would have been equal on either side. When Mr. Gadsden was in the service I now am in, he knows, I endeavoured to assist and serve him & God knows I never attempted to undervalue or depreciate him-if he had had any foundation for censuring me, he should have communicated his complaints directly to myself or have reserv'd them to be communicated at my return instead of such generous procedure, he has, according to his custom stabb'd me in conversations and private letters. It was by mere accident I learn'd his discourteous, injurious, attempts, from Mr. Drayton, and this, as I said above, but two days ago.(8) I wish you would read every word of this to General Gadsden; it will keep up a consistency in all my conduct towards that Gentleman.(9)  ""

  [August 7, 1778] It is now the 7th of August: what is written above is the product of four or five attempts in Minutes stolen from the hard service of the last three days. The Messenger has been and is detained for my Letters only, I must therefore hasten to conclude.  We have heard nothing late from General Washington or from AUGUST 7, 1778  Count d'Estaing. The Newspaper intimates the landing of 4000 British Troops from New York at Rhode Island, this is probably a mistake.  General Putnam from the Army informs me that Deserters were daily coming in, generally ten per day. A Green coat Captain and a British Cornet of Horse among them.  We do not yet know the result of General Lee's tryal.  I have been many days under that kind of anxiety which I felt during our debates on motion for detaining Lieut General Burgoyne and his Convention troops. I then feared he would slip through our fingers into this City-now from an unaccountable delay on our part I dread losing the proper time for treating the British Commissioners according to their deserving. In the Acts and attempts of Governor Johnstone I charge the whole with having offered the highest possible affront to a virtuous, Independent Nation by attempting to bribe their Representatives in Congress. I have therefore much at heart a desire that Congress should resolve to hold no conference with such Men, to assign their reasons in ample decent language and to transmit the Act by a flag to the Commissioners in New York and make them the bearers of their own disgrace. (1) They will not dare to suppress the Resolve, they must lay it before their Court, it will soon descend to the public at large, and expose themselves and their Prompters to the resentments of a deluded and much injur'd People, whose deplorable circumstances I must confess affects me. The Commissioners and the group of Politicians who have led on the British Nation to ruin will be held up and scorned at every Court in Europe, & their names will be branded with infamy in history.  If we leave this business to be transacted at our leisure, Governor Johnstone may in the mean time return to Great Britain, there he will confidently deny the fact and charge Congress with a calculated forgery. I am for attacking him immediately, Letters in hand, his guilt will be fix'd, for he cannot now deny.  I am not commonly tenacious of my own opinions, but in the present case I feel as if I clearly foresaw many good effects resulting from a proper Act on our part, I am therefore, day by day urging my Colleague Drayton to force a Resolve for this purpose, which he has had in his pocket more than a fortnight.(2)  The Captain Hawker, formerly the Instrument for Mr. Collector Moore at Charlestown lately Commander of the British frigate Mermaid is now in Goal with his Officers and Crew under the law of retaliation. I have lost or mislaid a Note which he sent to me a few days ago, but from my Answer which Your Excellency will find among other Papers the purport may be gathered-he has address'd to Congress in a Memorial (3) signed by himself and his Officers pray-  ing (4) for enlargement on parole-this has found able advocates and as strong an opposition, Mr. Drayton is firm against it.(5)  This instant we hear two articles of intelligence of some importance-a Gentleman from New York says, a fire had happen'd in that City which had consumed upwards of 200 houses, among which were some store houses full of Kings' stores, and that five store ships with their lading were also burnt.  That Admiral Byron with four British Men of War and supposed Cork fleet were on the coast, the Admiral had sent a frigate before him, this frigate or her barge had been up to the city, Sir Henry Clinton had confer'd with the Commander, and that a thousand hogsheads of Water were immediately filled and ship'd.  We shall soon learn particulars of these crude accounts-I believe neither of them are groundless, and begin to have some fears I may properly say, rather strengthened than beginning that the British fleet will be an overmatch for that of our Ally's in this Quarter- there is also a rumour that we have taken Rhode Island out of the hands of the Enemy; this I regard only as report.  A discovery having been made of frauds in the Accounts of the Deputy Commissary General of Military Stores, he was arrested and committed to Goal; there, he made some confessions and charg'd the Commissary General, hitherto a Gentleman of very fair character, as a tempter and accomplice. Congress had directed the Board of War to arrest and safely keep him also-the Board proceeded not with proper vigor and wrote such a letter to the house as is deemd a disobedience of Orders and an high insult. The adjusting this troublesome affair will much retard business of the greatest importance-it has already cost us two days, stagnated correspondence with the Board, and is not ended.  I will trespass no longer upon Your Excellencys' time but to repeat, that I am with very great Respect and Regard, Sir, Your Excellencys' Obedt. Servt.  P.S. While I was signing to the preceding Page, Monsr. Girard very politely transmitted to me the Treaty of Alliance general & defensive between the King of France and the \""Laudable Helvetique Body\"" or Swiss Cantons concluded the 28th May 1777 sign'd by the King on one part, and by Deputies from the thirteen Cantons and seven free States in Alliance with them, on the other. This was sworn to or finally ratified the 25th of August following; until this event France had not acknowledged the Independence of the Helvetic Body but in all their former correspondencies had treated with them as parts of the German Empire-an annecdote known to very few in Europe or America.  I view this, an Act preparatory to acknowledging the Indepen-  dence of America, although I will not hazard my conjecture with the Minister.  With this Treaty Mr. Girard sent me a ponderous and beautiful silver Medal struck upon the above occasion. On one face the Kings head encircled Ludovicus XVI Franc. et Nar. Rex.-on the other- Foedus Cum Helvetiis Restauratum Et Stabilitum, MDCCLXXVII, and ornamented by a Garland or wreath of Olive Branches.  The States are Zurich, Berne, Lucerne, Ury, Schwitz, Underwald le haut, Underwald le bas, Zug, Glaris Evangelique, Glaris Catholique, Basle, Fribourg, Soleure, Schaffouse, Appenzell, Abbe de SaintGall, Ville de Saint-Gall, Vallais, Mulhause, Bienne.  I have also just learn'd that upon the appearance of the French fleet near Rhode Island the Enemy set fire to the King Fisher Man of War and two of their Gallies and abandoned them. The vessels were totally consumed-some of their regiments which had been stationed on Connecticut side also retired into the Garrison at Rhode Island, where they are now about 5000 strong-we now know where they are. When the Marquis de la Fayette shall have joined General Sullivan, an immediate attack will be made-we may expect to hear somewhat important in a few days.  I sincerely condole with Your Excellency and Mrs. Lowndes. Your experience Sir, will point out the true way of softening and reconciling every stroke of Providence.(6)  Papers inclosed to Mr. Lowndes-  Copies of Letters from G.W. 14th, 17th, and 22nd July (7)  Mr. Maduits Paper (8)  Account of forces in England and Scotland  The Answer to Captain Hawker  Report of Treasury, sums advanc'd to staff officers  Mr Girard's Address to Congress  The President's Answer  His Most Christian Majesty's Letter to Congress (9)  Twenty Army Commissions  The damage by fire at New York is ascertained to be confined to 120 houses including Stores, a great quantity of Wine, and a very large quantity of King's stores destroy'd-only two Vessels burnt which happen'd to be aground. The Account of the Arrival of Byron's fleet is groundless.(l0)  ""

  Dear Sir 7th August [1778] I am indebted for your very obliging favor of the 13th of June which I had intended to answer in all its parts with that respectfulness and attention which is due to it, but that is now impossible. I have not many minutes allowed for writing this. Permit me then briefiy to say your Ideas and mine with respect to slavery appear to me, from your expressions, to accord. AUGUST 8, 1778  We shall, I hope, talk this matter over before Christmass to our mutual satisfaction. In the mean time, let it suffice to repeat my thanks for all you have done for me.  Inclosed with this you will receive the latest Newspapers, and also a letter to Mr. Burnet (1) which you'l be pleased to peruse, and then seal and deliver it.  Count d'Estaing's arrival at Rhode Island, obliged the Enemy to burn the King Fisher Man of War and two of their Gallies, and to call in all their out Posts-they are now about 5000 strong in Garrison on the Island, these will soon be attacked by General Sullivan, aided by the French fleet and about 3000 French Troops. The Army of the Allies will then amount to about 8000 commanded by some of our very best officers. We must with patience wait the event.  General Washington closely hems Sir Henry Clinton within his lines upon New York Island, except such of them as come off as deserters, these are seldom less than 8 or 10 a day.  I have hopes we shall be in a state of Peace, in a few months. Neither the French nor English had declared War the 28th of May, although hostilities are committed by each party against the other as effectually as if War was actually declared.  The general voice of England from the latest Accounts appear to be for declaring these States Independent-and those from Men who had hurried the People of that much deluded Nation into ruinous measures are paving the way for reconciling the minds of the Public to an event which one year ago they affected to treat with scorn.  Adieu, Good Sir, I wish you health and all happiness and am with great Respect, Your Most Obedt. Servant.  P.S. Please to let Mr. Burnet have the perusal of the Newspapers.  ""

  My dearest Love, Princeton August 8th 1778 Can you imagine my disappointment on arriving here this Evening after a very hot & disagreeable ride, and finding that I must be deprived of what I had foolishly set my Heart on. However I am now perfectly satisfied, as I would rather have taken two such rides than that you should have exposed your Health. I had agreed to come this Jaunt with Mr. Ch. Justice Drayton-but he gave up the Scheme on Friday Evening, and lest you should have your ride for nought, I set off & came alone. The Sieur Gerard Minister plenipo- AUGUST 8, 1778  tentiary had engaged me to attend him to the Valley Forge, and politely put it off till Tuesday that I might see you this Evening.  I have many Thanks to address to you as well as many additional Obligations for the several Letters recd this Day by Mr Skinner & Mr Webb-How shall I repay you-it can only be by loving you with a still more ardent affection if possible. On Thursday we gave the Sieur Girard his Publick Audience. The Ceremony as follows. Our President was Seated in a Mahogany armed Chair on a Platform raisd about two feet with a large Table coverd with Green Cloth & the Secretary along side of him.  The Members were all seated round within the Bar, and a large Armed Chair in the middle opposite to the President for the Plenipo. At twelve oClock-our State Coach & Six waited on the Minister at his Quarters. He was proceeded by his own Chariott & two with his Secretaries. The Minister was attended by two Members who introduced him thro' the Crowd & seated him in the Chair. He then sent to the President (by his Secretary) the Letter from the King of France to Congress, which was opened & read aloud first in French & then in English. It was then anounced to the House by the waiting Member, that the Stranger introduced was the Minister Plenipotentiary from his most Christian Majesty, upon which the Minister arose & bowed to the President & then to the House, and the House rising returned the Compliment. The Minister then addressed the Congress, and was answered by the President-On which the Bowing again took Place and the whole Concluded. (1) A publick Dinner succeeded at which was a Band of Musick and the firing of Cannon. The whole was plain, grand & decent. The Minister was much pleased as well as the Audience.  Enclosed is a return for some Land which I wish Elisha to go & see & let me know the Value of it-any surveyor there can inform him where it lies.  You do not tell me how Mrs. Caldwell is, pray let me know it.

You will see the Minister has recd. his Audience and those eventual Engagements containd. in the Treaty of Alliance have now been declared by both parties to have become possitive.  This is the Day assignd. to strike a blow at Rhodeisland. Should it succeed the Event would be important but I was this Morning informd. by Mr. Barns. Dean who arived in Town last Night that Lord Howe saild. from the Hook for Rhodeisland last Thursday; that he was superior to the Count D'Estaing in point of Number tho inferior in other respects. This acct. he had from Genl Maxwell as he came along. I understood from him that the Enemy had recd. AUGUST 10, 1778  some Reinforcements of Ships tho other very late Accts. we have had from persons who have been in New York say that no Reinforcements have arrived, how the truth is remains uncertain. That you will know before this reaches you. Cornelious Sweers who is now in Goal has since you left this City wrote a Leter to the president in which he confesses some part of the Charge against him. He says that he has altered some Accts &c: that he purchased a Number of Arms and returnd. them into the Stores at a greater price than he gave and that Col. Flowers was equally concerned with him in this and every fraud he may have been guilty off in that Department- he refers to some papers which he says will tend to evince the Matter (those papers I have not seen). In Consiquence of this Col. Flowers 15 now under an arrest by Order of Congress. How it will appear upon examination I cant pretend to say. A Comtee. is appointed to take Sweers's Examination upon Oath in the Matter: a Measure this I dont very well approve off; for should Col. Flowers be acquited perhaps Sweers may avail himself by haveing given his Deposition. This was objected but it was carried notwithstanding (1)  Nothing is yet done in Regard to our Currency. The Report from the Treasury Board upon that Subject yet lies on the Table. A special Comtee. have been appointed upon the Matter of Arrainging the Treasury who are ready to report.(2) The want of that Report has been assignd. as a Reason for Delaying the other matter. I hope in Consience it will be soon taken up as I think every other Matter is comparatively [but tithing]3 Mint, Annis &c until that is done. The Cloather Generals' Department is in a most wretched Situation- as are our Commercial Affairs and indeed some others by the best Intelligence I can obtain. But of these things I need not inform you.  Mr. Sherman is appointed immediately to repair to the Army for the purpose (with others) of compleating the arraingmt.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 10th Augt. 1778 I agree entirely with you concerning the importance of the confederation, and have never failed to press it. Ten States have ratified-Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland have not, and one of them, Maryland, has adjourned until November, so that the new Congress under the Confederation cannot meet this year at the time proposed by the Confederacy. The inclosed paper contains all the news we have, except that it is well reported that Lord Howe being reenforced by 4 Ships of the Line sailed from N. York on Thursday last with his whole force to Attack the French Squadron now at Rhode Island. Howe has a greater number of Ships, but Count D'Esteing has heavier Metal. The attack by Sea and Land was to be made this day on the enemy at R. Island, where they have 5500 men strongly posted and 3 or 4 frigates. Our force will be about 14000 men besides the Squadron. Success seems certain if Ld. Howe does not get up in time to prevent it. The Count D'Esteing is an Officer of approved merit, and his Ships very strong in every respect, so that I think he will check the British insolence on the Sea as we have already done on the land. No war in Europe on the 10th of June, nor do I believe G. Britain means to resent the proceedings of France. It seems to be a contest between the two Nations which shall be last in declaring War. Some advantages to accrue from Treaties is the cause of this. To us it matters little, since we so powerfully experience the aid of France. For it is certain this Squadron is to Act with and for us so long as the enemy by continuing here renders it necessary. There is great probability that the Emperor of Germany and the King of Prussia will fall out about the Bavarian dominions. Theirs will be a battle of Giants, each party having 300,000 men, the best disciplined Troops in the world. France, I fancy, has taken measures to avoid engaging in this quarrel, that her whole force may be employed against England.  The design against Detroit is abandoned for the present, and a force will be sent into the Indian Country to chastise their late insolences.(1) I heartily wish that the wisdom of our Country may be early next Session employed to regulate our finance, restore public credit, determine about our back lands, and if possible get rid of our public Commerce. If it succeeds with us, I believe it will be the first instance that has ever happened of the kind. But many there are of injury derived from such Trade. Whilst necessity impelled, it was unavoidable, but now that private Commerce will furnish abundance of all things, I incline to think our interest will consist in withdrawing from governmental Trade. Remember me to Mr. Mazzie. I am yours dear Sir very sincerely, Richard Henry Lee(2) AUGUST 10, 1778  ""

  Dear Sir August 10th 1778 Your favor of July 24th is now before me, but the banter of it is not rightly founded, for the superscription told where I was on the 6th of July as plainly as you may know by the present where I am; and I assure you I am not now under the fatigue of a frolic, though by the enclosed Advertiser you may see we have been at it again.  Our letters from the Count d'Estaing and General Sullivan are quite encouraging; but a report prevails that Lord Howe being reinforced is in pursuit of the French Squadron. I hope however that the latter will be well in the harbor of Newport before the former reaches the Island. I do not wish to have any engagement without a considerable superiority on the side of our Allies.  The encouragement which is given by the Count d'Estaing to Privateers, I should think was sufficient to make them ply in the track of his fleet. You did not appear, by your letter, to know what he had declared, which is, that prizes taken in sight of his squadron shall belong entirely to the captors.(1) I am quite chagrined that we have not a force of ships ready to join the Count immediately-4 or 5 days are of immense importance, nay the fate of Rhode Island may depend upon 24 hour's preparation on our part. The French fleet begins to grow sickly, to want the refreshment of an encampment for a few weeks. I notice your remarks upon the Navy Board but you know times and seasons are to be watched here and I do not find that your ideas would thrive at this period, if I was to strive to cultivate them I will not miss any right occasion I assure you. Mr D has had no formal conversation with C____ ss(2) but I expect something of the kind soon-but it is a difficult matter to communicate any thing to you on that head without being minute and exposing myself to disagreeable chances of the fate of my letters. The French have not a proper naval force in the West Indies to enable the General of Martinique to begin operations in that quarter agreeable to instructions sent to him from Europe. I suppose you would choose to reduce Halifax before you undertake the English West India Islands.  Good night, Dear Sir, J.L.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Augst. 10th. 1778. I hope Your Excellency will not impute my omitting to write so long a time to neglect of duty-the true reason was I have had nothing important to write. We have no late account from foreign parts, nor has anything remarkable occurred here. Congress has been employed about the ordinary affairs of the Continent The Minister Plenipotentiary from the Court of France had a public audience last Thursday-the manner of it is contained in the enclosed paper. The operations of War being at the Eastward Your Excellency has earlier intelligence of them than we have here-our affairs wear a prosperous aspect except the currency-I expected it would have been attended to by Congress long before now-but a multiplicity of other affairs have prevented it. I am appointed one of a Committee to repair (to?) (1) the Camp, and assist in the new arrangement of the army.(2) The Indians and more barbarous Tories have desolated our Settlements at Westmoreland. Congress sent two Regiments of Continental troops with some Militia to repel the enemy. The account given in a Poughkeepsie paper is said to be much beyond the truth. Expect to go the Army this week, and from thence intend to go home before I return to this place.  I heartily condole with Your Excellency (on?) the death of your Son the late Commissary General. His great public services deserve a grateful remembrance.(3)  I am with great Esteem, Your Excellency's Obedient humble Servant . Roger Sherman.  ""

  Sir, (private) Philadelphia 11th. Augt 1778 The unexpected Death of the late amiable and I think much injured Commissary Genl. (on which I do most sincerely condole your AUGUST 11, 1778  Excellency) renders it at present impracticable to have any thing done on the Subject of his Accounts; tis my Oppinion something would have been done notwithstand[ing] a late Resolution of Congress:(1) some Gentlemen I know felt that Matter most Sensably: and I beleave Congress themselves (that is a Majority) would have been willing to reconsider that Matter.  I see no prospect of haveing any thing done in favr. of Col. Derricks Mr Hancock on whom he seamd. to have some dependance left Congress soon after my arival.(2) I had therefore no Oppertunity of consulting him upon the Subject but the Objections appear to me at present insurmountable, tis said he went voluntarily out of the Line into the Staff; that the Conduct of that Department was such as not only to Occation great Uneasiness but even endanger the Existance of the Army in Consiquence of which a Court of Inquiry has been ordered by Congress, and tho no particular Objection is made to him: yet the Inquiry extends not only to Genl. Miflin but to the whole Department: it would be altogether improper to advance any Gentlemen from thence while the Inquiry is pending. And besides we have at present many supernumerary Officers in the Line; and a Comtee. Of Arraingment appointed to reduce the Number so that it becomes impossible to introduce any new Officers without turning out some of our own against whom there is not the least Objection: I am very sorry for the particular Situation of Col Derricks: but I know of no other Way at present for his Employ in the Army unless he can be again introduced into the Staff By an Application to Genl. Green who is at the head of the Quartermaster's Department. The Commissary Genl. of Military Stores & his first Deputy are now under an Arrest by Order of Congress for fraud and Mal-Conduct in the Execution of that Office. The Deputy has confest a part of the Charge and accuses Colo. Flowers the Comisy. Genl. of being concerned with him. The Clothier Genls. Department is in a most wretched Situation as is also some other Branches of our Affairs: many things are conducted very different from what I could wish which it is improper to mention in a Letter. The Deplorable Situation of our Currency I have expected would come under Consideration ever since I have been here, but as yet Nothing has been done. I think every Regulation in vain so long as that is neglected. There is a prospect of its being taken up soon: but I hardly know what to depend upon as to the Course of Business.

  My Dear Sir (1) Philad Augt 11-78 I am quite ashamd that I have not yet acknowledgd the two letters which I have had the Pleasure of receiving from you since I left Boston; you will excuse me when I tell you, I have many Letters, which are daily accumulating, unanswerd, and very little Leisure. This by the Way, must convince you how unfit a Person I am even if I were otherwise qualified, to undertake the important Task you require of me in your last.(2) While I am giving you the true Reason of my Silence, I hope it will not prevent your writing to me by every opportunity. Herein you will lay me under great obligations.  By the late Publications, you have seen, and doubtless have made your own Comments on the epistolary Correspondence between the British Commissioners & Congress. The short Resolution on their last Letter, has put an end to it. Last Week the Minister from France had an Audience in Congress. The Manner of conducting this Ceremony, together with a Letter from his most Christian Majesty and the Speeches of the Minister and the President are publishd in the inclosd News Paper. I have had several opportunitys of seeing him at his own House, and a few days ago, he made a Visit to the Delegates of the Massachusetts who live together. He is easy and polite in his Manners and converses freely without much Ceremony.(3)  Nothing can equal the barefaced Falshood of the Quakers & Tories in this City, unless perhaps their Folly, in giving out that M. Gerard does not come in the Character of a publick Minister, but  AUGUST 11, 1778  only to obtain Pay for the Stores we have receivd from that Country. These Quakers are in general a sly artful People, not altogether destitute, as I conceive, of worldly Views in their religious Profession. They carefully educate their Children in their own contracted Opinions and Manners, and I dare say they have in their Heads as perfect a System of Uniformity of Worship in their Way, and are busily employd about spiritual Domination as ever Laud himself was, but having upon professed Principle renouncd the Use of the carnal Weapon, they cannot consistently practice the too common Method made Use of in former times, of dragooning Men into sound Beliefe. One might submit to their own inward Feelings, whether they do not now & then secretly wish for fire from Heaven in support of their Cause, in order to bring them upon a footing with those whose Consciences dictate the kindling fires on Earth for the pious Purpose of convincing Gainsayers, and who keep the Sword in their Hands to enforce it. He who in the Spirit of the Apostle professes to wish Peace to all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity, must discover an unmortified Pride & a Want of Christian Charity to destroy the peace of others who profess to have that sincere Affection to the Common Master, because they differ from him in Matters of mere opinion-But the Post is just going.

  Dear Tucker Philadelphia August 11th. 1778 Your letter upon the planetary System was ingenious, and possessed eminently what is not generally reckoned a Perfection on writing, Obscurity. Yet so much was I interested in the Subject that the Obscure became clear, & all was unfolded to my mental eye. It is a strange Planet whose Influence some People live under. It attracts but is not attracted. I wish in your deep Researches & persevereing attention you could find out a Remedy for this Phenomenon.  You are versed in the doctrine of mutual attraction, but in the instance here alluded to I am & I fear must remain a Stranger to this vivifying Principle. I wish on a certain occasion a certain Luminary could add to the splendor that I know will brighten the Banks of the old Appomattox. I am determined to be there. How much are you to be envied ! In a fair way to possess the very object your Soul holds the most dear. Can any Prospect of the future more elevate the Mind? I do not expect to see you under the etherial Seale of spirits this Seven years. Tomorrow I go to Camp, at the White Plains, on business delegated by Congress.(1) This will be a pleasing Jaunt after a long confinement in this hot Place; And yet I really do not dislike Philadelphia. There is such a variety of Company especially of the fair \""Sex\"" that it is with all its inconveniences supportable. It may be indured, But I long more than ever Swiss did to revisit my native Land; and rejoin my amiable Connections. What astonishing Events have crouded together in our favour within a few Weeks.  In the Spring every department of the Army was distressed, our Success doubtful, the Enemy near us with a powerful & well appointed Army.  Our's small, naked, unprovided, in no good expectation that things would be better. The alliance with France not expected, the Continental Money Daily Sinking in value from a bad opinion generally entertained of the Event, and other Causes naturally producing that Effect.  The Army liable to attack & yet incapable of Motion for the want of Waggons, Horses, &c. and thro a total derangement in the Q. Masters Department. In this extremity this Office was filled by a new appointment, & the business entrusted to other Hands.  The Army which had been in iminent danger several times of starving was now by the appointment of a new Commissary put into a way of being supplied. These measures Taken the Month of April elapsed, & May ushered in the joyful account of the treaty of alliance with France.  This gave Life & animation to every thing. The Army recruited. AUGUST 11, 1778  Supplies became certain instead of being precarious. Discipline began to prevail, & the Month of May had not expired before the attack of our Army in its Camp would have been madness, tho but a few Weeks before such an attempt might have been made with a full assurance of Success. But Providence saved us here again. I think we should be grateful, for I am clear in his interposition. How do you like the doctrine my Friend?  The next favourable Event was the Enemy's determination to evacuate this City. The good Effect of this Resolution expanded itself 'thro all Order of Men & Produced an amazing change in the Minds of the wavering & undetermined.  To this succeeded our Victory at Monmouth, & then the arrival of the Fleet under the command of the Count D'Estaing.  This force is now employed against Rhode Island in conjunction with a formidable Body of Land Forces. If this attempt proves Successful I think the Remainder of the Coflict will be easy to us.

  [August 11, 1778] I yesterday had the honor to make an important motion which I had during many days waited for an opportunity of introducing. To my mortification it was postponed-& I regard the decision as fatal to it. Thus am I reduced to the necessity of hurrying forward another motion which I prepared as a consequence of the first. The importance of the subject & rapid progress of time will not allow me to delay it: in my humble opinion, the subject has already been too long passed over in silence. I beg leave to read the motion & having done so, I will make a very few observations to shew that propriety which in my humble opinion will have already appeared self evident.  Sir, it cannot be doubted but that Gover. Johnstone in the particulars of his conduct stated in the motion, has made a plain, direct & base attempt to corrupt this honourable body-to induce us to betray that inestimable charge which the Free & virtuous Citizens of America have hardened with their blood & committed to our care. Nor can it be doubted but that Congress do most sensibly feel the attack upon their integrity. Their honor calls upon them to resent it. I trust it is their inclination to do so, & in the most pointed manner. Censure Governor Johnstones conduct in the strongest terms-hold him up to present age & the latest posterity as an object o£ universal detestation-cut off all communication with a person who has dared to seduce you; a Virgin so attacked must do this or she will be thought to hesitate, & in danger of being lost-cut off also all communication with a company of Men, who act in concert, who come  AUGUST 11, 1778  Photographic reproduction of George Johnstone's Declaraion 426 AUGUST 11, 1 778 from the same school of venality-who come to transact the same business-and among whom is one who vainly has stepped forth & attempted to corrupt you in order to procure their common object. Your injured honor, your interest demand such a conduct on your part-your constituents require it-the world expect it.  As to the point of honor I have said enough. With regard to the point of interest, I say the avowed purpose of sending out these Commissioners was to unite your enemies-to divide your friends. You have now a fair opportunity to turn the tables upon those who would destroy you-cut off all communication with the Commissioners because of their recent conduct, & you cover your enemies with infamy, divide them & unite your friends. Demonstrate to the People of Britain by a light as the meridian glare, that their affairs are conducted by Men dead to a sense of virtue, & that they plundered for the purpose of corruption. By such a light let our own people determine what conduct they ought to pursue. You have long experienced their judgment-you know you can rely upon it.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Augst.11th. 1778 Since my arrival at Congress nothing of a public nature has presented to furnish the subject of a letter that your Excellency would not be apprized of by the public papers more fully & at large than you could in a private letter. The removal of Congress from Yorktown, & the reception of the French Minister have engrossed a great part of our time, the remainder has been spent principally in the common routine of business, which arises daily, and the very necessary to be done, could not deserve Your Excellency's attention in the recital. The extreme heat of the season which threw me into a slight fever on the road confined me several days & having kept me in a feverish habit ever since, hath obliged me to be cautious of writing, or applying to any business or exercise tending to increase it.  Congress are very industrious, yet many affairs of great importance are crowded out & postponed by an inevitable attention to events & business constantly arising; & although I have nothing of consequence to inform you of which they have done I have many things I can mention which they have not done-they have not taken into consideration the state of our paper currency-nor devised any means to stop the headlong current of depreciation. They have not settled their accts. with the Army-the Commissary Genls., the Quarter Master Genls., the Clothier Genl., the Commercial Committee, or any other large Department. They have not settled any mode by & in which they can call their great servants authoritatively to account for the expenditure of public monies-they have not constituted and empowered a Board of Treasury-nor a Marine Board-though each seems to be generally allowed to be necessary to release the attendance of members of Congress, & give them leisure to attend to more general & necessary business which can be done only in Congress or by its Members. All these matters are in prospect and are to be attended to as soon, and as fast as other business will admit; yet I fear AUGUST 11, 1778  much time will elapse before they are brought to a conclusion. I beg leave to condole with Your Excellency in the loss you have sustained in your amiable son, the late Commissary General. I am sensible your own mind must have suggested every argument and consolation which reason or religion can furnish yet permitt me to express my tender concern, and wish you may be supported under so severe a trial, and that your important loss, may be compensated by spiritual blessings.  I have made it my business since I was here to endeavour to sap the foundation, and overturn that Resolution which forbids issuing money to any person out of office, until his accounts are settled, which appears to me in many cases very unreasonable and had good hopes soon to accomplish it, with the assistance of sundry gentlemen of more experience and weight than I could prevent to, but am now at a loss how to apply it to the advantage of the late Commissary General's accounts, if effected, or what method will be adopted for their settlement; but shall be always happy to contribute all in my power to procure justice to be done to the family and heirs of one, for whom I had so great an esteem and friendship; whom I always believed to possess strict integrity, & to have served his Country with honor and fidelity and great success.  Will Your Excellency be pleased to remember me to Col.

  Dear Sir 11th August [1778] I had the honor of writing to your Excellency under the 5th and 7th by a Messenger from Don Juan de Mirallis, who had very politely permitted me to detain him as long as I should think proper -my public engagements the week last past had rendered it impossible for me to devote much time to private affairs, my letter was therefore performed piecemeal and not finish'd till the 10th.  My present Address will be deliver'd by Captain Pyne, late of the Comet State vessel of War, or, by lieutenant Martin of our regiment, these Gentlemen will in company begin their journey for South Carolina some time today. They arrived here from imprisonment by the Enemy, and were destitute of Money and apparel; they apply'd to me for aid, and with the concurrence of all my present Colleagues, I supply'd out of the fund belonging to South  AUGUST 11, 1778  Carolina, Captain Pyne 1000 Dollars, Lieutenant Martin 940 Dollars, for which sums your Excellency will find his several acknowledgements within this cover.  In my last letter I suggested some apprehensions of receiving shortly a ratification of the Convention of Saratoga. Last night a paper pretended to be a Ratification signed by four of the British Commissioners and usher'd by a Letter of the 7th from Mr. Ferguson their Secretary was sent to me by General Maxwell, the General had received it as he writes by a Flag which had come by an indirect and prohibited road.(1) The whole affair it is to be presumed, is calculated for insulting Congress by a retort on their late resolution that \""no Answer be given to the Commissioners letter of the 11th\"" published by Charles Thomson, Secretary of Congress.(2) In this view it appears trifling with serious matters, admitting their character to come within that description-and in what other light can it be viewed- the Commissioners knew that Congress had resolved that the embarkation of the troops of the Convention should be suspended \""till a distinct and explicit Ratification of the Convention of Saratoga shall be properly notified by the Court of Great Britain to Congress.\"" And those gentlemen have ground for believing that Congress will not hastily depart from important Resolutions. Possibly they may now pretend that their powers from their Court are tantamount-admitting this they ought to have been \""distinct and explicit.\""  What the determination of Congress will be after I shall have presented this paper is uncertain, in the mean time my fears are, that the motion and Resolve which I have so anxiously wish'd will not be effected, or, not with that grace and perspicuity which would have been produced by a deliberate consideration antecedally to the receipt of this outrer illegitimate Remonstrance & requisite. Yesterday I again repeated to the Chief Justice, \""you will by this unaccountable procrastination slip an opportunity of doing justice and honor to your Country.\""  Among other papers which will accompany this Your Excellency Will receive Copy of the Remonstrance and the Secretary's letter; these Papers contain nothing like a distinct explicit Ratification properly notified by the Court of Great Britain to Congress, and therefore I estimate the correspondence and the mode, a calculated Insult; and were I to direct, probably it is best I should not, I wou'd immediately return the whole, accompanied by a few proper lines from Charles Thomson to Adam Ferguson-Nothing has happen'd during the present Contest so embarrassing to the Court of Great Britain as the Resolve of Congress on the suspension. (3) A conformity with the terms will amount to an acknowledgment of our capacity to treat as a Nation-any thing below this will be to retain her claim upon us as Subjects in Rebellion, with whom faith is not to be held  but for the benefit of the Sovereign, as in the exchange of Prisoners; and even in that communication there have been many attempts on the part of our Enemy to exercise arbitrary and cruel impositions. Your Excellency will recollect a recent instance which occasioned the seperation of Commissioners at Germantown who had met for establishing a Cartel.(4)  If the Court shall, from necessity, find her interest in ratifying the Convention in the terms prescribed by Congress, it will then be for us to consider the Articles and to enquire whether the whole have been strictly comply'd with by the contracting powers, and thus, according to strict justice and sound Policy, which are inseperable the work will be to begin.  Admitting these Ideas to be just 'tis not to be doubted, that the Court of Great Britain perceives the dilemma to which she is reduced by a few deeply designing words of her Marionnette, Lieutenant General Burgoyne, who has acknowledged in Parliament that he penned every syllable of his infamous Proclamation and, at the same time declared he had no intention to carry the severe threats contained in it, into execution (5)- she must consequently view the troops of Saratoga as prisoners of War, unless she will engage in a tacit concession of our Independence, and for which, she will be in the judgement of all her European Neighbours-no wonder therefore, that in her entangled situation her Ministers are persevering in practices of ambi-dexterity-and as little that I continue anxiously wishing for the attestations of Captain Senff.(6)  ""

  Sir August 12th. 1778 The Marine Committee of Congress have heard with concern that the Squadron under your Excellency's command was on the 4th instant Supplied with no more than 20 days provisions, but you may be assured Sir, that accident and concurrence of Circumstances, not a want of Zeal and Industry to supply you has hitherto delayed the arrival of Provisions.1 The enclosed paper (2) will shew your excellency what orders have been issued from the Marine Committee on this Subject, with the Measures taken and taking to comply with these Orders. The movement of the Squadron and the Number of the enemies Cruizers, between this place, the great resource of Provisions especially of the Bread kind, rendering a long Land carriage necessary have chiefly produced this delay. In future we hope you  AUGUST 12, 1778  will receive a more regular Supply, except it be of Salt provisions which the want of Salt, the great consumption of the army, and the season of the year, renders scarce and dificult to be obtained.(3) To your wisdom must be left the propriety of Spareing the Salted provisions as much as possible, and useing fresh whilst you remain in a Country capable of furnishing the latter in abundance, but for the reasons above given not well provided with the former at present. A considerable quantity of bread, flour, live Stock, vegetables and water have been put on board the frigate Chimere and the Transports with her, but these I apprehend have not reached the Squadron. The Commissary General has fixed directions to Supply your Excellency from time to time with such quantities of Provisions as you shall call for.(4) I have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest respect and esteem, Sir, Your Excellencies Most obedient Hble servant, Richard Henry Lee,  Chn of the Marine Committee ""

  Dear General (1) Philad. Aug. 12. 1778. I this Morning received your Favour of the 1st Instt. No one I assure you could take a more sincere Part in the Distresses & Apprehensions to which you have been exposed than I did, & I feel no common Pleasure in hearing that the actual Stroke of Desolation & Blood did not reach your Family & Habitation. Every Exertion within the Reach of my small Abilities & Influence was made to forward Relief, tho for my own Part from the Nature of an Indian Irruption I expected little more than to discover to our Friends on the Frontiers that we felt most sensibly for them & were anxious to return some Part of those friendly Offices which in the Hour of our Distress they had rendered us. Offices which I trust will not be for AUGUST 12, 1778  gotten or neglected by the real Whigs in the interiour Country. I am sure I never shall. I must say that our Abilities did not equal our Wishes. The Continental Army has so exhausted all our military Stores, & we have had so little Time to recruit them that when we made the necessary Inquiries we found we could neither arm nor equip Men in Time to give any effectual Assistance by personal Service. The city which you know was formerly our Magazine was as you may suppose utterly destitute & from the Dispersion of our Artificers the Repairs could not be made on the broken Arms of which we had some in Store: Under all these Circumstances we did the best we could in calling off Broadheads Troops then on March to Fort Pitt, recalling Col. Hartley then on March to the Grand Army-ordering such of Pulasky's Horse as could be had to go up to countenance & encourage the unhappy Fugitives. And I must do the Gentlemen in Authority here the Justice to say that both in their importunate Applications to Congress & their own Exertions they discovered all that Anxiety & Concern which so unhappy a Circumstance must create in a feeling Mind. We got Congress to consent to Col Hartleys remaining on the Frontier till the Harvest could be got in & the Minds of the People quieted. But we are all clearly of Opinion with you that a defensive System against Indians is vain & ineffectual. That the War must be carried into their own Country & nothing short of severe Chastisement for their Perfidy & Cruelty will give Security to our Frontiers. Under this Idea two Expeditions are now actually on Foot, one against the Wiandots & others under the Protection of Detroit & the other against the Senecas & Cayugas, from Albany & Mohawk River. Our Colonel Butler with a Pennsylva. Regiment is upon the latter with Troops from New York & some friendly Indians-both Expeditions are in great forwardness & I trust will afford you more real Security than 20 Regiments posted on the Frontiers. These Expeditions were on foot before the late Irruption & the Route fixed or I should have thought a Passage to the Senecas & Cayugas more favourable from the Waters of the Susquehannah. As you have had great Opportunities of knowledge in these Subjects I shall be much obliged to you to give me your Sentiments upon them as Time & Oppy. admit and you may depend upon my making such Use of them as I hope will conduce to the Happiness & Honour of the State as well as the safety & Comfort of the worthy Inhabitants of the back Counties in whose Behalf from the Spirit & Zeal which they have discovered in the common Cause I feel myself deeply interested. Write freely I beseech you & tell us in what Way we can render you most Service, I trust you will not find us backward or ungrateful.  I am much obliged to you, my dear Sir, for the favourable Sentiments you express of me. The Approbation & Esteem of Gentlemen whose Courage & Integrity have stood the Proof of Danger & Adver  sity does more Honour than the time serving Adulation of a whole Nation of timid skulking Neutrals or half converted Tories, I hope I shall act so as to deserve it. The County of Philadelphia did me the Honour to chuse me to fill up the late Presidents Chair in Council but being then a Delegate in Congress the Election was not valid. I hope some Person of more Experience, Ability & Fortune may be found before another Election, as my Attention to the publick has so drawn off my Regard to my private Affairs that they suffer exceedingly: & the Opportunities of making proper Provision for my Family are so great that I cannot neglect them without doing Injustice to those whom I am bound by every Tie of Duty & Tenderness to consider.  I suppose it is hardly in your Power to leave Home at this Juncture, otherwise I should express a strong Wish to see you as soon as possible upon several Accounts. It is an important Crisis in this State & true Whigs should attend to it.  My best Wishes attend you & if I can be of Service to you in any Shape, command freely my dear General, Your sincere Friend & Hbble Servt. Jos. Reed  ""

  My dearest Love, Philadelphia Augt 13 1778 Being again confined by a return of my fever & Ague, attended with (I believe) the Rheumatism in my Breast, I have a little leisure to converse with the dear object of my warmest Affections & Esteem, altho' I do not write without Pain. I am applying the Bark in such Quantities that I hope to be out again tomorrow, God willing.  I left our Friends at Princeton well, altho' your Brother, the two Girls & one of the Servants had been very unwell, your Brother rather dangerous. Oh! how was I mortified at a disappointment my Judgment approved of, and perhaps would not have been pleased had you ventured your Health in pursuit of so trifling an Object. If my Health should not be restored in a few days, I shall not be easy without visiting my beloved Cottage, where all my Earthly Treasure is almost buried. Perhaps if I could forget it more than I do, it would add to my present Pleasure. I know that the things of this  AUGUST 13,1778  Life, are generally unsatisfactory & illusory and the Enjoyment disappoints us at the best, but notwithstanding as I verily believe that thro' the indulgent Mercy & Kindness of a holy God, as little of that disappointment has fell to my share, as to any one Person in the World, I cannot conquer my desire of risquing the Event-I have tried almost every Station in Life, and if you judge from the common Sentiments of Mankind, you might imagine that I am now in the highest, being actually in my Representative Capacity, on a par with the greatest Monarchs of the Earth-but if you could see my Heart, you would discover less exultation there, than when I considered myself, the humble Peasant of Baskenridge, in the enjoyment of domestic Happiness with a beloved family (perhaps as high as human Nature will allow) as unenvied as undisturbed. I can say my present Situation has greatly humbled me, and I am truly convinced that all the envied Greatness & dignity of Offices & Titles is Sound & nothing else.  My desire is to be usefull, and as my gracious God has in his all wise Providence been pleased to favour me beyond the common Lott of the Children of Men, and that not only in the best of Women for my Companion thro' Life, but in a beloved Daughter, Family, Friends and every other earthly blessing, with the means & hopes of eternal Life, so I would endeavour at the Risque of every earthly comfort & Enjoyment, to do his will under every circumstance of Life. This my dearest & best beloved, is my consolation & only satisfactory reason, for the loss of your inestimable Company, and those sweet & delicate Enjoyments of a domestic nature, which cannot be replaced by all the Grandeur, Parade & Noise that this world affords. My ambition is satisfied, and when it pleases him whose I am, and ever wish to be, a return to my original obscurity will be acknowledged with gratitude & Praise. I am but of little Consequence here, and can add but a trifle on the great Scale of publick Movement. I wish to retire & shall take the first favourable Oppertunity. I have nothing new to tell you, except what is contained in the enclosed. I have had a visit from the French Minister & have dined & breakfasted with him. If well enough I go to morrow with him to the Valley Forge.  My kind Love to all Friends-Kiss my Susan & remember me to the Family.

I am so confined to Business here, that a Letter from a Friend is truly valuable as it is a very agreeable relaxation to the Mind at the same Time that it affords a Satisfaction that is hard to express. We are on the tenter Hooks of anxious Expectation for news from Rhode Island. Our Hopes are raised to a high pitch as we have certain Intelligence that Lord Howe had not sailed from the Hook on Sunday last, so that the Count de Estaing cannot be interrupted in the least. From the best Accounts we have from England & especially from a publication sent us by a Friend, who informs that it was made under the immediate patronage of Lord North, I conclude that England will acknowledge our Independency & settle this unhappy dispute in many Months.(3)  I have conferred with Belcher, fully on the Subject mentioned in your Letter, and if nothing better turns up in a very short time for him, will endeavour to accomplish what you propose as I think it highly reasonable.(4)  The office I wrote you about is filled up,(5) and altho' another equally advantageous might be had, yet as it would require your personal & constant attendance in this City, I think it will not answer for the reasons you mention-and I am clear that there is a Berth in our own State awaiting you that you will fill with credit & reputation, and be of eminent publick Service while you may at the same time enjoy all your domestic Comfort at Eliz. Town in which you know I am personally & greatly interested.  The Express that arrived from the Commissioners, brought nothing but a requisition for permission to send Transports for the Convention Troops, &c &c  Being really & truly interested in your welfare I am distressed for the many Losses that you have met with in these unhappy Times, and the only consolation you can have, is that it is a general evill and in a good Cause, but when these misfortunes happen from other AUGUST 15,1778  means & are some measure arguing from our own faults and do not answer so valuable purposes they are the more distressing; it is upon this account that I condole so much more with you in the apprehension of your present Danger in the threatened Loss of your heavy Baggage, especially as it is your all of this kind of property.(6) I think you are in a great measure to blame, as you must know by Experience that Sheets tho' with the addition of Locks & Keys, have been generally found a very insufficient Barrior agt. a regular & secret attack. It becomes you without delay to swear the Peace agt every suspected Person, and even if necessary to get an additional Class or two of the Militia to keep a Town watch especially as the Enemy are so near as to afford the necessary assistance particularly by way of a retrograde manoeuver. Whenever you think it for the publick advantage, I can move Congress to pass some spirited resolutions agt. attempts of this nature, if not to make it high Treason, even to the Corruption of Blood any former Resolution notwithstanding.  It will give me great Pleasure to forward your Letters to Belcher, and beg you will allways enclose them to me, as By this means I shall hope to hear oftener from you.

You are pleased to say on the Subject of our Paper Credit \""What is like to be done, or can be in this Emergency you know a Thousand Times better than I.\"" Admitting this to be just, I find you know a Thousand Times less than Nothing about it for I assure I know just Nothing, and am therefore qualified to keep the secret & will tell you Nothing about it: one word more, I think by what I can discover that I know just as well what will be or can be done as Congress in General which constitutes the true Reason why Nothing is yet done upon the Subject-we are soon to consider it, and if I can come at any knowledge I will most chearfully tell You, but there are gigantick Difficulties on every Hand, and I can only wish they may be surmounted.  As I hope you are determined and preparing to come here as soon  AUGUST 16, 1778  as possible will you give me leave to introduce you to Congress, & attempt to give you an imperfect Idea of the Course of Business in Congress and in the several Subdivisions of Congress. We meet at nine & continue sitting till two in the Afternoon, after prayers the States are called, nine are a quorum to proceed on Business, the public Letters are first read & disposed off, next reports from the Treasury & then reports from the Board of War, these Matters by a standing Order must be gone thro' before any other Business can be moved, for the rest points are started, debated, & determined in nearly the same Manner as in our Assembly, saving that much Time is spent, too much I think in all Conscience in debating points of Order, they are referred to the House, and the Decision does not seem to depend on any fixed or known Rules, but the present Opinion of what is decent & proper in the Case before us, which gives much the same, indeed a greater Latitude than in debating points of Common Law in our Courts.  Besides the General Business which is originated & discussed in Congress, the House is subdivided into standing Comittes or Boards each of which is to pay their Attention to some one Capital Branch, give Orders in the Executive part, and report to Congress where its Aid is wanted to regulate and enforce. These are as follows  1. A Board of Treasury, this should consist of one member from a State, five are a Quorum, they Superintend the finances, consider in the first Instance all Applications for Money, & report what is to be advanced, regulate the Striking of Bills, give their Opinion when Emissions are Necessary, & prepare draughts of Resolves for that purpose, consult of & propose Ways and means for raising Money, propose regulations to prevent Counterfeiting, Depreciation of, or to Appreciate the Currency, they examine Claims, adjust Accounts & in general do every thing in this Branch, they are assisted by an Auditor General & Commissioner of Claims-the Auditor keeps Accounts & the Commis[sioners] examine the particular Articles, correct over-charges, reject improper ones & state Ballances, all sums to be granted in Advance, on Account or for Ballances due are reported to Congress, granted by them, & drawn for by Warrant under the Hand of the president.  2. A board of War, formerly consisting of Members of Congress, now of Commissioners chosen at large, assisted by some Members, the Objects of their Duty is particularly enumerated in the Resolve for Constituting & impowering them which I trust you have Seen. It extends to the superintending the Departments of the Commissary Genl., Quartermaster Genl., Clothier Genl., Adjutant General, Commissary General of Ordnance & Military stores, planning Expeditions & in short every thing almost that relates to the Army or Military Operations.  3. Marine Comittee, this board considers of Rules and Regula-  tions for well governing the Navy, the number of Ships & other Vessells to be built, superintends & directs the Building & employing them, examines into all mismanagement of Officers, directs Enquiries & Trials, furnishing transports & in short exercises the Office of Lord high Admiral with more extensive Powers than any British one ever had, & are only checked by the Necessity of obtaining the sanction of Congress to their rules and regulations which however in general is given of Course, as far Gentlemen have ability or Leisure to canvass their Measures, this observation may indeed be extended to all the other Committees General as well as the Marine Committee.  4. A Commercial Committee, all the Commercial Business of Congress is under their Direction, & is you will find a very extensive & perplexed branch of Business.  5. A Committee of Foreign Affairs, they Correspond with our Ministers at foreign Courts, with Agents in Europe and with all such Gentlemen of Character in foreign parts as are disposed to give us lntelligence, they prepare Instructions for Ministers & propose proper Courts or States to send embassys to.  6. The Committee of Foreign Applications, they are Gentlemen acquainted with the French or other European Languages, and receive Applications from foreign Officers, proposals, Schemes, & projects from a Shoal of Europeans who wish to fish for Wealth or Honour in our troubled Waters.  7. A Medical Committee, who superintend the Medical Department in the Army, & are consulted by & direct the Director General.  These Committees proceed in general upon the present State of Information & decide upon the Circumstances of each particular Case without any general or established Rules, at least if they have such Rules I have not been able to find them-some of them are Temporary & will end with the War, others are in their nature permanent, these last it is an object with Congress, when they can find Time, to put into Commission, & critically to limit, define & regulate their Jurisdiction.  I hope to hear by the next post that You will comply with my request in my last & set out for Congress, in which Case I shall take the Liberty to delineate, or give you a rough Sketch of the Characters of the Gentlemen you will find. I do not mean their moral nor political, but their Congress Characters.  I am Dear Sir, with great Respect, your most obedient & most humble servant. Titus Hosmer  ""

  [August 16, 1778] I am now at the 16th. Mr. Martin has been detained by bad weather and sickness.  Your Excellency will read in the Penna. Packet of the 13th a declaration of Congress of the 11th-this is the Paper Mr. Drayton had kept so long in his Pocket and which I had so often solicited should be brought forward.(1) I now regret that some previous corrections had not been apply'd to it and that the house was hurried in its passage without such amendments as at first view your Excellency will see it stood in need of-be this as it may, it contains matters of fact, and such as it is, the Commissioners may criticize words and Phrases but the whole group will not be able to explain away our meaning, nor do I believe that even a Man of Governor Johnstone's command of features will have Art enough smoothly to laugh off his feelings whenever this Act of Abnegation shall be brought on the Carpet in his presence on either side of the Water. I put it in motion the 13th and it is probable the Governor has receiv'd his first shock this Morning. He has been severely lampoon'd in New York as will be seen in another paper to be inclosed with this.(2) The Declaration and other unavoidable business fill'd up the Session of the 11th and barr'd the delivery of the Remonstrance and Requisition before the 12th, it was then committed to a special Committee, a compliment which, in my humble opinion it did not merit.(3)  ""

  Dear General Philadelphia 16th August 1778. I have lately been honored with your several favors of the 27th July, 1st & 10th Inst.(1) which I presumed were all intended as Public, & therefore duly presented each to Congress-I have received no commands from the House; nevertheless I think an intimation of  AUGUST 16, 1778  the receipt of your Letters will be acceptable. You will be so kind as to take it in this private address.  When you can find half an hours leisure, you will much oblige me by a general or detail Account as time may permit of the proceedings of the Allied Fleet & Armies at or near Rhode Island, although I must confess I have now some apprehensions that the late seperation was the period of our hopes of subduing the Enemy in that Quarter until quite new measures shall be taken. I wish my fears that the Count de' Estaing is decoyed, may prove groundless-the Enemy's seeming flight gives this alarm. Were they in earnest to fly they might have taken, with much less danger, the start from Sandy Hook-but we must with patience wait events. If you are so good as to communicate Intelligence of public transactions for my private use I intreat you Sir, to mark each Cover (Private). This will enable me to make acceptable offerings to my friends in the State I come from & on my part, besides the obligation which I shall feel, I will endeavor to make suitable retaliation. At present I have nothing to transmit but the last News Papers & to inform you that the British Commissioners have attempted to open a correspondence with Congress by means of a Remonstrance & requisition, demanding the Prisoners of the Convention of Saratoga & offering to Ratify that agreement on the part of Great Britain.(2) I will not say which is the most glaring in this Act their Insolence or their folly. I can see however they have with all their supposed Cunning ensnared themselves & exposed their Court to further contempt-they must either be possessed of powers \""distinctly & explicitly\"" to Ratify & \""properly notify to Congress\"" or they have no such powers. If they have, their weakness & folly will appear in withholding or neglecting to declare it-if they have not their Insolence will be seen in the attempt to negotiate without authority & I may repeat, their \""folly\"" in supposing they could amuse Congress by a stroke of Newmarket Jockeyship. Upon the whole these Wiseacres have inadvertently given their Seal to the Act of Congress of the 8th of January.(3)  I wish you all success & happiness & am with very great Regard & Esteem Dear sir, Your obedient & very humble servt,  Henry Laurens private  ""

  Dear Jay, Philadelphia 116th Augt. 1778 We are at Length fairly setting about our Finances and our foreign Affairs. For the latter particularly I much wish you were here.Many Persons whom you know are very liberal of Illiberality. You Friend Deane who hath rendered the most essential Services stands as one accused. The Storm increases and I think some one of the tall Trees must be torn up by the Roots. I have not heard from you in a long Time. I did expect a letter by your Brother James but was disappointed. I am informed that he brought letters from you to Nobody here. How happened that? Apropos I will give you a little History.  Just before his Arrival, I saw a Letter from Arthur Lee speaking of him most disrespectfully. I was informed and induced to believe that he was come to Congress charged with Lee's Information & to promote his Designs. The Length of my Acquaintance with him required Nothing. But it was my Duty to take Care that your Brother did not render himself ridiculous. I felt more than I can tell at the AUGUST 16, 1778  Idea of a Connection between him and some Persons also I am confident you do from your Soul despise and abhor. In Consequence I waited of him. I told him candidly that I suspected him to be charged with Matter which was to militate much in favor of Mr. Lee, That Mr. Lee had in a Letter which would then shortly become public traduced him. I had forgot to tell you that the Letter was to Mr. Carmichael who (being accused before Congress by Mr. Lee) shewed it in his own Defence to a Committee of which I was a Member. And I stated the Ridicule which far from being instrumental in forwarding the Views of a Man who had said of him that he was a Vilain.  He was as you may well suppose much obliged by this Instance of my Friendship and so far all was Right. So far I had saved him out of bad Hands. As the Devil would have it I was appointed one Member of a Committee to superintend an Entertainment given by the Congress to Monsr. Girard. Unfortunately the line which by the general sense of the Members of Congress had been drawn for Invitations excluded him. He was offended. He made Inquiries into the Reasons. You may readily imagine what some Folks would say on the Occasion. He inquired of me in a Stile which really put it out of my Power to give him satisfactory Answers. It is a Pity for his own sake that he appeared to feel the Omission. To you the Reasons need not be assigned. I fear he is now in the Possession of those Gentlemen. I would dilate upon the Consequences but the idea is painful to me and cannot be pleasant to you. I have only to add on this Chapter that I will save him if I can even from himself. The Mischief is he is now in such Dudgeon that any Advances from me would produce the direct contrary Effect from what they ought. Adieu my Friend. Remember me to our Friends. To your Wife particularly. Write to me oftener. In all cases believe me, most sincerely yours, Gouvr. Morris  ""

  My dear Hetty Philad. Augt. 16 1778, Sunday As I expected to have spent this Day with you I feel no small Disappointment in being obligd to substitute Pen & Ink in Place of the more substantial Pleasure of a personal Interview-but the Weather has turnd out so bad & some Events have happened in Congress that would have deprived me of the Satisfaction of meeting you if the Weather & other Circumstances had been favourable. I was for a Week confined to the House & suffered more Pain than I ever did in the same Time. You may judge how desirable your Company would have been to me under such Circumstances, tho I had no Reason to complain of Solitude. I am now perfectly well & mean to take such Precautions as I hope will secure me against a Return of this troublesome Complaint. About 8 Days ago the Committee of Arrangement was ordered to proceed to Camp, at that Time I was confined & immediately afterwards The Business of Congress led to Inquiry into the Conduct of our Commissioners abroad when mutual Recrimination brought out the Charge made by Dr. Lee against Mr. Langdon & myself as holding a treacherous Correspondence with the British Ministry. It seems Dr. Lee transmitted it to Paris to be forwarded to America somehow concealed in the blank Leaves of \""Enticks Dictionary.\"" The Gentlemen at Paris on examining it fearing it would have fatal Effects on our Characters kept it back-after a little Time Mr. Lee having joined them as a Fellow Commissioner & soon falling out with them he endeavoured to get the Dictionary from them which was refused, & last Spring it was sent over to Mr. R. Morris who seeing only a Dictionary & no Explanation could not tell what to make of it but laid it by & it being at Manheim we have not yet seen the Contents. The Story having now taken Wind & a strong Party formed in Congress against the Lee Connection they are resolved to avail themselves of this indiscreet & imprudent Measure to turn him out of Employ if they can-or at least that it shall be a make Weight in the Scale.(1) For my own Part, my Opinion of Dr. Lee is not altered by the Transaction. I shall vote just in the same Manner as I should have done if another Person had been the Object of this Charge & am really sorry that the Talent he unquestionably possesses should be useless to himself & dangerous to others for Want of a little Portion of Candour & common ordinary Sense to AUGUST 16, 1778  mingle with them. And at all Events we ought to be thankful that while Rocks & Precipices were all round me, Providence has so ordered Matters that I have not only not fallen but possess a greater Share of publick Confidence than I ever did. But every Event of this kind lessens my Attachment to publick Life & enhances the Pleasures of domestick. There no Doubt nor Suspicions enter-your Love & Tenderness & the Prattle of our dear little ones affords Pleasures without any Alloy of Scruple or distrust & I look forward with infinite Pleasure to the Time when I can enjoy them with less Interuption.  I hope Cyrus will have a good Place-he sent to desire he might see me & I sent him Word to come & stay here while he staid in Town which I expected he would have done as his Master seemed pleased with it but he did not come. When I came to Town I found at Mrs. Yards a Boy belonging to Mrs. Badger hired to Mrs. Yard. I got her to engage him for me which she did-but when I came to speak to his Mistress I found she wanted to sell, not to hire him-As Cyrus was now gone l was therefore obliged to purchase him several Persons offering to take him at her Price but the Boy had set his Heart upon living with Genl. Reed. I have accordingly got him & hope you will like him-He has been brought up to House Work & his Mistress assures me he is healthy, good tempered, sober & honest. Mrs. Yard also spoke well of him. I shall get him up to you as soon as possible as Idleness of which he has enough here will do him no Good. I shall endeavour to purchase the Calico for you as the Returns from New York are uncertain. I send you by this Oppy. a Cask containing 4 Pieces of Linnen, a Piece of Cambrick-the Ticking & Table Cloths-A Pine Apple & a few Limes. The latter I have kept waiting an Oppy. till they are almost spoilt, but my dear Girl in this Care must take the Will for the Deed. You must spare one of the Pieces of Linnen at least to Mrs. Pettit & I have given Polly also some Expectations of Assistance-Perhaps your Mamma may also by this Time have her Wants. I have now been moved above a Week & am so much pleased with the House that I fiatter myself you will be happier in it than in any we have had in this Country. The Rooms are large & commodious-Kitchen convenient & Yard &c. very pleasant, in short it is what I think you will like. I have got one of the parlours painted & the other now looks so shabby that I have serious Thoughts of getting that done also-tho the Walls being to be done will make it cost four Times as much as the other, & That was dear enough of all Conscience. Among other Conveniences there is a Spire & a Smoak House-nor do we find the Kitchen smoak as Hannah represented.  Monday Morn. I endeavoured to change your Stockings but the Man had no Cotton ones that would fit you-He has thread but as   the cold Season was coming on I would not get them without your particular Directions.  As I have concluded to send Tom to you by this Oppy. he will deliver you a Bundle of News Papers which contain all our publick Affairs, except what we had last Saturday from Rhode Island viz: That Genl Sullivan & the Count de Estaing having settled a joint Attack on the 9th Inst. while the Troops were actually landing & a Part of them had taken Possession of some Works which the Enemy had abandoned a Fleet of 29 Sail appeared in View which since proves to be Ld. Howe upon which The French Troops which had been landed were immediately taken on board & the Count stood out to Sea after them-the British Fleet then tack'd about & when the Accounts came away the Count was in full Chase. Genl. Sullivan upon this Event relinquished his Design for the present. Ld. Chatham is actually dead. £4000 per Ann. is settled on his Family by Act of Parliamt. & his Corpse has laid in publick State at Westminster Hall.  I should have wrote you last Week if any Oppy. had offered-this long letter will I hope make up my Deficiency. I have sent to Burlington for the Things provided Bowers can get a suitable Person to come down with them. I have made out extremely well as to House keeping; Numa pleases me much but I am not so enamored with her as not to wish to change her for my own little House keeper as soon as I can. About this Time next Month or the Ist October at farthest you must come. The Town was not very healthy before this series of Cloudly, rainy, sultry Weather especially for Children & I suppose it must be much worse now. I am glad you have got a school for ours. They will be much happier & less troublesome to you. If an Oppy. offers I think you had better sell one of the Cows. You will judge which but I believe it must be the speckled as Steins Cow will be a good Winter Cow & the other a summer one. I believe she will fetch £20 at least.  Kiss The Children for me, remember me to Mamma & Polly who I suppose is with you & believe me, my dear Hetty, Your faithful & affect. J Reed  P.S. I expect to be with you on Wednesday Night at farthest on my Way to Camp.  I have sent Joe's Hat among other Things. Parish has had it in Hand. If it will not do now you must send a Measure taken a different Way-the string should go round his Head not across it.

  [August 16,1778](1) By a letter from General Sullivan, dated Portsmouth, Rhode-Island, August 10, we are informed, that on the morning of the 9th, the enemy abandoned all their works on the north end of the island, in consequence of the French fleet coming up the river; and immediately thereupon General Sullivan pushed over all his troops, and took possession of the enemy's works. On the same day a fleet of 29 sail, 8 or 10 of which appeared to him to be of force, were discovered standing in to Newport under English colours. Count d'Estaign kept his station, there being but little or no wind; but the next morning, the 10th, he got underweigh, with a fine breeze, and gave chace; and at 11 o'clock, General Sullivan writes, he had the pleasure to see the British fleet fly before him. The Count left three frigates in the east passage. General Sullivan adds, that General Hancock, our late amiable and worthy President, had joined him from Boston, at the head of a number of volunteers. The French Fleet, in passing up the river of Newport, silenced two batteries of the enemy.

  Dr. Sir Philadelphia: 17th August 1778 I have this Day the happiness of receiving your Favr. of the 14th ulto. trust you have before this recd. a Line from me.(1)  I have as you observed taken a Seat in Congress, and mixd among the great States-Men of America, among whose shining Talents you may well imagine my feable Genious is lost in obscurity. Dont think this remark fishing for a Compliment, I barr every thing of that kind: you speak of gratifying my Curiosity & Ambition: as to the former it is both gratifyed and disapointed, in regard to the latter I can with utmost Sincerity say I have none in this way.  I am happy to hear that Mrs. Adams keeps up her Spirits in my Absence. I fealt much on her Account; my own health I think is quite restored. You Reason perfectly Just in my Oppinion in regard to our Currency: so far as I can Judge there is not the least Idea in Congress to let the Money die: as to one particular Member we had some Conversation about I beleave Nothing is further from his thoughts, he is extreamly urgent to have something effectual done to appretiate the Currency; this indeed seams to be the full determination of Congress & accordingly three Days in each Week (except some necessary Business such as attending to the publick Letter &c) are now set apart to attend to our Finances: this subject is very extensive and will take up much time. The Money in my Oppinion can & must be appretiated. Tis of Infinite Importance, but this must not be done suddenly, as that would greatly injure the poor & Virtuous part of the Community and throw a prodigious advantage into the hands of the present Money holders, a great part of whom are some of the greatest Rascals that ever disgraced humanity & deserve infinitly greater punishment than is in the power of any state to inflict.  All the News we have here comes from the eastward which you know before it reaches us: I dont know that I can better gratify your Curiosity at present than by giving a general account of the Proceedings of Congress: according to order we should meet at Nine and adjourn at two: but in fact we Meet about ten & sit till three, four and five before we adjourn: this you will say is very inconvenient but leaves us much leasure; but you will consider that much of the AUGUST 17, 1778  Business is transacted by special Committees in the Recess of Congress: besides these there is a Marine Board, a Navy Board, a Treasury Board, a Commercial Board & Comtee. of foreign Affairs who have no other time to do their Business but in the Recess of Congress: these Boards are at present almost wholly composed of Members of Congress: some of them meet at six in the Morning & sit till eight constantly every day. Others meet at five in the afternoon or immediately after they Dine & sit till Night and sometimes till late: I beleave there are but very few Members but what are employed in some of these Ways, so that those who do their Duty have not much Leasure to spare. The Debates in the House are simular to those in the British House of Commons: there are here as in most other Assemblys some very Sensable Speakers, & some very loud Talkers: you may make one exception & then conceive a House composed of very able sensable Gentlemen: but belonging to different States, whose Laws, Mannors, Genious of Inhabitants and indeed almost every thing else very different.  Many things have occurrd. since I left home such as the arival of a French fleet, the Minister Plenipotentiary & his publick Audience &c which have now become obsolete, a particular Account of which I have from time to time given to Miss Adams either by Letters or the Publick papers sent to her, which immagin you have seen: as also the Conduct of the British Commissioners & Resolves of Congress thereon-some of which have mentiond in my former Letter to you.  I have now Just returnd. from a Visit to the French Minister which every Member of Congress is obliged to receive and give for a formal Mannor, he appears to be very sensable & a Man of Business. Mr. Dean has Just began to give us a full Acot. of all Matters relative to his Business &c &c &c this you would esteam entertaining, more I may not say at present upon this head.

  Sir (1) Philadelphia 17th August 1778 I can give you no new Ideas from Congress. The proceedings and Debates here are very simular to those in the British House of Commons: should I tell you that some are fond to be thought a Barre, or a Burk I might be thought reprehensable but should I compare any to a Wilkes I might Deserve Censure.  AUGUST 17, 1778  I have not yet attempted to make any formal publick Speach in Congress, nor do I design it, (I can give you my Reasons at a proper Time) many Times I sit with almost infinite impatience but have hitherto kept in; nor has Mr. Hosmer yet spoke in publick; I know not his Reasons but imagin I could guess them; I beleave he will do it soon. I cant say but I should do the same if my Return was not at hand.  The State of our Currency is Just come under Consideration: two Days in each Week is now chiefly set apart for that & our Treasury Matters and Finances. This is so Difuse and important a Subject that it will doubtless take up a long Time: several other Departments loudly call for the Attention of Congress, but they are so crouded with Business of almost every kind, and git along with it so slow, that Nothing can be immediately expected, but what cant be dispensed with.  All our news now comes from the Eastward. We have very frequent Accounts from Rhode Island and are anxious for the Event of that Expedition, which must be a Matter of high Importance.  Genl Sullivan writes to Congress that his Supplys from Connecticut are very inconsiderable [& he] intimates that he has no great Expectations from there [. . .] if we consider our Quota of Continental Troops which [I am] told is more than full upon the present Establishment, Matrosses &c stationd. upon the Sea Coasts, two Battalions [. . .] men and two more raised by percentory drafts from the Militia &ca. the prodigious Number of Men employed in the various [. . .] of the privateering Business; we might perhaps assign [many?] good Reasons why large Numbers more should not be [taken?] from Connecticut: without assigning another Reason [. . .] perhaps has its weight with many good Soldiers (vizt) The [. . .] they have heretofore met with in the State of Rhode Island [. . .] Regard to the high prices demanded of them for Necessaries [....] But I am sorry after all to have such a Clause in the Genlls Letter without the true Reason, being assignd. which I beleave Govr. Trumbull will do: I intend to write him upon the Subject. Remember me suitably to Mrs. Marvin &c.  I am with Respect Your Obedt. Serv.  Andw Adams ""

However, hoping that this will rather invigorate and cause a redoubled Exertion-We remain in great Hopes of Success. We have had a long Series of very heavy Rains & Easterly Weather-This has brought one of Ld. Hows Galleys upon the Jersey Shore.

Last Evening we had advice that four or five Ships were at Cape Henlopen firing for Pilots as was supposed, Whether those Ships are of either the two Fleets is uncertain-it is rather apprehended that both Fleets must have got scattered, if the Storm was as hard at Sea as it was here on Tuesday & almost the whole Week.

You wish you had Intelligence to communicate, interesting Intelligence. You have for you can tell me of those I love.  I will not apologize for Silence by Business. On every Principle I owe a little of that Time and Health of which I sacrifice so much to the ungrateful to those who deserve it so well by their favorable Opinion.  I did really believe Captain Bedlow's Business was compleated.(1) I was told so. I will make Enquiry (mark I received your Letter in Congress at three this Afternoon) and endeavor to get him righted. Your Reasoning on the Occasion is just. I have to observe however that I never yet put it in the Power of Congress to refuse an Appli- AUGUST 17, 1778  cation for one of my Friends. 1 trust that whenever I am called to account for my public Conduct whatever may have been my Want of Ability it will never be said that I have preferred private Connections to the general Weal. I shall have the Satisfaction to feel that I have spent Time, Health and Money and risqued Life and Reputation freely and disinterestedly. Whether usefully or not it is for others to determine.  A Variety of those little Incidents which postpone great Affairs especially in a Body so constituted as the Congress together with a Want of that Providence and Arrangement of Business which I have labored to inculcate and establish ever since I have been here have produced the Evil you complain of in your Loan Offices. It is now in a Train for speedy Redress.(2)  The Vermont Business doth indeed press and daily with additional Weight. Let our Situation be considered. The Attention of the Members of Congress to this Affair must be intreated not forced. At present three Days in the Week are set apart for the Treasury and Finances, two more for the Consideration of foreign Affairs, add to this that Congress is also an executive Body. I do not mean to apologize. I know I shall be charged by my Enemies. Let not my Friends pretend to excuse. If the State have not a Confidence that their Delegates are willing and able to serve them it is Time they were recalled. Justice will shall be done to us. I am sorry to add that the unavoidable Delays render it almost Injustice.  You tell me that I must be with you at the opening of the Session but you do not let me know when the Session is. Let me paint my Situation. I am on a Committee to arrange the Treasury & Finances. I am of the medical Committee and have to prepare the Arrangements of that Department. I have the same Thing to go thro with Relation to the Commissary's, Quarter Master's & Clothier General's Departments.(3) I am to prepare a Manifesto on the Cruelties of the British.(4) I have drawn and expect to draw almost if not all the Publications of Congress of any Importance. These are leading Things but the every Day Minutia are infinite. From Sunday Morning to Saturday Night I have no Exercise unless to walk from where I now sit about fifty Yards to Congress and to return. My Constitution sinks under this and the Heat of this pestiferous Climate. Duer talks daily of going hence. We have nobody else here so that if I quit the State will be unrepresented.(5) Can I come to you? If there be a Practicability of it with any Kind of Consistency I will take half a dozen Shirts and ride Post to meet you. Oh that a Heart so disposed as mine is to social Delights should be worn and torn to Pieces with public Anxieties.  I am distressed infinitely distressed at the Idea that a full, entire, perfect Cordiality should not take Place among those I love. Whenever ye are together my Spirit shall be with ye. And let me intreat   that you will not wrong my Friendship by the smallest Dispute with each other. Remember our joint Labors in the public Cause. We have labored jointly upon the purest best Principles, for Heaven's Sake let not the Effects be lost by Divisions which will give to those who have personal Views an Opportunity of effecting the Ruin of our State. I cannot dwell on this Subject. I would that you could both of you see my Heart and feel how much I should suffer at the least coldness between you.  I shall make every Inquiry about the Gentleman you mention that you could wish. If I understand your Letter I am led to hope that the Result of it may be as favorable as possible. Whatever it be you shall know candidly & truly.  Return most Cordially the Greetings you sent me. I do most earnestly wish to see my Claremont Friends. To lounge, to idle, to dissipate the Moments and the Clouds, to live, to smile, to be happy. May you and all of you be so supremely.  Adieu. I am with Sincerity, your Friend, Gouv Morris  P.S.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia August 18th 1778. Your favor of the 2d inst (1) is come to hand and I have communicated to the Commercial Committee what you wrote me concerning the French Ship Duchess of Grammont and find they have rec'd your letter to them on that Subject. I have urged their immediately taking up the matter and sending you directions as soon as possible.(2) I am sorry to say our Treasury, Marine & Commercial Affairs are in a very bad Situation owing to their being conducted by members of Congress who can spare but little of their time to transact them, and are so constantly changing that before they get acquainted with the business they leave Congress and new members totally ignorant of the past transactions are appointed in their stead. This gives me great uneasiness and I wish I could see any prospect of a speedy remedy, but the multiplicity of business that is daily crowding on Congress and the time it takes to transact matters in so large an Assembly filled with lawyers and other gentlemen who love to talk as much as they, will not allow me to hope that our affairs will be very soon properly arranged.  As to your loading vessels with provisions in Maryland &c, while the Embargo lasts you are sensible it cannot be done without an Order of the Congress for that special purpose which I fear will be hard to procure at present unless the French squadron shall be so successful as to block up the enemy's ships of war and prevent the danger of it's falling into their hands.(3) August 18-Mr Wentworth has signed the confederation (4) and is still here but in such a state as not to be of any service to himself or the public and I fear there is but little hope of his getting well while he tarries here. I believe it would be for the best (if he could be persuaded to think so) for him to set out immediately for home and another delegate for our State  AUGUST 18, 1778  to come forward as soon as possible. I hope you have appointed delegates to relieve us early in November when the confederation takes place, as I shall be unwilling to tarry any longer if I should be able to stay so long; please to take particular care that others may be sent forward seasonable.  All the talk here is about Rhode Island and the French fleet, of which you know more than I, so shall say nothing about it, wish it may prove fortunate.(5)  I am Sir, your friend and humble servant,  Josiah Bartlett ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia August 18th 1778. Your favor of the 2d inst. I rec'd yesterday (1) and perceive you intend for Rhode Island and I suppose you are now in the vicinity of that place. Rhode Island and the French and English fleets at present engross all the conversation here. I wish we may have a pleasing account from them-as for foreign intelligence we have none later than the 3d of June which has been published in the newspapers. The faces in Philadelphia were much altered but the Whigs are returning fast, so that it begins to look more natural. Our old landlady is the same as usual and remains in the same house when the true Sons of America went off at the approach of General Howe and left her house. She was soon after supplied with British AUGUST 18, 1778  officers for boarders, and as soon as they left her, her house was filled up again with Whigs, so that when I came here I could not be supplied with lodgings at her house.  The majority of the Quakers remain the same dark, hidden, designing hypocrites as formerly-however as the laws of this State are very strict against all persons who do not take the Oath of allegiance to the State and abjuration of the King of England, not allowing of their buying or selling, receiving debts and in short nearly outlawing them, the Quakers many and I believe most of them are coming in with a sanctified phiz and taking the oath of affirmation, for if you touch their worldly interest you touch their conscience and their best beloved deity.  While affairs remain as they are at present I believe it will be difficult to obtain from Congress a permission to load vessels with provisions for New Hampshire, least they should supply the enemy instead of the inhabitants of New Hampshire. I am very sorry to hear bread is so scarce with you and am persuaded it is not owing to the natural scarcity but to other causes among which the fluctuating state of our money is the principal. The Congress are this day to take up that matter and try to provide a remedy. But the affair is so embarassed, I have but little faith, and fear we shall not be able to effect much, during the war such amazing sums being necessary for the supply of the Army and Navy.  Mr Wentworth is in town but does not attend public business.  Mr Deane has been called in before Congress to give an account of our affairs in Europe and of his conduct there-this has taken up some time and is not wet finished.  The letter to Judge Brackett was handed to me while sitting in Congress by one of the members, it seems to me by Mr Hudson of South Carolina,(2) who is now at Boston, but I am not certain; When I took it I asked I recollect from whence it came and the member said it was handed to him and could give me no account about it.

  Dear Sir, Phila'a Aug't 18th 1778.  I have had for some Time past a Considerable Sum of the Public money in my Hands, which the Delegates of the State of New York obtain'd from Congress on the Principle as stated to your Excellency in a Late Letter from Mr. Morris and myself .(1)  AUGUST 18, 1778  When I first received it, my Determination was to proceed to the State of New York within a few Days-but the Foreign affairs becoming interesting from the arrival of the French Minister; and the Necessity of getting a Decision of Congress upon the Conduct of the State of Vermont,(2) and their late Proscription growing every day more Urgent-I have been induced to stay since Mr. Lewis arrival from Baltimore-in hopes of finishing a Business which in my Judgment strikes at our very Existence as a State. I have endeavoured in vain to get several trusty Persons to take the Charge of this money in order to deliver it to you for the Purpose of its being paid into the Treasury of our State-but one or two out of that Number, who might with some Inconvenience to themselves have carried at least Part of it did not chuse to run the Risque. I have endeavor'd to prevail on Mr. Dennig to become the Bearer of it but on finding disagreable to him have been obliged to desist from my Request. As I have pass'd a Receipt in my own Name of this money, I am not willing to hazard it with a Person at my own Risque, Unless I should find a very trustworthy Character, who will consent to take the Trouble. I have, therefore, to request that your Excellency will be pleas'd to direct some Person, who may be depended upon, and who may be coming to Philadelphia, to call upon me for the money; and in case I should not be there to call on his Return to New York at Baskinridge in New Jersey, where I purpose staying some Days on my Return on a Visit to Lord Stirling's Family.(3) Mr. Dennig being in a hurry to Set out, I am obliged to conclude myself with great Respect, & Esteem Your Excellency's Obed't H'ble serv't, Wm.

5896,dg010405,1778,Henry Laurens to Rawlins Lowndes,"""Henry Laurens to Rawlins Lowndes
  [August 18, 1778] It is now the 18th. Captain Pyne and Captain Martin having declared themselves quite ready I would not attempt to detain them. They began their journey this Morning. I understand they are to halt at Baltimore a day and an half on business of their own-there I hope to overtake them, otherwise this will go by the common Post and not arrive so early as I could wish.  Mr. Deane late one of our Commissioners at the Court of Versailles, has already been two Mornings engaged before Congress reporting from Notes and Memory his own transactions seperately as AUGUST 18, 1778  well as conjunctly with his Colleagues and the state of our Affairs at different periods at that and other Courts in Europe, how many Mornings more the whole Narrative will consume is extreamly uncertain; hitherto he has been very little impeded by questions, when these Commence the progress will be slow-above two hours were employed some days ago in debate upon a motion that Mr. Deane should report to Congress in writing and the motion lost (1)-very much loss of time I foresee will be the consequence; in this debate I clearly discovered that my fellow labourers had as absolutely taken sides as it can be supposed Gentlemen are capable of in a pure unbias'd Assembly. Were I to say as ever Attornies had taken at a Bar I might be charged in the modern term with aberation, nevertheless I have taken the liberty to recommend the fillet and scales of Justice to one of my worthy Colleagues (2) who appears strongly attached to one of the parties, no doubt from conviction that that side is right adding the reply which I had made to Mr. D. after he had related to me in private conversation his state of the case. \""Your Account Sir appears to have been very candidly deliver'd, but I dare not flatter you with promises; when I shall have heard the other side I will give my voice as reason and conscience shall dictate.\"" Mr. Deane thank'd me. I remark'd further to my Colleague that nothing short of a written and correct narrative ought to have been accepted by Congress-that if Mr. Deane had acted, which I made no doubt he had, with that accuracy and perspicuity which is the duty of a Gentleman in the Great trust of a Plenipotentiary, nothing could be easier than to render a detail in writing.  As it was incumbent on Mr. Deane to transmit from time to time to Congress advices of all his proceedings, discoveries and observations, and as I could not entertain so degrading a sentiment as a belief of the contrary would involve, very little more than a fair transcript of his letters and journals would be necessary for satisfying the fullest inquiry-without assuming to myself any superiour knowledge I cannot help regretting that the Chair was a bar to the delivery of that opinion in public which arrived too late in friendly conversation after the question had been determined by a majority of nine of thirteen States, thirty two Members present.  Gentlemen had reasoned upon the immense labour of reducing to writing occurences, in three whole years, that the work would procrastinate the business several months, that all that would be deliver'd in writing might in less time and with equal accuracy be related viva voce; those who had not been much accustomed to business, and who lament the waste of time in almost all our proceedings were captivated-but the most curious objection, considering it was started by Mr. Deanes friends, was, that should a narrative in writing be demanded, that Gentleman might avail himself of the advantage of representing glossing &c. &c. as he pleas'd-every un  bias'd Man now, after reflection sees that the mode we have adopted will extend debates and often lead disputes into warm contests, wandering from the point.  Whose memory will retain all that has been and shall be related on different days at distance times? Whose notes will quadrate with those of a friend on the other side of the question? Who will acknowledge the accuracy, and precision of the memory or minutes of his opponent? Will you Call on Mr. Deane to recollect what he had said and to decide?-here is a field without limits for Oratory and wrangle, and finally for mutual dissatisfaction.(3)  I have troubled Your Excellency thus minutely, because the subject is not minute, it is of the highest importance to our Union. I have been long of opinion and have intimated my sentiments to my friends-that there have been errors on both sides among our Commissioners-Errors, probably not of the heart, and therefore I had wished that a veil had been judiciously drawn, and a wise seperation made of Gentlemen whose tempers when mixed in joint Commission excluded all harmony.  Already we have made this unhappy discovery that our funds abroad are exhausted, our resources dried up, our credit lost in the West Indies; our Bills of Exchange which are pledg'd for the Interest of loans will go forward at the utmost hazard of dishonor-my sentiments on foreign debt conducted in the manner and by the Men it has been, were declared without reserve to my friends in Charlestown some twelve Months ago, and from the present gloomy prospect it was, that I lately intimated to one of them that our Affairs were in a deplorable state, more so my Dear Sir, than you can form an Idea of, & more so than I ought just now to express-the value of our Current paper Money, is to be determined by the price of articles given in Exchange-this comparison will sink it low indeed-add to all this the injudicious behaviour of people in general, who flatter themselves with persuations that our troubles are at end and who act accordingly-the cunning ones striving to depreciate the value of our Money in order to get as much of it as by all means they can obtain-the simple by an almost total neglect of measures essentially necessary to be continued and pursued by a Nation in our circumstances. Immediately after we had repossessed this City, General Washington in the spirit of a watchful and wise Commander in Chief, sent General Duportail with a letter to Congress (4) recommending the immediate securing the River against Assaults from the Enemy, and for that purpose gave the General, who is principal Engineer ample instructions. We have been here upwards of seven weeks, I have repeatedly urged Congress to hear the instructions read, yet to this moment no step is taken-we are in danger of being routed again whenever two or three English ships of War shall be ordered up this River, and should Count d'Estaing be   over power'd or block'd up at Rhode Island, Congress will again be shamefully exiled, possibly in the absence of our Army, captured and all our prisoners retaken-all these things Your Excellency and the state I have the honor of representing should know with proper reservations-there are a thousand other things you are entitled to be informed of, which time and political propriety forbid in the present moment. Therefore I shall leave the subject after one sentence more-I remember to have read or heard some where of a Chief Justice's recommending to a Grand Jury to present the King- permit me to ask my Countrymen if it would be a greater outrage, to present their Attornies (I am in earnest Sir,) for neglect of duty- why are not public Accounts adjusted? Why are not the proceedings of the Confederal Attornies published? I have by strife this day obtain'd a continuation in two volumes including 31st December 1776 which I sent to Your Excellency by this conveyance-half, even quarter diligence would have reached to 1st August 1778 in boards, and to the 19th where I am now in sheets-for the correctness of these which I now transmit I will not be answerable, I know not how they are compiled nor if by any body corrected at the Press.  Major General Mifflin has taken one step on the line of presentment, and although, with submission to his better judgment I think his ground unfirm, yet it may hereafter prove to have been an happy Omen-the first Commandment is the basis of true religion.(5)  Concerning the present Embargo, Congress have recommended to this State and New Jersey to take Measures for ensuring a strict observance, and for preventing infractions by evil minded Men on this extensive unguarded Coast and upon the numerous Creeks Bays and Inlets (6)-the Commercial Committee have recommended to their Agent in Charlestown (7) to dispatch two Vessels with Rice from that Port. I wont affront Your Excellency by intimating that this is no authority-the motive for the Order is good, to save a faithful Confederal Agent at Hispaniola(8) from absolute ruin by paying protested Bills drawn on our Account, but who brought the unhappy Gentleman into this dilemma? I will not say a faithless Secret Committee, but I have no doubt of proving the fact when I get home. Thank God this is the 19th August and that I have strength enough to write on without dinner at 6 o'clock P.M.-a report from the Committee recommending a relaxation of the Embargo in the particular case abovementioned was offer'd two days ago and remains unconsidered(9) break one link, the gap will be thirteen wide-maugre any and all particular considerations.  20th August. When I had written Yesterday as above, Muckinfuss came in and honored me with your Excellency's favor of the 29th July (l0) which I shall endeavour to pay my respects to, before I lay   down the Pen. In the mean time a few scraps of intelligence shall precede.  Count d'Estaing from a happy prospect of immediate Conquest at Rhode Island, has in my opinion been decoy'd, what may be the consequence respecting himself is uncertain, but Your Excellency will learn from General Sullivan's last letter of the 14th that our insulated Army were in danger of a Coup de Burgoyne.(1l) Who but my friend General Sullivan would have thought that Lord Howe came within ken of the French fleet merely for the benefit of running away from it? Sandy Hook would have been a much more advantageous starting Post. The French ships are extreamly foul, the bottoms of the English Squadron quite clean, these may take or leave; even the immagination of gaining time for the arrival of a Reinforcement was good, the hope encouraged the risque, but I can hardly think Lord Howe as well as he knows the Count's impetus for fight, could have expected such sudden success to his stratagem. The storm which General Sullivan suffered in will have made a great indisposition of both fleets, and they may have since met by single Combatants-the story of a number of ships of War and others in this River and this bay is not yet explained to us-this draws forth another complaint, upon a conference with Monsr. Girard I pressed, weeks since for a regular daily Courier to and from the Capes and Lewistown either by land or water or both. The expence being for an essential service ought to have been no objection, nor indeed has that Article been the obstacle-mere inattention has kept us in ignorance three days, of vessels of War being in the River.  Three hours of this Morning passed in debate whether Governor Franklin should be given in Exchange for Governor McKinly the previous question by aye and nay-an Oration by S.C. Esquire (12) on the improvement of time with the life and characters of Elizabeth and Mary Qu.of Scots-the comparative beauty of black eyes and blue eyes-adjourned.(13) Seldom a question upon a Million of Dollars, seldom an unquestionable demand for an hundred.  The Confederation is now signed by Delegates from ten States as Your Excellency will see in a paper inclosed-Delaware and New Jersey will probably be instructed when their respective Assemblies meet, Maryland 'tis said will not come in without she receives a dower of Land, New York is not bound unless the whole confederate-the decimal is therefore equal to, a 0.  General Lee's tryal ended a week ago. The sentence of the Court Martial is on the road, and ought to have been a secret until Congress had approved or disapproved, but I have been pretty well informed he is acquitted from the charges for disobedience of Orders and shameful retreat, and censured only for insolent letters to the Commander in Chief- (14) -the British Officers in New York, who were good judges of  fact have passed quite a different Verdict. Governor  McKinly assures me upon his honor, they aver he might have taken the whole party before whom he retreated. That his retreat astonished them and led some of them to suspect stratagem-that animadverting on his term \""Check\""-Sir Wm. Erskine the best Soldier they have, replied, \""Lee may call it a check if he pleases, but, by_____ I call it a very handsome flogging, Gentlemen may be convinced now the Americans can and will fight.\""  By a return lately reported from the Board of War, it appears we have ample stores of Cannon, Powder, Balls, Lead &c. &c. and are not deficient in Muskets-and a Member of that Board promises a report in a few days which will demonstrate cloathing of all species for upwards of 40,000 Men-and yet however strange, near half our little Army have long been and are half naked.  A Schedule to be subjoined or inclosed will shew your Excellency what papers are intended to accompany this & to which please to be referred.  And now in order to give Your Excellency some prospect of relief from a tedious Epistle, I turn to Your Excellency's favour above quoted.  The sequel of the Expedition towards Augustine does not strike disappointment upon my Mind. (15) I will say no more upon the subject at present.  Your Excellency will have received Commissions, both Marine and Army and I will endeavour to transmit more of each by Muckinfuss' return, all Commissions signed by the late President and dated on and after 1st November 1777 ought undoubtedly to be exchanged the objections against them are good.  The Commission granted by Governor Caswell to Colonel Carroll appears to me a bad precedent, (l6) nor will it I apprehend be regarded as a Confederal; were Commissions to be granted by the Executive power of each State, and regular immediate notice given to Congress of name rank and date, it would answer all the ends of the present mode and save trouble, but the law and practice being otherwise, I should suppose the instance in question will be deemed invalid. I can perceive much regulation is wanted in this branch, there is ground for believing that a great, very great number of Officers are receiving pay and Rations who have never been in a field of battle who are scatter'd over the face of the Country on various pretences and many employ'd in their private occasions, who will also by means of Certificates and good swearing entitle themselves to half pay after the war. This circumstance leads into deep reflection upon the total derangement of every important department in the Union  The Enemy do not exchange Seamen for any but Seamen of equal rank, and they treat all our Seamen whom they capture with a rigor and barbarity unheard of before the present contest, hence we have begun to retaliate, but our returns of severity bear no kind of pro-  portion-I would not advise to exchange Bachop and Osborne for any persons but Seamen of equal Rank-there is no Cartel established-I have already intimated the interruption-but the Commissaries on each side proceed in exchanging Officer for Officer, Soldier for Soldier, Citizen for Citizen-regarding Rank, the Marine Exchange has been govern'd nearly by like principles, but capriciously and arbitrarily executed on the part of the Enemy-after having by every species of cruelty exercised on our Seamen in order to compel them to enter into their service, under which thousands have died languishing miserable deaths, they have exchanged the emaciated survivors, for healthy well fed fellows, compassion for fellow Citizens on our part has induced us to submit to the injustice and inequality of the Exchange.  I shall make enquiry of the Bills of Exchange vended by Mills and communicate to Your Excellency according to discoveries.  The conduct of the Committee under which Mr. Dorsius acted is misterious. I can say nothing of his own, but from them we can obtain no Accounts-upwards of twelve Months since Accounts of their proceedings were order'd by Congress have elapsed-about ten since Mr. Robert Morris desir'd to take the books into his own custody in order to settle them in a six Months leave of absence which he said he had obtained from his State, (l7) and eight Months he threatened to send them back to Congress, which they by no means forbid, yet to this hour we are without books and remain in total ignorance of the expenditure of 2 1/2 Million of Dollars except that we know a very large sum has been shamefully squandered by a brother of Mr. Morris, supported by him after being fully informed of the infamous practices of his brother by the Commissioners at Paris.(18) This, my dear Sir, is another circumstance leading the Minds of Men who have devoted their time and their fortunes to the public service into deep and melancholly reflections.  I have always held a favourable opinion of Mr. Dorsius, nevertheless I would have no further exchanges of Money or Accounts take place between our treasury and him or his Successor whom as an individual I have likewise a good opinion, without an express order or recommendation from Congress. Meaning hereby to deliver only my own opinion in answer to Your Excellency's enquiry. If the waste in the stream makes your heart ache Sir, the prodigality and profusion at the fountain would break it, and yet I believe it will be necessary to draw you there.  My Colleague Mr. Heyward informs me of his determination to return to South Carolina in a day or two, Mr. Hudson is in Boston, Mr. Matthews sick-I shall do myself the honor of addressing Your Excellency again by the conveyance of Mr. Heyward, and also of Muckinfuss-in the mean time as I am now at the 21st I have an opportunity of adding the sentence of the Court Martial on General  Lee and a copy of a letter from General Sullivan,(19) to which I beg leave to refer, and possibly I may get in tomorrows' Packet-I shall send this to Maryland hoping to overtake Captain Pyne and Martin, whose business at Baltimore they said would detain them till Sunday Noon the 23d.  I have the honor to be &c.  P.S.

  Sir In Congress Philadelphia 21st Aug't 1778 Just now a Letter was read from the Governor of Virginia to Congress in which his Excellancy (in polite Language) informs AUGUST 21, 1778  Congress that having in vain endeavoured to get their accounts adjusted and the United States being indebted to it, the State of Virginia have determined not to pay any Proportion of their Quota untill the accounts are settled.(1) We think it our Duty to inform your Excellency of this Circumstance. Whether the State we have the Honor to represent will imitate this Example it is in their wisdom to determine. Many States have received such astonishingly large advances from the Continent that we have no Conception how they can have been expended on the continental account and, therefore, are led to believe that considerable Sums are due from some Individual, to the United States while on the other Hand it is certain that the Union is considerably indebted to others. Whatever may be the future Determinations of wiser Persons in Congress certain it is that on any Principle Injustice will be done unless all these different accounts be finally closed in a short Time. We do not presume to censure or commend the Conduct of any Sister State much less to hold up any Example to be pursued or avoided, having as we have the fullest Confidence in the Wisdom of our Legislature and that they will upon an intimate Knowledge of their own Circumstances pursue the Line of Conduct which shall be dictated by wisdom, Justice and that patriotic attention to the American Cause by which they have hitherto been distinguished among the several States which compose the Confederacy.  We have the Honor to be with deep Respect Your Excellency's most obedient & humble Servant, F. Lewis,  Gouv'r Morris.  P.S. Mr. Duer is now on Business at the Board of War (2) wherefore he hath not an Opportunity of seeing this Letter.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 3:676-77.  1 This day the Board of Treasury laid before Congress letters from Govs. Patrick Henry of Virginia and Thomas Johnson of Maryland written in response to a July 24 circular letter to the states from the board urging them \""to make Monthly Returns to this Board of the Sums of Money paid into their Hands, for the purpose of supplying the Continental Treasury, conformable to the Resolution of Congress of the 22nd Day of November last.\"" JCC, 11:826. In reply, Henry stated that Virginia would not pay a Continental requisition for $240,000 because Congress' debt to his state already exceeded that amount, and Johnson declared that Maryland could pay only $50,000 of a requisition on her for $130,000. PCC, item 136, 2:481, 485-86. According to a brief note by President Laurens, Congress this day ordered both of these letters \""to lie for information of the Members.\"" Ibid., fol. 479.  2 See James Lovell to Horatio Gates, November 3, 1778, note 6.

  Dear General 23 Augt. [1778] I receiv'd the inclos'd letters two or three days ago from South Carolina.  The last intelligence from Rhode Island is seven days old. General Sullivan writes, that on the 18th he should make an assault on the AUGUST 23, 1778  Enemy, begirt within their lines nearest to Newport town, that he hoped to necessitate General Prescott to come out and fight on very disadvantageous terms, or to Capitulate. General Sullivan had of all sorts 9000 rank and file, his right wing commanded by General Greene, his left by Marquis de la Fayette, Lieutenant Colonel Laurens commanded the advanced Party. The Enemy's strength about 6500 including all their Seamen collected from 6 frigates, 2 gallies, and a great number of transports &c. which Count d'Estaing had oblig'd them to burn and sink.  Count d'Estaing had been drawn out to Sea the 10th Instant upon the appearance of Lord Howe's Squadron close in with the Island, he fled upon the Count's making sail and there was every appearance of stratagem for diverting our Allies from the siege of the Island, for gaining time in expectation of a Reinforcement under Admiral Byron and drawing us into an equal fight-on the 11th it happened a very violent storm of Wind continued to the 13th which had almost ruined our insulated Army-General Sullivan's prospect was then cover'd by gloom, he apprehended the Enemy would take an advantage of his distress; and he had only to trust to his Bayonets, and as he express'd himself, \""to conquer or die.\"" From Mr. Prescotts silence at so critical a time, I conjecture he is by no means as strong as 6500, or that he dare not trust his Men out of the lines and from under his Eye. The desertions from him of scores of Men almost every night, warrants the latter opinion.  How our floating friends and Enemies fared in that storm, or what is become of them, we know not with precision, a Letter from a French Gentleman in the Camp to Monsr. Girard reports that Count d'Estaing had taken one capital English ship and six frigates, or small armed Vessels.  A deserter from New York examin'd by me last night, and he is a very sensible Man, says, the Eagle had been driven on shore back of Long Island, that Lord Howe had saved his person and return'd in a Frigate, that three or four more English ships of the Line were likewise driven on shore and left, but whether the storm of wind or Count d'Estaings cannon had been author of these disasters he could not aver-upon the whole, it is reasonable to conclude the Enemy's fleet is scatter'd and much hurt-that, of our friends we wait to learn the fate of, probably tomorrow will inform us, and I also expect to know tomorrow whether General Sullivan has succeeded according to his sanguine expectations, or has met with a Burgoynade.  General Washington's Army remained at White Plains hemming in Sir Henry Clinton and ordering rations for deserters who are continually coming in. I conjecture Sir Henry has not lost less than 400, since General Washington established his Encampment.  Two Hessian Lieutenants lately deserted from New York, the brother of one of them is Aid de Camp to General Knyphausen, I  expect him every hour. I receiv'd an indirect message from him last night-Deluded, wretched old England! Inclosed you will receive Copy of the sentence of the General Court Martial on General Lee. Observe I send this only for yourself. I have added a Note or two on the paper. I have been assur'd by a Gentleman on whose words I rely that he has often heard the British Officers express their astonishment at the retreat of my old friend, and repeatedly say the party before whom he retired expected nothing less than being every Man Captured. Sir Wm Erskine, particularly animadverting General Lee's phrase of an \""handsome check,\"" said \""Lee may call it what he pleases but by I call it a handsome flogging. We had not receiv'd such an one in America.\"" My dear General I wish you all happiness; and am with great Regard, Your friend and Most Obedt. Servant.

  [August 24, 1778] There is abundant reason to suppose that an engagement has happened at sea between the French squadron and Lord Howe's fleet. Reports are strong that the latter has got a drubbing, and there is reason to believe it from the superiority of the French, and the great ability and spirit of Count d'Estaign. General Sullivan's last letter placed him under regular approaches, within 200 paces of the enemy's works round the town of Newport, and gave us reason to expect a speedy and favourable issue. We expect soon to receive authentick accounts of these two great events.

I have this Morning dispatch'd Mr. Custer a Young Man out. of my own house to view the Post Coach at the Head of Elk. If he approves of it and has an opportunity he will write to you from thence, in order to prevent the disposal or removal of it until I shall  AUGUST 25, 1778  have corresponded through your favor with Mr. Hudson on the great point, the price.  I am inform'd he purchas'd with the Carriage, Harness for four horses, and that there were too cushions, the whole for £250 Currency. His demand therefore, after deducting one set of Harness and one Cushion is enormous.  The Idea that every thing is cheap enough for the present will ruin me unless he takes care to lay a proper restraint. You would be astonish'd if I were to tell you the daily Amount of my expence. I nevertheless, my Dear Sir, thank you for the purchase of the Wine, and within this Cover remit a reimbursement in 134 dollars.  It is said a ship from Bourdeaux is in the Delaware. I am persuaded when it is known in the West Indies the River is open we shall have Vessels dropping in with all kinds of goods, hence I am induced to lay the restraint intimated above for a few days.  Dunlap's Packet will give you the current News of Philadelphia- Let me assure you not one word relative to the French and English Fleets deserves higher regard than as mere report-the most authentic Account respecting them I received from a very sensible Man of the rank of Commissary who lately came in from the Enemy at New York. He says that on the 18th Inst. it was whisper'd among the British and Foreign Officers that Lord Howe's Squadron had receiv'd very great injuries; the Eagle and 3 or 4 other ships of the line were driven on shore on the back of Long Island, but whether by the French fleet or by the storm, he could not positively tell, but believe the latter, except the ragged and distressed state of the Isis and that one frigate dismasted had got into New York all is conjecture. I expect this Evening or tomorrow Morning to receive regular Advices.  You will find within, Copy of General Sullivan's late letter, by no means let this be publish'd. I sent it for your amusement and information. My hopes of success at Rhode Island without the further aid of Count d'Estaing are exceedingly faint-'tis probable however there will be much blood spilt.

This instant I have a Letter from the General of the 19th inclosed in one of the 21st from His Excellency the Commander in Chief.

  Sir 26th Aug. [1778] Mr. Thomson Secretary of Congress, shewed me a Note Yesterday in which you enquired of him whether he had any dispatches for Head Quarters; this message I apprehend arose from Your having AUGUST 26, 1778  receiv'd no Answer from me to your favor of the 8th which had accompanied a Packet from the British Commissioners.(1) I beg you will be assured Sir, my silence has not been the effect of disregard (the practice of Congress is to receive public Letters from the President, and to make such order or no order as the house shall think proper. The President when there is an Order carries it into Execution, but he has the letter no longer in his custody. It is f led in the Secretary's Off ice.)  (Upon Your letter there was an Order made, but directed to his Excellency General Washington which I transmitted immediately, and should have paid the same attention to General Maxwell.)  Your Letter, Dear General together with the Commissioners Paper which is of a very extraordinary nature were referred to a special Committee who have not reported. Be assured of hearing from me immediately after I shall have received any Order from Congress.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia Augt. 26th. 1778 The time to which I am confined, deprives me of the very singular pleasure I always feel in communicating in the fulest manner my sentiments, to a person for whom I entertain so high an Esteem, & will only admit of my acknowledging the receipt of your very exceptable & most agreeable favor of the 18th July which I received this morning, & hearing Mr. McLean was to set off in an hour, I thought it would be some satisfaction to you to know your letter was come to hand.  Nothing very material has happened since Heyward left us. We had a letter from Sullivan yesterday dated 19th. He says he has two Batteries erected within musket shot, & one half Musket shot, from the Enemies principal works, he shall continue untill he has compleated the whole of his works before he fires a shot, & then he is to play the Devil with them in a very little time. He says They keep up an incessant heavy fire upon him but hitherto had done him no harm, not even kill'd a Man, in short he speaks as confidently of success as if he was already in possession of New Port, I shan't believe him a bit the sooner for it. It was but four days before that he wrote Congress the Damndest jumping, whining letter, that ever old Woman did. We have not yet heard a Syllable of Count De Estaing  AUGUST 26, 1778  that can be depended on. I am in hopes by McInfuss, to give you a more satisfactory acco. of these matters.  You can't conceive the Joy, the sight of your well know hand afforded me, it was indeed inexpressable, for Mr. Hall mentioned to me, some time ago, the dangerous situation you were then in, & never having heard anything of you since my anxiety was great indeed. This state of uncertainty has prevented me writing to you. But now that I am assured of your recovery, you may expect to have your time again broke in upon, as it has hitherto been by the obligation that I know your politeness will lay you under, of perusing my scribbling.

  My dear Hetty Camp at White Plains Aug 26, 1778 We did not reach This Place before Sunday Evening owing to The Heat of The Weather & some other Circumstances which usually attend the Travelling of Ladies, however upon the whole it has not been unpleasant. The Weather since we have been here has been if possible more disagreeable than before & we feel it more sensibly, as our Quarters are hot & very dirty. I think I never met with such a Combination of Smells & every one offensive. This Army seems at present to be stationary & indeed both main Armies appear to be looking at Rhode Island where there is hourly Expectation of something important. The French Fleet have returned, but very much shattered by the late Storm which has handled both Squadrons pretty severily. Two French Men of War are dismasted & one missing. We have Papers from New York from which we can gather that some of the British Fleet are returned but from Rivington's Silence there is great Reason to think they have suffered very much. I have very great Doubt of the Rhode Island Business-Sulivans Evil Genius I fear will follow him, & some Circumstances daily transpire which countenance my Apprehensions. I shall forward the Business here with all possible Expedition that I may return to Philad. where I am much wanted & where my Interest evidently calls me.

  Sir, Hd. Qrs. White Plains August 27th. 1778 (1)  An opinion is prevalent in the Army that the officers of it have no authority to enlist the drafted Levies for three years or during the continance of the War, on a supposition that Congress do not incline to have such enlistments made. Whence this opinion may be derived is uncertain but it would be surely wise to clear up a doubt which in its consequences may prove so injurious to the keeping up a respectable Army.  A great spirit for enlisting has taken place among the Soldiery who are brought into the Army as drafts for a short Term, on a supposition that the war will speedily be determined.  This event being at best uncertain & may be rendered more so in a few days, we beg leave to suggest to Congress the expediency of authorizing the enlistment of all Soldiers in the Army for short periods, during the term of three years or the continuance of the War. We wish an immediate adoption of this measure, that all possible advantage may be derived from the present temper of the Army  We are most respectfully, Sir, Your most Obt. Servants,  Jos.

  Dear Sir: hiladelphia 27th August 1778. Upon my arrival here, I met with the Enclosed Letter. Congress seems to go on in the Old way, sometimes disputing upon trifles, & neglecting the greater matters of the Law.  The Expedition against Rhode Island seemed to be in train for Success. Your friend Genl. Sullivan (1) having landed without Opposition with between 3 & 4000 Regulars, & a Body of Militia from the N England States, & the French Squadron under the Count De Estaing having made an Attack upon the Enemy's Fortifications & had in a very short time Silenced two of their Batteries, but were Surprised at the Appearance of a British fleet off the Harbour, which Obliged the French Admiral to put to sea the next Morning in Order to Engage the Enemy; this, Lord Howe endeavoured to avoid by flight, & the French fleet were seen in pursuit of him at 11 O'Clock -no certain Intelligence had been since received of the event of this Manieuvre. Genl Sullivan however Marched up Near the Enemy, who had evacuated all their Out Posts & retired within their lines near the Town. Our Genl. had under Cover of a fog, erected a Battery within 250 yards of the Enemy's works, & intended to begin a Cannonade as soon as the fog Cleared away. Indeed the General seems to promise himself success at all events and is by his Letter to Congress, in high Spirits. He has heretofore been unlucky; who knows but Fortune, who is a fickle Jade, may favour him at last. I hope she will. AUGUST 27. 1778  Inclosed are the last papers, to them I refer you for what little news is Stirring.  When the Assembly meets I beg you will endeavour to get their Account of expenditures for Continental Services Sent: in which Ought to be included, the expence of the Armament to quell the Insurrection, the Expedition against the Indians, the Militia sent to Virginia, & those raised on several Other Occasions. I am firmly of Opinion these matters ought to be made a Continental Charge, as you know such Charges are made, & allowed to the Other States daily. I hope you, Mr. Hooper, Maclain, &c., will exert yourselves on this Occasion. Coll Hogan is arrived with near 600 Men, & as soon as they are furnished with money &c will proceed immediately to White Plains, where Genl. Washington with the Main Army are Encamped, ready to Act as Circumstances may require. Genl. Lee's Tryal is ended and the Sentence of the Court Martial is in these words-\""The Court do Sentence Major Genl. Lee to be suspended from any Command in The Armies of the United States of North America for the Term of Twelve months.\"" Signed-Sterling, Major General & President. The Whole proceedings of the Court Martial are now before Congress, but nothing, as yet done in it. They are only Ordered to be Printed.(2) Our friends are all well & desire their Complmts to you-be pleased to present mine to Mrs. Burke. I am with great truth, Dr Sir, Your real friend & Obt.

  Sir Philadelphia August 27th. 1778 I embrace the first opportunity since my arrival to throw a few lines to your Excellency which I am obliged to do without method or correction. Col. Hogan is just arrived with 500 odd men, and will I believe proceed immediately to Head Quarters at White Plains. I take the liberty to inclose some of the last papers. Our affairs at Rhode Island seem to wear a promising aspect. You will find that the French Admiral the Count de Estaing after beginning an attack  AUGUST 27, 1778  upon the Enemy's Fortifications, had silenced two of their Batteries-when an English Fleet appeared off the Harbor in the Evening which obliged the Count to proceed to Sea the next morning to engage them, and was seen at 11 o'clock in pursuit, & the Enemy flying before them, Genl. Sullivan who commands our Army on the Island seems to be in high Spirits, the Enemy having evacuated all their out Posts, and retired within their lines near the Town of New Port. Our Army under cover of a fog, had erected a Battery within 250 yards of their lines, and seem to intend to force them, we are in Anxious expectation of the Event as our General seems confident of success. The Enemy having no prospect to retreat, having been obliged by the approach of the French Fleet to burn Five of their Frigates and two Gallies, and had by the last accounts received but one Frigate left at Newport which upon the return of the French Fleet must be also destroyed or fall into their hands.  Genl. Washington with the main army remains still at White Plains, waiting I suppose the event of the expedition against Rhode Island. I also enclose the sentence of the Court-Martial which sat on the trial of General Lee.  I must now beg leave to call your Excellency's attention to some matters which particularly concern the state which I have the Honor to represent.  I cannot find as yet that Congress have reduced the number of supernumerary Officers in the several Battalions of the different states in the manner they have done to our Officers, if so, the states have not been equally dealt by.  Our Troops of Light-Horse have been shamefully neglected, having been long in want of accoutrements, while other new raised Corps have been completely Accoutred.  No General Officer from our State has been as yet appointed, altho' the General Assembly recommended two Gentlemen to be nominated by their Delegates which was done in the most pressing manner in December last.(1)  The requisition of the state for 500,000 dollars for Bounty pay &c of the men raised to complete the 6th Regiment as the Quota of our State, agreeable to the new arrangement has been refused by Congress without assigning any reason as I find on their Journal, only a very short resolve to send 100,000 Dollars in lieu of 500,000 required, and that resolve enclosed to your Excellency without a letter from the President mentioning the notices which induced the measure.(2)  I am informed it has been asserted in Congress in the absence of our Members, that the state of No. Carolina had received from the Continental Treasury more than their proportion of money, and until their account against the United States should be properly liquidated, no farther sums should be advanced. This will convince you  Sir, of the absolute necessity of sending on the accounts and vouchers, not only those relative to the supplies to the Continental Troops, but also those relative to the Insurrection, The Indian Expedition, the militia sent to Virginia and those called out on several other occasions. As I find all the other States are endeavouring to do the same, I am very well convinced that No. Carolina is largely in advance to the Continent, much more I expect, than will pay the state requisition, which if I remember right was 250,000 dollars. I have been exceedingly hurt when called upon to produce the demand our State has against the United States, and must repeat to your Excellency my earnest desire that you will be pleased to send on the accounts and vouchers stated by Gentlemen well acquainted with accounts as every matter of this sort will be very strictly scrutinised by Commissioners of Claims appointed for that purpose.  I wish we could have been represented in Congress, at the time the requisition for 500,000 dollars was made.(3) I flatter myself the State would not have been affronted in so gross a manner, I stayed at York Town until the very last day to which I was appointed, being resolved to travel home at my own expense, rather than leave the State unrepresented. If I had an opportunity of attending the General Assembly, I would propose that 6 Delegates for Our State should be annually appointed and that three of them should attend 6 months, and the other three the remaining 6 months, and there to continue until they were relieved by others of the new appointment, and no delegate to be paid for a longer time, than his traveling to, attendance on, and returning home. By this means the state would be at very little expense (annually) more than they are at present, and be continually represented. I need not mention to you, Sir, the necessity of having your state constantly represented in Congress; you are too well acquainted with public assemblies to doubt of such necessity. Had either of my associates or even myself been present the credit of the State of No. Carolina would not have been so wantonly sported with. Myself and my Colleagues intend as soon as we can find an opening to introduce this subject. For my own part, I can't be easy, until Congress explain to the state, the reasons of their conduct. They have been so taken up since my arrival with business of very great importance to the public; that we have not had it in our power as yet to bring this matter on, but are determined to do it, as soon as possible. I could have wished that Congress had appointed a Deputy pay Master General in our State, and had taken care to have supplied a Military Chest with money necessary for the pay & subsistence of their Troops, this measure has taken place in almost every One of the other States. I assure you, altho' I sincerely wish the accounts & vouchers may be speedily sent on, I shudder at the difficulty I expect to meet with, in the passing them in such a   manner, as may give satisfaction to the state; I shall contribute all in my power toward accomplishing these purposes.  The bearer of this is Col. Marbury of Georgia who has promised me to call on your Excellency in his way home, this Gentleman comes well recommended to me by Genl. Howe, & I beg leave to mention him to you, as a Gent. of Merit.  I have the honor to be with great respect your Excellency's Most Ob. humbl. servt. Corns. Harnett  ""

  Dear Sir 27th Augt. [1778] I should not have remained so long in arrear for your Excellency's obliging Letter of the 9th June, (1) had I not flatter'd myself with hopes that long before this day the circumstances of Georgia would have been introduced as a subject demanding the consideration of Congress-but it has happen'd otherwise. To account for the probable reasons would be extremely unpleasant, and perhaps at this time equally improper; nevertheless, 'tis my duty Sir, as a fellow Citizen to suggest to you in that, as well as in the character of Supreme Magistrate of a State that in my humble opinion we cannot fairly ascribe the dormancy of this and of very many other momentous concerns, to want of leisure.  I see with grief the return of our troops from East Florida without that success which Your Excellency had hoped for, this unhappy circumstance will add to the distresses of Georgia and increase her cries for relief.  While St. Augustine remains in possession of the Enemy, Georgia will be unhappy, and her existence as a free and Independent State rendred very doubtful. South Carolina too will be continually galled by Rovers and Cruizers from that Pestiferous nest-another Expedition must therefore be undertaken at a season of the Year which will not out vie the bullets and bayonets of the Enemy in the destruction of our Men.  I have before me a Plan for reducing East Florida which I will have the honor of communicating to Your Excellency very soon;(2) in the mean time I am constrained to say that unless the several States will keep their representation in Congress fill'd by Men of compe- AUGUST 27, 1778  tent abilities, unshaken integrity, and unremitting diligence, a Plan which I very much fear is laid for the subduction of our Confederal Independence will, by the operations of mask'd Enemies be completely executed, so far I mean as relates to all the Sea Coast and possibly to the present Generation. Were I to unfold to you Sir, scenes of venality, peculation and fraud which I have discovered, the disclosure would astonish you, nor would you Sir be less astonished, were I by a detail which the occasion would require, prove to you, that he must be a pitiful rogue indeed, who, when detected, or suspected, meets not with powerful advocates among those, who in the present corrupt time, ought to exert all their powers in defence and support of these friend-plundered, much injured, and I was almost going to say, sinking States. Dont' apprehend Sir, that I colour too highly or that any part of these intimations are the effect of rash judgment or despondency. I am warranted to say, they are not; my opinion, my sentiments, are supported every day by declaration of Individuals; the difficulty lies in bringing Men collectively to attack with vigour a proper object. I have said so much to you Sir, as Governor of a State, not intended for public conversation, which sound policy forbids; and at the same time commands deep thinking in every Man appointed a Guardian of the fortunes and honor of these Orphan States.  Colonel McClean who will do me the honor to bear this Address to Your Excellency is well acquainted with the present state of our Arms. Copies of two Letters from General Sullivan, which will accompany this, will shew that of his particular and important department as it stood 8 days ago-every hour I expect further intelligence, had he been successful and as expeditiously so, as his sanguine hopes had mark'd out I should have received the important tidings the day before yesterday.  Not a word that has been said or printed respecting Count d'Estaing's and Lord Howe's fleets, merits confidence, an engagement, and a smart one too, there has undoubtedly been, but who was victorious and what losses each party sustained are unknown in this City-this fact only, that the British fleet had greatly suffer'd and had carried in no prizes four days ago, is ascertained; and from the following paragraph in General Washington's letter of the 21st there is ground to hope that many of Lord Howe's original shew of ships at Rhode Island have been detained by his rival or lost in the late storm. \""By advices from an Officer of Rank and intelligence who is stationed in view of the Sea I am inform'd that 16 ships enter'd the Hook on the 17th, one having a flag, and that on that and the preceding day a heavy cannonade was heard at Sea.\""(3) This days Packet may afford Your Excellency more intelligence.

I feel convinc'd that had Your Excellency named a sum in Gold and apply'd for it to Congress, an order for the Amount would have pass'd AUGUST 28, 1778  without hesitation-but from circumstances which I have more than a few times observed to attend Motions made from private Letters by Gentlemen of Merit and influence transcending far, any that I presume to claim I feared on your Account Sir, to hazard a question in the present case. There is a jealousy in the Minds of Men as unaccountable and unreasonable, as it is unnecessary to add a word more upon the subject; to contribute, however, towards forwarding Your Excellency's labours for public good, and from a melancholly conviction of the policy and necessity for constantly prosecuting the measures for which Gold in the present critical moment is wanted, I have pack'd up a few pieces the particulars noted below, which had been lying by me altogether useless and which do not comprehend my whole stock; these may possibly be of immediate service and I may be reimburs'd when Congress shall order a supply, which I am persuaded will be in the instant of Your Excellency's demand; be this as it may I intreat your Excellency will permit me to insist upon the receipt and application of this mite. I do not presume to offer it to General Washington but as a loan to our Country who will repay me amply even by permitting my endeavours to serve her.  I do not remember that ever an application was made by the Camp Committee of Congress.

Bedloes Business.(1) I shall esteem it a Favor if you will write me without the Colorings of Friendship or Pity exactly his Character, Particularly in Accounting and the like. Suppose at the same time that it were a Question to put Officers in the Treasury, marine or Commercial Departments and under this Idea converse with our common Friend and our Governor and let me know Names & Characters. I think I shall serve the public by nominating to Employments Men who can produce so flattering a Testimonial as that must be which you thence shall sanction. Duer who ought to have been gone hence long since will I believe soon go. What will become of your Representation I know not. I think I cannot much longer attend. The Depreciation here rapidly increasing hath arrived to such a Pitch that I am confident my Expences are between 15 & 20 Dollars per Day. Where is Duane? Above all where is Schuyler? In Times like the present I dare not cannot quit my Post tho to continue at it is big with Ruin. Should I leave the State unrepresented I shall be censured by all. If the Representation is defective in Abilities, our true Interests will receive an irreparable  AUGUST 28, 1778  Injury. This Continent now suffers from the Want of a Representation from New York in the Winter of 1776 & 1777. Should our State again neglect this most essential Point we shall from that Moment loose the Confidence of five States which It gives me Pleasure to say we now fully possess. I might have said six perhaps seven. For Heaven's Sake contrive if possible to have in the Delegation Men of Abilities & Industry and who possess such Property that they can afford to sacrifice a few thousands to the general Cause. For sacrifice they must unless the Expenditures of the Delegation be placed on a more respectable Footing by far than they are at present or they will content themselves to live in a Style which will deprive them of all Weight & Influence. My warmest sincerest Love awaits you, your Family & all our Friends. We have here no News of any Quality. I can however with Pleasure inform you that we make Approaches towards regulating our Finances tho slowly. This is an object which I shall not loose Sight of. I ardently wish to see it placed on a proper Basis. I know the Thing to be practicable but to accomplish the End in View it is necessary that those who preside should be liberal & wise, and that they should steadily pursue a well digested System. I see Interests to reconcile, Passions to assuage and Men to be found. After all Time alone can render any Measures effectual. We may indeed patch up our sinking Credit by Expedients but a life of Expedients is a Life I abhor. After every Expedient hath been used the Business will be only more complex. After exhibiting every Quack Remedy the Patient will [be] more exhausted the Case more desperate. Adieu. Vive Vale. Yours sincerely, Gouv Morris  ""

  Sir Philada. Augt. 28th. 1778 Your Letter of 16th March last has come safe to hand & I am obliged to Messr. Deucher Riedy & Co. of Nantes for their Introduction of this Correspondance.(1) In Answer to the Questions you ask I must now tell you that the best Method of extracting Merchandise from France is by Vessells bound from thence direct to this Country, formerly we made use of the French & Dutch Islands in the West Indies & first carried the Goods thither in Vessells belonging to those Countries, but as I expect France & Great Britain must be at open War before you receive this Letter it is useless to send Goods to the French West India lslands as that would only expose them to double freight & Insurance with charges in the Islands & not as formerly lessen the Risque of Captures. The Goods you mention are all Sale AUGUST 28, 1778  able here & much wanted; formerly we were entirely supply'd with those articles from England & our Intercourse with them having been so long stopped, Supplys from other Countrys are yet very inconsiderable & our own People too much employed in War & Agriculture to Manufacture. You may readily judge what must be our Wants therefore you have nothing to do but send hither soon as you can any Quantities of the Articles mentioned in your Letter. We raise Considerable Quantities of Hemp & Flax ourselves, but do not manufacture Sufficient of Cordage, Sail Cloth or Linnen & these Articles are always in good Demand, Lace is chiefly used by the Ladies, some Quantities will sell well but they must not be too large, Muslins sell well, as will also Hardware, Paints, Woollen Stuffs & Cloths but you will take care that every thing is of a good Quality, proportioned to its cost. Wines that come here should be of a good Body & round, not sweet, dry Wines being most used. Hardware is much wanted but should be good & that from England is preferred to any other. Shoud you send any Goods put them on board Small fast Sailing Vessells, if you can meet with such & your Returns may be made in Tobacco, Rice, Indigo, Wheat, Flour, Tar, Pitch, Turpentine, Skins, Furrs &c!

  Sir Philadelphia 29th August 1778 I do myself the honor to write you tho I have not the happiness of your Acquaintance: On Acct particularly of Major Bigelows being so long detaind at Congress, as the Reasons of his Delay in my Oppinion really Plead an Excuse: at least I wish to show my full Disapprobation of the Measure. On Major Bigelow presenting yours & Genl Parsons Letter to Congress & makeing known his Business: I perceived an Opposition against granting the Money proposed and of such a Nature as not to be agreable to me.(1) The first attact  AUGUST 29, 1778  seamd. to be levelld. agt. the State of Connecticut in general and at Govr. Trumbull and Genl Parsons in particular: But this being so fully obviated by one of my worthy Colleagues: that it subsided: The Matter was committed and a Report brought in stating a Number of facts and proposeing sundry Resolves: one of which was designd as a Censure upon you. This appeard. to some Gentlemen so illfounded and unjust that they were lead to examine into the facts stated. I have not the Report before me & can not pretend to be very exact: but it was said that you had no Right to order the purchase by Major Bigelow as there was a Clothier with the Army (vizt) Major Measom: that the Resolution of Congress under which you acted directed the Clothier Genl. to send a Deputy or assistant to the Army on the North River & that in the Mean Time the Commanding Officer take such Orders &c: (The words of the Resolve I pretend not to repeat). The Argument was that as you had a Clothier with you, your Power in that respect ceasd. & This lead some Gentlemen to examin into Mr. Measom & Col. Hews's (2) appointments as it was represented that Mr. Measom succeed Col. Hews: and for my own part I considered them only in the lights of Issuing Commissary. The Report however was in favour of granting the Money notwithstand you had no power to appoint Major Bigelow. This Matter was fully discussd. and it was urged that the Resolve negating your power and expressing a Censure on you should not pass: as there appeard no kind of Necessity for such a Step and it rather appeard. Like seeking an occasion agt you. 2dly that it was unconstitutional to censure any Gentleman much less a high Officer in his publick Conduct unheard. 3dly that the proposed resolve was ill founded &c. Many other Arguments were made off and on the whole the matter passd. in the Negative and the Money was ordered &c.  I am sorry to Observe that in the whole progress of this Affair it appeard. to me that every Obsticle was thrown in the way by one Gentleman from a State which is under the highest Obligation to you. The Gentleman I refer to Major Bigelow well knows.(3) I ask your Pardon for the Freedom I have used. I write in Confidence. I should not have giveing you this but was assured by Major Bigelow you would accept it well: In this I Claim no Credit as it was the Cause of Truth & Justice alone which Influenced him who has the Honor to be with the highest Esteam, Your Obedt. humbe Servt.(4)  Andw Adams ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 29th August 1778 I have the pleasure of acknowledging the Rect. of your favour of the 14th Instant by Mr. Sheldon: and am happy to find you have none of those fears which my Timidity & want of Experience as well as Want of knowledge in Politicks suggested.(1)  Had Great Britain acknowledged our Independence (which I am convinced she must and will do) before actual Hostilities had been commenced between her and France I conceive we should have had no occation of Consulting France in making peace with Britain: which perhaps we must now do as both France and we have acknowledged those eventual Ingagements contained in the Treaty have become positive: in this View not the Alliance itself so much as the arival of their Fleet in Consequence of which those acknowledgments between us have been made is what gave me some Apprehensions. For should a simular Treaty take place between us and Spain (which perhaps may already be the Case) and should France think of posessing the West India Islands: and Spain the two Floridas, (which in my Oppinion is not altogether chimerical) and then both unite in the Idea of totally extirpating England, A Quere would arise whether they would not expect our Assistance; Besides the Inconvenience of their posessing those places. However I confess this is looking forward some ways: I fully agree with you that we are not blindly to trust the Justice: much less the Generosity of any Nation unconnected with their Interest.  An Instance on which to ground our Caution I think we have before us is the french fieet leaveing R. Island in the Midst of an Expedition Jointly undertaken and going to Boston in order to refit when they might as well refitted there and at the same time Co-opperated with our forces: & also in Carrying off their Land as well sea forces. However this Matter requires some further Explanation; I feal anxious for the Event of that Expedition: and am in hourly expectation of further Intilligence: We receive constant Official Accounts by Expresses.  Our main Army it seams are Lying Still to watch the Motions of AUGUST 29, 1778  Genl Clinton. I Quere wither the Appearance of investing if not an Actual Attact upon Newyork should not have taken place before now. I have seen the Duke of Richmond's proposed Address and am fully of your Oppinion upon that Subject. Our foreign Intelligence gives us Reason to expect that a Treaty of Neutrality and Commerce with Holland will soon take place; and continues to assure us of the favorable Regards of most of the great Powers of Europe. Three Days in each Week are set apart for considering the Subject of our finances: and a lengthy complex plan for organizing a New board of Treasury has been laid before Congress. Genl. Mackentosh now at Fort Pitt is to be reinforced with 1500 Men from Virginia in Order to make an Attact upon the Nearest Settlements of the hostile Tribes of indians.  A flood of small Business from every Quarter continues to crowd out the great important Matters.  The great Neglect in Congress I think unpardonable.

  Sir Philadelphia 29th Augst. 1778. The desire we have of preserving every appearance of attention in our correspondence with your Excellency induces us to embrace this opportunity to write by Major Bigelow, though nothing very material hath come to our knowledge worthy to be communicated.  The finances of the States are at present the principle subject of the deliberations of Congress. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday of every week are set apart for this purpose; but little progress is yet made.  A plan for organizing a Board of Treasury is laid before Congress, and is to be taken into consideration this day. It is long and complex, time will not allow us to attempt giving you an abstract of it. (1) The Army on the North river is Iying still to watch the motions of Sir Henry Clinton in New York. The Rhode Island expedition seems only fruitful of events-these operations must be better known to Your Excellency than to Us.  Various accounts give us reason to fear an extensive confederacy to fall upon our frontiers is forming under the auspices of Col. Butler, and other British incendiaries, among the Indian nations & unless prevented by some speedy and vigorous movements on our part, may open a scene of ravage and desolation on our borders, more distressing than any this war, calamitous as it has been hath prevented. The Senecas, Otawawas, Wiandawts, and Mingoes (if we are not mistaken) are the principal of the hostile tribes, and threaten to fall upon the Indian nations who will not join. Genl. McIntosh is at Fort Pitt, where he is to be joined by 1500 men from Virginia and to fall upon the settlements of such of the hostile Indians as are nearest to him-carrying the war into their settlements, is thought the best expedient to break their confederacy, and induce them to give over their hostile designs. Our European Intelligence gives us reason to expect that a Treaty of neutrality and commerce  AUGUST 29, 1778  with Holland will soon be concluded-and continues to assure us of the favorable regards of most of the great powers of Europe.  We have nothing further worthy of Your Excellency's notice; a flood of small business daily pours in from every part of the Continent, & pushes aside the great & important concerns of the States, which we can only lament as an evil at present inevitable, and worthy to be remedied if any remedy can be found for it.  Permit us to add our cordial wishes that your Excellency's important services may be continued and that you may live to see the fruits of your Labour, in the establishment of liberty peace & happiness in these States & to assure you that we are with the greatest respect, your Excellency's most obedient, and very humble Servant,  Titus Hosmer.

  29th Augt. [1778] I had the pleasure of addressing you last Sunday & of hearing since by a kind intimation from your General that you were then well; but I have not receiv'd a line from you later than the 7th.  I should not have troubled you just now had not an odd circumstance of this Morning rendered it in some degree necessary.  A Monsr. Galvan lately a Lieutenant in the second South Carolina Regt. call'd on me and requested with very little Ceremony introductory Letters in his favor to His Excellency the Commander in Chief, and to Major General Sullivan. I had heard from Mr. J. Rutledge that Galvan had resign'd his Commission upon Colonel Motts refusing him a furlough for making a Campaign and seeking promotion in the Army now at White Plains-with great candour and I am sure no less politeness and civility I lamented to the Gentleman that he had committed so great an error, assuring him that I could give him no hopes of promotion, and producing many instances in order to convince him that he was spending his Money and time in a fruitless pursuit-he would then be content he said to act as a Volunteer, but press'd for Letters to the Generals, from which I attempted to excuse myself by remarking that I had receiv'd repeated informations of the inutility and even troublesomeness of supernumerary Gentleman Volunteers in the Army, that therefore I could not consistently with my own honor and with that respect which is due to General Washington add the slightest weight to his present burthen.  AUGUST 29, 1778  Mr. Galvan continuing to importune I prevail'd upon myself to say there was one Gentleman in the Army with whom I might take liberties. I had a Son who I understood was in good Credit there, to him I would give a recommendatory letter, the Gentleman reply'd he should be glad of an acquaintance with my Son, but he knew he had no Command in the Army and then demonstrated that he had as little command of good manners by abruptly retiring. Mr. Silas Deane sat impatiently during this dialogue, fearing that I should have acquiesc'd in Mr. Galvans intreaties: immediately therefore after he had turned his back, Mr. Deane informed me of some very naughty tricks this young French Adventurer had play'd in Paris, which he discover'd from my Conversation I was ignorant of. You will therefore be on your guard-Galvan speaks perfect English, is well read and can behave like a Gentleman in all exterior deportment when he is not chagrined by disappointment.(1)  When I was at York town I sent Letters which I had receiv'd thro' Governor Johnstone from my friends Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning either to Your General or to yourself for perusal. I request you, my dear Son, return them as soon as you can.  I need not tell you that I have written in great haste and under many interruptions nor that I shall be glad to receive a two and twenty days Epistle from you.  I pray God to protect you.  ""

  Dear General, Phila. Augt. 29th. 1778. I am to entreat your pardon for not having sent you the inclosed letter before now, and I think I shall obtain my request when you know the reasons that have caused the detention. This letter arrived before we left York, and before my brother returned to Virginia from Congress. Among many other foreign letters, this by mistake was carried to Virginia by my brother, (1) and not until lately returned. I hope however that no ill consequence will have arisen from its not reaching you sooner.  It grieves me that our flattering prospects at Rhode Island are so changed. This change of affairs will probably sustain the hopes of our enemies, and induce them to disturb our tranquility much longer than otherwise they would have done. I do not see how a war between France and G. Britain can now be avoided. Yet you may discover by Admiral Keppels letter about the taking of the two french frigates, that he considers his Ministry as acting with fear and trembling about things that may involve the necessity of rupture. I cannot help wishing that they may get heartily at it, because I think that during the progress of such a contest, we may find means of most effectually securing our independency.  The Dutch, according to custom, are for neutrality and commerce, and commerce with these States. How the latter can be prosecuted without destroying the other, time will discover. But it would seem that G. Britain must, upon her own principles oppose such commerce; whilst the Dutch I presume will not acquiesce with the capture of the Ships coming here.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia Augt. 30th. 1778. I wrote to you a few days ago by Mr. McLean of Georgia, in which I promised to answer yours of 11 July, more fully by McKinfus, who tells me he shall go tomorrow morning.  It is true I did oppose the Embargo act, as I shall uniformly do, every act of Congress, where I perceive an attempt to step over that constitutional line which has been chaulked out to them, even independent of the Confederation, for if they can exceed their powers in one instance, they may claim an equal right to do it in any & which was the case in this affair for the favourers of the measure claimed a right to do it, because they had done it before & surely said they if we had a right to do it once, we have a right to do it again. This proves to what dangerous lengths Precedents may be carryed, for which reason, I think every, the least attempt in Congress to go beyond the bounds of their Constitution should be immediately checked. Never suffer the plea of necessity to justify the Act, for a specious pretext can never be wanted, by artful men, to cover even the most arbitary measure, under the guise of necessity & if such a doctrine is once admitted, what is to hinder them, from at last totally subverting the Liberties of America. Examples of this nature are within the knowledge of every Man of reading, & because the people of America have a very high Opinion of & a very extensive confidence in the present Congress (I mean previous to our being Confederated) I would for that very reason be doubly watchful of AUGUST 30, 1778  their Conduct, as the precedents they now make will hereafter be excercised by a set of men less virtuous, to the worst purposes. I'll assure you I don't remember any thing that has come within my knowledge since the beginning of these troubles, that has given me more uneasiness, than the eager disposition that appeared in Congress to have that Embargo carryed into execution, they even suspended taking up the Confederation, untill this measure could be carryed, which I think was taking a very uncandid, & unjustifyable advantage of the unlimited powers they conceived to be prior to the ratification of the Confederation, lodged in their hands, but which was, notwithstanding, in my humble opinion, a very gross mistake, for I must ever deny they had at any time this power, for if this is conceded to them, then they have indisputably a right to legislate for the whole whenever they see fit, & which acts of legislation must be binding, whether approved by the States or not, the contrary position, I have always understood to be the true one. If they ever had this right or if it had been deemed eligible, they ought to have had it. Why was it not made an Article in the Confederation? That this right was never given up to Congress, is already proven, by the Acts of the diflerent legislatures, & which speak their sense of the matter, for you find them lodging the power of laying Embargos, in their Executive branc[h]es for a certain limited time. This evidently is productive of a confused clashing of the Acts of Congress, with those of the different States. The same Arguments that may be made use of for the propriety of lodging this power with Congress may be adduced for giving them several other important powers they at present have not. For God's sake let's stop where we are, & take a breath a little. Let anyone attentively examine, what the powers of Congress are, when they have done this, I cannot perswade myself they will be for giving more, in my poor opinion they are already enormous. That single one of borrowing & making what money they please, & I may truely say without controul, is sufficient for, & I am affraid in the end will, be our destruction. I know my sentiments on this point, are rather singular, however, I also know your candour therefore I speak freely. This a most extensive field for Argument, & will admit of a great deal being said on it, but I am sure I must already have tired your patience, therefore shall make but one observation more. There are two reasons assigned by the Proclamation for laying this embargo. The first is, the better to feed our own army. Now let us consider from whence the resources for this purpose are drawn. The four New England States raise very little more meat provisions than is necessary for their own consumption together with that of the convention troops, and Sulivans army, what they have to spare, they are glad to exchange for bread from hence. The Distressed situation of New York & Jersey enables them to raise a bare sufficiency for themselves. Then it is Pensylvania, Maryland,   Virginia, & No. Carolina that must produce these supplies, for it is most evident that So. Carolina & Georgia contribute nothing, or next to nothing, towards it, as their chief provisions are such, that the army do not, nor will not, if they had it in even so great abundance consume scarcely any part of it, but if they were ever so fond of it, the almost insurmountable difficulty of getting it to them, would render it an object not worthy of the least attention, As to the other reason, vizt. to distress the enemy it is in itself so glaring an absurdity, that cannot require an argument to prove it. Here are the interests of two States, compleatly sacrificed to answer us one valuable purpose-does this shew the propriety of this power being lodged with Congress?  I would be glad to know, by what authority our President carryed the Act of Congress fully into execution, when by our Constitution, he can only lay an Embargo for thirty days? (1) The Devil's in these Mighty men, I think. Under the rose. All the news I have at present to inform you of, is, the return of Count De Estaings fleet to Rode Island prodigously shattered in the late Violent storm, the Lanquedoc of 90, & one 74 Gun ships are intirely dismasted, & otherwise much damaged, one 74 still missing. We don't learn that there has been any action between them & the British fleet. The French fleet are obliged to proceed to Boston to get refitted. This I am apprehensive, will produce a necessity for our quitting the Seige of Rode Island, as in case of a failure of [. . .] success. The Insular situation [. . .] would be subject to [. . .] being cut off by two or three [of th]eir frigates. The chance of succeding [. . .] is, in my opinion, against us.  The Delegates of So. Carolina give an entertainment to the French Minister on the 2d Septr. at the expence of the State, which we hope will be approved of. Hutson is not yet return'd from Boston. I shall rely on the House granting me leave to return home, agreeable to my request & propose setting off, about the 20th November. I am Dr. Bee, with the most sincere regard, Yr. most Obedt. Servt.

  Dr. Sir, Philadelphia 31st August 1778 Your kind favour of the l9th instt. has just come to hand: that of the 14th ulto. was recd. on the 17th instant & has been answer'd which hope you have recd. before now; that has anticipated the Substance of your last Letter and contains all the Intelligence of Consequence I have in my power to communicate. Our foreign Intelligence gives us Reason to expect a Treaty of Neutrality and Commerce with Holland will soon take place and continues to assure us of the favorable Regards of most of the great European Powers. But it is a principle with me never to Trust to the Justice much less to the Generosity of any Nation any further than their Interest is connected therewith.  In regard to our Currency every one Admits, that it is a Subject of the highest Importance, and though three Days in each Week are set apart for the Consideration of our Finances, yet our Slow Way of Doing Business, added to the ferago of small Matters constantly crauding upon our hands gives me no great Assurance that this Matter will be soon Accomplishd. However Congress have it much at heart and I make no Doubt that something effectual will be done as soon as possible. In regard to your ingenious proposal, the Subject is delicate as you observe. But there are other Difficulties than those you mention for we have not a sufficient Quantity of hard Money on hand for the purpose and no way to obtain it but by Establishing a fund in some foreign Nation and this will be very difficult if not impracticable at present-or at least so soon as to produce an immediate Effect. Perhaps Holland is the most probable place for that purpose and whether the Treaty will be such as to produce that Effect is yet uncertain: if not it must perhaps be done through the Intervention of France But suppose we had a fund already establishd., would it not be much better for us to draw Bills of Exchange and sell them for our continental Bills than to bring the hard Money here and sell it for that purpose. It would at least save the Insurance which is very high besides it would not seem to Carry this Appearance of so direct a Discount: and perhaps a Fund might more easily be establishd. abroad in Case the Money was to be laid out there where they could answer many if not most of our Orders in the Way of their Trade than it could be done if the Money was to be brought directly to America; But Sir you will consider these hints meerly as my own private Thoughts upon the Subject. The Matter has not been mentiond. in Congress nor have I heard it discussd in private Conversation. I have had thoughts of suggesting some such Ideas: when that Matter comes upon the Carpet: But as I am neither Merchant, Politician nor Financier, I have no very raised Expectations from any plans of my own, whenever I venture to sug- AUGUST 31, 1778  gest anything in this great Councel I do it with Diffidence But I find you have lead me further into the Matter of Finances than I intended: however I can chearfully submit my thoughts to your Candour & that of your Freinds: And Am with sincerest Esteam & Regard, Your very Obedt. humbl.

I have hitherto been remarkably favored with health, hope it will Continue. As to news I have none at present that will be new to you. The misfortune that hap- AUGUST 31, 1778  pened to the french fleet by the Storm, will I fear Defeat our Designs on Rhode Island, if nothing worse happen from it, we must Expect bad fortune Sometimes as well as good, but hope it will all turn Right in the end.

  Sir Philadelphia Augst. 31st. 1778 We were this day honored with your favor of the 25th Inst.(1) Mr. Sherman is at present with the Army on a Committee to arrange the affairs in the Battalions and reduce them to the form prescribed in a plan lately adopted by Congress, which I presume your Excellency has had laid before you.  Mr. Adams and myself joined in a letter to your Excellency which went by Maj. Bigelow on Saturday last, since which nothing hath happened to make a public letter necessary.  I lament with you Sir the sickness and death of your Son-and the distress and melancholy it hath occasioned to you; your family and his near connections and friends, and am pleased to find Col. Dyer hath undertaken his accounts and business: when he arrives as Mr Ellsworth is to relieve Mr Adams, it will naturally fall to me to give place to him; I shall do it with pleasure, as I have informed him by this post (2)  I wish I could with truth, assure Your Excellency that in my view, our affairs are in a happy train, and that Congress has adopted wise and effectual measures to restore our wounded public credit, and to establish the United States, their liberty, union, and happiness upon a solid and permanent foundation. I dare not do it, while my heart is overwhelmed with the most melancholy presages: the idleness and captiousness of some gentlemen, maugre the wishes and endeavours  AUGUST 31, 1778  of an honest and industrious majority in my apprehension threaten the worst consequences. The Southern States are fixed against holding Congress more than once a day, our hours are fixed from nine in the forenoon to two in the afternoon. If these were punctually attended it would be perhaps as much as could be spared from Committees, other business which must be done out of Congress hours-nine States make a Congress-some States have Delegates so very negligent, so much immersed in the pursuit of pleasure or business, that it is very rare we can make a Congress before near 11 o'clock and this evil seems incapable of a remedy as Congress hath no means to compel gentlemens attendance; and those who occasion the delay are callous to admonition and reproof which have often been tried in vain. When we are assembled several gentlemen have such a knack at starting questions of order-raising debates upon critical, captious, and trifling amendments, protracting them by long speeches, by postponing, calling for the previous question, and other arts, that it is almost impossible to get an important question decided at one sitting, and if it is put over to another day, the field is open to be gone over again-precious time is lost, and the public business left undone. I am sorry to add that the opposition between the States and the old prejudices of North against South; and South against North seem to be reviving; and are industriously heightened by some who I fear would be but too well pleased to see our union blasted and our independence broken and destroyed. I wish what I have wrote may not seem too much like complaining of Congress; but besides that, I am sure it is a just picture of our present situation, when I look back & see how little has been done since I came here, and consider how much there was to do and the vast importance that it should be done without loss of time, I feel myself under an obligation to account for my own conduct among others, and can think of no better way to do it than by telling the truth; which I do the more freely, because I can appeal to every gentleman in Congress whether any blame lies upon Connecticut; whether she hath ever been an hour unrepresented, or whether any time hath been lost by the remissness, or captiousness, or long-windedness of her Delegates; besides that while hopes of a speedy reform prevailed I thought prudent to be silent; now those hopes have vanished, I thought it best and my duty to state our real, though unhappy situation to Your Excellency, that we might have the benefit of your wisdom and advice in concerting proper measures to retrieve us from the unhappy lethargy (shall I call it phrenzy) into which we have fallen.  Major Adams hath seen what I have wrote above as far as it respects Congress, and their mode of doing business, and permits me to fortify my narration with his concurrent testimony. I have not taken the liberty to hint anything of the above to any friends, except  to Col Dyer, in a letter of this date, as I hope yet some measures may be fallen upon to remedy the evil, and it may not be so proper to throw out any thing that may become public to lessen Congress in the general estimation, at a time when the British Commissioners are preparing to appeal from them to the people at large and would be pleased to lay hold of any thing which might affect their character in the minds of their constitutents in hopes to derive an advantage from it. I have only to add my wishes and prayers for the preservation of Your Excellency's important life, and the continuance of your usefulness, and to subscribe my self with the greatest respect, Sir, Your most obedient and most hble Servant,  Titus Hosmer ""

  My dear Friend Philada Sept 1. 1778 After having been disappointed several Weeks I am at length favord with your very acceptable Letter of the 18th of August by Yesterdays Post.(1) You formerly hinted to me your Apprehension that I might think jour Letters came to me too frequently. I could not suppose you then in earnest; but your Silence, from the 17 of July to the 18th of August, which you own to be many Days, is a very serious Comment, and obliges me in a formal Manner to assure you that you cannot gratify me more than by writing to me often.  My Enemies in Boston are exceedingly mistaken if they think I have condescended to become a Party Man in their unimportant SEPTEMBER 1, 1778  Disputes about Manly & McNeil; neither of whom, in my opinion, derived much Honor from the Decisions of the late Courts Martial. I wonder that Manly should attribute his Disappointment to me. At my Request he called to see me. I found him to be one of those Men who stand in Need of Advice, and gave him the best I could. I told him what Questions I thought would be put to him, that he might be prepared to answer them. In short I said every thing to him as a Friend which was proper for me to say. Perhaps I was too candid to be thought a Friend. I intended to have been present at the Committee(2) but was unavoidably hindered. He left the City without calling on me a second time. McNeil is still here-He has called on me twice or thrice. I know not in what Part of the City he lives. His Friends and his Enemies may be assured that I shall give my Voice upon the Subject Matter of his Petition according to my best Skill & Judgment. In this I am sure to be justified by those to whose good opinion alone I pay the least Regard, the candid & impartial.  I heartily despise the small Dealers in Politicks who are propagating idle Stories to injure me. Little Insects will be for ever playing round the glimmering Light of a farthing Candle. It is out of the power of those Men to disturb the Peace of my Mind. You took too much Pains, my dear Friend, to stop their Clamor, when you read a Paragraph of my Letter, which was designd for your Perusal & not theirs.(3) I am however much obligd to you for your kind Intention.  Your Letter informs me Mr_____ (4) is gone on the Expedition to Rhode Island. This is also announcd in the Boston News Papers; which, to do them Justice I must observe, never fail to notice the important Movements of a great Man.

The wishes expressed in the latter (1) have made all the Impressions of the most pleasing Commands, and shall be strictly attended to upon the first possible Occasion of fulfilling them; which must, I think, be soon, tho the Embargo is not yet taken off.  As to the former, I will not now make it the Baisis of a Declamation against Flattery. I will only tell the sudden Effect which it produced, upon the quick glancing of my Eye over it. Did it add to my former great Respect for the Writer of it? No, Portia, not at the first Reading; but it forced from me, almost audibly, in a grave Assembly where I broke the Seal, \""gin ye were mine ain Thing how dearly I would love thee\""! Excuse me, Ramsay,(2) if I now misspell you; I am sure my Feelings did Justice to your Sentiment! A second Reading restored me to Decorum, and I recognized my Age, tho I did not find any sudden Aids from Philosophy; nor do I now think that one sirlgle Plunge into the Waters of Lethe would quite prevent all after Recollection of the pleasing Impulse which I felt on this Occasion.  I will not, at this Moment, suffer my Ideas to deviate so widely from the Track they have been in as to go into the Trenches and covered Ways at Newport.

Your Excellency is not to be informed that the Cannon of the State of New York as well those in the City as those which were at the Posts of Ticonderoga and Crown Point were frankly and generously submitted to the Use of the United States. A Day of Reckoning must arrive and I hope the State will be prepared with an accurate Account (among other things) of the military Stores which they have furnished to the Continent. I know well there will be great Difficulty in collecting the necessary Documents on this Occasion and, therefore, it is the more worthy of the early Attention of your Excellency and of the Legislature. You will excuse, Sir, my mentioning to you a matter perhaps not strictly within my Line upon a Principle which I beg you to believe, that I cannot on any Occasion omit attending to matters  SEPTEMBER 1, 1778  which respect the Interests of those I have the Honor to represent.

  Sir White Plains Sepr.1,1778 I dont think I shall be able to return to Philadelphia So Soon as the 10th of this month, the Business of arranging will take longer time than I expected. If you Set out for home at that time please to write to me by the Post, perhaps I Shall not take a waiter with me if you determine to come away before I arrive there.(1) The General received a Letter to day from Genl. Sullivan giving an Account of An Action on Rhode Island in which our forces repulsed the enemy & kept the Field-with some Considerable loss on both side but was not then Able to Ascertain the numbers.(2) Count D.Estaign with his Fleet are gone to Boston to refit with intent to return as soon as possible. I hear that Some of our people have incautiously censured the Conduct of the Commander of the French Fleet which have given Some disgust. I think every thing of that kind ought to be carefully avoided. I have no doubt of the good disposition of Count D.Estaing to do every thing in his power to render the Expedition Successful & to promote the Common Cause.

  Sir, Philadelphia 2d Sep'r 1778 The rapid Depreciation of the Continental money as it greatly occupies the attention of Congress, so it calls aloud for the united Efforts and wisdom of every State of every Individual. Taxation is the only Remedy and it is by no means a meer metaphor to say that Expedients, however they may for a Time palliate, only encrease the Evil considered with a View to the radical Cure. Need I to you, Sir, or to those who I have the Honor to represent and whose political Character for wisdom & Firmness I am most happy to say stands high, Need I observe, that if by Funding our Paper the immense circulating medium could be so reduced that the Bills were brought on a Par with Specie, the Debt tho nominally the same, would in Fact be much greater because the Produce of the Country being low, it would require so much more of it to pay the same Sum. Early in this Controversy, the War carried on in Canada, brought a very great Sum of money into our State. At that time I wished to adopt Taxation which would even at that Hour have been productive in a great Degree. It was not adopted. Money it is said and justly is like water always seeking a Level; heap it up and it will run from you; take it out and it will run to you. The amazing Price of the Produce of our State at Present demands serious attention. If the Farmer is taxed a Bushel of Wheat now, he is taxed (as I am told) four Dollars; by and bye if taxed a Bushel of Wheat he will be taxed only one Dollar. I will not draw any Consequence but add that if a considerable Sum is taken now it will releive the State greatly hereafter.  I am most respectfully Your Excellency's most obedient & humble Servant, Gouv. Morris.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 3:724-25. SEPTEMBER 2, 1778

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, Septr 3, 1778. A few days ago I receivd a letter from your son in law Mr Temple dated New York, August 23d, requesting me by the first opportunity to inform you of his & Mrs Temple's arrival there, & that, for particular reasons he should be exceedingly happy if your affairs would permit you to meet them at Philadelphia, or as near it as might be convenient to you. He requested this of me, because excepting that letter & another to Mr President Laurens, (1) he had not written a line since his arrival at N. Y., & he had still weighty reasons for declining it. He also desired me to cause it to be made as convenient as might be (at his expence) for Mrs Temple & her little boy, who had not been well since their arrival, to get to Philadelphia. His baggage which is both heavy & bulkey, he intended to get transported in a Flag, if any should be suffered to pass, to Boston, or some port as near it as might be, & hoped to see me soon in this city. His letter to the President was read in Congress. It was short and contained little more than to sollicit leave to come to Philada to pay his respects to Congress. This was refus'd upon the idea that he might be a secret emissary from the British Court. I think it is best for him that his request is not granted; for the jealousy of the people at large would, I believe, render his residence here very uncomfortable. A certain Doctor Burkenhout, who came from London in the same packett with Mr T____ , is now in prison in this city, committed by the authority of this State, under the same suspicion. (2) I took occasion to inform Congress from my own knowledge of Mr Temple, that although he had been formerly an officer of the Crown of Great Britain, and in the Customs, yet he had constantly given great offence to his brother Commissioners & other friends of that government, particularly Bernard & Hutchinson, by his attachment to those who espoused the liberties of America; that he went to England seven years ago, where, I understood, he had since lived the greater part of the time, entirely out of favor at Court & in private life; and that I had reason to think his connexions in Boston had long expected his return to spend his days there. Congress afterwards orderd the Secretary to inform Mr Temple, that if it was his intention to reside in any one of the United States, the same should be signified by him to the State in which he intends to reside, & the approbation of that State obtaind before a passport could be granted to him. Thus the matter stands in all its particulars, a view of which I thought it proper you should be acquainted with. I wish Mr Temple had turned his attention first to Boston. It is probable he will now do it, and that you will soon receive a letter from him.  I am with the greatest sincerity, Your affectionate friend, and  humble servant, S. Adams. SEPTEMBER 3, 1778  MS not found; reprinted from Bowdoin-Temple Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society Collections, 6th ser. 9:423-25.  1 John Temple's August 23 letter to President Laurens is in PCC, item 78 22:589.  2 John Temple (1731-98), a native of Boston and former surveyor general of the North American customs in Massachusetts, had returned to America with the avowed intention of resettling in his native state. Despite newspaper accounts that he and Dr. John Berkenhout were coming to America to aid the Carlisle commissioners, Temple said that his American sympathies were the cause of his precarious situation. He claimed he had been dismissed from his British customs position in 1774 as a result of his aid to Benjamin Franklin in obtaining the notorious Hutchinson-Oliver-Whately correspondence in 1772, and that subsequently the British government had prevented him from returning to America with Franklin.  In reality Temple was returning as a secret emissary to seek support for the Carlisle Commission among his old friends and relatives in New England, and Samuel Adams was one of his prime objectives. An April 1778 memorandum in the British Secret Service papers of William Eden indicates that Temple received £2000 and a baronetcy, with the promise of a £2000 yearly pension if the Carlisle Commissioners \""now going out to America shall approve his conduct in that country.\""  Although Congress did not know the particulars of this mission, they were immediately suspicious of both Temple and Berkenhout, the latter of whom was jailed soon after his arrival in Philadelphia. On September 1 Congress refused Temple's request to travel to Philadelphia and, apparently at the urging of Adams, directed him to send his residency application to the state in which he wished to reside. See JCC, 11:858-60; Richard Henry Lee to William Maxwell August 29; and Henry Laurens to William Maxwell, September 5, 1778.  After this rebuff, Temple went to Boston, where he attempted to keep his credibility intact by offering to serve American interests in England. Trading on his past services and family connections, he even obtained formal recommendations from the Massachusetts Council and several revolutionary leaders such as Meshech Weare, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., James Warren, and William Livingston. Thus armed, he set off for Philadelphia, where he arrived on December I and immediately approached both Adams and Henry Laurens, renewing speculation that he had indeed come to America to arrange secret negotiations.

Among those who suspected from the outset that Temple was in fact a secret British agent was the French minister, Gerard, who explained his views in a September I report to the French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes. \""I have made it clear,\"" Gerard stated, \""that he can be only a secret emissary substituted for the underhand dealings of Mr. Johnstone, or a sort of hanger-on that they propose to attach to me, a spy to dog my foot-steps. I have demonstrated that if he was charged with some particular commission, even a secret one, the rule to be followed in war-time would require that he make his overtures on that head before setting foot on the territory of the United States. I am so impressed, Monseigneur, with the importance and the delicacy of anything which tends to establish the slightest thread of communication and of correspondence with Great Britain that I have no fear lest these details seem unimportant to you. I shall be easy in my mind only when Congress shall have resolved no longer to receive any agents from that Power, at least until they shall be provided with letters of   credence in diplomatic form.\"" Gerard, Despatches (Baisnee and Meng), 58:151; and Meng, Gerard Despatches, pp. 248-52.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, Sept. 3, 1778 Your very acceptable letter of the 21st of March, I received about the middle of June, and would have answered it long ago, if there had been any encouraging prospect of conveying it safely. As to writing you a short letter that must have gone open through the enemy's SEPTEMBER 3, 1778  posts, I did not think it worth while. I have, however, now come to a resolution of writing you pretty fully, and trying to convey it by France or Holland; and if it should fall into their hands, and never get to your's, there will be no other loss than my time in writing; for as to any other consequences, either to the public or to myself, I have not the least apprehension.  Your letter came to me sealed, and apparently never opened, in a packet from the British commissioners, which arrived at York-town while the Congress was sitting; and consequently it, as well as one from Mr F , was delivered to me in presence of the whole members. As the same packet, besides the public message, contained some private letters addressed to particular members, some of them from Governor Johnstone, one of the commissioners, a proposal was made by a member, who read publicly one received by himself, that every gentleman who had received private letters from any person with the enemy, should deliver them to Congress, that they might be read.(1) This would have been attended with no difficulty as to me; except some family affairs in Mr. F 's letter very improper to be publicly read, and some expressions in his letter a little offensive speaking of Congress. However, it was not done at that time; and afterwards, in a diet at many days distance, every member who had received any such letters, was called upon to read from them what related to public affairs, which was done.(2)  I am and have been greatly concerned, as you seem to be, for the contest between Great Britain and America; and certainly, from my own interest, have by far the greatest reason of the two; and as I suppose, it will be agreeable to you, shall make a few observations. 1. Upon the public cause; and, 2. On my own conduct, which I understand from many different quarters, to be highly blamed in my native country.  As to the public cause, I look upon the separation of America from Britain to be the visible intention of Providence; and believe, that in the issue it will be to the benefit of this country, without any injury to the other-perhaps to the advantage of both. It seems to me the intention of Providence for many reasons, which I cannot now enumerate, but in a particular manner for the following-that I cannot recollect any instance in history, in which a person or people have so totally and uniformly mistaken the means for attaining their own ends, as the king and parliament of Britain have in this contest. I do seriously and positively affirm to you, my dear Sir, that it is my opinion, that Congress itself, if they had been to direct the measures of the British ministry, could not, or would not, have directed them to measures so effectual to forward and establish the independence of America, as those which they chose of their own accord. They have had a mistaken opinion of the state of things in America, from the beginning to this hour, and have founded their whole conduct   upon their mistakes. They supposed sometimes, that the people of America, in general, were seditious and factious-desirous of a separation from Great Britain, and that their conduct on occasion of the stamp-act was the effect of this disposition. Nothing could be more untrue. I am a witness that the people of this country had an esteem of, and attachment to the people of Great Britain, exceedingly strong. They were proud of them, and of their own descent from them. British fashions, British goods, and even British persons, were in the highest esteem. A person educated in the old counties had a degree of rank and credit from that circumstance, independent of every other. I think they were even partial in this respect. I believe, had I myself been born and educated in America, I should have met with a degree of acceptance and success in my station, far inferior to what actually happened. When an American spoke of going to England, he always called it going home; and wherever you are in this country, you meet with almost nothing but counties, townships, and houses, called by English names. I live at Princeton in Middlesex county; and on the opposite side of the street is Somerset county, and indeed, I believe all the counties in New Jersey, are called by English names.  From this I desire that you may infer, that the opposition made to the claims of parliament, arose from a deep and universal conviction in the people, that they were inconsistent with their own security and peace. In this I am satisfied that they judged right; for had the claim set up been acquiesced in, the provincial assemblies would have become contemptible and useless, and the whole colonies no better than a parcel of tributary states, which, placed at so great a distance, would have been, from error, ignorance, and self-interest, loaded in the most insupportable manner.  Another mistake, into which the ministry and parliament of England fell, was, that this was a deep-laid scheme of a few artful and designing men, who stirred up the multitude for their own ends; that the sentiments in favour of America, were by no means general; but that the artful leaders imposed upon them. This I have seen asserted from the beginning to the end of the quarrel; and to complete the absurdity, the very commissioners now here from Britain, continue to reason in the same manner-impeach the Congress with ambitious and designing views, and seem disposed to appeal to the people. Alas! they know nothing of the matter. The Congress is a changeable body: members are going from it, and coming to it every month, nay, every week....(3)  MS not found; reprinted from John Witherspoon, The Works of John Witherspoon . . ., 9 vols.

 Carlisle Commissioners September 4, 1778 To the Earl of CARLISLE, Sir HENRY CLINTON, Knight of the Bath, and WILLIAM EDEN, Esquire.(1)  Your Excellencies must be sensible, that it does not comport with the measures of Congress to make any observations upon your declaration of the 26th of August.(2) But as it was evidently calculated for the people, I make no doubt you will be glad to know what effect it is likely to produce; and that your Excellencies may form some opinion, I take the liberty to shew you, in what light it is considered by an individual: Valeat quantum valere potest.(3) I do not flatter myself that my observations upon your applications to Congress are very agreeable to you: However, I am in no degree discouraged from writing a third letter to your Excellencies.  It seems the declaration of Congress on the 11th of August,(4) drew forth yours of the 26th. The storm of military war has lost its violence; on your part it has spent itself; you now assail us with words.  You are pleased \""solemnly to declare,\"" that you had not any knowledge, either directly or indirectly, of the letters and conversation alluded to in the declaration of Congress, until you saw them made public in the newspapers. This declaration related to your colleague, George Johnstone, Esq; nor did it charge your Excellencies with a privity to, or participation in his very exceptionable conduct. Unaccused, you have thought proper to endeavour to exculpate yourselves; a circumstance which strongly brings to my recollection a rule which Charles the First recommended to his favourite Stafford, as one that may serve for a statesman, courtier or lover-\""never to make a defence or apology before you are accused.\"" Without doubt, your Excellencies will not be at a loss to comprehend the meaning of the Royal hint.  That you would publicly have assented to the construction SEPTEMBER 4, 1778  Congress gave to Governor Johnstone's conduct, or that you would intimate a belief that any person was authorized to hold the conversation stated to have been held with Mr. Read, \""to engage his interest to promote the object of your commission,\"" was not expected. Neither was it imagined, that there was any obligation upon you to vindicate Mr. Johnstone's \""abilities and integrity.\"" The first we never doubted, till we saw his declaration of the 26th of August; the last he himself has not even attempted to vindicate; and I mark this as an instance of his prudence: It is laudable to point out merit wherever it is distinguished. On the other hand, it is also proper to observe the public shades of a public character: The Governor appears to have lost that calmness and circumspection necessary in the profession of a statesman. The declaration of Congress has precipitated him into abuse, mistake and contradiction. He censures Congress for bowing to a French Ambassador! Did his Britannic Majesty never bow to a French Ambassador? The Governor thinks \""many individuals\"" of Congress \""now entertain different sentiments\"" from those in the declaration of Congress: He is certainly mistaken, for I have heard every individual Member declare, he considered him as no longer an enemy to corruption. As to his contradiction of himself, I need only contrast these two ideas in his declaration- \""The said George Johnstone for himself says, that he is far from considering the said resolution of Congress as offensive to him, that he rather receives it as a mark of distinction:\"" However, \""he reserves to himself the liberty of publishing, if he shall judge proper, a justification of his conduct against the aspersions thrown on his character.\"" This unoffend ed, yet aspersed gentleman, who considers a resolution which asperses his character, \""as a mark of distinction,\"" draughted his declaration ad populum, and with them I will leave it, that I may proceed to shew a proper respect to your Excellencies performance.  Why do you tell the world, you \""were authorized to restore peace, to preserve the value and promote the credit of the paper circulation, to give satisfaction and security for ever on the subject of military establishments, and to extend every freedom to trade?\"" Your Excellencies sent to the Congress copies of the instruments by which you were, and by which only you are authorized. They were published, and the world have not yet forgot, that they only allow you to treat, not to determine upon any of those particulars. Nay, you are expressly prohibited, and it is declared your proceedings on those points shall not be of any validity unless ratified by the British Parliament. Need I hint, that every word you deliver is accurately weighed, and critically examined; and that consequential ideas naturally follow?  And do you really think you have \""offered everything that is, or can be proposed by the French alliance?\"" I am apt to suspect that  SEPTEMBER 4,1778  your Excellencies are inclined to pleasantry. Pardon me if I introduce a serious idea: I will be short; nay, I will use but a single word. INDEPENDENCE! This is proposed by the alliance with France: This is not to be found in your offers.  As you are astonished at one circumstance, I may be permitted to express a little surprize at another, it is at your assertion that France \""has ever shewn itself an ememy to all civil and religious liberty.\"" I cannot suppose you are unread in the histories of France, of Germany, and of the Low Countries, especially for the eighty years preceding the peace of Wistfully; and it is painful even to remark, that there is an alternative. The civil and religious liberties of Germany and of the Seven United Provinces found in the power of France a friend and a guarantee; and the same power is now a friend and a guarantee to the civil and religious liberty of America. On the other hand, the power of England has been, and now is an enemy to civil and religious liberty. Witness your penal laws against Roman Catholics, and the rejected petitions of Dissenters. Witness the reigns of Charles the Second and his successor. Witness the present reign in Britain; the stamp act, the Quebec bill, the cotemporary and subsequent outrages of laws and arms, respecting America. Your Excellencies ought to have looked at home, before you ventured to cast your eyes and censures abroad.  It is a favourite point with you, and you constantly press to have it established, that the offers of France \""were made only in consequence of the plan of accommodation previously concerted in Great Britain.\"" And to prove this, you aver, first, \""that public intimation of the conciliatory propositions on the part of Great Britain was given to the British Parliament, and consequently to the whole world, in the month of November last.\"" Secondly, \""that the preliminaries of a French treaty, did not bear earlier date than the 16th of December.\"" We will examine the subject. The terms in which the first point is couched, give an idea, that the intimation was pointed and public, descriptive of the propositions, and that they were important in their nature. I wish your Excellencies had condescended to give us the terms in which the intimation was expressed, and the authority expressing them: Because from these lights, we might have seen, whether the propositions were, or if you please, the intimation was, of sufficient weight to affect, change and give a ton to the measures of the court of France. The evidence was in your hands, you have not thought proper to lay it before us, and no doubt you have reasons for the suppression. However, as my object is truth, I will endeavour to supply the evidence that you have withheld.  The late sessions of the British Parliament began on the 20th day of November last. On the 21st, your House of Lords presented their address to your sovereign in answer to his speech. In that they say, \""we cannot but applaud your Majesty's unwearied vigilance and wis-  dom in recommending to us, to prepare at all events, for such further operations as the contingences of the war, and the obstinacy of the rebels may render expedient.\"" \""We thankfully receive your Majesty's declaration of perserverance in the measures now pursuing, for the re-establishment of a just and constitutional subordination through the several parts of your Majesty's dominions.\"" On the 22d of November your House of Commons also presented their address in answer to the speech; nor does this address contain any thing repugnant to the other; nor can it be denied, that these addresses are always mere echoes to the speech, and that the three )Sow from the Ministers. Thus, at one view, we have the public and joint sense of the Ministers, King, Lords and Commons of Great Britain. It is sufficient here to observe, that sense was a \""perseverance\"" in military coercion-not a change to \""conciliatory propositions. \""  This \""public intimation\"" \""given to the British Parliament, and consequently to the whole world in November last,\"" of the public measures to be pursued, perhaps may not be that public intimation, to which your Excellencies allude? Well, I am not tired in my research after truth, I will make another attempt. I hope your Excellencies will patiently attend, while I endeavour to discover the intimation you mean; and whether it was in its nature such, as ipso facto made a mere nullity of the declaration from the throne, couched by the Ministers, and approved by the Houses of Parliament.  On the 17th of February last, Lord North made a decisive speech in the House of Commons. This states what he said in November relative to terms that might be offered to America; and it is probable this may be the public intimation to which your Excellencies allude. This speech strikes my attention, because it not only states what Lord North said on the 20th of November, but it demonstrates his conduct and the reasons for it, from that time to the 17th of February.  It was on this memorable day that Lord North declared himself in the following manner. \""At the opening of the present sessions, on the first day during the debate upon the address to his Majesty, I told the House, that in my opinion terms might be made with the Colonies short of unconditional submission, and that the time of making them was the moment of victory.\"" Here Lord North himself gives evidence of what he had said, and it must be deemed absolutely sufficient. Thus it undeniably appears, that on the 20th day of November Lord North, speaking upon another subject, en passant, threw out a mere speculative \""proposition,\"" the truth of which was self evident: Terms might be made in the moment of victory. His Lordship did not intimate, that he would offer terms, nay, that he intended to do so. And is this mere speculative proposition \""the con  ciliatory propositions on the part of Great Britain,\"" to which you so anxiously point! Already it appears lighter than a straw; you catch at it, but it is not capable of supporting you. Place this in one scale-the public persevering declaration of the Ministers and the King on the same day, approved by the Houses of Parliament on the two following days, in the other scale-suspend the balance-Of what weight is your public intimation?-vox et praeteria nihil.(5) Was it possible such a public intimation affected the counsels of France, and changed their very nature! It is too extravagant to be supposed. But let us attend to the speech.  \""The time of making them was the moment of victory. I said this, thinking that the victory gained by Sir William Howe, was more decisive than it really was; and ignorant of the disaster which had fallen on General Burgoyne's army.\""  It appears then, terms might be offered in the moment of victory, and that on the 20th day of November Lord North thought the moment then existed. The question is, what use did he make of that moment? Did he intimate that he would offer generous terms of conciliation? No! Even terms short of unconditional submission? No! He only threw out a mere speculative idea, the truth of which no man could deny: But in this fancied moment of victory, under his auspices, the speech from the throne made a \""declaration,\"" and the houses of Parliament applauded the \""declaration of perseverance in the measures then pursuing,\"" to coerce America to an unconditional submission: And large supplies in men and money were immediately voted. It is true his Lordship very ingeniously intimated, en passant, when on another subject, in what manner the moment of victory might be used, but at the same time he took care, that the Ministry should demonstrate, and the whole legislature should declare, in what manner they were resolved to use it-to redouble the blows upon the party supposed to be then staggering under a late victory.  Lord North continued, \""When the news of that melancholy event arrived, I was struck that the time of proposing terms was past; and that the first point to be done was the raising of new levies and a new force.\"" The point with me at present is, to acertain a moment in which his Lordship thought \""the time of proposing terms was past.\""  It is notorious, that on the fourth of December Lord George Germaine was obliged, for the first time, to inform the House of Commons, (who were stunned at it) that he had received private accounts of that event, which I may call a glorious one: And I will therefore lay it down, that on that day Lord North was of opinion, \""the time of proposing terms was past.\"" Thus we find, that from the first day of the sessions in November to the fourth of December, a perseverance in coercive measures, new levies, and a new force, were the declared objects of the British Government. Do not your Excel-  lencies think it reasonable to conclude, that his Lordship continued in the same sentiments and measures for ten or twelve days? The contrary is not to be supposed. This allowance, then, brings us to the 16th of December, the day when the offers of France were formally made to the American Commissioners in Paris: A point of time when every public intimation that could be given of a perseverance in measures of coercion on the part of Great-Britain, actually and clearly existed.  You are pleased to say \""the propositions to be made were occasionally a subject of discussion in Parliament during the whole interval between the 20th of January and the 17th of February- during which interval, and not before, France being informed of the liberal and extensive nature of the intended offers, thought it expedient to new model and enlarge her proposals.\""  From hence these conclusions result: That on the 20th of January the propositions were yet \""to be made:\"" That previous to that day they were not made, nor discussed, nor the liberal and extensive nature of them known to France. Yet we have found that the offers of France were made on the 16th of December preceedingl But, say you, \""the concessions then made by France on the one hand were so unsatisfactory, and the conditions required by America on the other so exceptionable, that the Commissioners of Congress did not think proper to proceed, until they should be specially authorised.\"" We will candidly consider every thing you offer.  About the end of the year 1776 Congress made out the terms of the treaties they were desirous of forming with France; and also instructions to their Commissioners, materially to relax, if necessary, in many important points from those terms: And the Commissioners received these terms and instructions long before they had occasion to make use of them.  On the 16th of December last, when your conciliatory proposition, according to your own shewing, were neither made nor discussed, and consequently their \""liberal and extensive nature\"" not known to France, Monsieur Girard, by order of his Most Christian Majesty thus declared himself to our Commissioners. \""That his Most Christian Majesty was determined to acknowledge our independence, and make a treaty with us of amity and commerce. That in this treaty no advantage would be taken of our present situation, to obtain terms from us which otherwise would not be convenient for us to agree to his Majesty desiring that the treaty once made would be durable and our amity subsist forever, which could not be expected if each nation did not end its interest in the continuance as well as in the commencement of it.  Having thus from the records stated the authorities of the Commissioners on the one hand, and \""the concessions\"" as you are pleased to term them, \""then made by France\"" on the other; allow   me to ask whether these terms by France on the 16th of December last, could possibly be deemed \""unsatisfactory\""? And whether it is possible to suppose that the Commissioners, having early in the year 1777 received instructions, by which they were \""specially authorized,\"" in case of necessity, to agree to unequal terms, \""did not think proper to proceed\"" to agree to the terms of France on the 16th of December following, which were perfectly equal? The facts are, they had no occasion to wait for any special authority-they did not wait-the treaties were absolutely made upon the satisfactory principles declared on the 16th of December. What then becomes of your assertion, that in the interval between the 20th of January and the 17th of February, eleven days after the treaties were actually signed, \""France being informed of the liberal and extensive nature of the intended offers, thought it expedient to new model and enlarge her proposals.\""  I cannot avoid presenting to your attention another point of evidence against your favorite position, \""that public intimation of the conciliatory propositions on the part of Great Britain was given to the British Parliament, and consequently to the whole world, in the month of November last.\"" And the point is this-On the 5th of February last Governor Johnstone, in the House of Commons, wrote a letter to a gentleman in Pennsylvania,(6) and I have seen the original, in which is this paragraph. \""I have had a hint, and have good reason to believe a proposition will be made to Parliament in four or five days by Administration that may be a ground of re-union: I really do not know the particulars; nevertheless, as I learn some preliminaries have lately gone from France, I think it cannot be deemed unfriendly to either country to give you notice of this intended proposition, that you may in prudence do nothing hastily with a foreign power.\""  Hence your Excellencies must admit, that your public intimation of the conciliatory propositions on the part of Great Britain, given to the British Parliament and consequently to the whole world, in November, was not so public an intimation as to strike the attention even of Governor Johnstone a member of that Parliament, and then present. And that it was not till the 5th of February, the day before the signing the treaty of Paris, that he had even a hint and good reason to believe, that a conciliatory proposition was to be made to America-a period when he even had not any knowledge of the particulars of it. The time of his receiving the hint is to be absolutely presumed from the place in which the letter was wrote and the date it bore: and I will just add, it is violently to be presumed, the proposition to be made, was to answer the same end for which the letter was expressly wrote-\""that we might in prudence do nothing hastily with a foreign power.\""  Incontrovertible as these dates, facts and arguments stand, I will  not press their combined force upon your Excellencies: Your sensibility is too great, and your feelings are too much awake, not to be sufficiently affected without my doing so. I am not an ungenerous adversary, and to demonstrate this, I will for a moment admit your assertion, \""that public intimation of the conciliatory propositions on the part of Great Britain, was given to the British Parliament in the month of November last.\"" And the nature of them now becomes a matter of important enquiry.  Lord North has told us the propositions were only \""short of unconditional submission:\"" The terms you offer are only short of independence; and your Excellencies are sensible there is a vast difference between the two points: Will you excuse me if I ask the cause of it? You hesitate; I will therefore endeavour to resolve the question.  The British Administration, at the adjournment of the Parliament for the Christmas holidays, were moving heaven and earth for \""the raising of new levies and a new force\"" \""struck that the time of proposing terms was past.\"" The Parliament met against on the 20th of January; the Administration was then \""struck that the time of proposing terms was\"" returned; for France had offered her terms on the 16th of December preceeding. Conciliatory propositions were now occasionally, for the first time, discussed in Parliament, though not even then made. Well, the treaty of Paris was signed on the 6th of February; the time for proposing the British terms now pressed: on the 17th of the same month, Lord North \""formally stated\"" them; and as soon as possible afterwards, you on the part of Great Britain offered terms only short of independence, and immediately after, on the 11 of July, you offered \""to enlarge\"" those terms. In a word, the Courts of France and Great Britain were sat down to a game of chess. On the 10th of November the game was to be carried on by Great Britain on this principal-\""perseverance in coercive measures:\"" By France the principle was a decisive stroke. Britain declared her principle-France did not. Upon these principles France made the first move: She moved equal terms, on the 16th of December. Before Britain could have advice of this, she was engaged at the Christmas feast; but that being ended on the 20th of January, knowing the step France had made, she was \""struck\"" she must abandon her principle of perseverance, and she immediately moved, the discussion of conciliatory propositions. France upon her principle of a decisive stroke, on the 6th of February moved, the treaty of Paris. Britain soon heard of this, and on the 17th of the same month, she moved, the formal state of conciliatory propositions. The game of chess can be as easily played when the players are at a distance, as when they are present; the whole difference in the two cases, consists in the space of time necessary for playing the game. Already France seems to have reduced Britain to a state of consideration, whether she must   give up the game as too desparate to be recovered. From this plain figure, it is demonstrated, that the motions of France caused the vast difference between terms but short of unconditional submission, and terms only short of Independence.  Governor Johnstone in his declaration of the 26th of August, is pleased to reproach Congress for allying with France \""after all their just claims are gratified.\"" Your Excellencies ordered the transmission of this reproach: You are thereby parties in making it: And therefore, I am justified in taking some notice of it to you.  In consequence of the offers you have made, you say, all our just claims are gratified. You then admit, that when you began the war, we had just claims. You must admit, that notwithstanding our most humble petition in behalf of our just claims, you refused to grant those claims. You must also admit, that for three years you have by force of arms, and all the horrors of war, endeavoured to reduce us to unconditional submission, notwithstanding we had just claims. Upon those points then there is no mistake or doubt; nor can there be any upon these. The just claims of America ought to have been granted when they were stated, and you were desired to give redress. You denied us common justice, by refusing to grant redress upon those just claims. You enormously added to that injustice, by letting loose upon us all the calamities of war, to oblige us to abandon those our just claims. And we have now a just claim to receive satisfaction for all the damage which we, through your injustice, have received, in supporting our just claims. Your injustice has ruined thousands of our families. You have unjustly burned our towns and ravaged our country. Fathers, mothers, brothers, and friends, mourn the loss of their children, brothers and friends, by your injustice slain in the field of battle, scalped in their peaceable dwellings, murdered in your horrible prisons. America, by your injustice has lost thousands of her best citizens, and has been obliged to expend millions of her treasure. Nor is the loss her youth have sustained by your injustice, the loss of those important years for the improvement of their understandings, which they can never regain, the least loss she has sustained. Look at this short list of damages, and say, whether you have even offered to gratify America in all her just claims! Say, is it in the nature of things possible for you to gratify America in all her just claims! There was a time when you might easily have done so: You threw it away; you must be \""struck that the time of proposing terms is past,\"" never to return.  Your Excellencies wish to move our gratitude: You speak of your conciliatory propositions as \""the generous measures of Great-Britain:\"" Your Excellencies are rather unfortunate in the means you use to touch the passions. Louis the Sixteenth, the PROTECTOR of the rights of mankind, has some title to speak of the generous measures of France-generous, because just and noble. He magnanimously de-  clared, that in forming a treaty with us, he did \""not pretend that he acted wholly for our sakes, since besides his real good will to us and to our cause, it was manifestly the interest of France, that the power of England should be diminished by our separation from it.\"" But, can Britain say, her offers proceed from \""real good will to us and to our cause?\"" Can she say, she wished \""to promote and establish the liberties, peace, opulence, increase, security and permanent happiness of the inhabitants of this continent?\"" No! Her whole system of government since the year 1763, has operated-her laws have been enacted-her arms have been used for the very contrary purposes. Her Ministers and Parliaments have long oppressed in order to plunder us. When we were unarmed, she ungenerously drew her sword upon us. She treated our most humble petition for \""peace, liberty and safety,\"" with silent contempt. Her Minister, Lord North, declared he was fighting for substantial revenue-he would lay America prostrate and drag her to his feet. In the ideal \""moment of victory,\"" her Ministers and Legislature declared they would redouble their blows upon America supposed to be staggering under a late victory. Her veterans unjustly burned our towns, ravaged our country, and slaughtered our citizens. She let loose her Indian allies to massacre the unarmed, the aged, the sick, the infant, the matron, wife and virgin. Her Generals and Admirals in cold blood, in their prisons and prison ships, murdered our countrymen by suffocation, filth, hunger and nakedness; refusing to them the food and raiment provided for their necessities by public authority and private affection; with gold and food tempting these virtuous citizens, in the agonies of misery and despair, to dip their hands in the blood of their country! Behold \""the generous measures of Great-Britain!\"" Your Excellencies have unwarily touched a string, that already trembles throughout America-a subject that rouses the indignation, and calls forth the vengeance of the people! America has experienced too much to be surprized at any thing; she therefore cannot be surprized at your decorating your offers with the title, \""the generous measures of Great-Britain.\"" Generous measures proceed from magnanimity, not cruelty-from choice, not necessity. Already have I met your assertions with Lord North's speech; allow me once more to have recourse to it. His Lordship proceeded,  \""The resistance of America is greater, and the war has lasted longer than was at first apprehended. In the present situation of affairs, only three propositions can be made:  \"" 1. To strengthen our force, and continue the war upon the present plan.  \""2. To recal it from America. And  \""3. To offer terms of conciliation to her.  \""The first proposition is attended with too great an expence of men and money. The second is to subscribe to the Independence of   America. The third is that which appears to me to be the best and wisest.\""  Your Excellencies will be so good as to glance your eyes over the first and last propositions, and be sensible, that prior to the 17th of February last, conciliation was not the \""present plan.\"" And if you look upon his Lordship's reflections upon the three propositions, you must remain convinced, that he closed with the last proposition from necessity, not choice-he closed with it because he could no longer prosecute the first. Tell me now, in what consists the boasted generosity of the present measures of Great-Britain?  And have your Excellencies so unfavourable an opinion of the understandings of the Americans, as to think you can induce them, by your reasonings and negociations, to yield that Independence which they declared after the most mature refltection-which they have purchased with their hearts blood, and at every risk! Are you so much in the dark with respect to their inclinations and determination, as to have an idea, that if you proved to them, as clear as the meridian sun, that the offers of France were only the consequence of your conciliatory propositions, that therefore they would renounce their glorious independence! Is it possible you have forgot, that on the 22d of April last, when Congress were utterly ignorant that a treaty had been signed by their Commissioners, nay, that a treaty with France even had been, was then, or was expected to be in agitation, that on that very 22d of April Congress absolutely refused your conciliatory acts of Parliament! Are you now for the first time to be assured, that the people throughout the United States, with one voice, applauded and rejoiced in that \""decisive\"" refusal! It was not \""on the ground of the treaties\"" with France, that Congress took \""the decisive part,\"" of which you so much complain; nor was this decisive part taken as you suppose it was, \""without previously consulting the Assemblies of their different\"" States. The Members of Congress individually knew the sense of their respective Assemblies, before they came to Congress. The present Members of Congress were sent by their several Assemblies, at every hazard to maintain the Independence of America. I solemnly assure you upon this great point. Should a Member of Congress be so imprudent as but to move to accept your propositions, he must prepare to make attonement with his head, or fly to you for refuge. Congress have no power of themselves: Their power arises from the support of the people. So long as they possess this support, they hold the reins of government; the moment they lose it, that moment they cease to direct the affairs of the continent. As long, therefore, as you see them at the head of the American Empire, be convinced they are supported and obeyed by the people, in every measure tending to the establishment of their Independence. Deceive not yourselves by continuing to nourish the vain idea, that Congress have \""assumed the decisive part which they have taken.\""  Your Excellencies have it in your power to make a faithful representation of the utter improbability of your acquiring, in any degree, the subjection of America by your arms, or your negociations; to save your country by making such a representation; and thereby preserving your names from infamy, render them respectably immortal. That such may be your conduct and reward, is the wish of  W.H.D.(7) MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, and Daily Advertiser, September 12, 1778.  1 It should be noted that Gerard, the French minister in Philadelphia, claimed that he collaborated with Drayton in writing this letter.

  Congress Chamber, September the fourth, 1778. This morning I sent a bundle of newspapers and a half finished letter(1) by Mr. Hahn. Yesterday I dined with the president at his own house, he lives elegantly and keeps house himself, we had an elegant dinner and verr good claret and Madeira. No further accounts from Rhode Island that can be depended on, but one letter mentions they expect the French fleet from Boston again, and if so they will not quit the Island. If any thing certain arrives before this letter is sealed, I will mention it in a postscript. But for this unlucky storm that scattered the fleets of France and England we had the best ground to hope that Rhode Island would have been recovered, and that would have put an end to the war in all human probability, but if Heaven determines otherwise, we must submit; I am tired of the city heartily, it is very expensive living and not very agreeable; since I left the Indian Queen, I have paid for my room and bed, and breakfast and supper, six pounds per week, and four pounds per week more, for my dinner at another house without any drink.  SEPTEMBER 4, 1778  Yesterday, congress agreed to meet twice a day, so that we break up at one, and meet at three o'clock.(2) I told Mr. Shee my lodging was too dear, and I did not like to lodge at one house and dine at another half a mile off. He agreed to board me at twenty dollars per week including dinner, which is fifty shillings less than I had paid. I breakfasted with Mr. Wilson and Ross at Mrs. House's, she said her price was twenty dollars a week, which I will accept of, unless I can lodge at captain M'Collough's or Mr. Nichols', for being now able to dine at the usual time, I can get board in many places where I could not while we dined at four o'clock.  I am laying my account upon returning about the tenth of next month, to be able to attend Carlisle and York courts.  Beef and mutton are half a crown, veal three shillings, and all kinds of goods as dear as ever.  I put fifteen hundred pounds in the loan office, and have got about ninety pounds fees, and a promise of a hundred pound fee more, these are the first fees I ever got in Philadelphia; my fees here must clear my teeth, and my pay in congress go to you my dear, and the children. I believe if you would consent to come here and live, I could get into pretty good business in the law way, but it is a hazard, and two thousand a year would, as times go, be not more than enough to live in any tolerable style here. York and Carlisle are sure for business though fees are not so high as here.  Mrs. Stevenson sent me a forty dollar fee, to turn her husband out of her house, and general Thompson assures me, she will sign her claim to the widows' house on any separate paper, but not where he signed.  Poor Mrs. Shugart with Mr. Armor called on me to assist in getting a pass from congress, for leave for her to go to New York to try if she can get her husband home, I much doubt her success, but got her the pass.(3) Our prisoners there whose friends cannot send them hard money suffer greatly. I tried to get Tommy Armor a good post in the army, but missed it; had he spoken or written to me in time, I believe it might have been had for him.  I dined at major Nichols' one day and Kitty seems very clever, and is visited by good sort of people.  You, my dear, have been fatigued to death with the plantation affairs; I can only pity but not help you. Did you hear from Betsey's; is Peggy any thing more talkative? She sent a good letter, tell her to write me another.  I went to Mr. Hillegass (where I go often,) with Mrs. Nichols to deliver the letters. I have not time to finish, but you will have nonsense enough.

I wrote your Excellency some time past respecting the matter of Col. &c,(1) since which we have been honored with your favor of the 25th Ulto, and cant but again lament your distresses occasioned by the sickness and death of the late Commy. General and the melancholy of your mind in consequence of that event. I sincerely pray that under your present heavy and grievious affliction you may be comforted with the consolations of God-which are neither few nor small, & that while you are deprived of such tender connections, and dear enjoyments in life, you may at the same time, rejoice in the God of your Salvation.  I am very glad to hear Col. Dyer is coming on, not only on account of the late Commissary's affairs, but also of the public, and shall be happy to resign my Seat in Congress to his superior abilities and experience, and especially at such a time as the present when every effort of the greatest abilities is necessary to be exerted in behalf of the suffering public, for the manner of our conducting or rather delaying business in Congress gives me the most sensible uneasiness. I should think it my duty to give your Excellency a particular account of our proceedings had not Mr Hosmer done me the honour of presenting me his letter of the 31st Ulto. which had my full approbation, and which states that matter with such justice as to supercede the necessity of any observations from me upon the disagreable subject; other than most sincerely to lament the disagreable truth it contains. It is a most unwelcome consideration & what fills my mind with the deepest anxiety & concern, that the conduct of any of the members of Congress should be such, as to create in my mind strong suspicions of their moral and political virtue. But these things lead me more and more to remove my confidence from man, and to comfort myself with that consideration, that none of the wicked machinations of the deceitful and vile shall ever be able to defeat the kind instructions of the Deity.  SEPTEMBER 5, 1778  Yesterday we began to meet twice a day, which is to continue till the 1st of Novr.-A measure this-extremely disagreable to many members; but it has long been urged by the New England States.  We have just received Intelligence by General Sullivan's letter of a battle fought at the North end of Rhode-Island, in which our people kept the field, and that considerable numbers fell on both sides, we have no particulars as yet: nothing of consequence has concurred since Mr Hosmer wrote, have only to add my sincere wishes that you[r] extensive usefulness might be long continued-and that you might live to see the fruits of your arduous labours in the independence freedom and happiness of your Country, and be finally admitted to the glorious rewards of the Righteous.

  Sir 5th Septr. [1778] I had the honor of paying my respects to you the 26th Ulto. in a private Address, this is intended also as a private, having received no Commands from Congress respecting your late Letter.  The Executive Council of this State lately ordered Doctor Berkenhout who came from within the Enemy's Lines at New York thro' your Head Quarters into this City where he had remained some days without explaining himself or the nature of his errand to the Vice President of the State, the President of Congress, or to any Magistrate, to be apprehended and committed to Goal, where he now lies, under suspicion of being a Spy-from the contents of a Paper found in his custody it appears he had a design of offering himself to Congress as a private Negociator for terms of peace consistent with Independence between these United States and Great Britain, and 'tis certain that upon his journey hither, he, in conversation with a Gentleman in Jersey assum'd the Character of Agent or Commissioner from the Court of Great Britain to Congress.(1)  In a letter to Congress written since he has been in confinement, in terms which appear to be extremely equivocal he claims no public Character, says, \""he came hither under the sanction of a Pass from an American General,\"" complains of the hardship of being imprisoned \""in a Country which he had been taught to revere as the asylum of liberty\"" and \""requests to be permitted to return from whence he came.\""(2)  Congress have declined interfering in this business, but I am particularly requested by a Gentleman of the Council to inquire of You, SEPTEMBER 5, 1778  Sir, what were Dr. Berkenhout's pretensions of business or Character when he apply'd to you for a pass and under what authority or permission he gained access to you.  I have also to request you to inform me if you can possibly learn how many ships of the Line which lately went out of the Hook under the command of Lord Howe in order to divert our attack Count d'Estaing returned after the storm into New York-a very sensible Man a deserter from the Enemy, assures me, the Eagle and 3 or 4 more capital ships were driven on shore on Long Island and totally lost, that Lord Howe returned in a frigate which bore his Flag, and hitherto I have seen no other names in the New York Papers of his Lordships squadron but the Isis, Renown, and Prescott, which gives an air of truth to the deserters narrative. This is an interresting subject, if you will make the necessary enquiry and communicate the result together with every particular information you can collect of the state of the British Fleet you will thereby render a favor which will oblige me very much, and of which I will embrace all opportunities for making proper acknowledgments.(3)  I have the honor to be, With great Respect &c.(4)  ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia September 5. 1778 I am much obliged to you for your favor of the 26 August, and for the satisfaction you are pleased to express at knowing that I was in good health My health is indeed not bad at this time, but I am quite worn down with so long and constant attention to public business. I suppose you will have heared before this reaches you, that a violent Storm saved Lord Howe and the British fleet from the vengeance of Count D'Estaing. This ill timed tempest shattered and dispersed both fleets so that a very partial fighting took place between a few single Ships. The F. Admiral lost all his Masts before he fired a gun, they were carried away by the Storm. He returned to Rhode Island in that condition with a 74 that had lost her foremast & Bowsprit. The rest of his fleet safe, except the Caesar of 74 guns that has since arrived at Boston, where the whole fleet went immediately to refit, after touching at R. Island only. In this situation of things Gen. Sullivan was to consider, whether to retreat, or continue to press the Seige of Newport and risk the arrival of succors from York. A Council of War determined upon the former. The consequence was as you will see in the paper inclosed. I should suppose that Gen. Sullivan will find no great difficulty in effecting his retreat  SEPTEMBER 6, 1778  whilst the enemy continue sore from their late drubbing. It appears by the last accounts from England, that Adml. Keppel had taken two French frigates in the Channel, which he seems to have done with fear and trembling, for he apologises for his conduct. Whether the Duke des Chartres, who commands a superior fleet in the harbor of Brest will admit his apology, time must discover. I like much your ideas about the best manner of proceeding to the westward, and will in due season avail myself of your plan.  Remember me, if you please, with affectionate respect to Greenway Court, and do not forget my other friends in your parts.  I am, with sincere regard, dear Sir your real friend and most obedient servant. Richard Henry Lee  P.S. Tell Colo. Martin that I forwarded his letters to Alderman Lee, but I am uncertain when they will reach him, or where they will find him. He is either at the Imperial Court, or at that of Berlin.  R.H. Lee 7th. Septr. Since writing the above we have had an Express from Gen. Sullivan with a more particular account of his action on R Island, by which it appears that our loss was very small, 23 killed only, no Officer of consequence killed or wounded, and his retreat to the Main effected without any loss whatever, except the few men in the battle. Gen. Clinton with a reenforcement of 5000 men arrived on the Island thro the Sound a few hours after our Army crossed the Water.  Six ships of 74 guns each have lately arrived at N. York from England, and joined with the Ships formerly here are sailed Eastward in quest of Count D'Estaing. He is safe in Boston Harbour, and we have no doubt but that these Ships from G. B. will [be] quickly followed by a superior force from France.  Since the R. Island expedition began, the thing stands thus-Lost by the enemy 5 frigates, 2 sloops of War, 3 Gallies, a large number of Transports, and their Army, 6000 on R. Island have got a severe drubbing-On our side 23 Men killed, 211 Wounded & missing. We brought off near 70 Prisoners with some Officers. The account of the enemies dead not returned, but said to be very considerable.  ""

  My Dear Friend 6th September [1778] My last was dated the 22nd Ulto. conveyed by Captain Pyne, since which I have received none of your favors. I must again beg leave to refer you to our worthy friend the President for news in General. I have sent him a Budget-much of it ought to be confined within the knowledge of a few friends for the present.  Within the present cover I give you several of Dunlaps' Packets, Copy of a Letter from Your friend John Laurens of 1st September, and of one relative to him from General Washington. (1) I know you will be glad to see these; if you think proper to publish the first in order to do justice to some characters of whom he writes don't publish his name. I am sure he is as averse as I am to that sort of Newspaper Parade.  I was in great hopes to have sent you General Lees' trial at length, but 'tis not out of Press.  You will read what I have written to His Excellency the President respecting the Embargo and the Article of Rice an intimation intended for public good, (2) to yourself, I say if you are disposed to purchase 4000 Barrels of very good Rice at the Current price as speedily as possible after you receive this I shall be glad to hold a moiety of the concern, you will be the best judge of quality, goodness of Barrels and convenience of Storage, I shall therefore not trouble you on these Points, nor do I mean to impose myself on you as a Partner unless it shall be quite agreeable to yourself and that you can pay for one half the purchase out of my own funds.  My next shall mark my sentiments respecting the shipping or otherwise disposing of the Rice.  A swift sailing Sloop or Schooner to run into Delaware with 2 or 300 Barrels immediately if you have general permission will probably make a good Voyage provided the freight is not too extravagant. I judge it will sell here at 40/ or perhaps 6 dollars per 112 w[eight] if the Vessel be light, you may dispose of as much rough Rice as will fill the hollows in stowage of the Cask-but note 'tis not impossible  SEPTEMBER 6, 1778  that British Men of War may again appear in the Bay, and that there is no great hope of a back freight-these circumstances you will duly consider.  I shall also in my next talk seriously to you concerning my return. 'Tis high time, and yet when I reflect-Mr. Heyward gone, Mr. Hudson absent, Mr. Mathews going, I feel a sensible pain at the prospect of leaving our State again almost unrepresented, but if my Countrymen are totally inattentive to their dearest Interests, the continuance of my feeble efforts to serve them will be in vain with respect to them, although it may work the ruin of my Estate.  I expect to hear from you such Answer as General Gadsden shall have given.(3)  My respectful Compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Manigault, Mrs. Gervais and all Friends.

  Dear Sir 6th September [1778] Mr Heyward left us so suddenly about the 10th Ulto. it was impossible for me to pay my respects to Your Excellency by him. I writ the 11th continued to the 21st and my Packet overtook Captain Pyne the 23rd at Baltimore which I hope will supply that defect. In that Dispatch I omitted to send Copy of the Decree of the Committee of Appeals on the case of the Brigantine Success, because indeed I could not procure it in time from the Register. (1) It will now be found under cover with this among diverse other papers which will accompany it, as will appear by an inclos'd Schedule of the whole.  I am much dissatisfied with this determination and have doubts concerning the respect which will be paid to the Decree in Charlestown. Certainly a very formal and solemn Verdict given there is intended to be set aside by the judgment of a Court far inferiour to that of our Admiralty in every view-besides the 280 Dollars to be paid in obedience to his judgment for the Costs and charges of Captain Arthur the law charges which I must pay here will Amount I am inform'd to seven hundred Dollars and upwards. SEPTEMBER 6, 1778  I have lately been call'd upon by three Persons who had made their escape or been exchang'd from imprisonment at New York, and who had been captur'd on Voyages from Charlestown whither they were desirous of returning, but could not proceed without assistance of Money. I have supply'd each of them, viz. Lieut. Richard Wells of the Comet 200 Dolls. Captain Joseph Price of the Active 109 Captain George Leacey of the General Gadsden 350 Their several Receipts will be found within. I trust our State will suffer no loss from such unavoidable advance of Money to her distressed Citizens, and in any case that I shall not incur censure- indeed in every instance except that of Lacey I have had the concurrence and approbation of my Colleagues.  The sundry Papers alluded to above, together with the printed Papers which I shall add, will give Your Excellency almost a clear knowledge of our public intelligence to this day, and therefore I will not be troublesome with repetitions.  Bad as General Sullivan's Case appears to be, and the appearance is bad indeed, I do with grief assure Your Excellency the state of our Treasury and finances, of our Loan Office Certificates, our foreign Debts-our waste of time & neglect of the most important concerns, are infinitely more alarming-were I to indulge suspicions too well warranted from appearances, and the daily intimations which are given to me from different quarters, I should be provoked to say there are Berkenhout's and Temple's, and more dangerous Engines than either in the vitals of our Union.  At this very instant the arrival of Major Lewis Morris Aid de Camp to General Sullivan is announc'd-I must attend him.  Major Morris has deliver'd me Letters from General Washington, General Sullivan &c. which will soon spread that joy which I myself feel, throughout an anxious City.(2) I will add to the pile of Papers a Copy of the Generals Letter-the general anxiety was not without cause. The Major's words in a whisper to me were \""I do assure you Sir, we are indebted to that good Man General Washington for our escape, he gave us notice and press'd again our Retreat.\"" The day following 5000 Men landed from New York at Newport-Sir Henry Clinton said to be at the head of them-when General Sullivan had determin'd to retreat he cover'd his design by a stratagem which compleatly deceiv'd the Enemy and happily effected his purpose. The Enemy were then at least equal in number Man for Man with himself-the retreat of Major General Hancock and his Volunteers and of the Militia &c who had followed his example had nearly ruined our cause, or to say the least reduced America to extreme distress-we have cause to be thankful for an almost unparalle'd escape.  Major Morris informs me there are now upward of 10,000 British  and foreign troops on Rhode Island and a fleet of British Men of War riding in parade in Boston Bay, this will probably however, end in parade furnishing Mr Rivington with small means for long vaunting Paragraphs.  Will your Excellency pardon me in my present haste for making this private letter a vehicle for conveying an Act of Congress of the 2nd Inst. for relaxing the general Embargo in so far as to procure a supply of Vegetable Provisions for the necessary consumpt of the Eastern States.(3) I find the Embargo in this State is in existence and to run about fourteen days longer, Peccadillo evasions excepted, whether it will be renew'd is a question, probably it may be under the present relaxation which will answer every purpose to the 15th November.  I am desired by the Honorable the Minister Plenipotentiary to encourage the exportation of Rice to the French West India Islands, & to Count d'Estaing's fleet, and I am persuaded small Cargoes will meet with good sales in this City-which I intimate for the general benefit of my Countrymen that each may have timely notice and an option to adventure when the term of the present restriction shall expire. I am persuaded it will not be renewed this Year.(4)  I have the honor to be, With the highest Esteem & Regard (5)  Schedule of Papers sent Mr. Lowndes No. 1.

Mr. Silas Deane happened to be present, & immediately after the young Gentleman had turned his back intimated to me that he had sat with impatience during the Dialogue, fearing I should have acquiesed in Mr. Galvan's importunity, that he knew this Gentleman's conduct at Paris, adding a detail of several particulars; the most important to our State is-that Monsr.

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia Septr. 6. 1778 Having written you very lately (1) from hence it would have been unnecessary to write so soon again if some military events had not taken place that you may be desirous to know. The Count D'Estaing has no doubt informed his Court of his Maneuvres with the British fleet commanded by Lord Howe. We have here no accurate knowledge of this affair, but what we do know is as follows, that the Count, in conjunction with Gen. Sullivan who commanded the Continental Army, was beseiging about 6000 English & foreign Troops that had retired within Lines round the Town of Newport on Rhode Island, when Ld. Howe appeared in the offing. This suspended operations on the Island as the Count immediately reshipped his Troops and went out to fight the British fleet, which, tho consisting of many Vessels, was inferior in number of guns & weight of metal to the Counts fleet. The British fled & were pursued the first day, on the next day a furious Storm arose which saved Ld. Howes fleet by dispersing both fleets. The Count lost all his Masts before he fired a Gun, and a ship of 74 lost her foremast and Bowsprit. A partial fighting between single ships took place but nothing of consequence happened in this way. The Count returned to R. Island missing the Caesar of 74 Guns and he carried in prizes the Senegal Sloop of war & a Bomb Ketch. We hear the Cazsar has since arrived SEPTEMBER 6, 1778  at Boston. The French Admiral determined to go to Boston (and refit his Squadron) which he did immediately. By this time Gen. Sullivan had approached within Musket Shot of the enemies Lines. The departure of the fleet, exposing our Army to the arrival of Succors from N. York quickly thro the Sound, and Ships also to cut off our retreat, determined a Council of War to raise the seige of Newport and return to the Main. The enemy, upon our retreat came out, and a battle ensued, the consequence of which was victory on our Side as you will see by the inclosed Gazette. The Army was not off the Island when the last Express came away, but no doubt they would soon as possible return to the Continent. We hear that Succors were on their way from N. York thro the Sound for R. Island. Gen. Clintons Army is still shut up in N. York by the American Army which lays just above Kingsbridge at White Plains. Congress has not yet taken up the consideration of foreign affairs, but they soon will, I expect in a few days, when I will write you more fully. We are very anxious here to know that Spain has acceeded to our Alliance, and it would be very pleasing that Holland had determined to open Trade with us. We impatiently expect to hear from Europe-I refer You to my last in which I request, with regard to Ludwell that you may either keep him with you, or send him to me, as your judgment and most perfect convenience shall direct, remembering that I have a large family, and that I wish to do them equal justice-That I am very willing to assist Ludwells genius & application as far as I am able to render him useful to himself and beneficial to his Country. Send our brother Alderman this intelligence with my love, Farewell, Richard Henry Lee  [P.S.] My love to my dear Ludwell. We do not know whether the British fleet has ever returned to N. York in the whole-Reports are various-Some say they are all returned-Others that they have met with great loss.  ""

Cooke has sent me one. But You'l perceive others are also to be sent. Your Excellency will now have no Difficulty in forwarding the Tickets.  I am sorry to find that for want of the Aid justly expected from our Sister States (New-Hampshire excepted) We were obliged to exert so uncommon a Force from Our small State. But I somewhat console myself upon such Occasions with the Consideration of the Honor we procure to Ourselves, as well as a Consciousness of having well discharged Our Duty to Ourselves & Posterity. And however this Expedition is not likely to prove so successful as we had much Reason to perceive it might, Yet no Dishonor I think as yet at least, can be reflected on the American Arms. Our Conduct will raise our Characters abroad as well as at Home, even under Disappointments. For to conduct well, & bravely under unforseen Events & Misfortune is great Heroism. I hope also that Phylosophy & good Temper will be exercised under any Misfortunes; and that we may in some good Measure suppress Observations upon the Conduct of others, which may do us no good, but may do harm. Besides, Candor will teach Us, allways to put the most favourable Constructions upon the Conduct & Opinion of others-and we may sometimes doubt at least whether or no we are not mistaken Ourselves. Your Excellency I presume will perceive my Meaning. Whether all Things considered it was a Right Measure in the French Fleets going out after the English Fleet, And whether the going out the second Time was advisable, are Points not the most easily to be Determined-it is political however that We should be delicate upon the Point, if we would not gratify Our Enemies-The Tories especially. This is certain, that no Man could possibly express more uneasiness on that Occasion than the F___ h M___ r (2) And whether the C___ ts (3) Conduct was the most prudent or not. The goodness of his Intentions cannot be doubted of. The Friendship of his Royal Master most assuredly cannot. And we may depend upon a Vigour of Conduct that will shew His Royal Resolution to make good his Ground And to anticipate Our Wishes & Expectations in Him.  It is said that a Person has come out of N. York a Native of Virginia who was a Passenger in Ad'l Byrons Fleet, & declares that on the Passage he was an Eye Witness to the Loss of the Admiral and two other Ships. They all foundered in a terrible Gale of Wind. We hear of the Arrival of but 6 or 7 of that Fleet. We presume upon no SEPTEMBER 6, 1778  slight grounds that a French Fleet is after them-And we yet Trust that we shall see Our Worthy Ally superior in Our Seas to the British Fleet, within a few Days or Weeks. This however it may not be proper to publish.  I should be glad to know the Real Loss of the Enemy in their Shipping at Rhode Island-Whether Their Transports were so sunk as to be destroyed-Whether their Hay &c at Connecticut was destroyed. Our last account from Genl. Sullivan was after the Battle of the 29th but he was not particular as to our Loss, or the Enemies. But we presume it was great on both Sides. We are very anxious to hear that he got off safe, before the Reinforcements got to the Enemy which sailed more than a Week ago. My Respects to your Lady & Family. Most respectfully I am Yr.

Seriously, I have too good an Opinion of our Legislature to believe they would wantonly sport with the Feelings of mankind.

  My dear Hetty Camp White Plains, Sept. 6, 1778. I have wrote you twice since I have been here which I hope you have received tho the Conveyance was uncertain. I have nothing new to make a Letter necessary or even agreeable but that I know it gives you Pleasure to hear from me & therefore I take Pleasure in Writing. Notwithstanding the hot Weather & other Circumstances I have enjoyed a very good Share of Health & am now happy in the Thoughts of seeing you at least by this Day Week as I propose to set out for Home on Thursday Morning. We shall not have quite compleated our Business but so little will remain to do more than Clerkship that I think it not very necessary to stay. My Colleagues are neither of them Men of Business, so that if I should leave them the whole Business stands still-that is they are not sufficiently acquainted with military Business as to render me the Service they otherwise would. I am the more induced to hasten my Departure, as the Assembly of Pennsylva. have appointed me Assistt. to the Atty. Genl. with an Allowance of £2000 per Ann.-an Appointment which for various Reasons I believe will please you & is therefore very acceptable to me. I have wrote to the Council accepting the Appointmt. & thanking them for it.(1) As to News a few Days have wrought a great Change-Sullivan has been obliged to give up his Interprize on Rhode Island & was happy to get off with little Loss. Ld Howe has got a Reinforcement of Ships & is once more Master of the Coast. He has now block'd up the French Fleet at Boston. If you see Mr Lowry soon you may inform him that I think these Circumstances will change the Views I had when I wrote him last.(2) The Evacuation of New York appears now to be a more questionable Event than when I wrote you the other Day. By Advice from thence yesterday it seems they are impatiently waiting for the August Mail which  SEPTEMBER 7, 1778  they expect will announce a French War or The Independence of America. The latter seems to be their Wish.  Mr Pettit has very good Health, but has a very great Weight of Business upon him-Mr. Cox being at Philad. & Gen. Greene at Rhode Island.  Adieu my dearest Love. Remember me to the Children, your Mamma & Polly & believe me to be ever, Your Afft, J Reed  ""

  Sir Camp at White Plains, Sept. 7th. 1778 Your Committee beg Leave to sollicit your Attention to the Situation of your Cavalry while destitute of a general Officer. Each Regiment having its own Colonel, & he only attending to the Concerns of his particular Regiment, a general Confusion & Neglect must take Place, for Want of an Authority which can extend its Influence to the whole & correct their Abuses, & that Profusion of Expenses, which hitherto has been incurr'd by this Corps. Nor do we conceive it possible for the publick to derive the same Service from them in their present State, that it would do if under the general Direction of an active, & intelligent Officer. The present Colonels, tho' Men of Merit, are upon such Terms with each other, that it is probable the Appointment of either would occasion the Loss of the other three; there may also be other Reasons to determine another Choice, & we can think of no Person so proper, or so likely to be acceptable to the present Officers, as General Cadwallader. At least it is the Wish of the Committee that the Experiment may be made-the other Gentleman recommended by the General having turn'd his Views to civil Life, & wholly declining this Service now. If the Committee are so happy as to meet the Opinion of Congress, with Respect to Gen. Cadwalladers Appointment, they beg Leave to suggest the Expediency of immediately making the Choice, & leaving it to him to accept, or refuse; as they have Reason to fear a previous Consultation will be more likely to defeat, than advance their Views.(1)  The Cloathing of the Army is also an Object of very great Importance-in the present State of Suspence with Respect to that Department, we fear vigorous Measures are not taken either by the States, or the Officer of the Department; & that when the Season advances your Army will find itself suffering as it has been done formerly. If the Committee appointed on that Service, have made a Report, we hope Congress will not delay the Consideration of it, as the Conse- SEPTEMBER 7, 1778  quences will be extremely prejudicial to the Service. It is an Opinion universally prevalent here that the several States would effect this Business with great Economy, & more Satisfaction to the Army.  We are to acknowledge your several Favours of the 30th & 31st Augt.: the former inclosing the Papers respecting the Cavalry, upon which we have not yet come to any Resolution but shall in a few Days report to Congress the Allowance to be made them.  As to any additional Encouragement beyond the usual Bounty of Twenty Dollars given to the new Recruits his Excelly. has intimated his Opinion, that it will be best to keep it out of Sight at present & has communicated his Sentimts. to Congress to this Effect.(2) In which we concur.

  Dr. Sir. Phil. Sep. 7. 1778 I most affectionately congratulate you upon the glory you have gained in the late action on Rhode Island, & upon your having continued safe in the midst of so many balls & dangers. Your post was in the most important, most honourable & most perilous quarter. We had received a copy of Gen. Sullivans letter to Gen. Washington. Your Father had received a letter from the Marquis la Fayette.(1) Three days passed & not a word from or of you after the action. A report prevailed that you had fallen. And it had weight from the above circumstances. However, yesterday Major. Morris arrived with the desired account & relieved us from our anxiety:(2) & I felt particularly happy on the occasion, as well upon your Father's as your account.  A Man who is ever vigilant to discharge his duty to his country, is pleased to have objects pointed out. Give me leave to point one. The public is fully convinced that in you they possess a most valuable officer, & upon this point great hopes are established. It is your duty then in action to take some care of such an officer, & not unnecessarily expose those hopes to a blasting shower of balls.  We have had but little information with respect to the operations of the French fleet during their expedition against Lord Howe. Gen. Sullivan forgot to inclose a copy of D'Estaing's letter to him immediately upon his return to Rhode Island. We have no account of the names of the Officers who signed the Protest. Nor of the answer of the Gen. Officers to General Sullivans (3) propositions to them immediately upon the departure of the French Fleet for Boston.3 Nor of the precise time when the Fleet sailed for & arrived at Boston. These you know are of importance to me. The stationary nature of the Camp at White Plains may enable you to inform me on these points & on those relative to Monmouth.

Cook who lately commanded a Brigt called the Industry formerly belonging to some of my Friends abroad, was taken by the British; Retaken, & brought into the Jerseys, where upon Tryal, she was Condemned one half to the Recaptors & the other half to the former Owners as appears by your Honors Decree dated the 16th July last. Cap Cook informes me that the Vessell was Sold at Public Vendue the 29 July agreable to the Decree & also part of her Cargo of Salt, the remainder of the Salt he thinks has been Sold at private Sale at higher prices than that Sold at Public Sale. He complains that the Marshall has never furnished him the Accts & has delayed  SEPTEMBER 7, 1778  settling with him altho often applyed to for that purpose, & that he has been detained waiting for said Settlement since the Month of July, at a very heavy expence which amounts to a denyal of Justice. At his request I wrote to the Marshall Mr Stotler Eight days ago on this Subject but he has not thought proper to give an answer. Capt Cook has empowered me to Act on behalf of his Owners, my Friends dr Correspondants and I am bound to see justice done them. This application to You I consider as the Second Step towards obtaining it having before applyed to the Marshall & from my knowledge of your private Character I am sure you will not suffer any irregularities under Your Authority, therefore I hope to be favoured with a line on this Subject.  I must also beg leave to trouble Your Honour on another, which is just opened to me by the Receipt of the enclosed letters. I beg of you to peruse them and if any Steps be necessary in the Law to procure Messrs Penet & Co their property, you'l oblige me much by putting those papers into the hands of some Gent. of the Law that Practices in your Court (as I am entirely ignorant who has practice in the Jerseys) desire him to do the needfull & I will pay for his Services.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sept. 7th. 1778. When I was at Newbern last and was informed that several Gentlemen of the Assembly proposed to ask more money for the purpose of raising Troops for the Grand Army, I was against it; and gave my advice that application should be made to Congress for whatever money was necessary for public use-giving them as a reason, that I thought it more for the interest of No. Carolina to be indebted to the United States, than the reverse that all the other States were occasionally supplied with money and I was authorised to say (to the Treasury Board) that they wouid have money by the 10th of May; besides what money was made in our State was confined there. I also knew that our(1) governor or State when I left Congress was treated with more respect than your Excellency and those you SEPTEMBER 7, 1778  presided over. I therefore had no doubt but that you would have received whatever money was necessary for marching the Troops without delay. Judge then Sir, of my surprise and Chagrin when I found by your letter, which I got a few days ago, in what manner your application was treated.(2) I own I most sensibly felt the indignity offered the State, I belonged to, by the little respect that was paid to her first magistrate, and loudly complained of it in Congress. The Members seemed much concerned and resolved to grant us the sum you wrote for, indeed they appeared willing to do every thing that tends to our interest.(3)  We shall send off the money as soon as we can, which will I expect be in a short time. Congress are obliged to meet twice a day, business still increases, in short unless persons are appointed not members to do some part of it, we must all be ruined. A few days ago we were in high expectations of taking all the British Troops on Rhode Island, now rejoicing that our army was able to get away without being taken. The Newspapers will inform you the reason. We have no late intelligence from Europe. If the Assembly did not discharge the Soldiers it is the wish of Congress that they may be kept in Carolina, under proper officers until, your Excellency can hear from them. The express is setting off sent by the President which obliges me to stop. I should be happy to receive any intelligence that you may think proper to give me and with my Colleagues to do every thing in my power for the benefit of No. Carolina. I hope you will excuse the manner in which this appears from the hurry I am in.  I have the honor to be with great respect, your Excellency's Most Ob. huml. Servt. J. Penn  ""

6019,dg010528,1778,Proposed West Indian Expedition,"""Proposed West Indian Expedition
  Philadelphia, 7ber 8, 1778 (1) It is proposed by Major Gen. Arnold to a Committee of Congress appointed to confer with him in consequence of a resolution of the 7 7ber to undertake an expedition against Barbadoes, and, in returning from that Island to take possession of Bermudas in the name of the United States. The force proposed to be employed is 5 or 6 frigates and (if to be procured from our Allies) one or two line of battleships including two companies of artillery, together with a troop of horse. The expedition to be fitted out from Boston, and to sail about the 1st of February next. The objects of the expedition are 1. To lay Bridgetown, and the Island under a contribution of money and plate.  2. To secure the merchant men which arrive from Britain with goods and to lade them for America with merchandize, and produce found at Bridgetown.  3. To secure the cannon, musquets and military stores on the Island of which there is a considerable quantity.  4. To engage in the marine service of the united states about 5 or 6 hundred black and Mulatto Slaves who are employed as mariners in coasting vessels, by giving to them the pay and priviledges of American Seamen, and assuring them of the[ir] freedom after the war, or three years Service.  5. To take and hold possession of on the return homeward of the Is- SEPTEMBER 8, 1778  lands of Bermudas from which a swarm of priwateers may be fitted out to cruise upon the enemies West India commerce, and where inhabitants who are now our friends must from necessity become formidable enemies to our commerce if this measure is not adopted.  6. To raise the reputation of American Arms, to alarm and distress the enemy, and thereby hasten their acknowledgment of our independance.  7. To serwe the interest of our Allies by giwing up to them the right of conquest to the Island if they shall think proper to send a sufficient and timely force to keep possession of it.  In order to form a judgment of the practibility of the plan proposed, and of the means necessary to carry the same into execution, it will be proper to take into consideration the situation and strength of both Islands.  Barbadoes Barbadoes is situated in latitude 13 N. Long. 60 W. is about 30 leagues S.E. from Martinico about 24 leagues east of St. Vincent and 103 leagues S.E. by S. from Antigua. It is 25 or 30 miles long and about 12 broad. It contains about 10000 white inhabitants and about 50 or 60000 slaves. The Capital sea Port is Bridgetown situate on the southwest of the Islands upon the side of Carlisle Bay where there is a good harbour for ships of any size, and in which almost all the ships which bring Supplies to the Island and carry produce home in. To defend the habour there is a fort on Needham's point mounting betwixt 30 or forty pieces of heavy cannon; no embrasures towards the land side where it is only defensible against small arms. There is another battery on the north side of the bay in which there is about 25 or 30 pieces of heavy cannon. This battery is open and accessible in the rear. There are no other posts or forts of any consequence so as to prevent taking possession of the town, which may be immediately occupied and the harbour opened as soon as the above fort and battery are taken possession of. This may without difficulty be done by landing a body of men and some heavy artillery at Austin's bay about 8 miles from the fort and making a breach in the rear, should they on summons refuse to surrender, which considering their weakness is not probable. There is seldom more than two frigates in Carlisle bay and sometimes a 40 gun or line of battle ship. There is no regular force on the Island and only about 2500 militia, 200 of which are horse and who are by no means formidable. Should the enemy obtain intelligence of the invasion of the Island, it would be at Least 12 days before any reinforcement could be sent either from Antigua or Dominica, where the principal force of the English is stationed, and before that time every object of the expedition will be effected. But to render the success of this Enterprise still more certain, it might be proper that an expedition should at the same time be undertaken by our allies either against of the Islands of An-  tigua, Dominica, or St. Christophers, in order to prevent the enemy from sending reinforcements to the succour of Barbadoes.  The objects of this expedition being effected, which it is presumed may be done about the middle of March, it is proposed that the fleet should immediately proceed for the Islands of Bermudas.  N.B. Here followed the Observations of the Committee on the situation, strength and importance of Bermudas, but it being no wise connected with the present object of our Allies, I have omitted inserting here.

  Dear Sir: (1) Philadelphia, 8th September, 1778. I received your favor of the 24th of last month just now, and I write an answer which may or may not reach you. I am much obliged by the sentiments you profess for me, and I hope to deserve them from you, from all, from enemies and from friends. I always have regretted, and I trust I shall, that you did not take part with us in the cause, which, let the success of it be what it may, I cannot but consider as the just cause of all mankind. I am particularly afflicted, that you should be now obliged to relinquish your country, for opinions which are unfavorable to her rights. If I am rightly informed, your situation is by no means singular; a circumstance which, I believe, is far from alleviating your feelings, and which most sincerely affects mine.  What may be the law you allude to, I know not; and therefore shall not be so hardy as to arraign its policy or humanity:(2) should it be contrary to the principles of the former, the infancy of the state must apologize for the defects of its legislature; should it revolt against the latter, while we lament the consequence, let us pardon something to the cause. Being men, we are all subject to human frailty. We are not therefore to be surprised, that some sparks of resentment shed their baleful light on the conduct of human affairs. I fear that the very best will, in the years of cool reflection, pay melancholy tribute of repentance to the hours of contention. Adversity is the great school of moderation. If any of my countrymen are come thence unlearned, I will not blame, though I cannot commend; and let me entreat you not to tell tales of them to high-judging Job, or pray him that he will teach them to feel what wretches feel.  It was always my opinion, that matters of conscience and faith, whether political or religious, are as much out of the province, as they are beyond the ken of human legislatures. In the question of punishment for acts, it hath been my constant axiom, that the object is example, and therefore the thing only justifiable from the necessity, and from the effect. I implore the Omnipotent on all occasions to direct my conduct by this great, and I trust just principle. Could the American contest have been decided without blood, I should have been happy. While the appeal lay to reason, I reasoned; when it was made to the sword, I thought it my duty to join in the great issue. While reconciliation appeared practicable, I labored for reconciliation. When the breach was so widened that no hope remained of cure, I solemnly pledged my faith to support the independence of my country, which had then become essential to her liberties. In the hours of distress, I was secured from fear by the mens sibi conscia recti, and the dawnings of prosperity have not inflated me, because I SEPTEMBER 8, 1778  have seen too much of the instability of human affairs, to confide in appearances.  As I am determined not to share in gains which arise from public distress, I will continue in public life till the establishment of the liberties of America. It shall be my object to narrow as much as possible the circle of private woe. I would to God, that every tear could be wiped away from every eye. But so long as there are men, so long it will and must happen that they will minister to the miseries of each other. It is a delightful object in history, to see order, and peace, and happiness result from confusion, and war and distress. It is a pleasing hope in life. It is your misfortune to be one out of the many who have suffered. In your philosophy, in yourself, in the consciousness of acting as you think right, you are to seek consolation, while you shape your old course in a country new.  Whatever may be the fate of the great controversy, and whatever may be your individual lot, I pray you to believe there are very few who will more rejoice in _ (3)  MS not found; reprinted from Henry C.

  My Dear Sir Philada. Septr. 8th. 1778 When I look at the date of your last Friendly & affectionate letter, I cannot help reproach myself for hawing so long delayed to acknowledge the Receipt of it, and indeed my immagination is obliged to trace back the busy Scenes that have employed my Mind since the Month of April (in which this letter arrived) before I can find the shadow of excuse for this seeming Neglect. I say seeming for be assured I shall newer incur the charge of real Neglect of the Man I love & esteem so much & so justly as I do Mr Duane. Many important Scenes have occurred since we parted, often have I wished for Opportunities of Consulting you on whose judgement & Friendship I cou'd safely rest myself. Duer in many instances supplied your place and a Worthy honest fellow he is, that Man deserves the Esteem & Confidence of his Constituents in the highest degree, for his only fault is an over zeal & anxiety in their affairs. They have an able ad- SEPTEMBER 8, 1778  vocate in my Namesake (1) & really the Representation in Congress from N. York does honour to the State. You called on me to give my feeble Voice in support of your representation of the Indian affairs & in bringing forward the Tryal of General Schuyler and had I attended Congress, I certainly shou'd have promoted the points you wished all in my power because I did then as I do now think them just & reasonable, the first have not produced all the evils you expected especially to N York & the latter is I hope brought about by this time. I make no doubt our Friend Genl. Schuyler will be acquitted with honour & I shall rejoice very sincerely with you whenever it happens.  I did not join Congress seriously untill since they came down here, now & then I paid them a visit of a few days in York Town during the Winter & Spring. Notwithstanding this a great-part of my time was employed in Public business for People were perpetually coming after me about it. The recess I obtained from my State was of real service to my own affairs & enabled me to arrange & bring them again into some order. I find also that this recess has caused the strongest desire to take place in my mind to get back into my private Station again.  Ambition had no share in bringing me forward into Public life nor has it any Charms to keep me there. The time I have spent in it has been the severest Tax of my life and really I think those who have had so much, shou'd now be relieved & let some fresh hands take the Helm. These notions prompt me to get out of Congress at the next appointment of Delegates, but my Namesake swears I shall not depart. Philadelphia my Good Friend is vastly changed, the avowed Tories are I think more inveterately so than ewer, our Circle's of Friends & acquaintance are all broke up and it is with difficulty we cou'd patch up a little Social Club at Dick Peters's Spring during the hot weather, in short our greatest Society is now in the Company of Strangers. Shou'd the British evacuate New York you will experience this & many other changes that I cannot spare time to tell you of. The Hills, poor Hills alas have changed, a Melancholly cast of Countenance cowers the Face of Nature & the Works of Art exhibit Such Melancholly pictures in their present Views that Hospitality can no more cherrish nor Festivity exhilerate the chearfull guest but I hope to see the day when the Scene again shall change & all be bright & gay.  The Alliance with France certainly Secures our Independance & has procured us temporary advantages but I wish these may be properly followed up and the most made of them, our Money is at present the only stumbling block. I wish you was here to assist on that Subject, it is as Intricate as important & we really want lights & help. God Bless you my Good Friend.

  [September 9, 1778](1) The Committee of Arrangement after mature Consideration of the many disputes of rank, subsisting in the Army of the United States have agreed to the following resolutions founded upon a report made by a board of General Officers of the whole line (wizt.):  1st. That the relative rank in the Continental Line of the Army between all Colonels and Inferior Officers of different States, between like Officers of Infantry and those of horse and Artillery appointed under the Authority of Congress by Virtue of a resolution of the 16th. of September 1776, or by Virtue of any subsequent Resolution, prior to the Ist. of January 1777, shall be deemed to have their Commissions dated on the day last mentioned, and their relative rank with respect to each other in the Continental line of the Army shall be determined from their rank prior to the 16th. of September 1776.  This rule shall not be considered to affect the rank of the Line within any State or within the Corps of Artillery, Horse, or among the Sixteen Additional Battalions where the rank hath been or shall be settled; but as there is a difficulty in settling the rank of the Line of Artillery by reason of the peculiar Circumstances attending some Appointments in that Corps, it is recommended that the general rule now to be established for the great line of the Army should be the rule to determine the relative rank within the particular line of Artillery so far as their rank remains unsettled.  2ndly. That in determining rank between Officers of different States previous to the 16th. of September 1776, preference should be given in the first instance to Continental Commissions, and to State  SEPTEMBER 9, 1778  Commissions of those Corps which have been incorporated into the Continental Army, the latter being considered as Continental from the time of their entering the Continental service: That in the second instance Preference shall be given to Commissions in the New Levies and Flying Camp. That in the third Place Commissions in Militia be considered where they have served in the Continental Army for the space of one Month at least.  3rd. That all Colonels and Inferior Officers appointed to vacancies since the 5th. of January 1777, shall take rank from their Right in Succession to such Vacancies.  4th. That in all Cases where the rank between two Officers of different States is equal, or between an Officer of State Troops and one of Cavalry, Artillery or the Additional Battalions, their Seniority is to be determined by Lot.  5th. That a resignation entirely precludes any Claim of benefit from former rank, under a new appointment.  6th. Adjutants, Pay Masters and Quarter Masters taken from the line shall be again admitted into it in the rank they would have been entitled to had they continued in the Line, and such Adjutants, Pay Masters and Quarter Masters not taken from the Line may be admitted into the line in such Subaltern Ranks as by a signed Certificate from the Field Officers of their respective Corps they shall be deemed competent to.  7th. The rules above laid down for the determination of rank between Officers of different States are to govern between Officers of the same State unless where a rule has been laid down by the State or rank already settled, in which Case it is not the Intention of the Committee to interfere.  Signed in behalf of the Committee of Arrangment.  Jos. Reed, Chairman.  Reprinted from Washington, Writings (Fitzpatrick), 12:413-15.

  Sir Philadelphia 10th September 1778 I have the honor to inform your Excellency that your Letters to me of the 8th July and 26th August have been laid before Congress.(1)  The Trust reposed in your Excellency by His Most Christian Majesty in your present Command is so high an evidence of your Excellency's proved Abilities, Zeal and Bravery as to secure your Reputation against those injuries which the ill success of the best laid Plans sometimes brings upon less established Characters.  I am to assure you, Sir, that Congress, not admitting a doubt of your Excellency's attachment to the joint interests of your Sovereign and of these United States have readily concluded that your Excellency has been influenced in all your aims for the general good, since your Excellency's arrival in America by a strict attention to your Orders, and to the peculiar state of your Squadron under the varying circumstances of time and Place.  The People of America must indeed regret the failure of the late expedition against Rhode Island, but certainly they will not omit to do just Credit to the Martial zeal of their Naval Allies, which, in pursuit of an hostile fleet was overborne by the power of a sudden and severe Tempest. From such an unfavorable casualty they will look forward in hope of Events more consonant to the wise intentions of His Most Christian Majesty, the Glory of his Fleets, and the security & interest of the United States.  You may be confident, Sir, that every possible aid will be afforded to your Excellency for the repair of your Ships. The most immediate and active Measures were taken to furnish your squadron with all the supplies which Congress was at first informed were wanted. The true cause why you did not earlier receive them was the diflerence between that facility with which Ships move from one place to another, and the embarrassments of distant land carriage. The Plan for furnishing Your Excellency's Squadron at Sandy Hook was rendered abortive by its removal to Rhode Island; and the Provisions ordered for this latter Place, were afterwards to be transported by land to Boston.  The public officers are now diligently employed in forwarding to that Capital such supplies as Congress have been informed will suffice for the Squadron thirty days, and if more is required to be sent thither, Congress will continue in the exertion of every practicable means to comply with your Excellency's future requisitions: but it is to be wished that the delay and expence of so long a land carriage in victualling the Squadron could be prevented by its change of Harbour as speedily as possible to Chesapeak Bay or that of Delaware.

  My Dear Friend 10th September [1778] I had the honor of writing to you the 6th Instant by Muckinfuss to which I beg leave to refer, the opinion which I then intimated refering the Article of Rice, I now confirm, more on your Account than mine; I am altogether indifferent respecting a Concern in any purchase you may think proper to make, except the wish ewer uppermost in my mind to promote your Interest. I do not apprehend you will be a loser, should you venture to lay up even ten thousand Barrels, a small Cargo at Egg Harbour or Sinnepuxent will be in a fair way for Count d'Estaing's fleet and for further Orders. I shall persevere in offering my opinion by every opportunity.  Within the present inclosure you will receive two Newspapers- also a Copy of Count d'Estaings late letter to Congress and the Answer to it, which shew, that all at present is harmony, altho' I may truly say, and say it with some concern, there is a cursed, unreasonable, impolitic jealousy resting in some Minds. What this observation alludes to will afford Annecdote when I shall have the happiness of seeing you at Ansonburgh-you will shew these Copies to His Excellency the President, then be so good as to deposit them among my own Papers.  Mr. Timothy Matlack of this City has been so polite and generous as to put into my hands a long Letter which he receiv'd from Mr. Gadsden,(1) and if I understand him right he has hitherto shewn it to no other Person, altho' the Author has intimated that it should be shewn to any body or every body but me; It is highly probable you have seen or learned the Contents of that Letter. As Mr. Gadsden has, in this new instance without the least grounds, most injuriously  SEPTEMBER 10, 1778  and unjustly treated me, first, by what he has written, and aggravated in the second place by his manner of wounding an innocent Man in a secret manner, and at a time when such a stroke in the dark must be most affecting; and as he must feel conviction of his error, I expect from him an immediate and ample acknowledgment to each of the Persons to whom he has written, and to as many as possible to whom he has related such Articles contained in that Letter as respect my Character; even this will fall far short of that justice which a vindictive Mind would demand, and which a generous Heart would, without prompting, express immediately upon discovery of so great a fault. I am willing once more to sacrafice at the Shrine of Peace all that I might further with strict propriety exact from him.  You will, I am persuaded Sir, do me the honor to read all the preceding Page to Mr. Gadsden; be so friendly as to transmit me that Gentleman's Answer, which I hope you will obtain in a few plain, explicit Words.  Mr. Drayton, I find, has a Copy of that Letter, it was from thence he gave me the information which I formerly spoke of,(2) but I had not known he was possess'd of the letter until I mentioned to him this of Mr. Matlack's. Mr. Drayton expresses himself upon the occasion with much sorrow and concern on my Account. He is also vested with full powers \""to make what use he pleases of it, either in Congress or out, but by all means to shew it to Heyward, Mathews and Hudson, and his old particular friends in Congress.\""(3) Here it was calculated to ruin me among People with whom I live in the strictest harmony, and from whom I have the honor of receiving daily marks of friendship and respect. I should have felt the blow, without knowing the hand from whose Art or power it had been struck-but Alas poor Man! he mistakes his friends as egregiously as he does his Enemies. I do not, my Dear Sir, restrict you from reading the whole of this to Mr. Gadsden if you think proper, but I could wish whatever may be the Event of this Circumstance it may not be talk'd of abroad. I have written in great haste. The dictates of a Heart, honest, feeling, and disposed upon every occasion to pursue such Measures as may produce good effects public & private. My Compliments to each friend ennumerated in my former Addresses, and to all, if any, whom I may have inadvertently omitted.  God Bless you, and keep you in health and Peace. H.L.  ""

  10th Septr. [1778] I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency on the 6th which I sent after Muckinfuss whom I had engaged to wait eight and forty hours-business had crouded in upon me for the preceding week in such quantity and numbers as to render it impossible for me to write while he remained in the City-my Colleague Mr. Drayton had detained him five days. I have therefore paid Muckinfuss for the whole, 70 Dollars, which I charge to our State; had we sent a special Express which our variety of Intelligence seemed to call for, the expence would have been ten times as much.  By mere accident I have learned of an opportunity for Charlestown, and have half an hour allowed me to write.  General Sullivan writes the 3d Inst. that a perfect harmony subsisted between the Count d'Estaing and himself, (1) this points at certain Circumstances which had happened upon the Count's determination to go into Boston, the knowledge of which Congress had engaged to keep within doors, therefore I have not spoke of them to Your Excellency or any other friend and I think myself not yet releas'd.  The General adds that the British fleet in Boston Bay consists of 8 ships of the line, 10 frigates, one Sloop and a Schooner. They cannot lie there long without coming to blows with the French Squadron whose re-equipment is proceeding with great celerity and whose Admiral is brimfull of desire for Action.  We are too ignorant of the State of our Enemy's forces in this neighbourhood both on land and water. I am endeavouring since I perceive the public neglected to collect the fullest intelligence for their benefit.  General Washington the 4th of September says \""the designs of the Enemy as to their future movements remain yet entirely unfolded; but the expectation of their leaving the Continent is daily decreasing.\"" The reasons which his Excellency assigns for the ground of this opinion appear to me as good premises for a quite contrary conclusion. Mr. Gerard concurs in my sentiments, therefore I am not very presumptous in saying, that important point remains doubtful; in the mean time I am grieved by knowing from General Washington in the same Letter that our Army are again likely to suffer exceedingly for want of Cloaths and Blankets, yet we have been amused for Months past with Reports of Cloathing enough in the public Stores for forty thousand Men.  The management of Provision is equally improvident. In a word, Sir, every complaint which I have lately made to Your Excellency of the deplorable state of our Affairs gathers strength from every days melancholly experience-if Congress continues inert, the States will soon be alarmed by informations which will throw the whole into  SEPTEMBER 10, 1778  convulsions. I have written in the utmost haste, and under many interruptions and hear the person who is to conduct my Letter calls, and will not be detain'd.  I shall inclose certain Resolves of Congress approving the late conduct at Rhode Island,(2) and two of Dunlap's Advertizers. The Resolves may be published. I intimated to the House a Resolve of November last for enquiring into the causes of miscarriage of every Expedition &c. as a bar to hasty approbation and thanks but my sentiments were lost.(3) I have not time to expatiate on a subject which seems to require attention.  On the 5th Inst. a Member of Congress Mr. R. Morris declared in the house in a formal Address to the Chair that the Embargo was not regarded in Maryland, that flour was daily exported thence under, or under the Idea of, Tobacco. The Delegates of Maryland were present. No Contradiction was intimated. No doubts of the fact suggested, and the matter passed over without notice. This is a simple relation of a fact which duty to my country has prompted.(4)  I have the honor to be &c.  P.S. I have prevail'd on this Messenger to wait a few hours for the benefit of my (Colleagues, if any thing important shall come to light in the meantime, Your Excellency will be troubled with an additional Postscript.

  My dear Sir Philade. Sept. 12. 1778 Your obliging Letter of the 25 of August came duly to my Hand.(1) As you again mention Captn. Manly I will speak of him to you with Candor. I newer saw him but once, viz. the last spring in Boston, till he came to this City. I had preconceivd an opinion of his Bravery, in speaking of which you tell me \""no Caution ought to be used,\"" though I have newer yet been pointed to a single Instance. I confess his Appearance in Boston did not strike me most agreably. He was in the midst of a Crowd who were shouting his Entrance into Boston, and like some of his Superiors, he seemd to be intoxicated with popular Applause. I had some other Apprehensions, but I give you my most charitable Thoughts. I retaind however an Opinion of him; for I concluded, that Huzza for the brave Manly, might be sufficient to induce him to lay a Pop Gun Schooner alongside the Eagle SEPTEMBER 12, 1778  if good Fortune should throw her in his Way. You think his Judgment and Abilities would not be equal to others in the Direction of more Ships than one. Here lies a Difficulty; for let us consider the Rank he holds in our little Navy, and judge how soon the Time may, perhaps must come when he may have the Command of more Ships, if you give him the Command of one. Hawing said this to you and to no one else though I have frequently heard the same thing mentiond by others, I am sure you will not conclude that I am here deeply engagd in a Party against him. Some, I know have formd or pretended to form such a Conclusion, not from a real Regard to the Merits of Manly, the Honor of our Navy or the great Cause we are engagd in, but to serve a different and very inferior, Purpose than either. Such Men, you know, I hold in ineffable Contempt.  I am glad that Lanais rises in your Esteem-that the other Captains are convined that he is Master of his Business, which with his agreable Manners & Disposition forces Conviction of the Judiciousness of his Appointment, I fancy now, that I shall soon be dischargd the shameful Imputation of being \""his chiefe Patron here.\"" I have a particular Reason to urge that every Exertion may be made to get his and every other Ship manned.  Last Evening a Letter from Governor Trumbull was read in Committee, strongly recommending a Captain for the Ship at Norwich, who, added to great Qualifications, can readily get Men for her.(2) I mentiond Manly as hawing the Character of a brave and very popular Officer, and read those Parts in your Letter to me that related to Him; But I am convincd he woud not impute his being owerlookd to any other Cause, than the Desire of the Court Martial, which acquitted him with Honor.  The Rhode Island Expedition is at length finishd. Our Cause is not dishonord though we have not succeeded to our Wishes. Congress have approvd of the Retrial, thanked General Sullivan & his brave Troops and applauded the patriotick Exertions of New England. Major General Hancock was unluckily at Boston and missed the Laurels. In my opinion it would be in a great Degree impolitick at this Juncture to suffer an Odium to be cast on the Count D'Estaing. If there should be a Disposition to do it, I am perswaded Men of Discretion & Influence will check it. The Tories will try their utmost to discredit our new Alliance. And he who not long ago expressed his Opinion, that \""A Connection with France would serve America,\"" will not fail to promote a Jealousy if he can thereby establish his Popularity.(3) Such Men should be critically watchd on this Occasion.

By the last post I had the pleasure to receive a copy of the Vote of the General Court appointing you a delegate to Congress(1) and I hope that no private considerations of any nature will prevent your acceptance and that you will have as great a hand in making peace and confirming our Independence as you had in carrying on the War and declaring our total separation from Britain; as it is very probable negotiations for peace will be carried on the ensuing winter, I Sincerely wish you may be present in Congress when they are under consideration. I could wish you and your colleague would be here the latter end of next month that I might have a day or two with you before I set out for home, which I shall do the Ist of November, as I can by no means tarry over the winter and every day after that time will make the journey more and more disagreeable and my tarrying longer will be of no service, as being alone, I cannot represent the State after that time. I shall therefore think myself at liberty and that it will be best for me to return at that time whether you are arrived here or not.  Please as soon as you receive this to send me an answer that you have accepted and that you will be here by the latter end of next month.  The enclosed paper will inform you what the British Commissioners have been Sending to Congress and that we have not thought proper to make them any other answer than the Resolve concerning releasing the convention prisoners. The letter to them signed W.H.D. was wrote I suppose by Chief Justice Drayton member from So.

It has been acknowledged that a Member of Congress did give the Information respecting exportation of flour to the Eastern States, intending it only for the private information of your Governor and Council but that you my good friend opened the Letter and let the contents pass under the Eye of several Merchants and others, pray, between you and I, how stands this Mystery?(1)  General Sullivan, you see, made a safe Retreat and Congress have applauded him, this applause would have been in my humble opinion of no less value had it been founded on an inquiry in terms of our Resolution of November last(2)-it is known to very few, and I do not mean to depreciate General Sullivan's merit when I assure you the Union is indebted to that good Man General Washington for the escape of that part of our Army.  The Newspaper under Cover with this will shew you W.H.D. versus British Commissioners,(3) and from a Copy of General Heath's Letter of the 2nd Inst. you will see Lord Howe is determined at great hazards to attempt a further interview with Count d'Estaing.(4) What if Clinton with his 10,000 should from Rhode Island penetrate to Boston and the Troops of the Convention struggle to join him? Such an attempt would give us some trouble, and might end the War in their ruin-four or five days will produce great and probably bloody accounts.

In the Course of a Retreat, made necessary by circumstances out of the Power of Mortals to prevent or foresee- a Victory was obtained by the Continentals and Militia of New-England, and a safe and honorable Retreat effected. And in that Expedition the Exertions of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the Spirit of its brave Officers, Troops and Volunteers, has gained them high Honor & Reputation and a very advanced Standing amongst the United States. Upon this Occasion as well as many others, which the Patriotism, Valour and Spirit of thy State I have the Honor to represent has furnished me with, I have not been wanting in my Exertions to place them in that Point of Light which Justice demanded. 'Tis true, however, such distinguished Merit and display of Spirit and Fortitude had no call for an Advocate. They stood confessed.  I must however observe, that Major Genl. Sullivan has done great Justice to the Honor of the State, and has not failed to exert himself in obtaining the Attention of Congress to his Merits, and to Her Relief, from the Burthens she has so long & with so much Magnanimity sustained.  By a Resolution passed this Day, & which will be forwarded to him by the President, Genl. Sullivan is impowerd with the Advice of the Legislature or Councill of War for the State of Rhode Island &c to call upon all the New England States for such Numbers of Militia as he shall think necessary upon great Emergencies.(1)  This is to be understood exclusive of the Standing proportions.

  My dear sir, Philad. Sept 14 1778 I received your favor of the 3d with the News Paper inclosed. I note well the Contents. Our Boston Papers never fail to mark all the Movements of Great Men, and to give Honor where Honor is due. The Spirited Exertions of our Major Generals to be sure ought to be properly noticed, Some of them have the good Fortune to be never out of the Way of making a Figure, while others are wisely following the unpopular Steps of Fabius or Count Daun. The Marquis, every one acknowledges, made surprising Dispatch in going to Boston and returning to Rhode Island; but he was sadly mortified in not being present in the Action on that Island. He did all that Man could do. Impossibilities are not to be expected. But he arrivd in Season to take a distinguished Share in the well timed & well conducted Retreat. In Him we indeed see an Instance of a young Nobleman \""of Rank & Fortune foregoing the Pleasures and Enjoyment of domestick Life and voluntarily exposing himself to the Hardships & Hazzards of a Camp\"", not in his own but a foreign Country, \""in the glorious Cause of Freedom.\"" His Example must be \""animating\"" to our young American Heroes; and who would not covet to be coupled with him? Congress have requested the President to write to him & in their Name acknowledge his Zeal and spirited Services on this Occasion, by which he has given a fresh Proof of his warm Attachment to our Common Cause.  I am sorry to hear that there is a Disposition in some Persons in Boston to cast an Odium on the French Admiral for leaving Rhode Island. In my opinion it is at this Juncture impolitick in the Extreme. Even if his Conduct shd be thought blameworthy, Prudence, I think, dictates Silence to us. Men of Discretion and Influence will surely by all Means check such a Disposition. The Tories will try their utmost to discredit our new Alliance. You know how much depends upon our culvitating mutual Confidence. It is not in the Power of undisguisd Tories to hurt our Cause. The Injudicious, though honest, Whigs may and too often do injure it. Those whose chief Aim is to establish a Popularity in order that they may obtain Emoluments of Places or the Breath of Applause, will think they can  SEPTEMBER 14, 1778  serve themselves by declaiming on this Subject or prompting others to do it; and they will not fail doing it though they essentially wound their Country. If there be any of my virtuous & publick Spirited fellow Citizens, who pay any Regard to my Opinions, I wish they would particularly regard what I have said to you on this Occasion.  I have written in Haste & must break off abruptly.  Adieu. S A [P.S.] Pray let Mrs A know that I am well and am disappointed in not hearing from her by the last post.  ""

We desire you will purchase without delay 18000 Barrels flour in Virginia or if necessary in Maryland for the use of the French Squadron and collect the same quickly as possible, and Store it at such place in Virginia as the Governor and Council of that State Shall advise will best answer the purpose of speedy delivery to the Squadron when it is called for, and avoid at the same time danger from the enemy and interruption from the frost.(1)  We are sir, Your very Hble servants  P.S.

It should be so placed as to be taken off with the greatest facility by the fleet, yet care should be taken against surprize from the enemy and delay from the frost.

Such of the Contents as now require reply shall be annswd. & the rest passed over in Silence. The first of these letters advises the unloading of the Henrietta; the damage of some goods and the pains you had taken to recover them, which was very obliging & Merits thanks The freight of the Three Friends I got Settled with the Commercial Committee & Remitted the same to Mr Williams.  Your second letter advises the unloading of the Three Friends & enclosed Mr. Richd Browns draft on me in your favour which is at your Credit. Your favour of the 25th May mentions the circumstances of the Brigt. Fame by which it appears the former Owners were excluded from any benefit of Recapture & we must be content thanking you for your trouble in the inquiry. You Congratulate me on my return to this City in yours of the 30 July & add many obliging wishes for which I am not ungratefull; nor unmindfull of your hint to endeavour at making up by Trade the losses I sustained by the destructive hands of the Enemy & in this View I have lately extended my Concerns considerably. I note by your letter of 13th August, that you had sold Mr Ross's Salt at 30/ per bushl. paya. in Jany, this last part of the bargain I think a bad one, because the Trade is chiefly carried on now a days with ready Money, on Acct of the depreciation, however we must be Content. You'l please to furnish me with Acct Sales thereof soon as you can conveniently. You have omitted to Send me a Receipt for the Muskets out of the Three Friends delivered to the Order of the Board of War and it will be a necessary Voucher to my Accounts. By your favour of the 26 August I am in hopes the Henrietta sailed the next day and that she went clear of the British Fleet. I wish you had mentioned the Captain's Name as I do not know it.  It will afford me great pleasure to hear of your Sons returning safe home from Rhode Island & sorry I am that he had not an opportunity of rejoicing in the Success of his exertions in that expedition, but it was not practicable to carry the place after the departure of the French Fleet & there seems a necessity for the Count D'Estaings doing as he did, so that we must rest content and look forward to other events that may be more fortunate.  I have not seen Capt. M. nor heard any thing of the reports you mention, this you may depend, that if any such come to my ears I shall not be backward in your justification.  SEPTEMBER 14, 1778  Thank you for the Account of the engagement between the French 74 & English 64 Gun Ship, the former seems to have suffered a heavy loss in Men but I am glad she proved & maintained her superiority.  We are taking public measures to Supply the French fleet with Provisions and I hope they will be successful. I have been well employed in Committees on this & other business since joining Congress, so that altho I got myself clear of the Standing Boards it makes little difference as nearly the whole of my time is taken from me & I never shall be master of it untill I get quite clear of Public business, which I do most Ardently long for. Pray give my best respects to my Worthy Friend Mr Hancock & tell him I hope he will come back by the end of next month & be ready to fill that Chair he before filled with so much Reputation & then my respect for it will again be as perfect as ever it was. We have a report that the British Fleet after shewing themselves off Your Light House, have departed again, I dont think they have received Reinforcements and without them, they cannot block up the Count D'Estaing.

  Sir, Philadelphia Sept 15th. 1778 The Delegates of the State wrote you a few days ago, that they had at last obtained a grant of the remaining 400,000 dollars to complete your draft for 500,000.(1) This was an object which on my arrival I had much at heart, to accomplish; fearing the General Assembly might have been induced to have disbanded the new raised Troops for want of money, or emitted Procl. money for the purpose of paying them off-neither of which was I hope done. Had our state been represented in Congress at the time of Mr Blounts' arrival, I am well convinced the money would have been sent. I am happy to find Mr. Burke and Mr. Hill are appointed for a year, by that means I hope the state will not again meet with such usage.  Should your Excellency think proper to instruct your Delegates on matters relative to the state, especially such as may not occur to us; I should be happy. I find when Governors recommend any measure to the Delegates of their States, it generally has greater weight with Congress than when propositions are made by them, without any letter or instructions for such purpose.  As soon as the 400,000 dollars can be procured from the Treasurer I shall in conjunction with my Colleagues send it forward by some safe conveyance, in the most expeditious manner. I must take the liberty once more to press your Excellency to forward as speedily as possible the States account & vouchers. I am daily told that No. Carolina has received more money from the Continental Treasury in proportion, than any other state in the union. In vain do I tell them that we never had a Military Chest established in our State, or a Pay Master; that the expense of drawing out a considerable part of our Militia to quell a very dangerous Insurrection in the very heart of our Country; another very expensive Expedition against the Cherokees; the raising, paying, clothing and subsisting Ten Continental Battalions, for a considerable space of time, has been defrayed out of the Treasury of our State. To this they only answer why don't you produce your accounts? I wish this may be done, as I am confident the Continental Treasury must be largely indebted to us. I hope the gentlemen who are or may be appointed to state these demands, may be careful to procure every necessary voucher for the charges made against the Continent, which must be sent on with the Accounts. If your Excellency should in future think it necessary to establish a Military Chest, Pay Master, Commissary &c. you will be pleased to mention it to your Delegates. Perhaps it may be necessary, more especially should another requisition for men be made this winter against the Spring which may happen-should the Enemy be determined on another Campaign this is the opinion of some.  By the Newspapers enclosed you will find Genl Sullivan on the  SEPTEMBER 15, 1778  29th August gave the Enemy a severe check on Rhode Island before his retreat. This enabled him to cross to the main with all his baggage & stores without molestation. The French Fleet are in Boston harbor and Lord Howe with a Superior Fleet having been lately joined by 6 or 8 sail of the line, being a part of Admr. Byrons Squadron, are cruising off that place. We are told another fleet is hourly expected to reinforce the Count De Estaing. I wish they may not be intercepted by Lord Howe, before a junction is formed with the Count.  If I can persuade Mr Burke or Mr Hill to relieve me, my intention is to return home before the winter sets in too severe. I am with great respect, Your Excellency's most Ob. huml. Servt.  Cornl. Harnett P.S. A very great noise has been made in Congress by the Virginia Delegates relative to a Cap Harper driven into Curretuck by Goutrage. And an attempt is now making to recommend to the state to rriake restitution to Virginia, this matter has been pushed much by the Virginia Delegates, and altho' they have been assisted by the Gentlemen from New York &c. they have hitherto failed in their attempt. I hope your Excellency will enquire into the matter, and see that the persons who took the vessel out of the Inlet be brought to punishment. The Bill of Costs of the Court of his Excellency's Admiralty is exorbitant. More of this in my next.(2)  Genl. Sullivan acquaints Congress that by Accounts received by Deserters, but which is more to be depended on Accounts from persons on Rhode Island, The Enemy had 1061 killed & wounded in the late Action, 321 of which were killed and mortally wounded on the field. This seems to account for the Enemy's suffering our Army to make good their retreat, with all their Stores and baggage, without molestation-tho' equal in Numbers before the Action.  ""

  Dear Sir Septr the 15th. 1778. I should have done myself the pleasure of Answering your letter of July the 19th(1) several weeks ago, if I had not wished to have made a through enquiry after the workmen you want to Employ previous to my writeing to you on that Subject. Ben Randolph professes an Inclination to Accomodate you with an House joiner and tells me that he has been Constant in his researches after one since I informed him that his recommendation to me of a proper Character in that way would be rendering me an Agreable Service to you, but from his and other Accounts of the Scarcity of Skillful hands now following this Branch of Business and the Exorbitant prices prevalent in this City and its Vicinity, I would by no means advise you to depend on one from this Quarter. I cant hear of a Stone Cutter of any kind, the prisoner that I hoped to have Engaged for you who was a Master of this Trade being in Common with a Number of others moved from where I formerly heard of him to some other place of Confinement that I am not able [to] discover. It is possible that a number of the Convention prisoners may be sent to Virginia this Fall or Winter. If so probably some Tradesmen of the Professions you want may be found amongst them and procur'd. Whilst I stay here I shall still Continue to look out for the person you want and shall never Consider a triffling Enquiry in this Way a trouble even for a Stranger and much less so for a man to whom I acknowledge myself in many Instances most Sensibly and highly Oblidged. Haveing sent the papers Regularly to my wife since I have been here I expect their Contents have been Usually Desiminated through the Neighborhood wherefore I Conjecture a Circumstantial Account of the Action on the 28th Ultimo at Newport with the timely Regular and well Conducted Retreat of General Sullivan  SEPTEMBER 15, 1778  from Rode Island has either Struck your Eye or Ear. A Letter received last Evening from that General makes the Enemys loss in Kill'd and wounded in the Action (above) amount to upwards of One thousand men. The Hurry and Bustle of the Enemy in New York Indicates a Movement some where. General Washington Conjectures to the Eastward and therefore designs very soon to break up his Camp at White Plains, posting his Army on Ground more Advantageous for covering our Works on the North River and Counteracting their measures in the New England States. A Marauding Division of the Enemys Light Infantry and Dragoons have made a Descent from Newport on the Massachusets, Burnt many Valuable Houses in their Route and destroyed a Magazine of Considerable Consequence at Bedford in that State.  It is reported by pretty good Authority that ten 74 Gun Ships of Byrons Squadron has lately join'd Admiral Howe which Combined fleet now Hover about Boston Harbour. Upon the Appearance of this formadable force the Count D'Estaigne Stationd his Ships except those which are Damaged in Nantucket Road and Erected Batteries on George Island which Command the Entrance and Afford a Cross fire to the Ships which will render it extremely difficult, if possible, for a fleet greatly Superior in force to Enter. However I acknowledge I rather Consider the Count at present in a perilous Situation, but hope that the Brest fleets Arrival will again make him Out Number the Enemy.  I have Spoken at least a Dozen times to Dunlap relative to his account against the Albemarle Subscribers for his paper. He has not yet render'd it in. I will certainly Settle it before I leave this City. I intended to have been at the October General Court Early in the Session, but there is such a Strange Remissness in our Delegates if I leave Congress now, our State will be unrepresented at a time two when Business of the Utmost Consequence to us particularly is in Agitation. I must therefore Sacrifice My own private Interests to a publick Duty. The Moment F Lee or Mr. Smith arrive I quit this place I hope for ever.(2) Adieu, Jno.

  My Dear Sir 15th September [1778] I had the pleasure of writing to you the 10th Instant by Mr. Frisch, a chance opportunity, this will go by such another-a Mr. Whitney, his short notice, and the extreme long sittings of Congress afford me very few minutes for paying my respects to private friends.  Inclosed with this you will find a Character of Joshua Brown, said to be imprisoned in Ninety six Goal, I intreat you Sir, interest yourself as speedily as possible in this Mans case, and if it may be done without offence to the laws of the Land obtain his enlargement and supply him on my Account with such Money as may be needful to help his return to Philadelphia. I need say no more on this occasion, you will take every necessary step for relieving a Man from suffering, if it has been brought on him from mistake of his Person, Principles or Conduct.  The Subscribers to this Paper are all Quakers. There have been several little Addresses from these People to me which indicate a desire to be reconciled to the present ruling Powers-and one of a very extraordinary extent to Mr Gerard which the Minister detailed to me last night strengthens my belief-I have promised one of the principal Persons of the Society a meeting for conferring on subjects which we have barely sketch'd, I am to point the time, but when shall I have leisure?  There are now strong Prognostics of an evacuation of New York by the Enemy, none stronger in my Mind than the advance which these friends are making. They have always been in the Secrets of the opposite Party, having Emmisaries in each, and I am persuaded their Religious Principles will lead them to abide with the strongest, provided they may do so in Peace and free from persecution. The  SEPTEMBER 15, 1778  Policy of America will be to retain them after Independence is established in the enjoyment of all their ancient priviledges.  The Newspapers which you will receive under this cover together with Extracts of Letters from General Washington, General Heath, General Sullivan and Colonel Laurens will inform you the present Intelligence. I have not time to comment-Lord Howe's leaving Boston Bay and appearing off Rhode Island is the only inexplicable Manouvre-a few days will clear up doubts.  I have long predicted what has happened at Bedford,(1) and I dread such a stroke every hour in this River, the Enemy's great policy is to ruin our navigation, and here have we been sitting near three Months, and nothing done to prevent four frigates from destroying every ship and other Vessel accumulated at the Wharves of this City and laying the Town in ashes or under contribution of Money or Members of Congress.  Be so good as to communicate the inclosed intelligence to His Excellency the President, the late President, and other friends and all of it that is proper to the Public.  My thoughts are to return to my own Country early in November, but I am staggered when Mr. Matthews tells me that he must absolutely go home in that Month-the remaining Representation will not be competent, for if one happens to be sick or absent, you will have no Vote.  Mr. Whitney calls and presses to be discharged. Present me as usual to all friends, and believe me to be, With the utmost Regard &c.  [P.S.] Mr. F. Kinlock lately from New York brought me a Message from Mr. R. Williams whom he left 5 days ago in that City-Mr. Williams, and several other late Inhabitants of So. Carolina and Georgia were attempting a Voyage to Charlestown under a Flag of Truce, tis probable therefore you will soon see them.  ""

When you have occasion for Money, draw on me without apology and your Bills shall be honored, or, if it suits you better, I will transmit the sum necessary, by such hand as you shall direct.

I have not receiv'd or seen a Letter for you since our departure an Express Messenger from Charlestown has been some days due to me, I expect every day his appearance; depend upon it, Sir, if he imposts any dispatches for you, they shall be immediately forwarded, and now that I know where to address, you may expect to receive from me the Carolina Gazettes when such come to my hands.

  My dear Brother, Philadela. 16th Septr. 1778 This will be delivered you by the Baron Arand who has served some time in our Army, and who now returns to France, with leave, on account of his health.(1) Your two letters of July the 3d. & March 2d. came to my hands two days ago. Where the latter has so long SEPTEMBER 16, 1778  been, I do not know. I shall observe the caution contained in the former, and give Loudon (2) the same. I do not know that we have erred in this way upon any occasions of consequence. I must here repeat my former advice, not to use the book cypher you have hitherto done, unless where you have reason to suppose the Bearer of the letter will deliver it himself. It may be good against his curiosity, but not against that of many others who by Carmichaels treachery have got possession of the key to this mode of corresponding. You were not mistaken in the union you supposed would be formed here between Carmichael & {Deane}.(3) They go hand in hand & are closely allied in forming {faction}-Nor have they been unsuccessful in their wicked labors-But I trust, not in a manner to avail them much, or to {injure} you. The {scheme} is not yet completely opened, but before we part with {Deane}, we shall endeavor to get as much truth out, as will save the public from injury. I wish we had all the evidence on your side-But Mr. Stephenson is alone here,(4) and we must call for his evidence to fix Carmichaels charges against {Deane} when the former was at Nantes. The necessity of immediately appointing a {plenipotentiary} for our {ally} has occasioned a vote for the {Doctor},(5) and his credentials & instructions will soon be sent. In a few days the other {Courts} will be determined on- {You} and our {brother}(6) I think will not be {shaken}, but I assure you that envy, selfishness, and {Deane's} arts have created a strange spirit among many, and will require on your parts great wisdom and much {caution} in all your {conduct} and {correspondence}. The {Doctor} is as I always thought him, I am not in the least disappointed or informed by any thing {immoral}(7) that I hear of him. We do not know he has {written} any thing against {you} but I strongly {suspect} it from the conduct of some Men. However, virtue will prevail over vice in the end if tolerable prudence support the former. The {Doctor} is {old} and must soon be {called} to {account} for his {misdeeds}; therefore {bear} with him, if possible. In order to provide for {Deane} I suppose, it has been proposed to have a {consul} {general} in France, but this I think will never prevail. {One} in each {port} of consequence, and appointed by {Congress} the public good demands, and this will probably be done.  But {Deane's} pride nor avarice will let him in here. I wish our brother may succeed in either of his missions-I fear he will in neither until these Courts have taken decided parts with regard to their contemplated war. The arrival of Byrons Squadron has given the enemy superiority at Sea over our friends, but we hope it will not long continue so. The Count is at present refitting safely in Boston from his damage in the Storm where he will soon be ready. The English fleet has been off that harbor but are now off Rhode Island. The movements in New York denote an intention soon to abandon that   place, I suppose to strengthen Canada, Hallifax & the West Indies. Our accounts are now very good that the enemy lost between 12 & 1500 killed & wounded in the late battle where they were defeated on Rhode Island. I pray you my dear brother not to keep Ludwell (8) a moment longer than it is convenient for you. A well grounded knowledge of eloquence, Civil & natural law will fit him for pursuing in Virginia the study of the laws of Engd. & his own Country. Besides, the justice I owe my other children will not allow very great partiality in expence on any one or two. Yet I would not withhold what may be necessary for good foundations. But my income is chiefly paper money, and that you know will not reimburse you in Europe or serve my Sons there. Can you contrive the contents of this letter to William, I know not whether to address him at Vienna or Berlin. The Bark you kindly sent me has been of great service to me, but I shall want more next year, therefore pray send me some, if possible, directly to Virginia. I shall be glad of any valuable new publications whether in France or England.  Not being forewarned at the time, and it being so long since Sim. Deane's arrival that I cannot recollect all the letters you sent me a list of-I did receive several by him, but I do not remember those for Owen or Pringle. I believe the rest came.

The first proper person going to Camp shall be the Bearer of Money, and probably a Piece of Linnen.

Your friend F. Kinloch will probably salute you in Camp this day sinnight, another friend of yours R. Berresford is in New York.2 I hope to obtain permission for his coming here in a few days, this indeed should have been done four days ago, but Mr. Kinloch had omitted till last evening to deliver me a message from Mr. Berresford.

As I always make the best of every Misshap, I think we ought to conclude that the Events at Newport will prevent too much of our Independence being attributed to the Arrival of the allied Fleet on our Coasts.  It is reported here that War is declared in the West Indies by the French. The Print of Tomorrow will have the Accounts, if it is authentic.

I suppose you feel confirmed in your Winter's Opinion that New England would have the main Struggle of this Campaign. But, the Period for much Business is too far over.

  My Dear Sir Philada. Septr. 18th. 1778 I heard with great Satisfaction of your joining, as a Volunteer, the army at Rhode Island and was sanguine in my hopes & expectations SEPTEMBER 18, 1778  that Mars wou'd have been propitious and sent you home crowned with Laurels. The brave & virtuous know how to deserve Success and altho they cannot command it when they please, yet the appointed hour will come when Merit must have its reward. It may be wise not to enquire into the causes that operated the failure of that expedition, but look forward & try to get rid of these troublesome Enemies, that teaze & harrass us from one end of the Continent to the other. I hope they will not dare, to undertake an Expedition against Boston, or if they do, my firm perswasion is that they will smart severely for it, but the situation of the British affairs in general is such, that I cannot help thinking they must quit the United States very soon, in order to take care of those territories they have some title to. I shall not venture to write You on any Political matters because I hope it will not be long before I see you here again in time to fill that Seat again which you so well grace. This will be delivered You by my Friend John Holker Esqr whom you are already acquainted with, but unless you have an intimacy you know not half his Virtues. I have had an opportunity of seeing & knowing a great deal of him and am convinced he is a Man of the right sort as such I recommend him and at the same time I must go a little further with you on his behalf, he goes to Boston to assist Count D'Estaing & may probably have occasion for very considerable Sums of Money. I must beg of You therefore if it becomes necessary to assist in accomodating him, I shall pay whatever bills he draws on me and if the Sums wanted are very large Congress will no doubt make him the needfull payments or advances towards the discharge of the Public debts in France, indeed they will be glad to make payment in this way and consequently you will see that yourself & Friends cannot Run any Risque in accomodating Mr Holker.(1)  I beg my Compliments to Mrs. Hancock in which Mrs. Morris joins & with the Warmest Wishes for your Felicity I remain, My Dear Sir, Your affectionate Friend & Obed Hble Servt,  Robt Morris ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Sepr. 19th. 1778 It is long since I had the Pleasure of your Favour of the 2d. of June. I had thought of pleading some Excuses for my Delay, but upon the whole, it is the shortest Way at least, to plead guilty and throw myself upon the Mercy of the Court.  I find there has been some Difference in Opinion upon the Resolution of Congress you refer to. The most prevailing I believe has been against Your Construction of it. Upon the present Instance however, I should readily concur in giving up the Contl. share to SEPTEMBER 19,1778  Photographic reproduction of Finance Report, September 19, 1778 SEPTEMBER 19, 1778  the Merits of the Captors; I cannot presume however what will be the Sentiments of the Court, or of Congress. Not knowing whether the Resolution of Congress respecting the allowance to be made the Court appointed to inquire into the Causes of the failure of the Expedition against Rhode Island was ever transmitted to you, I enclose it to you (1)-By which it appears we are referred to the Dep Paymaster Genl. in the Eastern Department. I mean to exhibit my Account for my Services only, noting that I have already recd. my Expences. And I mean to charge the same per Day as was allowed me by the State at that Time as a Delegate in Congress, viz five Dollars. I have also sent a like Copy to Mr. Ellsworth. He is expected here in a few Days. Nor are we without Hopes of seeing You this Fall.  Before this I dare say you have heard of the Fate of Stateing Bills or Regulations of Prices. They all fell to the Ground-Thus you may see the Weight & Influence of Monopolizers & Extortioners. The Necessity of such Acts I early foresaw, and also the present Consequences from the non-complyance with Them. But some great State Polliticians will spin their Thread till it breaks. Had those Acts been carried into Execution-Millions would have saved-The Credit of the Money mainly supported, at least as far as further Emissions have tended to sink it.  I entirely agree with you Sir, that we have had & still have more to fear from the Decay of publick & private Virtue, than from the Arms of Britain, With any possible Aids she might procure. This is an Evil that not only Congress, but every Legislature, ought immediately with Might & Main to pay their Attention to.  America would have had Peace before this Day had she deserved it; and I wish to God she was as ready for the Blessing, as Heaven is to grant it. It is to Miracles we are to ascribe Our present Situation-But appearances which strike with Wonder and astonishment all Europe, are scarcely noticed by two many amongst ourselves. They Expect that Congress and Washington, have some magick Wand, to raise, feed & cloath Armies with.  However that be, tis certain, that Thousands of vile Extortioners and devilish monopolizers rise up with more magick Acts & Spells to counteract every Attempt to give Strength and Vigour to our Arms and Accomplish the Blessings of Peace, Liberty and Independence. To such Men as those, Tories are virtuous Men, and Britons & Hessians less unnatural.  I lament Sir the Failure of the Expedition agt. Rhode Island. I rejoice however that the Arms of America far from being sullied, have reaped Glory & Honor in the Attempt. I resolve the Misfortune into the just Providence of God. Again I say Heaven knows we were not under proper Habits and Temper of Mind to receive the fulfillment of the Blessings, which yet I trust are reserved for this Land. I hope Time & Reflection will put the most candid construction upon the   Conduct of the Count De Staing. We may not Doubt of His Honor & Integrity-much less of the strongest Assurances we have of the Friendship of his Royal Master. I have not Room to add, unless I tire you with a new Sheet.

6086,dg010595,1778,Gouverneur Morris to the Earl of Carlisle,"""Gouverneur Morris to the Earl of Carlisle
  [September 19, 1778] To his Excellency the Earl of CARLISLE. MY LORD, THROUGH the medium of a news-paper, I see a declaration and requisition, signed by yourself and your brethren Clinton and Eden, together with an apologetic Epistle from Governor Johnstone.(1) As these papers are transmitted by your Secretary, and reflect light upon each other, your Lordship will excuse a few animadversions on them addressed to you. My intention is, to undeceive you in some matters you seem to have mistaken, and to state the true ground on which you stand with respect to America.(2) This I attempt from a sincere desire of peace; considering it as a blessing, the loss of which can never be compensated by the splendors of victory.  Your first error, a leading one, which hath tinged the complexion of all your national acts since the early commencement of the controversy, is a supposition that Congress do not speak the sense of the people of America. Of all the people they do not, but of a considerable majority they certainly d o. Considerable for the numbers, property, principles, temper and character of those who compose it.  The number, according to my best estimation, is at least two thirds of the whole; and the remaining third are of very little political consideration. They consist of a few who adhere to you from principle, a few more from interest, and a very few (now) from fear, as Indians worship the Devil. The remainder are attached to no side, unless indeed they could discover with absolute certainty which is the strongest side, being, as they term it moderate men. Add to this, that your American friends, from their religious notions and other circumstances, are generally averse to war.  The majority are further considerable from their property. It is by no means a figurative expression to say that the land of America is SEPTEMBER 19, 1778  against you. This may seem extraordinary after what you have heard, especially if you have had the honor of a conversation with some of those traders who have lately, taken it into their heads to call themselves the Gentlemen of America. But if your Lordship will condescend to enquire for the ten greatest landholders of the state of New-York on the whig side of the question, you will find that no forty tories throughout the whole Continent have an equal property; considered as to the extent, the fertility, or the value in coin.  The principles of your opponents are republican, some indeed aristocratic; the greater part democratic, but all opposed to Kings, from a thorough conviction by reason, by history, and above both by experience, that nine times in ten they are the scourges of mankind.(3)  The temper of this majority is not only vigilant and irascible, but much roused and exasperated. Exasperated by the injustice, the treachery, the cruelty of Great-Britain. Respect, my Lord, for your feelings forbids that odious detail which justifies these charges.(4) Should you doubt, ask Sir Henry. Ask the officers in your regiments and on board your ships. Let them paint the violations, the burnings, the massacres, the starvings they have been witness to. And if this evidence is insufficient, invocable the manes of those wretches who died at Philadelphia in the paroxisms of madness and despair, from reflecting on the horrors they themselves had executed.(5)  Lastly, the character of those who compose the majority in America is of no small importance. Many of them are the most respectable members of the community; others again are distinguished by superior talents; and a great number are of that aspiring cast who look on high, and will neither be thrown out in pursuit of their favourite objects, nor dropped into insignificancy. To these things, I add the perseverance of the lower class in a cause which they think, with me, is just and righteous. At the Valley-Forge I was an eye witness to the sufferings of our soldiery: Many of them lay literally on the earth naked without fire and without food. It is to their honor that they did not mutiny; that they did not desert; that they did not even complain. The sentiment expressed by these brave citizens was, \""We know every measure is taken to relieve our wants, and if we are distressed, it is because distress is unavoidable.\"" Of such a majority, my Lord, the sense is spoken by Congress. To convince you of it, look at their publications; see how frequently, how fully, how directly they appeal to the people. Can you lay your finger on any falsehood sanctioned by their authority ? Have they ever descended to meanness or artifice to cajole or to deceive their constituents or even their enemies7 I know that your Gazetteers have charged all these things upon them; but, my Lord, I can hardly suppose that you was sent hither to read or to write news-papers.(6)  A second error which hath affected your national conduct, is an  opinion that Congress lead the people. The direct contrary is so much a fact, that the business of Congress is, in a great measure, to discover the sentiment of the people and clothe it in words. Whenever any step is to be taken, they ask, what is the opinion of the people? For should they go beyond the ground on which they are supported by popular favour, that instant their power is at an end. To prove this further, I ask if the people have ever refused obedience to the matters proposed by Congress? Have the accumulated distresses of the present war, distresses almost beyond example, prevailed on them to desert their Congress? Nay, have all your efforts impaired the credit of our continental money, resting, as it did, merely on the public opinion and confidence in Congress?  An error of another kind appears in the papers now before me. From them it is manifest that you really misinterpret the language, and mistake the meaning of Congress. You seem to suppose, that when they declared it incompatible with their honor to hold intercourse with George Johnstone, especially to negociate with him upon affairs in which the cause of liberty and virtue is interested, they indirectly receded from their determination to have nothing to say to any of you till you sent away your fleets and armies, or acknowledged the Independence of America.(7) It is a maxim, rny Lord, that a positive act cannot be repealed by implication. The plain language of the resolution, therefore, is this, \""Perhaps the British Commissioners may have collateral matters to urge, such as the exchange of prisoners, &c. If he who hath insolently tendered bribes to us should join in any application of this sort,(8) we cannot listen to it. Let us therefore give our enemies a timely notice, that they may square their conduct accordingly. Let us not leave them the shadow of a reason to charge us with any disingenuous procedure.\""  From the best information, I take on me to assure your Lordship, that not the remotest idea was entertained of departing from their resolutions. The candour which dictated this last determination, is entitled to a very different language from what it hath met with. But since the conduct of Congress is stigmatized with the charge of duplicity, it may not be improper to shew the entire consistency of that Body, notwithstanding the many changes it hath undergone of the individuals. This will corroborate my former position, that they are simply the mouth of a people steadily attached to, and determined to support their rights and liberties.  The declaration of Independence will form a principal part of the present question. But, though much hath been, and much more may be speculated on the right of a people to become independent, it will perhaps ultimately turn on their power. You yourselves tender to Congress every thing they may ask short of a total separation of interests: Therefore, you offer to confine the union simply to the person of the Prince. Supposing it accepted, then without enquiring  whether Americans might afterwards choose a King for themselves, clearly the English might, or else as clearly their now King is an usurper. If the people of Britain should exercise this right, then America continuing under her old King, would be independent. But a contract which one party can break, and the other cannot, is void; and therefore America could of right break the bargain as well as Great Britain; and therefore either party might at pleasure be independent of the other. And if America could of right declare herself independent after the agreement, certainly she could before. But further; from your own shewing, we are not subjects of the Parliament: If subjects therefore, we are subjects of the King. Again, it is agreed that if we do not like a King, we can send him away and take another in his stead, for our fathers did so before us. Therefore, as the greater contains within it the lesser, so we could do just one half of the proposition, viz. get rid of one King without getting another; and this is precisely what we have done. Take it lastly as a question of force, and then we fight to determine the moot point of which side are rebels. So much for the right to Independence.  In the commencement of this controversy, Congress prayed to be placed in the situation of sixty-three. This was practicable at that time, for nothing more was necessary than on your part to repeal the impolitic acts you had passed. You refused; they pressed it earnestly. For tho' the situation of sixty three was not very eligible, yet, as the event of war was uncertain, and the costs and the miseries but too certain, it was prudent and right to urge this request. Still you refused and appealed to the sword, and prosecuted and persecuted us to obtain what you now acknowledge you had no right to ask. Thus then were we plunged into a war against our inclinations, and of consequence could not be bound by any offer made with a view to avoid it. Besides, the situation of sixty three was no longer attainable: For, though the paper acts of your Parliament could have been repealed, yet the bloody acts of your soldiery could not. You could not pour back into the veins of our citizens the blood you had wantonly spilt. Previous to the year sixty three, points which should always have remained in oblivion, had never been started. But the question of supremacy once made in the rude language of arms, a decided line of authority and subjection became necessary to a future union. Desirous of avoiding the further calamities of war, we intreated you to pursue the measures necessary for reconciliation. This you refused, pertinaciously adhering to your first postulatum of unconditional submission, and with a view to the great object of solid revenue. You therefore urged the war, and applied to every little Prince in Europe for troops: We deprecated it, and did not even seek an alliance with any foreign power, knowing well that such alliance would close the door of reconciliation forever with all the bars of national faith and honor.   The situation of America was at length such by your obstinacy, that the evils Congress laboured to avoid were to become certain. At the same time it was a decided fact, that the interests of England and of America were directly opposed to each other. It was your interest to restrict our commerce, and it was our interest to extend it: It was your interest to take our money, and it was our interest to keep it. In a word, it was your interest to tyrannize, and it was our interest to be free. We therefore could not trust you, and you would not trust us. The King and his Ministers no body would trust. So that a re-union became every day more problematical.  The great fleets and armies you had employed, and the pains you had taken to deprive us of all military stores, obliged us to seek foreign aid, and it was clear that no Prince would assist us while we acknowledged ourselves to be rebels. Thus it was certain that we should experience the horrors of war, notwithstanding we had offered a part of our rights to avoid them. It was highly probable that without help we should be conquered. The object of reconciliation was distant and precarious at best, and by no means worth the blood and treasure necessary to attain it; and therefore, the people of America, through their Congress, declared themselves free and independent, as the only mode left to obtain their great end of peace, liberty and safety.  The war continued, and success seemed to be yours. Swoln with the hopes of conquest, you disclaimed every thing which looked like concession. At length the fate of the brave unfortunate Burgoyne recalled you to your senses: You sent to Congress the draft of your conciliatory bills. They, at that time, knew nothing of what their Commissioners had done in Europe. They saw, however, that your concessions proceeded from weakness, and were dictated by necessity. They knew your insincerity, and therefore wisely determined to have nothing to say to you till you acknowledged our independence, or withdrew your forces. Between this period and your Lordship's arrival, Congress received a copy of the treaties with his Most Christian Majesty. In answer to your letters therefore, they informed you, that after you had complied with the alternative just now mentioned, they would consent to a treaty with your Prince, not inconsistent with those already entered into. At length a war hath broken out between your sovereign and France, which, if I am rightly informed, will again alter the situation of affairs as far as they relate to negociation. From this detail your Lordship will perceive that the most perfect consistency hath been maintained on our part. We have acted from a conviction of your force and your violence, of your weakness and your insincerity.(9)  I come now to a matter of some delicacy, which I shall nevertheless, treat with freedom, and hope your Lordship's pardon for the unpolished terms of a republican. In your declaration you state a  series of facts (as you call your assertions) to shew the insincerity of France. My Lord, you are deceived, or you mean to deceive; for the assertions you make are not founded in truth. Not only so, but you grossly mistake our disposition; for were every thing you say admitted, it would not produce the effect you wish for. You say, it is well known to the whole Continent of America, that public intimation of the conciliatory propositions was given in November last-Permit me to undeceive your Lordship. The direct contrary of what you say is perfectly well known to the people of America; and further, they know your Ministers breathed nothing but conquest and war at that period. You say, it is equally well known that the preliminaries of a French treaty, sent by Mr. Simeon Deane, did not bear date earlier than the sixteenth of December. The people of America do not enquire into such trifling circumstances. It is very immaterial to us when Mr. Simeon Deane went to sea, or why he put back, or when he came out again: If these things had been of consequence, we know that (10) Congress would have published them. One thing, however, is very clear to me, that you know not when those preliminaries, as you call them, were dated, nor indeed any thing about them. Let me ask one question: Are you certain, my Lord, that when Mr. Simeon Deane first sailed he had any papers whatever with him? You suppose that difficulties arose in the negotiation with France, for want of power in the American Commissioners. No such thing my Lord; they had powers as ample as they could wish. Our Congress know better than to send their servants on a fool's errand. Perhaps your Lordship may find it convenient to recommend their example by the old adage of fas est et ab hoste doceri.(11) You roundly assert, that the conciliatory propositions were a subject of discussion in all the debates upon the state of the nation from the twentieth of January. Those your Lordship will revise, and correct that sentence, before the next edition of your declaration. A reputation for veracity may be of service to you at some time or other. You assert also, that no treaties were sent from France before the eight of March: Your Lordship's intelligence is not to be depended on. From better evidence I assure you, that dispatches containing the treaties were sent by the way of Corunna much earlier. The gentleman who brought them left Paris immediately on conclusion of the treaty which by the bye is not antidated.  I have said above, that the affair of Saratoga determined your conduct; I mean, my Lord, that it opened the scene of American politics at St. James's, at Versailles, through-out all Europe. You have laboured to prove that France did not act from motives of Generosity but of interest. You have failed; but I will admit the conclusion though I deny the premises; and then I add, that if she had consulted any thing besides her interest, America would by no means have   been pleased with the alliance. The generosity of statesmen, my Lord, is but another name for caprice, and we wish no connection with the capricious. It is the interest of France to be allied to America; it is the interest of America to be allied to France. The rulers of the two nations see their interest and pursue it. What more can be desired? Did you expect, when you told the Congress a long story about reviving free intercourse and mutual affection, with other the airy forms, ideal nothings, to which you had given a local habitation and a name; did you suppose them such coxcombs as to pay the least attention (12) unless, at the same time, you could convince them it was their interest? No, you did not. Your conduct shews you did not. Unfortunately you applied to the private interest of the Members, instead of the general interests of their constituents. We wish to be at peace with all the world, and therefore we will make peace with you when you are properly authorized to speak, and have proper terms to offer. In the mean time, if you like fighting better, why we will fight with you.  My Lord, you are come hither for the very modest purpose of persuading a free and independent nation to surrender their rights and privileges: You are confessedly incompetent to the business of subduing them and are therefore to proceed by what you call reasoning. Now, as public addresses are not always the most clear and intelligible compositions, in order to simplify the matter, I will suppose you in conference with such an honest farmer as myself: You ask me to become a subject of the King of Great Britain; and what shall I get by that? Security of your person and property. My person and property are secure already. He will make laws for you and govern you. I had much rather make laws for myself and govern myself. But he will regulate your trade. Pray what is that? Why he will tell you where your ships SHALL go, and where they shall NOT go, and what they SHALL carry, and what they shall NOT carry. But I had rather our merchants should send their ships where and with what cargoes they please; I fancy they know as much of trade as your King, and how to get the best prices and the cheapest goods. Aye, aye, but this is for the sake of a union of force, and for the interests of the whole British empire. My good friend, the force of America is already united, and I have nothing to do with the British empire. Yes, you have; for unless you comply with these terms, the King of England will conquer you. I do not think he is able. He will try however; and therefore, if you do not instantly submit your person and property to his disposal, you are answerable to Heaven for all the miseries of the war he shall carry on for that purpose. I do not believe a syllable of the matter. I wish your King would mind his own affairs, and not trouble other people. But if he will send armies hither to fight, we must e'en fight. And so I wish your Lordship a good morning. I  am, my Lord, with the most profound veneration, Your Lordships most obedient, and most humble servant,  AN AMERICAN (13) Reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet, and Daily Advertiser, September 19 1778.

  My Dear Sir, Philada Sept 21, 1778 I beg you not to impute my omitting hitherto to acknowledge your Favor of the 4th of July to Negligence.(1) I have frequently thought of its Contents; and although I was not able to obtain what you wishd for, I think you will not doubt my Sincerity when I assure you that whenever it shall be in my Power to render you substantial Service I shall do it with the utmost Cheerfulness. It is the Opinion of Gentlemen here that the Appointment of Auctioneers to make Sale of such Prize goods as fall to the share of the Continent should be made by the Authority of the particular States where such Goods may be forfeited.  Your Letter was delivered to me by Capt Manly. I am informed by some of my Boston Friends that he speaks of me with a Degree of Bitterness, supposing that I prevented his having another Ship. This gives me not the least Disquietude. He may have been taught to believe it, by Persons who care but little for him and less for the Honor of our Navy or the great Cause we are contending for. Neither he nor his Friends could be at a Loss for the true Cause of his Disappointment, if they would advert to the Judgment of the Court Martial which acquitted him with Honor. What a strange Inconsistency was there in that Court, in recommending Cap Manly for another Ship, and at the same Time holding up so great a Deficiency in his Conduct as the neglecting to prepare Signals for a Fleet under his Direction, and in general his Want of Experience. This was said by many; and it ought to be satisfactory to Cap Manly, that though I clearly saw the Justice of the Remark, I was silent. In this, it is possible, I was not altogether blameless. I have never felt my self disposed to take a Side in the Disputes which I understand have run high between Partizans of Manly & McNiel. I think Neither of them can derive much Honor from the Decisions of their respective Courts Martial. I wish for the Credit of our Country that both had behavd more to the Satisfaction of the Publick. One of them is still here. I suppose he is preparing to meet the Committee to whom his Petition is referrd. When it may be proper for me to speak my Mind his Friends & his Enemies may be assured I shall do it with Candor & Freedom. In doing this I expect to be justified, by sensible & honest Men. If I stand fair with them, you well know, how unsolicitous I am whether others are pleasd or not.  There is another Matter of greater Consequence which I wish to mention to you. I am informd there are Persons in Boston disposd to make a popular Clamor against the french Admiral for leaving Rhode Island. I cannot help remonstrating to my Friends against it as in a great Degree impolitick. Even if it should be thought he had taken a wrong step, it is our Wisdom at this Juncture to forbear SEPTEMBER 21, 1778  criminating him. The Tories will try their utmost to discredit our new Alliance. They cannot succeed but by making injudicious Whigs their Instruments. There are two things from which I am more apprehensive than I am from the joynt Efforts of all our Enemies, viz the intemperate and misplacd Zeal of our honest Friends, and an insatiable Desire in others who are called Friends to establish a Popularity in order to obtain the Splendor or Emoluments of Places, or that Vanity of Vanities the Breath of Applause.  Adieu my Friend, ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Septr 21st 1778. Your favor of the 5th inst is now before me. We have had all the particulars of the Rhode Island expedition transmitted to us by General Sullivan and have rec'd a letter or rather a folio book from Count d'Estaing in justification of his conduct.(1) I make no doubt he acted what he thought for the best and had it not been for the unlucky storm which it was impossible for him to foresee, it is very probable that it might have been for the best; nor do I think him so much to blame for going to Boston with his shattered fleet when he knew Admiral Byron's fleet might be hourly expected which joined to Lord Howe's fleet and all the troops at New York ready to be sent immediately to assist them might endanger the total destruction of the whole French Squadron. I hope great care will be taken not to throw too much blame on the French, and raise a misunderstanding between us and them in this early period of the Alliance, than which nothing could give our enemies greater pleasure. The Rhode Island expedition though not successful, yet brought no disgrace on our arms, nor have the enemy any great cause of boasting.  Our commercial, marine and treasury affairs are in a very bad Situation and will never be otherwise while they are managed by Committees of Congress who are many of them unacquainted with the business and are continually changing and by that time they begin to be acquainted with the business they quit, others come in who know nothing that has been done; thus we go on from time to time to the great loss of the public. But you will ask why don't you put those affairs in other hands to be conducted who may give their whole time to the business. There are several reasons-first we have not time to make the proper arrangements and form proper Systems  SEPTEMBER 21, 1778  for conducting the business; above Six weeks ago we ordered that Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in every week should be set apart for arranging the Treasury Board and for the affairs of Finances and nothing is yet completed;(2) so much business is daily crowding on Congress, and so much time taken up in doing business in so large a body of men a great number of whom are lawyers and who think proper to make a long speech or two on every question however trifling &c &c &c &c that I fear it will be a long time before proper systems will be formed and when that is done I fear we shall be as much put to it, to find proper men to fill those important departments who will lay by, all their own business and attend wholly to the public for years together and perhaps for life; they ought to be men of the first character for probity, integrity and attention to business, but such men can always find employment in a more private life, more to their ease and advantage.  Generals Whipple and Folsom I am informed are appointed to represent our State after the first of November. I hope they will be here by the last of October as I shall be glad to see them before I set out for home.  By accounts from the West Indies (which is credited here) we are told that France declared War against Britain the 8th of July and that it was proclaimed in Martinico the 15th of August.  I am Sir your friend and most obedient Servant,  Josiah Bartlett ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Septr. 22d. 1778. I Received your favour of the 19 July a few days ago & imbrace this opportunity by Capt. Arthur of answering it.  The conduct of the Court of Spain, I must confess appears to me very ambiguous. We have certain accounts of their flota's being safe arrived some time ago, we have got a list of their marine force, which is powerful & when united with that of France, will be by far too formidable to apprehend any danger from the British, in short they are in all respects, at this time as well prepared for a rupture, as that nation for some ages past ever has been, but still we have no open and positive declaration in our favour on their part. To be sure state policy is a Machine-the main springs of which are extreamly difficult to be develop'd & which of them are at this time, so far out of order, as to induce in them so long a suspension of the fair promises they have made, is to me (& I believe to C s) altogether impenetrable. They can have nothing to do, in the dispute between Germany & Prussia. Why Germany and Prussia have not as yet acknowledged our Independency is obvious. SEPTEMBER 22, 1778  You'll have heard 'ere this reaches you, of Clinton's late expedition to Bedford. These exhibitions of bonfires every now & then, I suppose he thinks will so captivate the hearts of the Americans, as soon to bring them to consent to a peace upon his own terms. A peace I would make with them to be sure, because it will be our present interest to have peace, for many cogent reasons. But I would see the whole nation at hell, before I would have any thing more to do with them, than barely to make peace. I would sooner enter into a treaty of Alliance with the Devil than I would with the King of Great Britain or any of his damn'd Crew. Whenever I am induced to forgive them for their last march through the Jerseys, it must be when, I am no longer capable of reflection. Such a pack of Hell hounds, I believe was never before let loose upon a distressed, innocent country. The theme is too painful to be dwel't upon.  Our Army are moving higher up the North river in order to oppose the penetration of the British army that way, should they attempt it. A part of the army under Gates is filing off towards the eastward. These movements are making to be in readiness to oppose the enemy in which ever quarter they may next bend their ravaging course. That they have some new expedition in contemplation, we have good reason to believe, as there are strong marks of their intention, soon to quit New York. The account here, of their destination is, that six regiments are to go to the West Indies, the remainder to Hallifax & Cannada. I believe it is more conjecture, than certainty. I fancy the arrival of their August packet from England will determine their next plan of operations.  By a Vessel arrived at Baltimore from Nantz a few days ago, there is an account, that the french fleet, had drove the British fleet into Portsmouth, & had compleatly block'd them up. This may be true, but there is one thing that appears misterious to me, which is, that Byrons squadron, should be permitted to sail for America, & no reinforcements sent to Count De Estaing, for they must be well apprised, that Howe's squadron, when joined by Byrons, must be far Superior to De Estaing, & in all probability without a timely reinforcement, he must fall a sacrifice. Happily for him this can not now be his fate, as he is so well secured in Boston harbour, but had Byrons squadron joined Howe, before De Estaing had had time to effect this security, his fate might have been the very reverse of what it now is. When I reflect on these great matters, I draw this consolation, that I find we are not the only blundering Polititians in the world.  Oh! my Worthy friend, never was Child more sick of a school, than I am, of this same business, I am sent here upon. I have frequently heard heavy complaints in our Assembly of the tedious progress of business, but I will venture to say, you do more business in one day than we do, in three. To be a Witness of this, & no prospect of amendment, when there is business of such magnitude before   us, every day's delay to the completion of which gives an almost fatal stab to the Interests of this Great Continent, I can assure you without exaggeration, frets me in such a manner, as frequently to deprive me of that indifferent share of health which I should otherwise enjoy. As far as my poor abilities extend I will never flinch from any duty that I may be called upon by my country to undertake but at the same time, I could wish to be placed in some station, where I could render some service. I fully intended when I came into Congress, to have accustomed my self to deliver my sentiments upon every important Question, but I have found the thirst for Chattering so extremely prevalent, that it absolutely disgusts me, & frequently seals my lips, least my conscience should upbraid me with the commission of that very Sin against our righteous cause that I see daily committed by others, Vizt. the loss of so much precious, irretrievable time, & I am affraid the day will shortly arrive when some men, will be made sensible, that all the future services they can render their Country can never compensate for the invaluable moments, nay hours, days, & months they have trifled away, in idle debate. For my own part I seldom speak, except it is a subject in which the State I belong to, is particularly interested, for I most commonly find some member or other, speak my sentiments, then when is the necessity of a repetition? I thank God, I am not Coxcomb enough to conceive, that my cloathing the same sentiments, in a different garb, can have greater influence over the minds of men, than the picture that has already been exhibited by my Neighbour. If any thing has been left unsaid by others, that has struck my mind, & which I think material why I throw it out in as few words as possible. If every member would observe this line of conduct, the business of the Great Public may be done, but whilst every member is so tenacious, & so cursedly conceited of his own rhetoric, it never can. I am affraid, my Dr Sir, you will think your old acquaintance, has of late grown very ambitious, thus to presume to lay down a rule for the Government of so Wise & August a body as this one of whom I have been speaking, & that Egotisms, of all things, are most peculiarly disgusting. I submit it all to your candour, & will most chearfully abide by your decision.  It is now a month ago since I moved the enclosed resolution, (1) but it has been postponed from time to time, & as I See the disposition of the house is decidedly not to comply with it I bear it with patience. I have done my duty.  I wait with anxious expectation for your answer to my request for leave to return home. I hope you will be kind enough to forward it to me, as soon as possible.  There are some parts of this letter that your good sense will point out to you as not proper to be communicated, except to a very few, to you, I write with unreservedness, well knowing you will make al-  lowances for my weaknesses, when others may think me an errant disclaimer & a conceited Coxcomb.

For certainly I was formed for the Sweets of private Life (i.e.) if Nature had any Thing in View at the Time.  I return to Politicks. We want as a proper Melange to our present Arrangement an intriguing industrious Body a Duane. If Schuyler and Duane should spend the Winter here with me I am convinced the most beneficial Effects would flow from it.

  Dear Sir 23d September [1778] Mr. Richard Beresford arrived at a late hour last night from New York and immediately called on me and delivered a verbal Message from Robert Williams Esquire.(1) Mr. Williams had been frequently in conversation with Governor Johnstone, at the last interview which happened on or about the SEPTEMBER 23, 1778  17th he discover'd, as he presumed, the design of the Enemy to detach part of their Squadron together with 10,000 Troops immediately after the Hurricane Season to South Carolina to land at Charlestown or at Port Royal, or both. Governor Johnstone intimated the Conquest would be easily made, and the acquisition extremely beneficial by annexing South Carolina and Georgia to Florida, he particularly enquired who were the leading Men in South Carolina and other minutia which I have communicated to my Colleagues and to Major Butler and whose advices will supply my deficiencies.(2)  Mr. Williams intreats me to avoid naming him as my informant, hence Mr. Beresford did not enter upon his disclosure until he had with great form shut the Parlour door.  The Idea of secret, in this case, is truly ridiculous. Mr Williams, Mr Hopton, Mr. Graham (3) and some others are going to Charlestown with a Flag of Truce.  I asked Mr Beresford upon what principle Sir Henry Clinton had permitted these Gentlemen to go over to the Rebels, he replied with a smile, \""a mark of extraordinary favor, certainly.\""  The announced enterprize is the most likely to succeed so far as to create a favorable diversion of any I can think of at this juncture of circumstances. It is the favorite Plan of General Grant and 'tis not improbable Sir Henry will be glad of an opportunity to recover the Honor he left in the Sands of Long Island.  Is it likely that Governor Johnstone would have communicated a design of such importance to Mr. Williams? How shall I account for Mr. Williams' betraying to me the confidence reposed in him. These are questions I have answered to my own satisfaction-and submit them to your Excellency. Mr. Williams is exceedingly cautious. I have received two Messages but no writing from him.  All that Governor Johnstone has said to Mr. Williams may have been calculated for amusement-at the same time his Flag may cover two or more Engineers in Frocks and Trowsers and other dangerous instruments in disguise. Your Excellency will be governed by your own judgment and the best advice respecting the admission of either the Vessel or any individual contained in it higher than five fathom hole or Cumings Point and admitting her arrival, whether she ought not to be detained, and the Officers and all their people belonging to her secured out of Charlestown.  I have written fully on this subject to His Excellency General Washington, and will have the honor of writing more fully than the present to your Excellency in two or three days.  I have ordered this Messenger Wilkinson to ride night and day, and hope he will be in Charlestown on the 8th of October and be returned as expeditiously as possible.   I have the honor to be, With the highest Esteem and Regard.  P.S. This instant I have received repeated intelligence by escaped Prisoners from New York that the Enemy have abandoned Rhode Island, but I rely not upon such Reports.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 23d September 1778 Mr. Richard Beresford, a Native of South Carolina a Young Gentleman of family, fortune and good Character who left New York on the 20th Instant called on me at a late hour last Night and delivered a verbal Message from Robert Williams Esquire another Native of that State, a very sensible Man, long a Practitioner in the Law, a respectable Character in general but not well affected to the Independence of the United States, more than cooly attached to his own private Interests, and I believe held by the British Ministry to be a fast, prudent friend to their Government.  In the last Conversation Mr. Williams held with Governor Johnstone at New York, he discovered, as he presumed, the design of the Enemy to detach part of their Squadron, together with 10,000 Troops immediately after the Hurricane Season to South Carolina to land either at or near Charlestown, or at Beaufort Port Royal about 70 Miles from Charlestown, or at both-the conquest, Governor Johnstone apprehended would be easily made, and the acquisition extremely beneficial by annexing South Carolina and Georgia to the Floridas. Mr. Williams requests me to avoid as much as possible intimating from whom I have derived my intelligence, hence Mr. Beresford with great form shut the Parlour door before he would enter upon the disclosure-the Idea that I could conceal his name was a little ridiculous-this Gentleman with a Mr. Hopton, not so good a general Character as his own, and several other disaffected Persons are to embark in a few days under a flag for Charlestown.  The enterprize is the most likely to succeed so far as to create a favorable diversion of any I can think of at this juncture of time and circumstances-it is a favorite Plan of General Grants nor is it improb[ab]le that Sir Henry Clinton will be anxious to recover the honor he lost upon the sands of Long Island.  Is it likely that Govornor Johnstone would have communicated a SEPTEMBER 23, 1778  design of such importance to Mr. Williams? it is possible he might for valuable considerations, and also to Mr. Hopton-how shall I account for Mr. Williams' betraying to me a confidence reposed in him-he is a wiley Man-does not give a word in writing-may have in view ultimately to secure his own Estate-for his attachment to the Enemy if their attempts prosper-for the faithful and timely notice given to his Countrymen should they from thence defeat the meditated Attack-this, he may think will also secure to himself and his present Companions admission into Charlestown, which otherwise would be extremely doubtfull.  I asked Mr. Beresford upon what principle, Sir H. Clinton permitted Mr. Williams and the rest to proceed to Charlestown, he replied with a smile, \""a mark of extraordinary favor certainly.\""  All that Governor Johnstone has said to Mr. Williams may have been calculated for amusement, or, merely for obtaining a safe re-entrance upon his Estate to a friend of British Government.  Upon the whole my Idea is to give immediate notice to South Carolina, preperations will be made for guarding against the effects of the menace-necessary steps will be taken for stopping the flag-ship far below the town, and after a proper detention for returning her and her whole Cargo to the Ocean; if a stroke is really intended she may contain skilful Engineers in Frocks & Trowsers and many other dangerous instruments in disguise-if the Vessel shall be ahead of my Intelligence and shall not have left the Port when that arrives, means may be devised for detaining her according to Circumstances-upon her return to New York or, meeting the Fleet, the mode of operation may be decided-the Voyage and return will be completed within October-the next will be the best Month for carrying the project into execution.  I therefore admit the possibility of the design, and will recommend to my Countrymen to act as they ought if there was no ground for doubt.  Your Excellency may possibly derive some advantage by a comparison of this with other Accounts from New York. I have from this reflection and from considering that all public important Intelligence is due to Your Excellency made the present communication without delay.  I request Your Excellency to order forward the several letters for Boston &c. & believe me to be with the most sincere & respectful attachment, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's Much Obliged & obedient humble servant, Henry Laurens  [P.S.] This Instant an escaped Prisoner from New York informs me of the Enemy's having abandoned Rhode Island.

  Sir Philadelphia 26th Septr. 1778. Your favor of the 31st Ulto with its enclosures has been duly received and laid before Congress.(1) In obedience to Your Excellency's orders, I have done myself the honor to use my little influence in favor of Capt. Harding. He has been waiting some time on this business but was last evening unanimously elected to the command of the Ship Confederacy now building at Norwich, Notwithstanding considerable opposition was made against it by individuals, the ostensible reason, for which was the number of Continental Officers  SEPTEMBER 26, 1778  now out of employ. But the reasons assigned by your Excellency were so strong as to prevail with all the States against the opposition made by individuals. I hope and trust every exertion will be made by Capt Harding & that nothing will prevent the Ship being manned and got to Sea immediately-as I now look upon the honor of the State concerned in some measure in this matter. We have reason from appearances to expect the enemy are about to leave the Northern part of the Continent. The evacuation of New York &c is soon expected, and 'tis apprehended that there is some probability of their making a visit to South Carolina-under this idea cautionary measures have been taken by Congress, which perhaps may eventually have a more extensive operation-but of this hereafter.  We have had no foreign intelligence of consequence since my last. The state of our finances is in a most wretched situation, and nothing as yet has been done decisively by Congress upon that important subject. A Report of a Committee upon that head is to come under consideration this day which I hope may produce something effectual tho' in my opinion the Report (which is very lengthy and complex) is exceptionable. As the State has for some time past depended singly upon my feeble abilities for their representation I strongly wish the arrival of some of my Colleagues.  I have the honor to be with great esteem Your Excellency's obedient Servant, Andw Adams  ""

  Hond Sir Philadelphia Septr 26th 1778 Soon after I Recd your letter of 19 Augt with the Inclosures Relative to a number of Towns on the Eastern Side Connecticut River Joining themselves to & being Recd by the Nominal State of Vermont (1) I Communicated the Matter to the New England Delegates & to Some others all of whom Seemed much surprized at their Conduct. After Some time for Consideration they Advised me to lay the Letter & papers before Congress and Request their advice in the matter which I accordingly Did and had the satisfaction to find that Every person who Spoke on the Subject Severely Condemned the Conduct of the Revolted Towns & of Vermont; What was proper to be done was all the Difficulty. After Some little time Spent as it appeared to be a matter of Consequence the Congress Resolved that on Friday the 18th Inst.; the Congress would go into a Committee of the whole House to take into Consideration the said letter & papers. SEPTEMBER 26, 1778  The Delegates of New York moved that Sundry letters & papers from their state, which had been presented and some others that they had further to lay before Congress Relative to the Conduct of Said Vermont might be taken into Consideration at the same time and tho it was opposed by some members as a Distinct & seperate matter it was nevertheless agreed to. On the 18th matters of a very pressing nature laying before Congress the affair was ordered to be postponed. On the 19th Colo Ethan Allen Came to this City from Said Vermont and understanding in what Situation the affair was and that their Conduct with Regard to the Said Towns was universally Condemned,(2) He earnestly Requested me not to press Congress to take up the matter till he had an oppertunity to Return to Vermont & lay the matter before their Assembly who are to meet the 9th of October and he Says he is perswaded they will Resind their vote for Receiving those Towns and Disclaim any pretensions to the East Side of Connecticut River. He informs me the vote was past by a Small majority (3) soon after his Return home from his Long Captivity and that agreable to a promise he made me when I See him in the Jersies as I went to Congress and he was returning home he had opposed the Measure and that if Vermont Does not Rescind the vote, He with a very Considerable Number who he is Sure will Join him will petition Congress against it and that he will himself present the petition to Congress and will use Every other means in his power to procure New Hampshire Redress against So unjust and impolitic a measure. He has also promised that he will immediately write to you & inform you what the Assembly Shall Do in the matter whither they Rescind it or not, and will also write to our Delegates here or Come himself in Case their assembly Does not Renounce their Connection with those Towns. According to his Desire and the Desire of a number of the Delegates here, who think it much best to have it Settled in that way at this Critical time, I have agreed not [to] move for it being taken up by Congress till I hear further from him or Receive further orders from our State.  If Vermont Should Renounce any Connections with those Towns, I Could wish our State would Continue Still to use Every proper Condescending & Lenient measure to unite them firmly with us, as those Broils in the States are very injurious to the Common Cause and Keep up the Spirits of our Enemies, who get intelligence of everything of that Kind.  One of the New York Delegates has informed me that they have wrote to their State advising them Either to send a Committee to our Assembly, or to Request our State to appoint a Committee to meet with one from theirs, to Consult & agree on measures to be Jointly taken by the two States relative Vermont. But as the Claim of New York to the whole of Vermont, in my opinion, is not better founded than is the Claim of New Hampshire to the same, and as   the Decision of the Question to whom it properly belongs, will probably at this time be attended with very important Consequences and as our present Dispute Concerning the Towns of the East Side of the River is of a very Different Nature from the other, and will probably Soon be Setled to our Satisfaction, I humbly beg leave to Submit it to your Consideration whither it will be advisable for our State to be hasty in Entring into any agreement with New York on the Subject at least till you know what the Conduct of Vermont will be relative to those Towns.  I believe it is the Desire of the major part of the members of Congress (if possible) to keep off the final Decision of the old Dispute Concerning the New Hampshire Grants to Some future time when it may be Setled without any Danger to the Common Cause.  I have the honor to be with great Respect your most obednt Humble Servt, J.B.  P.S. As I Cannot Represent the State in Congress after the first of November and can by no means tarry over the winter I shall Consider myself at liberty to Set out for home the beginning of the month of Novr. whither other Delegates have arrived or not.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 26th Sept. 1778. I take the liberty to enclose your Excellency the accot. as it stands in the Treasury Books against Our State. Your Excellency will be pleased to observe that a Warrant has been procured for 400,000 Dollars the balance of your draft for 500,000 for the use of the new raised Levies, as soon as the money is received it shall be sent forward with all convenient despatch.  Congress did yesterday come to a resolution of sending 1000 Men from Virginia, and 3000 from North Carolina, to March immediately to So. Carolina as the people of the State apprehend that Genl. Clinton, (should he leave New York, which we have reason to believe) may take Charles Town in his way, to endeavour to retrieve his lost honor in that Quarter.(1) The movements of the Enemy at New York & Rhode Island seems to indicate an Evacuation of those places. Their destination is not known-but as we have reason to SEPTEMBER 26, 1778  believe there is a declaration of War between France & England, and that the Spaniards will very soon take part in it-Congress are led to believe the British Troops in America must proceed to England, and perhaps a part of the West Indies.  By the resolve of Congress, enclosed to your Excellency by the President, you will Find, it is the desire of So. Carolina that you should take the command of the No. Carolina Troops, with the rank and pay of a Major General in continental Service.(2) I am informed the new Levies are let out on furlough, until next March; could those men be collected and Sent forward to So. Carolina it might save a good deal of expense in calling out the Militia. The President of Congress will mention to your Excellency some other matters relative to this movement, which I am not at present at Liberty to communicate, indeed they are not yet fully determined upon. You may be assured that a Supply of money will be sent on immediately to defray the expense of our Troops not to be drawn out exclusive of the 400,000 dollars mentioned above. I should be sorry to hear of any more Troops received or Militia embodied in our State unless provision is first made by Congress for their bounty and pay and subsistence &c by sending money forward for that purpose. I am necessitated once more to remind your Excellency, to endeavour by all means to send on the accounts & vouchers of our State against the Continent. Surely we must be largely in advance, not having since the beginning of the War a Military Chest established in our State, had such an establishment taken place in Ours, as in other States, the charge against No. Carolina would have been trifling indeed.  The So. Carolina and Georgia Delegates are so incensed against Genl. Rob. Howe that he is directed immediately to join Genl. Washington at Head Quarters. And Genl. Lincoln is to command in the Southern department. This Gentleman is a valuable and experienced Officer, he is ordered immediately to repair to Charlestown.(3)  I have not had the pleasure of a line from your Excellency, since my return to Congress. I hope I have not given you offence, I am sure I have not intentionally. I mentioned in my last that it was the wish of myself and Colleagues, that your Excellency would give us instruction on any matter to be brought before Congress relative to our State. We find it the practise of the Governors or Assemblies of the other States; requests there made, are seldom if ever refused. The affair of the Virginia vessel secured from the Enemy by our Militia at Currituck, has made a great noise in Congress; as she was taken away by persons supposed (by the Virginians) to be some of our people.(4) I hope Your Excellency has taken care to have this matter inquired into, and the parties brought to punishment-if any proof appears against them. It has been with great difficulty that your Delegates could prevent a recommendation to the State to   make restitution. The affair is postponed at present, whether it will again be taken up I know not. I have the honor to be with great regard, Your Excellencys Mo. Ob. Huml. Servt.  Corns. Harnett ""

  Sir Philadelphia 26th September 1778 I had the honor of addressing Your Excellency under the 5th Instant, since which I have received none of Your Excellencys favors.  This will convey an Act of Congress of the 25th for the immediate defence of South Carolina and Georgia to which I beg leave to refer.  The apprehension which gave rise to this Act, springs from a private verbal Message sent to me by Robert Williams Esquire a Native of South Carolina, a Practitioner of the Law, a Man of good understanding, and of a very respectable general Character, possessor of a large Estate in that Country, but more attached to his private Interests, than zealous for the establishment of our Independence and held to be a friend and favorite of the Ministers of Great Britain. This Gentleman's communication which I received three days ago imported that he had on or about the 19th Instant, learned from Governor Johnstone that an attack by an Army of ten thousand troops, and a sufficient number of Ships of the Line was intended upon South Carolina at Charlestown and Beaufort-Port-Royal, or both; that Governor Johnstone obtained permission for him and several other unstaunch Carolinians to proceed to Charlestown under a flag of Truce. Mr. Williams anxiously pressed a very ridiculous request \""that I would not give him up as the Author of this important discovery\""-which strongly implies a degree of treachery and no less a degree of artifice.  Is it likely that Governor Johnstone would have informed Mr. Williams the Plans intended by the Commanders of the British Land and Sea forces? It is possible he may have intrusted him with the SEPTEMBER 26, 1778  secret for valuable considerations, the flag Vessel may contain skilful Engineers in the habit of Mariners, and she may Return with such intelligence as may greatly facilitate the meditated execution-how shall we account for Mr. Williams' breach of confidence? only by supposing that in any event he means to secure his own Estate, and wishes to meet a more hospitable reception in Charlestown than his fears had indicated without this harbinger.  The recovery of South Carolina and Georgia is a project of the first magnitude to Great Britain in her present circumstances-it is consistent too with the declared intentions of her Minister from the commencement of the present War, \""that those Provinces should be the dernier resort\""-the subduing those States in the approaching November, unless in the mean time an ample aid shall be supplied by their Northern neighbours, will certainly be no difficult work-the expected plunder of an abundance of Provisions Merchandize many thousands of Negroes, great quantities of Cannon and warlike stores, Horned Cattle, Sheep, Hogs, and Horses, an immense value of Indigo and upwards of 200 Sail of Ships & other Vessels appears to be a sufficient temptation to the Enterprize.  I have lately examined upward of 30 Diserters from Byron's fleet and many other persons from New York, all of whom concur in opinion that an abandonment of that City and Port is intended but none pretend to know whither the forces are to be transported; the most intelligent Person among these Informants intimated that the Enemy had contrived to circulate whispers of their designs so contradictory in terms as to leave the truth undiscoverable. He had been much on board the Eagle Man of War, and although he professed his ignorance in general, he had collected so much from various conversations as had induced him to believe the Enemy intended a complete evacuation of New York and Rhode Island; that Hallifax would be strengthened by one part of the Troops the West India Islands by a second part, and the remainder cross the Atlantic for reinforcing Great Britain and Ireland.  A sensible Correspondent in General Washington's Camp gives me as his opinion, that the destruction of Count d'Estaings' Squadron will not be left unessay'd.(1) If Your Excellency will have patience to hear my private sentiments, I will add that Sir Henry Clinton is taking every necessary step for a sudden removal when he shall receive Orders from Whitehall expected about this time by the August Packet, and there is no place more inviting than South Carolina, an attempt therefore upon that State is most to be dreaded, especially as the Expedition may be made consistently with a voyage to the West Indies, consumes but little time, and success be the means of securing a twelve Months food for the most populous of all the Islands, and for many political considerations which will in a moment strike Your Excellencys Mind.   General Washingtons' Camp was on the 19th Instant at West Point. We know nothing of transactions at Rhode Island except the return of Sir Henry Clinton to New York from thence and from thence the successful descent of General Gray upon Bedford and Marthas Vineyard.  It is said that about 50 empty transports came out of Sandy Hook and steered southerly in view of Egg Harbor four days ago, and that the Enemy have landed about 5000 Troops at Hackinsack: these I regard only as Reports.  This instant came in two Seamen who left New York the 21st. They say the Isis to which one belonged has lost upward of 50 Seamen by desertion. The other from the Conqueror reports near 100 Deserters from that Ship, both confirm the Accounts of intended evacuation-the Packet was not arrived-all the Men of War have lost Men in proportion, as these fellows aver. They add that the fleet in general were extremely sickly, provisions extremely dear and scarce-and repeat the landing at Hackinsack, and that the troops as well as Seamen were inclined to desert.  I have the honor to be, With the highest Esteem & Regard, Sir, Your Excellency's Most obedient & humble servant,(2)  Henry Laurens, President of Congress ""

  Sir 26th September [1778] I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency the 6th Inst. by Muckinfuss thro Charlestown.(1)  Within the present Cover will be an Act of Congress of Yesterdays date for the defence of South Carolina and Georgia for appointing Major General Lincoln to the Command in the Southern Department and for other purposes therein mentioned.  This Act is founded on a presumption that the Enemy intend to make an immediate attack upon the two Southern States, an intimation to this effect having been transmitted to me by Robert Williams Esquire, late of Charlestown. This Gentleman, Mr. John Hopton, and several other return'd Americans are now, or will soon be on their passage to Charlestown in a Vessel bearing a flag of Truce. It is possible that Vessel will find it necessary to put into Tybee and  SEPTEMBER 26, 1778  highly probable she will contain Engineers and other Spies in disguise, who after having made their observations will return and make their Report to the Commander in Chief of the British forces either at New York or on the Coast of Carolina.  Your Excellency will judge the propriety of suffering any one person to land from a Vessel coming upon so questionable an errand, or of permitting her suddenly to depart again should she be arrived and remain in Port when this reaches you.  I have examined many Deserters and escaped Captives lately from New York. These vary in their several accounts of the destination of the British forces in that Port, some of them say their grand object is the destruction of Count d'Estaing's fleet, consequently an immediate and forcible attack upon Boston by Land and Sea; others, that the whole are destined to the West Indies-one, a very sensible Man, intimated the impossibility of determining where they are bound, \""they give out said he three places, Boston, Philadelphia, and the West Indies, but from my observation I think part of them are going to Hallifax, part to the West Indies, and the remainder to England or Ireland.\"" Hence Your Excellency will see that all agree in opinion that the abandonment of New York is determined. South Carolina and Georgia are grand objects in the Plan of the British Ministry, and were from the commencement of the present War held as a dernier resort, it behoves the inhabitants therefore of those States to exert their utmost abilities in the present critical conjuncture-my private sentiment is that the Commander in Chief and the British Commissioners are waiting for orders from Whitehall.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 29th Sept. 1778. Your favor of the 13th inst. by Major Gardner came to hand last Saturday and find you seem to be hesitating about coming forward to your duty here; however as I have a better opinion of your patriotism than to suppose you will desert the ship till she is safe in the harbor notwithstanding any disagreable feelings on account of former unrewarded services, I expect you will be on your journey here before this reaches New Hampshire or immediately after, so I shall not write to you after this while I tarry here.(1) By a letter from Mr Bingham dated Martinico the 16th of August (2) who says that a packet had just arrived from France, that a war was declared against England in Martinico that day that Spain had declared openly in favor of France &c.

  Dear Sir Philada. Septr. 29th. 1778. I hope this will find you Safe and Sound in Boston after an agreable journey. As you will probably have many things to claim your attention in Boston, I mean to trouble you as little as possible and Shall therefore avoid writing to you, unless when matters of business require it.(1) This is now the case-Major Franks having informed me that the Schooner Dolphin of Virginia lately commanded by Capt. Josh Peck and belonging to my friend Mr. S. Bealle of Williamsburg is now with the Count D'Estaing. She was taken by the Roebucks Tender a Brigt & Retaken by your fleet when lying off Sandy Hook. She was laden with 70 hogsheads of Tobacco, which was taken out as Mr. Franks tells me and distributed amongst the Fleet, and the Vessell being a fast Sailor and having Guns was detained for a Tender to the Fleet. I imagine that the former Owners of this Vessell have a good claim to her and paying Such Salvage as the Recaptors may be intittled to by the marine ordinances of france provided for Such cases, for this Schooner had been but a Short time in possession of the British When retaken and had not been in port to be Condemn'd. Mr. Bealle has wrote me Several Very pressing letters to put in his Claim and he can make all the Needfull Proofs of his property, &c. I am however a good deal at a loss as to the proper mode of proceeding and must rely on you to do in the Premises whatever is right and I beg you will advise me as Soon as you can of your proceedings and of what may be necessary for Mr. Bealle to do in the matter. Col. Langdon has Sent a young Gentleman here who proposes paying me the ballance due me and in that case you will not have any money to receive from him on my Accot. I have SEPTEMBER 29, 1778  not Sold any bills Since you left this altho' Some enquiries have been made after them; but that business may perhaps as well remain untill you return as you are not here to draw the bills if agreed for.

  Sir, Philadelphia Sept 29th. 1778 We are sorry to inform your Excellency, that we have not been able to send forward the money granted for the use of North Carolina. The very great demands on the Treasury previous to our Grant, has been the cause, however we are assured that it will be ready in a day or two at farthest.  Congress have been alarmed that our Enemies were about evacuating Rhode Island and New York-& that another attempt would be made on Charles Town by them. To prevent their getting possession of that place so important to our Neighbours, it has been recommended to Virginia and North Carolina, to send some of their Militia to assist in the defence of So. Carolina. The high opinion entertained of your Excellency here, and the very great desire the Delegates of that state had, that you would accept the Command, was the reason of the resolve relative to you, but in this you will no doubt consider the interest of No. Carolina and the propriety of being absent from your Government. Genl. Howe is directed to repair to Head Quarters, and Genl. Lincoln goes to South Carolina.  We are informed that the French are busily employed, in taking  SEPTEMBER 29, 1778  possession of the British Islands, this if true will furnish Genl. Clinton some other employment, than ravaging these States. Enclosed is a news paper by which you will see the manner in which this intelligence is obtained, we can only observe that it is believed here.(1) We should have written by the express that was sent by the President, but he went away without our knowing it.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 29th Sept. 1778. For the news current I refer you to the paper of the day Inclosed, the report of a French War & their having taken Dominica on the 7th Instant Came to Town yesterday Evening, and tho' not officially to Congress yet it came in such a way as gained Credit and was printed as you see, after which came an official account to Congress SEPTEMBER 29, 1778  this morning confirming the account, the several reports from New York for some time past all point to an Evacuation of that City, which I Incline to think they will do soon, whether they will go to Boston the West Indes or to Charles Town South Carolina is very uncertain, it has been [secretly sus]pected they would make a Decent on or the latter, assistance has been requested by the Gentlemen of South Carolina for men to prevent their taking possession of Charles Town, Virg. & No. Carolina are advised by Congress to send assistance; from N. Carolina 3000 men to be Immediately Marched to Charles Town, tho' I am convinced now that the Enemy will not go to South Carolina, I suppose their assistance will be wanting in the West Indes to prevent the french taking possession of their Islands about which they are now busily Imploid, should their men be sent to South Carolina it is probable they may be Imploid this Winter in an Expedition agt the Islands or in opposing the Indians who are we are told making inroads into Georgia, I suppose they will hardly think of carrying to the Southward any more of our late raised levies than Choose to go, as I believe they could not be compelled having been raised for the Express purpose of filling up the continental Batallions in the grand army; we this day Received Information of the Enemy having 5000 men in the Jerseys, near Havensack, the Malitia are conveening to oppose them under the Command of General Maxwell, if they continue there I suppose part of General Washington's army will Immedeately join Gen'l Maxwell-tho' it is thought the Enemy will soon retire being only foraging, or Manoeuvering before their departure. Our assembly you tell me have struck 850000 pounds so much will be in circulation when the former Emissions are called in besides the circulating continental currency the quantity of which was not small when I left home, Immediately after 100000 dollars was sent from Congress and now 400000 dollars the remainder of the 500000 required by the state & heretofore withheld, then several sums of Money with what will necessarily flow in from raising troops purchasing comodities &c &c we shall have a great redundancy of money & I fear a great depretiation, and tho' congress are Endeavoring to regulate her Treasury, finances & loan offices in such a manner as it is hoped will tend to appretiate the paper currency yet this will take some time, this hint is perhaps useless, as I suppose you have seen what would happen from a variety of causes obvious to men of speculation, some time, I doubt whether it will be in my power to procure you a farmer to come to North Carolina at any price which you would choose to give, all kind of labour has rose to such a hight here that men can't be got, when I have time to ride into the Country shall make further trial, I received your favor of the 15th of August, am happy to know all were then well, I hope they continue so, if Doctor Burk & Wm. Hill comes, as I hope they will some time in November at  SEPTEMBER 30, 1778  farthest, I shall Immedeately set out for North Carolina, I assure you I am already perfectly wearied of this place, if it should so happen that Mrs. Williams should want money on any occation before I return please furnish her with what she wants which shall be replaced on my return-I spoke to you before I left home to buy Mrs. Williams a negro girl if one should fall in your way which you thought would suit her, I wish you may have been lucky Enough to have met with one if you have not please attend to that object, I have little more to add my race will come on shortly.

  Sir Philada. September 30. 1778 When the Committee of Arrangement had the Honour of conferring with you on the Affairs of the Army it appeared to them that it was your Excellys. Opinion that no Prisoners or Deserters should be inlisted, & farther that such as had been inlisted should not join the Army: The Treachery of Armand's Corps about that Time having too fatally demonstrated how little Dependance could be placed on such Characters. In Consequence of which the Committee whose Sentiments perfectly corresponded with what they supposed to be yours wrote to Congress representing the Necessity of putting an immediate Stop to such Inlistments & also of purging such Corps as were proceeding to join the Army under your Excellency's Command. In this Representation they did not expressly point out the Count Pulaski's Corps, but as it comprehends a considerable Number of those exceptionable Characters we fully intended to include it in the Reform we then recommended.  This Letter the Committee forwarded to Congress about 2 Weeks after their Arrival at Camp, (1) having first shewn it to your Excelly. & received your Approbation of its Contents. Upon their Return to This City they found nothing had been done with Pulaski's Corps but our Letter had inadvertently been referr'd to the Board of War who also mistaking the Nature of the Reference had wrote to your Excelly. for your farther Opinion on this Subject. This Letter your Excelly. has answered (2) so as to leave it doubtful whether for some Reasons not express'd you do not mean that Count Pulaski's Corps should go forward as it is, one half of which at least is composed of Deserters & Prisoners, & We are inclined to think that upon a strict Scrutiny there will be found a much greater Proportion. If this is the Case we presume your Excelly. has altered your Opinion, at least with Respect to this Corps, either upon farther Consideration or upon some particular Circumstances not attended to when we had the Honour of convening with you on this Subject. Your Excelly.  SEPTEMBER 30, 1778  will see by this State that the Committee find themselves in an awkward Situation as having represented the Necessity of a Measure founded upon your Opinion-in which some Gentlemen who favour the Employment of Prisoners & Deserters think we were not sufficiently warranted. And of Course the proposed Scrutiny of this Corps has been delayed & will in all Probability finally fail, unless some farther Advice is received from your Excelly. on this Head.  We must observe that in all Probability if the Corps should be purged there will remain sufficient to compose the original Establishment of 68 Horse & 200 Foot-As the Count has extended his Number far beyond it-by adding what he calls supernumerary Troops & Companies.  The Committee are sensible of the Value of your Excellys. Time but as the Determination of this Matter will probably lead to the Settlement of other Corps of like Character, & they are attended with a very heavy Expence, we trust you will not think a few Moments unusefully employed on the Subject.(3)  With the most respectful Sentiments & very sincere Regard, We are, Your Excellys. most Obed., Hbbl Servts.

  Wednesday [September 30,1778.]  The last question proposed.(1) Although I think the house by their determination has put me into a Very delicate and to me disagreeable Situation, as I am desirous of giving the house every information, I am ready to answer the SEPTEMBER 30, 1778  question, provided the question relates to apprehensions that may have arisen on w[ha]t I conceived to be fact at the time.  A. I do.  Q. What were the instances?  A. The instance I allude to particularly was the equipping a vessel of war where I apprehended the public money had been appropriated to private uses.  Q. What vessel was it you allude to?  A. It was a vessel intended to be equipped in the Mediterranean partly at the expence of the public, and partly of individuals.  Q. The name of the Capt and of the vessel?  A. The name of the capt intended to be employed was Bell. As there were vessels bought which were afterwards obliged to be given up there was no name given any of them that I recollect.  Q. From w[ha]t circumstances do you apprehend that there was a misap[plication?]  A. From this circumstance that Mr. D. having recd. Money from M. Beaumarchais, which I conceived to be public Money did appropriate it to private uses, that is in the purchase of those vessels as far as regarded individuals.  Q. Why did you suppose that to be public Money?  A. Because M. Beaumarchais, having as I apprehended advanced before to the public to a large amount, I thought it was likewise on the public credit he advanced this sum.  Q. Are you clear there were more vessels than one bought in the Mediter[ranean?]  A. There was but one intended to be bought but the person employed bought two as I understood.  Q. Who Compelled the giving up of the vessels?  A. I understood the State of Genoa had interposed and compelled the purchaser to restore them to the orig[inal] proprietors.  Q. What were the names of private persons that were to have been concerned (in the purchase of) the public in those vessels? A. I do not recollect all the private names.  [Q.] Do you recollect any?  A. I understood M. Beaumarchais was to have been concerned.  Q. Do you recollect any other?  A. I understood that Mr. Thomas Morris was to have been concerned for others, but who those others were I cannot possitively say.  Q. Was Mr. Deane to have been concerned in his private Capacity?  A. I do not know that he was.  [Q.] Did you understand or were you informed that Mr. D. was to have been concerned in his private capacity?  A. I did not receive such information as to induce me to believe he was concerned.   [Q.] If you did not believe that Mr. D. was concerned in his private capacity in those vessels what did you mean when you said that you apprehended the public money was applied to private purposes in that instance?  [A.] I meant that I thought Mr. D. had applied the public Money to supply the deficiencies of the money that others were to have(2) advanced but did not towards the purpose of fitting out these vessels.  [Q.] On what grounds did you think that Mr. D. meant to supply those deficiencies?  [A.] From conversations with diverse persons & other occurrences at that period.  The question being read, On what grounds etc., and the answer thereto, Mr. C. gave this explanation.  The idea I meant to convey to the house was this-I apprehended Mr. Deane had applied the money which I conceived to be public to a private use. I judge that I had my information of Mr. Dean's rect. Of the money from Mr. Beaumarcha[i]s, Mr. Deane himself and others. But that this information was merely of the fact that he received it, not whether it was public or private money which he had received and so applied.(3)  [Q.] What persons?  A. I apprehend Mr. D. and M. Beaumarchais were two of the persons that informed me at that time.  [Q.] Were the other Commissioners or either of them acquainted with this transaction?  [A.] I apprehend Dr. Franklin was acquainted with the fitting out these vessels. I cannot charge my memory whether Mr. A. Lee was then at Paris or not.  [Q.] Are you sure that Mr. D. and M. B. were two of the persons with whom you had the conversations you before mentioned?  (The house having agreed that I should answer from my apprehensions I have answered so, not that I am certain as to the fact. I know from conversations with M. B. that he advanced sums of Money. I knew from Mr. D. that he had red. sums and from these b other circumstances I apprehended there was to be a misapplication of public money, but I am not certain.)  [A.] I apprehend from the nature of the transaction it must have been these persons but I cannot be sure.  [Q.] Had you reason to believe from conversations with other persons or other occurrences that Mr. Deane applied the public money to supply the deficienc[i]es of those who were to have advanced but did not towards the purpose of fitting out those vessels in the Mediterranean?  [A.] I cannot at present absolutely recollect, but probably there might have been other occurrences at the time which I do not now  recollect that induced me to apprehend an application of the money to supply of those deficiencies.  [Q.] Do you know whether the particular sum you allude to was charged by M. Beaumarchais to the united States?  [A.] Since my arrival in this country I have understood from M. de Francy the Agent of M. Beaumarchais that this particular sum was lent by M. B. to Mr. Deane on his private Account. M. Francy is in this country and he can give more full information.(4)  [Q.] Did you know or believe that Mr. D. applied the public money to the paymt. of such parts of those vessels as were to have been the property of the public?  [A.] I do not know, I believe that Mr. D. wd. have applyed the public money to that purpose but cannot say that he did.  Ordered to withdraw.

The entrance of Messrs. Kinlock and Jeffrey was certainly very irregular, altho' I am persuaded their intentions respecting these States were to add two faithful Citizens to our numbers.(2) I can vouch for the former, and must rely on the assurances of the other Gentleman. I wish General Maxwell and the Magistrates in New Jersey whom it concerns would restrain all illicit importations from New York. The Managers in that Garrison may now and then send us good goods in order the more effectually to impose counterfeits upon us.  I have faithfully executed your Excellency's commission by delivering the message to Mons. Girard, who repeated sentiments which he had expressed of your excellency's character before he had had \""the honor of receiving your visit\""-we cannot say too much of this Gentleman's merits out of his own hearing. OCTOBER 1, 1778  I do'nt Know any thing more troublesome than the conversation of those people who are eternally pestering one with recitals of their dreams This does not however aim a blow against all dreams-within this exception I trust that a dream of my own which will appear in Dunlaps next Packet (3) will be viewed by your excellency. I mention this because New Jersey is the Grand subject and you may be surprised at the presumption of any Man the Governor excepted in dreaming about New Jersey. The impressions of the visions alluded to were twice strongly made on my mind. I regarded the second as an high command and determined it my duty to reveal the whole to that part of the World for whose benefit it seemed principally designed but I have given strict orders to my Herald to conceal the dreamers name, after this intimation your Excellency-will be in that part of the Secret which I mean to go no further.  Inclosed with this your Excellency will receive a copy of a new address from one of the Gentry at New York and of a sort of no answer which Congress thought proper to return. Look Sir at the date of the extract from Lord George Germain's letter, compare it with the dates of the late requisitions and remonstrances from Messrs Carlisle & Company on the same subject. Is it not highly probable when those papers were fabricated the letter from whence this extract was made was in the hands of that Company? Is it not therefore to be presumed they are now in possession of \""a distinct and explicit ratification by the Court of Great Britain\"" under special orders prohibiting the \""due notification to Congress\"" until every Stratagem shall have failed? (4) If it be true as I believe it is that the French forces are scouring the British West India Islands and that Admiral Keppell has not beat the Brest Squadron our troublesome inmates on this Continent must soon leave us in more quiet possession of our own beds.

Norton & Bealle for a Passage from thence the latter went by the Brigt. Retaliation, Capt. Geo. Ord, intending for your Island or St Eustatia but unluckily he fell to Leeward & put into Cape Francois from whence he forwarded your Letters in a Sloop bound to St. Eustatia but I cannot learn that she ever arrived there. Many of your Letters have come to my hands since the date of my last which acknowledged those down to the 8th of April, the next in Course is dated the 12th wherein you very justly supposed my time was too much engrossed by Publick to admit proper attention to private business. This was & is really too much the case, but I have long laboured to disengage myself from the first in order to do something worth while at the last & hope the time is not very distant when I may become Master of my time.(2) Notwithstanding my constant hurry I should have entered in the Speculation you proposed of buying up the Loan Office Bills of Exch. & remitting them to you but none OCTOBER 1, 1778  were Issued untill the 10th of last month & now they ask 500 to 650 Per Cent for them, a price so enormously high can not answer your purpose or mine & therefore I decline the purchase. Your favr. of the 20th April comes next in order & I am to thank you for the kind expressions therein. I shall be glad to hear that Mr. Prejent was so successfull in Hispaniola as to have secured sufficient property there to pay his Debts,(3) as to himself I fear he was lately killed in an Engagement off the east end of Jamaica. You will see by my former Letters that I sent by Captn. Ord such Papers as could at that time be obtained for proving our Claim against him but if they do not get into your hands or prove insufficient I can send others from this Place better authenticated. I shall be glad to hear that you have recovered the Insurance made by Mr. Delap on the Brigt. Industry & Cargo. You thought it a pity the Medicines you sent to Virga. were not sold immediately on their arrival & so thought I at that time but when you see the Account Sales you will find no cause to repine at the Delay for I believe they were sold at the highest prices ever given.  You have no doubt been advised by Messr. Norton & Bealle of the Remittances they made me for your account & I shall very soon transmit you such Account Sales as have not already been furnished & your Acct. Currt. but it will be impossible to do it by this Conveyance of which I have had but short Notice. I have constantly been picking up as many Loan Office Certificates bearing Interest payable in Bills as I could get.(4) Your Sum however is very large & as People are grown fully Sensible of their Value I don't Know whether it will be in my power to accomplish it fully. You mention in this Letter the £1000 Bills of Excha. again. If you had recurred to the Letter which carried those Bills I fancy it would clearly appear they never were intended on joint Account & as to their being charged to the Publick by you or me I did not consult what was the most beneficial mode but was the right mode & that I pursued. With respect to the Adventure per the Independance, Captn. Young, I credited you for half its cost in W. M. & Co[mpan]y's Books & continue their Interest in all my Transactions untill the 31st Decr. 1777 when that Partnership ended, except indeed in the Brigt.

Bentson, was also on the Houses Account & at this time instead of my being your Debtor in Martinique the Ball. is in my favour & the Debt due to you is owing entirely from the House but this makes no difference to you as I am equally engaged to see it paid. I have made two attempts to lodge Effects with you for this purpose & both have been unfortunate but more of this by & by. Mr Dorsius has never remitted me one farthing on your Account & has much to my Surprise left off writing   to me. I observe with due Attention all you write in this Letter respectg. the Publick remittances for your relief, but you must be better informed in many things relative to the Publick Business than you are, before you can understand why I wish Consignments to be made you in preference to your drawing on Europe, for I am still of the same Opinion & it would take up more time than I can spare to inform you of all the Causes that conspired to prevent such Consignments from being made but they are such as induced me in Novr. last to draw up a Plan for establishing a Board of Commissioners to carry on the Publick Commerce.(5) This I left with Congress & have ever since refused to have any thing to do with it myself & the consequence is that nothing is done at all as the Plan met with some opposition, the Consideration of it was postponed from time to time & no determination has been had thereon to this day. Your Draft on me in favor. Madm. Thomas for 1249 46/90ths Dollars was duely paid.  The other parts of your Letter of 20th April are I think answered by what I have already wrote therefore proceed to the next which is dated the 6th May & proposes a plan for making our Loan Office Certificates negotiable in foreign Countries. In their present Form this is not practicable & as there is only one Certificate for each Sum & that payable to the Bearer you will be sensible the exportation of them would be attended with as much risque as Merchandize, it may probably surprize when I tell you, that forese[e]ing the advantages which would result to Commerce & to this Country from such Certificates as you mention, I proposed them above a Year ago in Congress when the Plan met a most Violent Opposition & was finally rejected,(6)therefore that Scheme will not do at present altho I believe it might be brought to bear some little time hence as the Sentiments of Certain Gentn. on these Subjects seem to be a good deal changed. Messr. Conyngham, Nesbitt & Co. & I have a good many Concerns together but I do not encline to form any more General Connection or Partnerships, neither is it necessary, for if I can but once get the Command of my time I have in every other respect the means of doing as much business as I chuse. The Six Bales of Linnens you consign'd to Messr Hooe & Harrisons they sold & have Accounted with me for our half the Net Proceeds. The other half they say are to Account with you for. Your Letters of 10th & 18th May only require to be acknowledged & to tell you that I forwarded the Letters to your Friends & sent word to your Mother that I was not only ready to pay the 1600 Dolls. you ordered but also to Supply her with any Money she might want & I have already answered what relates to Loan Office Certificates. Your Original Letter of the 2d June never arrived & no doubt you have been advsed by Mr Duncan of his Misfortune L in being taken. I was very sorry for your Loss in that Vessell & Cargo.  Mrs. Morris was vexed at her disappointment in the loss of the Sugar, Coffee and Limes for Amount whereof I credit you Lrs. 218.9.6 agreable to the invoice with thanks for your Attention. I observe also that one of Mr. Grays Cases of Wine was on Board this Vessell & is lost but where are the other two Cases, I hear nothing of them. I mentioned to the Members of the Committee for Foreign Affairs your desire of returning to this Place & observe you have now mentioned it yourself. I think they have no right to object & I will try to procure you an order or remittance for the Ballance of your account. Your favr. of the 24th June is Accompanied with the Accounts relative to the Brigt. Retaliation all of which I have entered in my Books without examining them minutely, this however shall be done when I can find leisure for it & if any remarks should hereafter appear necessary you must expect to hear them as also to Correct Errors of any we discovered as to remittances I shall write of them by & by. If the Underwriters on the Brigt. Industry do not pay that loss on receipt of the Papers I forwarded there is no use in making Insurance, but I think they must have paid it long since & I count on our half as so much in your hands before this time. Mr. Braxton insists on the propriety of his Claim on you for the Double of Conynghams Bill but you must settle it yourselves being very disagreable for me to interfere. The Possessors of Money in the West Indias are become too sensible of the Value of it to expect any good bargains can be made in that way at this time of day therefore you must not expect it. I have always desired the Goods you sent on our joint Account to be sold off as fast as good prices could be obtained & believe this-is chiefly complied with. You request me to give you an answer about the Musquetts you agreed for on the Publick Account & I have long expected the Committee had done this & having withdrawn myself from those Committees I do not like to interfere. My private Opinion is that you should have taken & sent them along as the Transaction was known to them from the first & never contradicted I think they were bound in honour to fulfill your engagements. Your Letter of 6th July mentions the Applications of Mr. Limozin & Mr. Cathalan for remittances, you need not remit anything for our Houses Share as I have ordered Mr. Ross to pay them & make no doubt he has long since done so. Nothing more can I say about the Musquetts except urging the Committee again which shall be done. The Goods you consigned Mr. Crosby arrived safe, he has been here & says he is to Account with me for half the Net Proceeds when sold I desired him to make the most of them soon as he could. It was out of my power to assist him with Loan Office Certificates not having yet compleated your order to myself for that sort of Paper. Your favr. of 1st Augt. advises the Arrivel of 68 Bales of Blankets from Havre de Grace they are on Account of W.M. &   Co[mpan]y being the remains of an old order. You shall have Credit for the Freight & Charges on them & I hope the whole Balla. due you will be paid before long for your Complaints on this Subject are very painfull to me. I fancy you will not find it so difficult to Ship these Bales to me as you seen to imagine, as they contain Blankets that are greatly wanted. I shall be very impatient to receive them & entertain hopes that you will meet Virginia Boats or other fast Sailing Vessells to receive more or less of the Bales until the whole are dispatched. But the Triplicate of your favr. of the l9th Augt. which is the latest I have received seems to confirm your Apprehensions of not meeting with Opportunitys to remit me these Goods. I hope however that your endeavours to send them will not be wanting as it would be a great disappointment not to receive them this Winter. Having now gone through your Letters & made such reply thereto as at this time appears necessary, I shall proceed to such other things as may occurr.  When I had wrote thus farr, I discovered that the Boat by which this was intended to go had gone down & I had only time to Scribble over a few Lines of Apology which I sent after her & hope they have got on board & this must go by Captn. James Robertson in the Sloop William which I have bought in Connection with Messr. Co. Nesbitt & Co[mpan]y & we conclude to send her to Martinique consigned to you & Mr. H[ayfield] Conyngham that is the one third part to him & my 2/3rds to you. We bought this Vessell as she lay in Egg Harbour with 48 hogsheads Tobacco on Board & have sent down 12 hogsheads more to fill her. Captn Robertson goes down to Morrow & we expect the Vessell will be quite ready by the time he gets down so that he may proceed on the Voyage immediately. Mr. Nesbitt will write the Instructions which will be that you are to make the best Sale you possibly can of the Cargo supply what may be necessary for Charges & expences, pay Captn. Robertson Fifty Pounds, Ship 500 Bushells of Salt on board for the Owners Account & then Mr. Conyngham is to receive their one third of the Ballance & you are to Credit me for two thirds. Mr. Nesbitt will I suppose order his Money to be Invested in goods to come back by this Vessell but my Intention is that you Credit W.M. & Company for my two thirds of the Ballance & that you Ship back in this Sloop about one fourth part of the Bales of Blankets you have received from Mr. Limozin if so many of them still remain with you when this Vessell is there but should you have Shipped those Goods & any others have since come to your hands for my Account or for Acct of W.M. & Co[mpan]y you may Ship of such to the Value of £1000 Sterling or there abouts if so much there be, or if the Powder from St. Eustatia should be sent to you & remains with you Ship a Quantity of that; but if you have sent away all the Blankets & have not any other Goods of mine or the  Houses then I must request you to invest halt' the Ballance you are to receive from this Sloops present Cargo in Molasses, Rum, Sugar & Coffee assorting it as you judge best & Ship it back by this Sloop consigned to me on Acct. & risque of Thos. Willing & myself. In that Case the other half will remain towards discharging the Ballance due you from Willing, Morris & Coy. & as that Ballance is entirely owing by the House I have Shipped this adventure on Acct. of T.W. & myself & shall make up other consignments in the same way & for the same purpose but then we must have something sent back in the Vessells to make up their Voyages unless the Blankets or other Goods of ours from Europe remain in your hands in that case the risque of those will be sufficient. I must entreat that Captn. Robertson may have good Dispatch for Wages & expences are very extravagant & a little delay ruins a Voyage. The Balla, of your Martinique Acct. stands on W.M. & Coy's Books at Lrs. 78,095.13.8 in your favr. & on my Books at Lrs. 1594.10.4 against you which leaves Lrs. 76,501.3.4, of this Mr. Saml. Bealle should & I suppose has remitted Livrs. 15,100 being what you charged to our Account for Expences on the Powder & which must be made good out of that Concern, this will leave Livrs. 61,401.3.4 against this will come half the Insurance on the Brigt. Industry which certainly must be recovered by Mr. Delap & I hope also, you will have to Credit me again for Lrs. 2794 charged in your Acct as my part of outstanding Debts due to the Owners of Brigt. Retaliation the principal part of which I find was owing by Mr. Prejent & I can not help thinking You have been somewhat to blame in suffering W.M. & Coy. to be so basely treated by that Gentn. You knew he had half of our Ship her Cargo & freight in his hands. You knew he was ordered to pay you the whole & I really think it was your Duty to have insisted on the payment whilst he had the Money instead of suffering him to fit out privateers with it & the more so as it was entirely owing to your recommendation that we trusted him which we did reluctantly at the time but depended on you to Insist on the payment.  If you had done this you would have had little reason to write me in so pressing a Stile for remittances. I mention this affair that you may recollect the reasons of our being in your Debt, that it is in some degree unexpected & entirely your own fault. I do not however plead this as a reason why you should not be paid nor in excuse for delay of payment as you may suppose when you recollect that I sent the Schooner Hope for your address for the purpose of discharging part of this Debt out of her Cargo but she was unluckily taken. I also assigned you a further payment out of my half of the Retaliations last Cargo but she unluckily fell to Leeward & went into Cape Francois. There are Accidents I could neither foresee nor prevent but my Intentions are evidenced by the outsetts & from thence you   may gather that it is not necessary to be so pressing with me about remittances-indeed if I had been Master of my Time I would long since have had Money in your hands instead of being indebted but I hope to turn the Scale before long. The Brigt. Retaliation met with as bad a Market at Cape Francois as she would have done at Martinique Tobacco being only Lrs. 55 to Lrs. 65, & part of the Cargo remained unsold at last Accounts I had from thence. Mr. Ceronio on whom Captn. Ord valued Shipped back some Molasses, Taffia, Sugar & Coffee to the Amot. of what he judged would be coming from the Cargo of Tobacco when sold. The Vessells expences were very high there-She had a quick passage hither & I sold her Cargo for good prices but have not time to enclose the Accounts indeed it cannot now be done for want of the Tare of some Coffee Barrells.  After some delay occasioned here on the Publick applying for the Brigt. to go after some Ships that came into our Bay-We hove her down loaded her with Tobacco & she is is gone for Port L'Orient in France under the Command of Captn. Thos. Bell as Captn. Ord desired to stay on Shoar a while. She is well manned with 30 Men & I have ordered her directly back here with a Valuable & suitable Cargo on Account of the Owners & if she gets safe back a fine Voyage must be made. She is addressed to Messr. Gourlade & Moylan & the Value of this Tobacco ordered back in Goods. You shall have all Accounts relative to this Brigt. by some future Opportunity after I have time to adjust & make them out. I shall also send you an Account of the Loan Office Certificates & State of your Acct. Currt. which I cannot attempt to do at this time & indeed this Letter is spun out to such a Length that I think it time to close it. Were it not for the Embargo I would Ship you a Quantity of Flour as this Article is both scarce & dear however if any alteration takes place that will enable me to do it consistantly I shall not fail to embrace the Occasion. Should the Goods Mr. Nesbitt & myself have ordered back in the Sloop not be sufficient to fill her perhaps you may encline to Ship by her on your own Account or more Salt may be added. I hope soon to address you again & remain, Dear Sir, Your Affect. Friend & Obed. hble Servant, Robt Morris.  P.S. I beg you will send the Blankets quick as possible & by good Conveyance.  ""

  [October 3, 1778] (1) A virtuous woman is never solicitous to resound her chastity, although she feels a proper degree of resentment at being called a Whore even by implication.\""  Mr. Dunlap,  I have very little faith in dreams, but whenever those unaccountable visions of the night make such strong impressions upon the sensorium as to leave whole pages of what I dreamt I had read or heard, it is my practice to commit them to writing early in the morning, and at my leisure to remark the difference between my sleeping and waking vagaries. I am an old man, and have been thought a good friend to American liberty, but too insignificant to be called on to carry a musket. I amuse myself with reading news papers, conversing with my neighbours about the times, applauding the young fellows who turn out chearfully against the common enemy, and encouraging such as appear a little timid.  I was last night under my pipe reading your packet of the 10th of September, some parts of which led me into deep reflection, and while I was taking a general view of public affairs, the conduct of each of the United States, and of their representatives in Congress, I fell asleep.  In this state of freedom from the cares of the world, a little fairy maid, ten thousand times handsomer than any Tory Lady in Philadelphia with her top-gallant-royal commode, stood at the foot of my oaken elbow chair, delivered me a paper containing the identical OCTOBER 3, 1778  words here-underwritten. She dropt a curtesy, said \""Old man, Virtue is its own reward,\"" and vanished.  \""FACTS.\""  \""The largest return of the army commanded by Major-General Sullivan in his late attempt against Rhode Island, amounted to ten thousand men; the Militia of the Eastern states who had joined him could not therefore exceed five thousand.  \""The firing of a tar barrel and the discharge of a cannon collected instantly four thousand of the New-Jersey Militia, who joined and co-operated with the army under His Excellency General Washington in his pursuit of the enemy through that State-and-N.B.-this was in the time of harvest.  \""The Eastern Volunteers, who composed about one moiety of General Sullivan's army, took occasion to return home before the General's retreat, leaving him and the other moiety of troops on the island.  \""The Jersey Militia continued with General Washington till the enemy was routed, and their assistance no longer necessary.  \""General Sullivan seems to complain a little of the Eastern Militia's going off and reducing his army to little more than the amount of those of the enemy.  \""General Washington declares his deep sense of the services of the New-Jersey Militia in opposing the enemy in their march from Philadelphia, and for the aid which they had given to harrassing and impeding their motions, so as to gain time for his troops to come up with them.  \""Congress by their resolve of the tenth ult. declare their high sense of the patriotic expeditions made by the four Eastern states on the late expedition against Rhode-Island.  \""BUT,\"" \""By no resolve have Congress ever manifested any sense of the patriotic exertions of the State of New-Jersey, whose Militia have twice put to the rout nearly the whole army of the enemy in their marches through that State.\""  I had finished reading this paper, and was entering upon reflections in order to reconcile the conduct of Congress from a persuasion that they never wilfully err, when my pipe dropped out of my hand; the clattering upon the floor startled and awoke me.  Now I am awake, let me, Mr. Printer, say what I should probably have dreamt had not the breaking pipe disturbed me.  From the sentiments which I entertain of the wisdom of Congress, I am perfectly satisfied the partiality implied in the fairy tale did not arise from a predilection in that august body to any particular  OCTOBER 4, 1778  state or states, but from mere inadvertency. Inadvertence, howbeit the common failing of human nature, should not too often appear in the acts of those who are appointed guardians of an infant empire, and with the most profound respect for the FREE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE, I claim the liberty of the press to inform them that all their proceedings in and out of doors are inspected by  AN OLD MAN.  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or the General Advertiser.  1 Although this letter had been written by October 1, it appeared in the October 3 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet.

  Sir, Philadelphia 4th October 1778. By this express your Excellency will receive the 400,000 dollars mentioned in my last.(1) Should there be a necessity for a further supply for marching the 3000 Militia to South Carolina, I could wish you would be pleased to mention it to your Delegates, and unless the Temper of Congress should suddenly change, I believe it may be procured. Congress have found it absolutely necessary to continue the embargo, until the last day of January finding it almost impossible to supply the Army and French fleet with bread unless it can be taken out of the hands of Engrossers and Monopolizers. A request is accordingly made to the States for this purpose, which the President sends on by Express. How far this may effect our State I know not, no supply of bread is however expected from that Quarter.  As the General Assembly are to sit the next month, I could wish with my Colleagues to receive their particular Commands; we find from experience that requisitions from States come with much greater certainty of Success through the channel of their Governors than by a bare requisition from the Delegates, not having an instruction from authority to produce, I therefore hope your Excellency will be attentive to this circumstance.  The Circumstances of the Enemy still in the Opinion of Congress seem to indicate an evacuation of their Ports on the Continent, 'tis imagined some of their Troops will go to the West Indies, some to Europe and some to Halifax or Quebec. That the French are already in possession of the Island of Dominica, we have pretty good Authority for. It is also believed that an Attack on Jamaica is also intended. We hope the French & Spaniards will cut out work enough for the  OCTOBER 4, 1778  Enemy at a distance from these States, which will at least give us a breathing spell. A large foraging party have been landed in West Jersey some time, the States have no Ally in that quarter to oppose them. The french Fleet still remain at Boston. Lord Howe is too strong for them at Sea. We do not yet hear of any new instructions received by the British Council, whether Britian will acknowledge Our independence or not seems therefore doubtful as yet.  I take the liberty to enclose the last Newspapers, and shall be happy in receiving a line from you.  I have the honor to be with great respect your Excellencys Mo. Ob. & very hume Servt. Cornl.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 5th 1778 I thank you for your obliging letter by Dr. Johnson.(1) That gentleman has been pleased to promise that he will call for an answer, should he not, this letter must find its way by the safest hand I can meet with. There can be nothing in nature more clear than that large Magazines of bread provision at least, are indispensable in the East; and every nerve is, and has for some time been straining to accomplish this purpose. Distance and the want of safe means for water conveyance, are considerable obstructions; but a far greater than these are a pernicious set of Miscreants called Engrossers, who by the redundance of money, have sprung up in multitudes like Mushrooms in heat and moisture, and they in the midst of plenty are creating an artificial scarcity which threatens much mischief. We have sent such recommendations to the different States, as if adopted, will I hope occasion these mercenary Wretches to suffer in the way that will hurt them most. I hope the various measures we have taken, will prove, tho slow, effectual in the end. Some considerations  OCTOBER 5, 1778  induce me to think that the enemy will not attempt Boston, notwithstanding the Object is so tempting under its present circumstances. For, if success presents advantages and great ones too, failure is most certain ruin. In fact more may be lost than can possibly be gained. Gen. Clintons Army is the only hope of Canada, Nova Scotia, Floridas, West Indies, and perhaps I may safely add, very much of G. Britain & Ireland. Should Burgoynes fate be Clintons the four former possessions are infallibly lost, and the two latter shaken to their foundations. Revenge must therefore be postponed to safety, and keeping what they have must precede the recovery of what they have lost. We hear pretty directly, that Dominica is already in the possession of our Ally, and that Jamaica and St Kitts are trembling for fear. Admiral Keppel too, it seems, has fled from the fleet of France. These things do not admit a much longer stay here. However we ought in wisdom, to be completely guarded against every attempt, and every one of us, in his Station should be contriving to that end.  My brother Arthur will be happy to hear from you, for I know he considers your Victories as contributing more essentially than anything else to place us on the ground of security and honor upon which we now stand.  I am, with sincere esteem and affection, dear Sir your obliged friend, Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia October 5, 1778 A few days past, since the last post left us, Mr. Harvey presented me your favor of August of 30th,(1) to which this is an answer; and which I shall direct to Williamsburg upon a supposition that the Assembly has called you there by the time the letter can reach that place. The hand bill you have seen was certainly written by Mauduit, and circulated under the auspices of administration.(2) Twas intended to feel the national pulse, and to prepare its mind for the reception of events, which are now become unavoidable. I agree with you Sir that the fishery is a most important point nor will the limits of Canada be with less difficulty settled in those negotiations which precede a peace. The arrival of Adm. Byrons Squadron has given to our enemies a temporary superiority in those Seas. The sending him here was more necessary than it can be called bold. But the fleet of Great Britain is, by this detachment, rendered inferior to that of France in the Channel of England. My brother informs me from OCTOBER 5, 1778  Paris July 4 that an engagement is every day expected between the two fleets. Later accounts say it has happened and that the English fleet was beaten. Our information from the West Indies says that Dominica is fallen, and that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in Jeopardy. I believe our enemies would willingly change their war of conquest into a war of revenge, but revenge must be postponed to safety; and I think they will rather endeavor to save what remains, than endeavor to get back what they have lost, or to gratify their malignity put Canada, Nova Scotia, the West Indies, and even G. Britain and Ireland in danger. But wisdom points to precaution, and they may attempt Boston as some think, in order to destroy the french Fleet. If they do and fail in the attempt, they will be defenceless in every part of the world by the destruction of the only army on which they can hang their hopes. I have a very high opinion of the republican principles and of the ability of Mr. Mazzei, and I think that if Mr. Maddison were sent to Genoa with him for Secretary we might have a good chance to succeed in borrowing there one of the millions, five of which are absolutely necessary to sustain, and restore our falling currency.(3) To cultivate a good understanding with the nations in the south of Europe is undoubtedly wise policy, and may produce the most profitable consequences. These affairs will come presently under the consideration of Congress, when I shall not forget the useful possession of Mr. Mazzei. Mr. Izard is the Commissioner for Tuscany, my brother William is appointed both for Vienna and Berlin. He has been sometime at the former Court, but the latter refuses to receive a Minister from us or to acknowledge yet our Independance, altho he did by his Minister most unequivocally promise my brother he would do so, as soon as France should set the example. Since this, he has quarreled with the Emperor about the Bavarian succession, and wanting the aid of Hanover, Hesse, Brunswic &c. he chooses to be well with England. The Emperor is not a little puzzled in the same way and for the same reasons. Tis a matter, not of the greatest moment to us at present, since the war between the two Giants will swallow up in their respective vortices the lesser Tyrants and thus prevent him of England from bringing German Auxiliaries to distress our Alliance. There is nothing that threatens so much injury to our cause at present as the evil operations of Engrossers. If something decisive is not quickly done by the Legislatures to stop the progress of Engrossing, and to make these Miscreants deliver up their ill gotten collections, the American Army must disband, and the fleet of our Allies remain in Boston Harbor.(4) I know the root of this evil is in the redundance of money, but until the latter can be reduced some measures are indispensable, to be taken with the Engrossers. You will see the expedients devised by us. A more radical cure will follow shortly, in a proposition of Finance now under consideration. I am   so greatly pressed with business that I cannot now write to Mr. Mazzei and must beg the favor of you to make this apology for me. [Be so k]ind as remember me affectionately to Mr. Wythe & Colo. [. . . i]f he is with you. I am affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee P.S. Colo. Baylor, with a Corps of 60 light Dragoons, was lately surprised in the Jerseys, between Hackensack and the North River- Himself made prisoner, and his party chiefly put to the Bayonet, it is said, in cold blood.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia October the 5th 1778 I hope the measures you have taken will be effectual to the purpose of reenlisting the Army because it is an object of great importance; and I readily admit the propriety of first trying those methods which promise fewest ill consequences. Danger will only arise from pressing such too far, and urging the experiment too long. I very much fear Sir, that the knowledge of depreciation has reached the most uninformed, and therefore, that every evil which can, will happen to us from this cause. But I am not without hope that such measures will be adopted as may, before it is too late, restore our currencey to its proper value.(1) It is indeed no easy matter to judge of the designs of the enemy. They have created to themselves a great choice of difficulties. I OCTOBER 5, 1778  believe they would willingly change their war of conquest to one of Revenge altogether, but revenge must be postponed to safety. Gen. Clintons Army is the only hope of Canada, Nova Scotia, Floridas, the West Indies, and I may safely add, much so of Great Britain and Ireland. Whilst this is the case, altho Boston in its present situation is a very tempting object, I cannot think they will undertake it. However, what can be attempted may be attempted, and wisdom points to precaution. If it be true, and our information comes pretty direct, that Dominica has fallen, that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in jeopardy, and that Keppel has fled from the fleet of france, we may suppose that our enemies can make no long stay with us. Distance and Land carriage distress us greatly in the article of bread provision, to which is added an artificial scarcity created in the midst of plenty, by an infamous set of Engrossers who have raised the price of flour from four dollars an hundred to five and six pounds. I hope the measures we are taking with these gentry will make them suffer in a way most hurtful to them.  Mr. Custis had quitted this City before your letter came to hand, and as he is gone to the Army, I have inclosed the letter in this.  I am, with much esteem and regard dear Sir your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee  ""

The Stock taken off at the Vineyard I have heard was very considerable especially in Sheep.  The Enemy are now foraging in the Jerseys. Was it not that our Enemies get well provided thereby, it would be some Consolation, that they were plundering amongst the Tories-Their very good Friends. A considerable Number of Our Light Horse were surprised in their Quarters in the Jerseys-And it is said many were put to Death most barbarously after they had surrendered themselves. The Particulars are not yet come to Hand. The Facts if established, will come under serious Consideration of Congress. We are just now alarmed with the Appearance of about twenty sail of the Enemy off Little Egg Harbour, which it is supposed the Enemy mean to Pillage  OCTOBER 5, 1778  of the considerable Wealth there collected by privateers &c. The Jersey Militia are called out-and we hope they will be able to give a Check to those Free Booters. However, many People seem not much to distress Themselves to preserve the Property of Men collected and lodged about in private Corners to wait for, and to enhance the present intollerable high Prices.  With Respect to the Embargo in Connecticut upon Wheat &c it much surprises me. 1 have spoken to Mr. Sheurman the only Connecticut Delegate now here, and a very worthy Character; and he promises me he will immediately write Home upon the Subject. Congress are doing every Thing in their Power to provide, or procure the sending of Wheat &c into the Eastern States; and are calling loudly upon the Southern States to make Examples of monopolizers of Provision. At the same Time it is expected that the Eastern States will not suffer Their own People to buy the Provision up in large Quantities, and that no Person will be allowed to hold, or purchase more for himself than may be necessary for his Family Consumption -And that Laws be immediately provided agt. such a Practice, and that those Laws extend to Rum b Spirits, & every other Article of Life, or that may be wanted for the Army. Extortioners, & monopolizers must have a twisted Bitt put into their rapacious Mouths. This is doing to the Southward-I say again it is expected you foll[ow] the Examples. I am yr.

  Monday, Octr. 5, 1778 (1) [Q.] Are you sure that the public had any share in those two vessels wch. were purchased in the Mediterranean?  [A.] I apprehended at the time that they had and my reason for apprehending was that the captain had a continental Commission, I thought they were on the same footing as those fitted out at Dunkirk.  [Q.] Were you any wise concerned in equipping Capt. Cunningham from Dunkirk?  [A.] I was no ways concerned in the equipmt. I was sent by Mr. Franklin & Mr. Deane to facil[it]ate the departure of that vessel from the port.  [Q.] Was Capt. Cunninghams vessel fitted at Dunkirk more than once?  [A.] Capt. C. commanded two vessels from that port, one a Lugger, the other a cutter.  [Q.] Were they fitted at the same time?  [A.] At different times.  [Q.] Were they or either of them public or private property?  [A.] I apprehended that each of them were part public and part private but I do not certainly know.  [Q.] When you were sent to dispatch these vessels did you consider yourself as acting for the public or for private persons?  [A.] Every service I performed for the commissioners I considered as done for the public, and so I considered in this instance.  [Q.].What reason had you to consider these vessels as part private property? .  [A.] From conversations I had at the time particularly with Mr. Hodge I had reason to apprehend he was concerned.  [Q.] Had you reason to suppose that Mr. Deane was concerned or any of the Commrs?  [A.] I did apprehend at that time that Mr. Deane was concerned in the first equipment.  [Q.] What reasons induced you to apprehend that Mr. Deane was concerned in the first equipmt? OCTOBER 5, 1778  Portrait of William Carmichael  [A.] I cannot recollect the reasons that induced that belief but I know that I did at the time apprehend he was concerned.  [Q.] At what time was the first equipment made, What year & wt. month?  [A.] At present I cannot precisely recollect. I think it was in the spring 1777. The capture of the Harwich packet will nearly point out the time of the sailing.  [Q.] Do you know if any and what instructions were given to Capt Cunningham respecting that cruise?  [A.] I think there were instructions given but I cannot be particular what those instructions were.  [Q.] Do you recollect whether those vessels or either of them were ordered to cruise on the coast of England?  [A.] I do not know particularly the instructions given to the capt of the two vessels. I believe the object of the cruise was for one of the Harwich packets.(2)  [Q.] Was this equipmt. at Dunkirk made with or w[ithou]t the knowledge of the french Ministry?  [A.] I cannot answer as to the knowledge of the french Ministry.  [Q.] Did you ever hear that the french Ministry objected to it?  [A.] I know they gave proofs that it did not appear to be agreeable, for the capt was imprisoned upon his return to Dunkirk.  [Q.] Did you hear that the french Ministry objected previous to the sailing?  [A.] I do not know that they knew of the first vessel previous to her sailing, therefore they could not object to the equipmt.  [Q.] Did you ever hear that the french Ministry offered to pay the expence of equipping those vessels or either of them to prevent their sailing?  [A.] Of the first vessel I never heard that they did, of the Second I heard after she had sailed that they had given orders to pay the expence to prevent her sailing.  [Q.] Did you understand that much diligence was used to push these vessels or either of them out of Dunkirk to prevent the effect of the Measures the fr. Ministry had taken to stop their sailing?  [A.] With respect to the last I believe all possible diligence was used to Accelerate her departure to prevent measures from being taken by the Ministry to stop her sailing.  [Q.] Did you ever see or hear of a letter or letters written by the Count de Vergennes to Mr. Grand or the Commrs. complaining of this measure?  [A.] I have heard that there was such a letter but I do not know whether to Mr. Grand or the Comrs.  [Q.] Do you know whether the Comrs. had recd. any order from  Congress or the Secret Comee relative to the fitting out of these two vessels?  [A.] I do not know whether they had rcd. orders relative to the fitting out of these two vessels.  [Q.] Did you ever hear that they had?  [A.] I never heard that they had recd. orders to fit out these two vessels particularly. I heard that they had general orders to fit out vessels.  [Q.] Do you Mean vessels of force to cruise agt. the enemy? [A.] I do; because they recd. Continental commissions for the captains.(3)  ""

  Sir Philadelphia October 6th 1778 By the vote of the Legislature of our State of the l9th of August last, I find it will Require two Delegates to Represent the State after the first of November next, the reason of which I suppose was that they Expected (as I Did) that the Confederation would be Ratified by all the States so as to take place at that time, But as neither Jersey, Delaware nor Maryland have yet agreed to it, and as we have been informed within a few Days that the Legislature of Maryland is adjourned to December, it is now Certain it Cannot take place So Soon as was Expected and there is a probability at least that it may not take place for a Considerable time to Come. I would therefore Earnestly Recommend it to a General Court as Soon as they meet, to pass a vote authorising any one of their Delegates to Represent the State in Congress until the Confederation is Ratified by all the OCTOBER 6, 1778  States; and that the vote may be forwarded to your Delegates here as Soon as possible.

  Philadelphia, Octo. 6th 78 You will be good enough, my dear Sir, to excuse this Letter. There are but few Men indeed with whom I could wish to be thus candid. It appears to me that Congress will shortly be dissolved. If the large Emissions of Money, and visionary Expeditions do not bring forth our destruction, I greatly fear that Party will complete the matter. Congress exhibit not more than two or three Members actuated by Patriotism. Great questions are carried every day in favor of the East-ward, and to the prejudice of the Southern States. Great questions are now upon the Carpet and if determined in the affirmative will do excessive Damage to Virginia and Maryland particularly. At present we are under secrecy-perhaps in a little time I shall think myself obligated to quit Congress; I will not sit in a house whose proceedings I cannot assent to with honor, nor is it in my  OCTOBER 6, 1778  abilities to oppose them with success.(1) I value most what our great Politicians value least. Congress are at present a Government of Men. It would astonish you to think how all affairs proceed upon the interested Principle: Members prostituting their votes in expectation of mutual assistance upon favorite Points. I am apprehensive that in geting free from oppression in one quarter, we are likely to establish it in another; by avoiding one set of Plunderers we are certain to fall into the Clutches of a still more dangerous set. I am sorry our good Friend Harvey is about to leave Congress; he is a valuable man in times like the present, a man of great virtue and boldness of Spirit. If the Land office should be established, put him at the head of it; his abilities and honesty will be highly necessary in that Employment. The motions of the Enemy are very uncertain; there is an expedition going forward on the part of General Clinton, but to what object is merely conjecture, perhaps to Boston- New England and the French Fleet are powerful inducements. All Circumstances considered, I believe they are going to guard the remaining parts of their Dominion. In the mean time they will destroy everything they possibly can, and I should not wonder if Philadelphia (2) itself was reduced to ashes before their departure. As yet Spain have taken no part to our advantage, indeed Arthur Lee still remains at Paris. The Court of Berlin have refused William Lee the Commissioner of Congress to that quarter: he is now gone to Vienna,(3) the most accomplished Metropolis in the world. We are plagued to death with quarrels and recriminations relative to our Conamissioners abroad; these men will involve the Continent in perdition. It is absolutely necessary that Dean should be sent over to Europe for the most valuable purpose in the world, but some Gentlemen are determined to ruin an innocent Character, notwithstanding he alone has the great merit of concluding that valuable Treaty with the Minister of France.

This Gentleman has served as a Volunteer in the grand Army with the highest reputation. South Carolina and Georgia will in Mr. Tenant receive the acquisition of an excellent Officer, and will in turn experience in him a valuable Citizen -his Conduct and manners will speak more in his favor than I can express.  I shall do myself the honor of inclosing with this several Papers of Intelligence which with the information Your Excellency will receive from Mr Tenant and such additions as no doubt will be made by my Colleagues will put Your Excellency in possession of all our present knowledge of public Affairs. In a Letter which I had the honor of writing to Your Excellency the 5th Instant as President of Congress is contained a late Act for continuing the present Embargo, and for preventing engrossing Provision. I shall not trouble you Sir with my opinions on the several branches of this Act but barely remark that when the power of Congress to lay an Embargo was made a question and the voices of each Member called upon- there appeared fourteen in the negative, twelve affirmative-six States affirmative, five negative.(1) Of these six affirmatives, there were three States represented by Units. I am persuaded my Countrymen will Act on this great occasion as shall appear to be for the general good of these United States. If I may offer my sentiments Congress is not OCTOBER 6, 1778  vested with sufficient power to lay a general Embargo and it would be dangerous to vest them with such power in our present system-the recent Act I humbly conceive marks incompetency-nevertheless I think it will promote the public good to restrain the exportation of Provision until January, and therefore I wish there could be a general restraint excepting of such quantities as should be found sufficient for re-equipping the fleet of Count d'Estaing, and a necessary supply to our fellow Citizens in the Eastern States. Under these indulgences and thro the artifices of cunning Men I fear the honest Citizens and fair trader will bear an heavy burthen-So far as respects my non interest altho' I am persuaded the intended prohibition will in several States be evaded, and have doubts whether any regards will be paid to it in Pennsylvania and Delaware 1 am willing to submit. Articles which the Enemy stand more in need of than either flour or Rice, I mean Tar, Pitch and Turpentine remain unrestrained.

It is reported that the State of South Carolina in sending some Gentlemen to France has instructed them 1st to purchase a certain number of Vessels, 2nd to raise a certain number of troops to be in the pay and immediate service of that State.  It is apprehended that this step executed by a single State in contradiction with the Plan of Confederation could hurt in Europe the Idea of the uniformity of the Governments to rely on Congress for the exertion and application of the common forces and it might be misunderstood or misrepresented to the prejudice of the confidence and the consideration Congress has so justly acquired.  If the concern for all what is conducible to the honor and Credit of the United States may apologize for a reflection offered on that subject, I should venture to say that the best method to prevent any inconveniences is perhaps to send immediate Orders to the Minister of the United States in France, to countenance the demand of South Carolina.

  Sir, Philadelphia, Octo 6th, 1778.  I have been absent about 6 weeks on the business of arranging the Army, which, so far as it is accomplished, has occasioned less dissatisfaction than I feared it would. Some good Officers are excluded for want of room, which are recommended to Congress for such notice and provision as shall be thought reasonable. Maj. Wells did not apply untill the arrangement of the Connecticut officers was made, so that he could not be admitted. It is customary in other States, not to fill the places of Officers in captivity, but to promote them according to their rank as if present. I shall take the first opportunity to transmit to Your Excellency a copy of the arrangement of the Connecticut Officers.  I returned here last Wednesday evening, and Maj. Adams being unwell-set out to go home last Saturday.  Col. Dyer and Mr Elsworth are not yet arrived; I hope they are on their way, for it is of importance to have a full representation.  Business goes on slow. The important matters of the currency, OCTOBER 6, 1778  cloathing department, and Treasury arrangement are not yet finished -though believe the last is compleated, except appointing the Officers. Cloathing the army will doubtless be referred to the particular States to Supply their own troops. The Continental cloathing on hand, and what may hereafter arrive will be distributed in some just proportion.(1)  There is a report lately made on the subject of Finance not acted upon, which I think will not be an adequate remedy for the evils. I think a reasonable time ought to be fixed for sinking all the outstanding bills, and sufficient funds by annual taxes provided for bringing them in. That would fix their credit by letting the possessors know when and how they are to be redeemed, and would in some good measure do justice to the public as the bills would be collected in at about the same value they were issued out. The first part of the time the people would obtain them at a cheap rate to pay their taxes, and they would gradually appreciate till restored to their original value.  But some provision ought to be immediately made for doing justice to creditors in payment of old debts and salaries stated in lawful money. The law making the bills a tender when the same nominal sum was of equal value to lawful money was reasonable and necessary, but now is become the source of great injustice. I think Lawful money should be the standard, but an equivalent in bills should be accepted in payment. The Committee of Commerce do make a discount in payment of sterling debts. I hope public faith will be inviolably observed in the redemption of the bills, at their full value, at the period fixed for that purpose; but that will not prevent their depreciation in currency in the mean time while so great a quantity is in circulation. We received accounts yesterday that a number of the enemy's Ships were seen standing in toward Egg Harbour, supposed with intent to destroy the shipping and stores there. Some Continental troops, and New Jersey militia are sent to oppose them. What their intentions are concerning leaving this country we can't yet learn. Congress have thought it necessary to continue the Embargo on provisions to the last of Jan. next. Our friends at the eastward, especially at Rhode Island, think it hard that they are deprived of getting provisions from Connecticut by the land Embargo.  I am with great respect, &c. Roger Sherman.

I hope the Beast will reach you in Flesh, as Mr. Banister's Heart was set on that Circumstance. I am sure of Mr. Dodd's Care if he conveys it to Boston. If he should not, I wish your Orders in Writing tho' you seem to have a sort of Antipathy to the Pen now, in Consequence of your long Drudgery in this Quarter. How, otherwise, is it that you do not deign to say by one Line that you have recd. any one of 8 Enclosures which are minuted in my Almanac prior to the 13th. of Sepr.(1) I should have been glad to know  OCTOBER 10, 1778  whether Capt.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia 10th October 1778. An accident which has very seldom happened to me in the course of thirty Years business, has deprived me of the honor of making an earlier & puts it out of my power even now of making a more proper acknowledgement of three of Your Excellency's favors which I remember to have been indebted for antecedent to the receipt of this of the 3d Inst. which now lies before me.(1) Those, in removing my Desks & their Contents from one part of the House to a more convenient, I have mislaid among my private Papers, & after as much OCTOBER 10, 1778  search at different times & particularly this Morning as the fleeting & pressing moments which I dare to borrow from public attentions have permitted me to make, remain undiscovered, although I am sure they are safe in a wrong class.  I recollect however & shall never forget a new obligation which in one of them Your Excellency was pleased to lay on me by a very kind notice of my Sons behavior at Rhode Island & that you had returned the Gold which I sent to Head Quarters by Jones (2) & also the Letters of Governor Johnstone, Mr. Oswald & Mr Manning.(3) In the present circumstances of Great Britain, rendered deplorable by the waste of another Campaign on this Continent, by the loss of Dominique in the West Indies & of a great Marine battle at her own door, it is exceedingly difficult to determine what will be her next step, although I do not think it is, to see the only measures remaining for her salvation. With respect to South Carolina, I cannot yet treat the Idea of an attack as altogether chimerical. I am well warranted to say the British Administration held that State & Georgia in reserve, for a stroke of necessity which might at any time be made with Success & they well know the immense value of those States & great things may be done by drawing their forces to one point-they may have indeed stayed a day too late. Be that as it will, I have fully advertised my Countrymen, & if the alarm shall prove to have been unnecessarily sounded, their intermediate exertions towards a defence will do them no real injury.  Congress have ordered the proceedings of the Court Martial on Major Genl. St. Clair to be printed,(4) & have appointed Friday the 16th for considering & determining on those of the Court on Major Genl. Lee.  I have nothing further to offer at present Sir, but the repeated assurances of being with the highest sense of Respect & Obligation, Your Excellency's Most obedient & Most humble servant, Henry Laurens.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Octob 11. 1778 In the inclosed News paper you will see certain Queries, calculated to impress on the Minds of the People the Idea of Dr Lee's having held a criminal Correspondence with a Person known to be at the same Time in the Service and under the Direction of the British Ministry.(1) I hope it will not be in the Power of this Querist to do essential Injury to so eminent a Patriot; who took the earliest and most decisive Part in opposition to the Measures of the British Court, and whose invariable Attachment to the Liberties of our Country, never was, and I think cannot be justly suspected. Yet it may be necessary to guard against it; for I plainly tho silently saw when I was last in Boston a malevolent Disposition towards Dr Lee, in a certain Gentleman, who, till he is better known, will have a great Influence in the Massachusetts State. The Instance you may recollect, as you were knowing to it in the Time of it. I then supposed it to proceed from his having strongly attachd himself, and for a Length of Time to a Circle of Men; and imbibd their Prejudices, who are far remote from the political Connections of Dr Lee, and who differ widely from them in the Adoption of publick Measures regarding either Politicks or Morals. You may remember that some time ago in a letter I informed you, I should have much to say to you about Mr D,(2) of whom I had long formed my opinion, and had not seen Reason to alter it. I have hitherto said Nothing to you about him; because I knew it would lead me to Subjects of great Delicacy, which by being exposd to the Enemy as they would if my Letters should fall into their hands, might disgrace or otherwise be prejudicial to our publick Affairs. This Caution prevents my communicating to you many things on which I wish to unburthen my Mind. Mr D was originally taken up by a secret Committee of Congress appointed to procure from France the necessary Supplys for carrying on the war: By them he was sent to that Country in the Character of a mere Merchant. About that Time another Committee was appointed OCTOBER 11, 1778  whose Business was to form a Correspondence abroad, and particularly to feel the political Pulse of France, in hopes of forming a Connection with that powerful Nation! This Committee also took up Mr D; and he carried Letters from Dr F to some Men of Eminence, which might enable him in some Measure to penetrate into the Disposition of the Court of France towards America. With these Views Mr D was sent to France; He was to be an Agent to the secret Committee of Commerce. To the secret Committee of Correspondence he was to be the Inquisitive Man or Intelligencer. He had no political Powers, whatever; and yet he sent us over Majors, Colonels, Brigadiers & Majors General in Abundance & more than we knew to do with, of his own creating, till at length Mr Du Coudray arrivd with the Commission (or an Agreement signed by Mr D in Behalf of the United States that he should have one) of a Major General & the Command of our Artillery; together with his Suite of about seventy Gentlemen of different Ranks. All this was done as I said before, without any Authority. Congress was exceedingly embarrassd, being loth to discredit their Commissioner (for before the Arrival of M DuCoudray he was commissioned joyntly with Messrs Franklin & Lee) I say, being loth to discredit him by disannulling the Convention, and at the same time judging it dishonorable as well as unsafe for America to ratify it. This however was agreed to in a Committee of the whole House. Not having the Records before me, I do not recollect whether it was confirmed in the House; but DuCoudray soon after died, his Suite or most of them returned with gratifications, and Mr D was recalled.(3) After which he was directed to return speedily and give an Account of the State of our Affairs in Europe. This has given an Occasion to his Friends to hide the real Reasons for his being recalled, and to hold up in the publick News Papers an ostensible one, supposing it to be more for his Reputation.  Our Affairs even in France wore a gloomy Aspect during the last year, until they receivd the News of our Army at the Northward being completely victorious. This was the decisive Language which commanded our Success in the Cabinet of France. To this we are indebted for the Acknowledgment of our Independence, the Treaty and the French Fleet. Mr D is complimented with having procurd this Fleet, and his \""spirited Exertions\"" like those of other great Men, have been passd off in the News Papers. Unthinking Men may be amusd with a Golden Snuff Box &c &c; after all they are mere Things of Course, especially in the Honey Moon of National Matrimony.  Since Mr D's return, as well as before, there have been suggestions of his Misconduct in France, and among other Things of his misapplication of publick Moneys. I cannot say whether these Sugges- OCTOBER 12, 1778  tions are well grounded or not. Congress is devoting every Hour to an Enquiry into the grounds of them which can be spared from an Attention to other great Affairs, particularly the Finances. The Conduct of an honest Man well bears the strictest Scrutiny. If the Friends of Mr D have any Suspicions of his being tardy, I am inclined to think they will be more apprehensive of a Detection from the Vigilance & Integrity of Dr Lee than any thing else. On such Occasions it is not unusual for the most unblemished Characters and sometimes even the Lives of the best of Men have been sacrificed, in order to prevent \""Transactions dark & mysterious\"" from being brought into open Light.  I have written this Letter in Confidence and shall continue the Subject when I can find Leisure.  Your last was dated the 3d of Septr. Adieu.  ""

  My dear Sir. Philada. Oct. 14, 1778. In my last (1) I inclosed a News Paper containing certain Queries calculated, as I conceive, to blast the Reputation of a truly virtuous Man. Dr. Lee and Dr. Berkenhout mentioned by the Querist, were formerly fellow Students at Edinburg; and as both were esteemed learned in their Profession, it is not improbable that on that Account they kept up their Acquaintance while both continued in Great Britain. Dr. Lee, you know was requested by Congress to go over to France, where he was made a joynt Commissioner with Messrs. Franklin & Dean. It is possible that a Correspondence afterwards have been carried on between them; but from the Knowledge I have of Dr. Lee, I will venture to pledge my self it was not a criminal one as the Querist would seem to insinuate, and if Dr. Berkenhout was in the Service & under the Direction of the British Ministry, which by the Way is but bare Suspicion here, it must have been utterly unknown to Dr. Lee: I am rather inclind to think it is a Creature of the Querists own Fancy, or an artful Suggestion thrown out to the Publick, to serve the Cause of our Enemies. America should beware how she suffers the Character of one of the most able & vigilant Supporters of her Rights to be injured by Questions designd to impute Slander without any Reasons offerd why such Questions should be made. It is the old Game of mischievous Men to strike at the Characters of the Good and the Great, in order to lessen the Weight of their Example and Influence. Such Patriots as Lord Russel & Algernon Sydney of the last Age, have been of late falsely and audaciously charged, by a Scotch Tool of the most nefarious Court in Europe, as having receivd Bribes from the Ministers of France;(2) and it is not strange that a Gentleman whom the leading American Whigs have placed high in their List of Patriots, who has renderd the most laborious & important Services to our Country in England,  OCTOBER 14, 1778  France & other Parts of Europe, who has so often & so seasonably developd the secret Intrigues & Practices of wicked Men, and who at this Time stands high in the Esteem & Confidence of the Congress, & when it is considered in Addition to this, that there are too many disaffected & insidious Men still lurking among us, it is by no Means a strange thing to hear it insinuated by an anonimous Writer, that Dr. Lee also is chargeable with a criminal Correspondence with the Enemy, without even the Shaddow of Reason.

  Hond & Dear Sir, Octo. 15th. 1778.  Your favor to me of the 5th (1) by Brown found me in bed, under most severe symptoms of a nervous fever. I had enjoined it upon myself not to visit my family, till the Accounts of my dear, injured, OCTOBER 15, 1778  deceased friend shall be put in proper train. I continue in that mind, and am this day greatly encouraged to think all my medicines have critically served their intended purpose, so as that I may be abroad speedily. The flattering confidence which you are pleased to repose in me is a great Reward for me in advance, upon the Resolutions I had formed to aim to do justice to my friend-your now happy son.  I am told the Papers are committed. Mr. S. Adams promises that my sickness shall double his diligence on the point.  I am, with the most sincere respect, Your friend & obedt. humble Servant, James Lovell.  ""

  Sir, Philada, Octobr 16, 1778. I am informd that General Clinton designs to send to the Governor or Assembly of each of the United States, Copies of an insulting Paper, called a Manifesto or Proclamation, calculated to promote a Rebellion, and that the one intended for this State is to be sent by Water up the Delaware. And as it appears to be the Design of the Enemy, as far as it may be in their power, further to pursue their barbarous practice of laying waste our Sea Ports, and that they would be particularly gratified by an opportunity of destroying this City; would it not be proper that one or two of your Gallies should be ordered to watch for them in the River, that they may seize their Vessel & bring the Men up, blindfold, to be confined & dealt with according to the Laws of Nature and Nations.(1) You will excuse this Hint, and be assured that I am, Your very humble Servt,  S. Adams.  MS not found; reprinted from Pa. Archives, 1st ser. 7:14.  1 Learning that copies of the Carlisle Commissioners' October 3 \""Manifesto and Proclamation\"" were about to be distributed throughout America under flags of truce, Congress declared that persons captured in the act of distributing them were \""not entitled to protection from a flag\"" and would be taken into custody because the manifestos were \""seditious papers\"" designed to \""stir up dissentions, animosities and rebellion.\"" Accordingly Congress proceeded to ask the states \""to take up and secure\"" all persons discovered \""engaged in the prosecution of such nefarious purposes\"" and recommended that the document be printed in the newspapers, \""more fully to convince the good people of these states of the insidious designs of the said commissioners,\"" a measure already taken in Philadelphia where the manifesto was OCTOBER 16, 1778  Photographic reproduction of Carlisle Commissioners' \""Manifesto and Proclamation,\"" October 3, 1778  printed in the October 15 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet. JCC, 12:1013, 1015-16. For the fate of the crew of the British vessel captured when it ran aground while attempting to carry copies of the manifesto up the Delaware, see John Henry to Thomas Johnson, October 20; Henry Laurens to Caesar Rodney, November 1; and Laurens to John Beatty, November 7, 1778, note 1.

You must know that in humble Imitation, as it would seem, of the Example of the British Army some of the officers of ours have condescended to act on the Stage while others, and one of Superior Rank were pleasd to countenance Them with their presense. This with some other appearances as disagreeable to the Sober Inhabitants of this City as to Congress gave Occasion for the Resolution. I am sorry that by a Repetition of a theatrical Performance which at least appeard to be done in contempt of the Sense of Congress, another Resolution became necessary.(2) You will see it in the enclosd paper.

  My Dear Sir Philad Octob 17. 1778 If I should tell you that I wonder much at the Conduct of some of our Politicians, I might discover my own Folly; for it is said a wise Man wonders at Nothing. Be it so; I am curious to know who made the Motion for the Admission of Gray, Gardiner and Jemmy Anderson? (1) Which of the Boston Members supported it. Are the Galleries of the House open? Do the People know that such a Motion was Made? A Motion so alarming to an old Whig! Or are they so incessantly eager in the Pursuit of Pleasure or of Gain, as to be totally thoughtless of their Country? I hope not. Gracious Heaven Preserve us from Vanity, Folly and the inordinate Love of Money. Your News Papers are silent upon every Subject of Importance, but the Description of a Feast, or the Eclat of some Great Man. Your able Patriot is wholly employd in spirited Exertions of the Military Kind, or he would surely have pourd forth all his Eloquence on so detestable a Motion. The Motion \""did not obtain.\"" I rejoyce in this; but Do you do Justice to the House by so faint an Expression? I hope they rejected it with every Mark of Contempt and Indignation. Do the Gentlemen who made and supported this Motion know, that even in this Quaker Country they are trying, condemning and I suppose will hang some of their considerable Men for Crimes not inferior to those of Gray and Gardiner. Jemmy Anderson I have forgot. I presume he is a little Man and a Scotchman. It is the opinion of the People of this Country that a Galloway could not atone for his publick Crimes by the Sacrifice of a thousand Lives. A Galloway, a Gray,  OCTOBER 17, 1778  a Gardiner! Examine them and say which is the greatest Criminal. Confiscation, you tell me labors. \""It labors very hard\""! I have heard objections made against it, not in this Country, but my own. But I thought the objections were made by interested Men. Shall those Traiters who first conspired the Ruin of our Liberties, those who basely forsook their Country in her Distress, and sought Protection from the Enemy when they thought them in the Plenitude of Power-who have ever since been stimulating, and doing all they were able which it must be confessd was little indeed, to aid and comfort them while they were exerting their utmost to enslave and ruin us. Shall these Wretches have their Estates reserved for them and restord at the Conclusion of this glorious Struggle in which some of the richest Blood of America has been spilled, for the Sake of a few who may have Money in England, and for this Reason have maintained a dastardly & criminal Neutrality. It cannot be. I venturd to speak my Mind in a Place where I could claim no Right to speak. I spoke with Leave which I should have disdained to have done, had I not felt the Importance of the Subject to our Country. I will tell you my opinion.

  My Dear Bee, Philadelphia Octr. 17th 1778. I am set down with a heavy & aching heart to write to you. To you I can communicate my sentiments without reserve, as I am sure you will never betray that confidence I repose in you. I will now speak more freely to you than I have yet done. They are the dictates of an honest heart that means well, & is deeply impressed with the most poignant grief in contemplating the ruin that impends over this unhappy country. Since I have come into C_____ I have viewed the progress of its business with a curious, & a watchful eye. I have for some time past thought this body by no means competent to do the great public business intrusted to them, I am now thoroughly convinced of the Justice of this observation. I do not think it would be prudent to trust my reasons to paper, I will reserve them untill we meet. Do not think me actuated by an over jealous disposition. Indeed I am not. I have refrained from saying this much, untill I was satisfyed there was no room left whereon to hang a doubt. A change of Men, or measures, must be speedily effected, or we are lost. It is a melancholy truth, & as I think it high time it was known, I must tell you that the American cause never stood so near the pinnacle of destruction as it at this day does, & is daily approaching nearer to its downfall. Whence arises this dangerous alarm? I may be asked. From men in whom you repose an implicit confidence, & who are not worthy of it. These are serious matters, & require no less serious consideration. They are meant to operate so far in your mind as to produce something for the benefit of that virtuous cause in which you took so early & decided a part, and the same noble Patriotism which first fired your bosom to step forth in its support, will, I make not the least doubt again engage your exertions of mind, to devise some means for conducting it to a final & happy Issue. I would wish to see one State at least in the Union have fortitude and honesty enough to instruct their Delegates to remonstrate in pointed & severe terms, against the abuse, & waste of time that Daily is committed in that body. The great public concerns are left to shift for themselves, whilst almost our whole time is ingroced by the private interests of individuals. Alas! C_____ is not what it has been. Your own good sence will at once dictate to you that this must be, inter nos, It is a delicate affair, & ought to be handled with extream tenderness, for if these things were once to get abroad, the consequences, you must at  OCTOBER 18, 1778  once perceive. I intend when I am about to leave C_____ to speak my mind very freely to them on this subject, & shall conclude with telling them I am abundantly satisfyed they are not calculated to conduct the business intrusted to them, & if the States do not fall upon some other mode, by which the concerns of the American States, are to be managed, we must inevitably fall to pieces, & that I intend to tell the State so I belong to, as soon as I go home, & will too.  Octr. 18. For particulars of the intelligence we received yesterday, of the expedition against you I must refer you to Hall. We set untill past ten oClock last night on this business & at last carried our point for 2000 men more to be sent you from No. Carolina,(1) this will make 6000 in the whole, which with our own force, will pretty effectually secure us against this cruel enemy, provided they are with you in time. We have taken every step we possibly could, that they should be, & hope they will, at least the first 4000. (2) You know my handwriting therefore shall not put my name to this. I am my Dr. Sir, Yours most sincerely. J.M.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Oct. 18th 1778 Congress were yesterday informed by what is said to be good authority, that several thousand of the Enemy are about embarking OCTOBER 18, 1778  from New York for Charles Town in hopes of being able to surprise the Inhabitants and to get much plunder. Your Excelly will observe from the proclamation published by the British Commissioners that they intended to destroy every thing they can alleging by way of excuse, that America was mortgaged to France-their natural Enemy and it was now the intent of Britain to ruin the estate, to prevent them from getting any advantage from our connection. They have burnt and destroyed all the houses & other property of the Inhabitants of Jersey lately, whenever it was in their power. I can hardly believe yet, they will go to South Carolina, but as there is some reason to fear it, we should endeavour to be prepared so as to prevent their being able to practice such horried cruelties as they do.  The French have taken Dominica and Turks Island, and will soon be in possession of all the British W. Islands, unless they are defended in a different manner, from what they now are, nor have they any other resources than what are here plagueing us. Count de Estaings Fleet will shortly be fit for sea again, and how the Enemy can continue to divide their shipping without leaving him superior to what is left I know not. We have no late information from Europe worth mentioning, Except that the Emperor of Germany and the King of Prussia are at the head of 250,000 Troops each well officered, they seem disposed to try who has the longest sword.  The Delegates wrote your Excellency an official letter not long ago, tho' we have not had the pleasure to hear from you since our arrival, in that way. I have received one letter only, I shall think myself much obliged to you for some account of what is doing to the Southward, when you can spare so much time; I wrote to you the first of this month, (1) giving you all the information that I suspected would please or was worth your attention. I should take pleasure, in corresponding with you if agreeable besides what is necessary in our official characters. Genl. Howe is directed to repair to head Quarters to join the grand army, and Genl Lincoln goes to So. Carolina to take the command there. The latter is from Massachusetts Bay. He is highly spoken of-both as a Soldier and a Gentleman- by all that know him, especially by the Southern Officers.  The French Minister behaves with great propriety as far as I am able to judge of his conduct. I wrote you the situation Genl. Lee was in, Congress have been so engaged in business, that we have not had as much time as to take up the proceedings of the Court. However that will be the business of to morrow.  Genrls.

It is impossible that a person of such worth should not feel the obligation of returning to offer service to his country when engaged in war. Yet the Marquis still continues a Major General in the Army of the United States, and OCTOBER 19, 1778  we hope will be permitted by his Sovereign to come back more effectually to our aid, by adopting the plan proposed by Congress, for an account of which I refer you to the Marquis.  Be so kind as [to] introduce my son Ludwell to the Marquis, and charge the Youth to respect Monsr. Fayette as the much esteemed friend of his father. I am my dear brother most affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. 19th. 1778 I have not yet had the pleasure to hear from you; but by Mr. Rowes letter of the 6th inst. I perceive you were at Boston. His drafts No. 1 to 9 amount 107,702 Dol. are duly accepted, as will Such others as you or he by your directions may draw. I continue also to pay Mr. Oster's order for the expenses of the Ship Chimere and the two prizes which Seem to accumulate pretty fast. The Salt imported in the Jeune Achilles remains in Store and I now understand it belongs to the marine of france, it will remain there for your orders. Mr. Oster will inform you that another Cargo of this Salt is arrived at Baltimore, nothing is yet done with Capt. Roche and I wish he was here in person as he makes Some difficulties that you might remove more easily than I can. However we are to meet this day on the business and I Shall bring it to some conclusion or other. Considering that you may probably have occasion for much money in Boston I have endeavour'd to Sell more bills, but I find a considerable alteration is operated in the course of Exchange by the Loan office bills being pretty generally offer'd for Sale at 500 per Ct. and those being deemed as good as any can be, no body will now give me 600 per Ct. as they did before. I mention this for your information that you may avail yourself of a favorable course of exchange at Boston, if you want to draw further & can there get a price to your liking. Capt. Deane in the Sloop la Liberty Sailed from Virginia for France Some time ago and Mr. Harrison has charg'd me for the Cargo and Expences of the Vessell upwards of £3600. Mr. Clarkson has charged me with upwards of £10,000 for goods bought from the Sales of the prizes which are to be account'd for by Mr Mitchell Quarter Master General and will be placed against the Cost of the our Supplied the fleet. I am told the Chemere frigate is coming up to the City which will no doubt cause an encrease of expences. The goods from No. Carolina intended for Mr Harrison had not reached him at the date of his last letter. I have at last procured an order  OCTOBER 20, 1778  from Mr. Lewis for the delivery of the Cannon brought by Capt. Borritz in to No Carolina to the States of Virginia and No Carolina each to pay for what they receive agreeable to the Contracts in tobacco. These Resolutions of Congress and the Commercial Committee I Shall send down by tomorrow's Post and hope the States will immediately deliver the Tobacco and thereby Save demurrage. Thus far is all the intelligence that occurs to me as necessary to be given you at this time. If any thing further offers I Shall write you again by this Post. The time is now near at hand when I Shall be relieved from my Seat in Congress, but you may See in our news Papers that our fellow Citizens are determined not to leave me master of my own time, and as I cannot by our Constitution Serve longer in Congress they have Elected me a Burgess for this City in the general assembly. This However will not claim quite So much of my time as the Congress did. Should your wants of money for the fleet extend to Such Sums as you may conceive will exceed your deposits here to an inconvenient degree, you will doubtless desire Monsr Gérard to apply to Congress for that advance untill you can at convenience replace it, which I mention just to remind you of what in Such case may be necessary. I Shall be happy to hear of your finishing your business at Boston & still more to see you return here, being Dr. Sir, Your's &Ca. R.M.  ""

  My Dear Sir. Philadelphia, Oct. 20th, 1778 I am much pleasd with the Respect lately shown to the Count D'Estaing and his Officers, but not with the Etiquet of your publick Entertainment.(1) The Arrangement of the Toasts was not perfectly agreable to my Idea of Propriety. This may be thought unworthy of Notice. But there is no Appearance made by the Publick but, like that of a private Individual, adds more or less to its Honor or Disgrace. Besides, Things which detatchd & by themselves are justly considered as Trifles light as Air, when they are connected with and made Parts of a great Machine, become important and do good or Hurt. The Monarch & Kingdom of France preceeded the Congress; and the Army & Navy of France that of America. Nations and independent sovereign States do not compliment after the Manner of Belles & Beaus. The superior Respect paid to the General & Army of America to that shown to the Congress, viz. by the Addition of a feu du joy, I suppose was conformable to the practice of all wise States in giving a just Preference to the Military above the Civil Power. It must be confessd it is grounded on Principles truly and altogether Republican. Yet the old fashioned Whiggs murmur at it; and with a Mixture of Pleasure and Indignation contrast the present with past Times when it was made a Capital Point, to keep the former under the Controul of the latter. Men are prone to Idolatry; and some who seem to scorn the worshiping Gods of other  OCTOBER 20, 1778  Nations, will bow down to graven Images of Gold & Silver, and, strange Infatuation! of Wood in the Form of an Ass, an Ape or a Calf, no matter what, if it be the Work of their own Hands. In Truth, my Friend, the Congress appears to be in an awkard Situation. While they are exerting their utmost Influence, on all proper Occasions, to support the civil Authority of the several States over the military, there are some Men, even in that State which my Partiality had almost led me to pronounce the most respectable in the Union who would have less Respect shown to them than to the Creatures which they have made. Tyrants have been the Scourges and Plagues of Mankind, and Armies their Instruments. These have been said by ignorant Flatterers & Sycophants to be the Vicegerents of the Almighty to punish Men for their Sins, and therefore not to be resisted or contrould. The Time may come when the Sins of America may be punishd by a standing Army; and that Time will surely come when the Body of the People, shall be so lost to the Exercise of common Understanding and Caution, as to suffer the Civil to stoop to the Military Power.  I will finish this Scrawl with an Anecdote. Not many Days ago a Sherriff of the County of Philadelphia attempted to serve a Writ on the Person of the Count Pulaski. He was at the Head of his Legion and resisted the Officer. A Representation of it was made to Congress by the Chief Justice who well understands his Duty and is a Gentleman of Spirit. The Count was immediately orderd to submit to the Magistrate, and informd that Congress was determind to resent any Opposition made to the civil Authority by any of their officers. The Count acted upon the Principle of Honor. The Debt was for the Support of his Legion, and he thought the Charge unreasonable as it probably was. He was ignorant of the Law of the Land and made the Amend honorable. The Board of War afterwards adjusted the Account and the Creditor was satisfied.(2) Adieu. S.A.  [P.S.] I intreat you not to resign your Seat at the Navy Board.(3) ""

  [October 20, 1778] To SIR HENRY CLINTON, &c. &c.  May it please your Excellency. I have been favoured with the sight of your letter to the Congress, dated at New-York, the l9th September, 1778, on which I shall take leave to make a few observations.(1) It was suggested to me to notice the requisition you sent upon the same subject, some time since, as a Commissioner, in conjunction with your brethren, Eden and Carlisle. I avoided it, because I was certain your Excellency would offer me another and a better opportunity. You will, however, pardon me for referring to that paper on the present occasion.  Let me observe, Sir, that fraud and hypocrisy, however they may be mistaken for policy by weak minds, are of a very different family, and have not the slightest connection. The use of them is at all times dishonourable, sometimes dangerous. They may serve one turn and for one moment, but they frequently fail even of that short purpose, and impede a man in all his future operations. If ever there was an opportunity for using these weapons successfully, you had it with us; for we reposed the highest confidence in British integrity, and we had an affection for the nation. But you have so imprudently dissipated our good opinion, that when you aim a great stroke the means are wanting.  When your officers broke their paroles, we imputed it to a defect of principle among them individually from the want of education and other circumstances of that kind, which, considering the characters of some, is not to be wondered at. And when we heard that these persons were not only countenanced but caressed, we did not believe it.  We know tolerably well the insidious manners of your court, for they were painted by your own citizens, and we had reason to believe their assertions. We found the design to enslave us was persisted in through every change of Ministers and measures, and professions in a long course of years. But we did not, we could not believe that their baneful influence had so deeply affected every order of your state. And though the conduct of Lord Dunmore, in tendering freedom to all the slaves who should butcher their masters and repair to his standard, was sufficient to have opened our eyes. Yet our partiality in your favour led us to attribute this to the profligacy of his private character, and to a predeliction for Negroes, arising from his natural propensity to the females of that complexion.  In short, I have known some of the best friends to America behave OCTOBER 20, 1778  coldly to their friends, for believing the relation now too well attested, of your conduct to those unhappy men who capitulated at Fort Washington.  At length conviction came, though slow, yet full. To mention the instances in which you broke faith with the public and with individuals, would be to write the history of your three campaigns, with all the attirais of proclamations and protections. But it would be for the honour of human nature to bury this history in oblivion. It is sufficient for the present to observe, that we became fully convinced you were no longer to be trusted.  Honest men, after they have been defrauded, acquire that wholesome suspicion which others inherit. The only difference indeed is, that the former reason from facts, the latter from feelings. Of consequence mutual diffidence took place to the greatest degree; and it is perhaps as laughable a circumstance as any of the others that you made at this time, and under such auspices your conciliatory propositions, which of all things required the greatest confidence. But to return.  It was predicted by every discerning man, that the troops of the convention would be used against us the instant they were out of our power. Your former conduct justified the inference, and considering the many infractions you made in it from the very commencement of the treaty, Congress had good right to have declared the stipulations on their part void. Principles, however, of national honour induced the determination of that Body strictly to comply with the convention. Luckily for America General Burgoyne, by declaring in a letter to Congress that they had broken it, gave an additional ground, known and acknowledged among nations, for suspending it until a ratification from the court of Great-Britain. It is observable, that even then the suspension was carried by a very small majority, although every Member present was convinced you did not mean to pay the least regard to it. They reasoned (but with what force it becomes not me to determine) that it was better to convince the world by one more experiment of your want of integrity. Luckily however, they were overruled; and you have daily given additional proofs of the wisdom of that cautionary measure.  On the requisition by yourself and others, Commissioners, &c. dated at New-York, the 26th August,(2) the following doubts arise:  1st. Why was it not made sooner, since clearly the Commissioners had as much power to ratify it before, and their King was as much in need of his troops.  2d. By what authority did the Commissioners intermeddle in a business by no means in contemplation at the time of their appointment, and (as will be shewn hereafter) clearly out of their power,   especially when you the proper person was on the spot, and only made one of them.  I am informed that the solution given in Congress at the time was, that the Commissioners had received a ratification of the convention, together with orders to make an application of that kind, with a view to two objects:  1st. If possible to obtain the prisoners, and then declare the convention void by reason of the suspension, and of their want of authority.  2d. At least to lead Congress into some kind of treaty or correspondence with them on the subject, and thereby indirectly into an acknowledgment of an authority in the Commissioners to treat with us as subjects of Great-Britain.  This is confirmed substantially by your letter; for it cannot be supposed that your Ministers have less pride or wisdom than heretofore. If therefore their Commissioners had been possessed of sufficient authority, they would hardly have sent you that express and recent authority you mention to have received since the date of their requisition. It is worthy of observation that this date is the 26th of August, and Your authority the twelfth of June, between which is an interval of eleven weeks. It is evident that Your Ministers in the critical situation of their country, would give this paper every possible dispatch. Six weeks or seven, at farthest, were sufficient to transmit it from Whitehall to New-York. Hence it is evident, not only that you had received that paper before the date of the requisition, but also that it was on that ground the requisition was made.(3)  What right had the Commissioners to interfere in it? They were appointed for the single purpose of persuading us to become subjects to the King, being a kind of missionaries to propagate monarchy in foreign parts,(4)and what connection this has with a military convention, no man can discover. They had no authority to speak to Congress on national grounds. They were not Ambassadors, Ministers Plenipotentiary, nor any thing of that kind. They were not appointed by letters of credence but by commission under the great seal, not from the mere motive of the Prince, but by Act of Parliament. In short, the whole mission was on domestick principles; when therefore the people of America refused to become subjects to the King of England, their authority, if any they had, ceased, nor could they possibly have had authority to the purpose they pretended. It was given them neither by their commission, nor by the act on which that commission was grounded, nor could it possibly have been in contemplation when that act was passed; and your letter shews demonstratively, not only that they had not any such authority, but that your King and his Ministers did not think they had.  But what kind of authority is your's? Why it seems you have sent a  paper, purporting to be the extract of a letter from Lord George Germaine, and that is a true extract, we have the word of one Smith, your secretary. And what is this extract? Why it seems it is a signification of your Monarch's pleasure? And what is it that will please him? Why that you give assurances, &c. All this appears from the paper. But why will it please him? Because he would get some troops without being under the necessity of keeping the convention. For does it follow, that because he desires you to give assurances, that therefore he gives assurances? Does it follow because your secretary hath signed a piece of paper as an extract, &c. that therefore it is an extract? I believe it is, but I also believe that your court would deny it if they could get any thing by it. Does it follow, if this is a true extract, that the whole letter taken together is not of a different complexion? Does it follow, that it is the King's pleasure you-should do so because Lord George Germaine says it is? In a word, will any assurances given by you under such flimsy authority, amount to that explicit ratification which was demanded by Congress? A demand then justified by the conduct of General Burgoyne, and which the chicane used since, hath rendered it absolutely necessary to [insist] on.  The position then, Sir Harry, is clear, that when Carlisle, Eden and Clinton made their remonstrance and requisition, and when you made your demand, neither they or you had given or could give that satisfaction for keeping the convention which Congress had a right to demand: Of consequence you could not expect the troops would be suffered to depart from our shores. This being the case, let us consider the requisition. I say what did you and your brethren mean by your eulogy upon the faith of cartels, military capitulations, conventions and treaties which you have sported with so often? What did you mean by calling on us by the sacred obligations of humanity and justice, to do what, confident with a regard to either, or even to our own safety you knew was impossible? What did you mean by a threat of retaliation, you who have exhausted the mores of military barbarity? What were you to retaliate? A weakness almost amounting to pusilanimity in declining to avenge the injuries you have done? Do you think it possible to affright us by an idea that you will pay no regard to cartels or capitulations? You nevey yet have done it: Those who surrender to you know they are exposed to the sword or to languish in confinement.  You have dared to say, \""all breach of faith, even with an enemy, and all attempts to elude the force of military conventions, or to defeat their salutary purposes by evasion or chicane, are justly held in detestations and deemed unworthy of any description of persons assuming the characters or stating themselves as the Representatives of nations,\"" and yet at that moment you are employed in the very   attempt by evasion and chicane to elude the convention of Saratoga. You had surmounted, possibly after many compunctious struggles, at least for the honour of human nature I hope so, but you had surmounted every sense of justice, of humanity, and of honour. Let me congratulate you on this new victory over the sense of shame. In this view you have gained at length the victory over yourselves, and may stand forth the first of philosophers in your kind, you may boast to be leaders of those, who cloathed with the dignity of national character, display the story of their own disgrace.  It is to be lamented, that on an occasion so solemn, and of such serious consequences to your reputations, we cannot derive an idea of your wisdom, equal to that which your fortitude hath impressed. It would have been glorious indeed, could you have shewn a capacity to deceive all mankind with the same facility that you set their opinions at defiance. But unfortunately this is not the case, for you have taken upon you to remonstrate against the unjust detention of the Saratoga troops. Did you consider the force of the term? If the detention is unjust, the convention is broken, if we have broken the convention you are no longer bound by it, if no longer bound in equity, a ratification extorted by the unjust detention will be void. To have released them therefore on this requisition, other objectionable circumstances being removed, would by implication have admitted you a ground whereon to build a release from your engagements; wherefore the requisition taking it conjunctively with the remonstrance contained in it, as it shews the mind an opinion which you possess so presumptively it demonstrates the conduct you mean to hold, and therefore compels-Congress to a greater caution and circumspection, being in fact a supplement to that letter of General Burgoyne which I mentioned before.  We come now to your letter of the nineteenth of September. One word more as to chronology. Your offer it seems is not only by express but recent authority, &c. If this epithet means any thing, we are to conclude that the authority was then just received. Indeed you take pains to induce that belief. But the extract you send us is dated the 12th of June, that is more than three months prior to your letter. Did you imagine the Congress had such implicit faith in your dictums, as to believe you had but just received that letter? The imposition is too glaring to pass on men of much less sagacity. What could have put it in your head that it is unprecedented to take no notice of demands by those who have no right to make them? The Lord Chief Justice of England is an officer at least as well known in the constitution of your kingdom as these new-fangled Commissioners. Suppose the Earl of Mansfield had written a letter to Congress demanding the convention troops, do- you think a neglect of this demand would have been quite unprecedented? And yet he had full  as good right to make the demand as those Commissioners; else why the express and recent authority to you? You will not surely pretend that it was sent in consequence of the neglect you complain of, for there again chronology is against you.  But let us examine this express authority. I take it such authority can be derived but two ways respecting those to whom it relates: These are dependent on the points either of sovereignty or subjection.  First then as to the sovereignty. Conceding that America is an independent power, then clearly your authority ought to be expressed in a letter of credence to Congress, which it is not.  Secondly, as to the subjection. If, as you say we are subjects, then on general principles you are not bound to keep faith with rebels. But further, your laws have expressly determined this matter by a case in point, shewing that capitulations and conventions with rebels are merely void, so that the least which could be expected is an act of Parliament. But  Thirdly, on the ground both of sovereignty and of subjection, leaving that great point in dubio, the authority should have been derived under the great seal and sign manual.  In lieu of all this you send an extract of a letter from a Secretary of State, which neither with foreign nations, nor even with your own subjects is worth a pinch of snuff; and thus you have thought proper to dubb with the sounding title of an express and recent authority from the King.  In order however to piece out the deficiencies of your ratification, you have insinuated a threat of certain consequences which are to follow from withholding a compliance with your demands. You are really a most diverting correspondent. What in the name of common sense can you mean by this and by your former menace of retaliation? Is it that if ever we are so weak as to make any agreement with you, you will break it? We always expected as much, we have told you so repeatedly, and this is one of the capital reasons why we reprobate all connection with you. Is it that you will to the utmost of your power lay waste our country? You have done this already, not excepting the territory of those poor creatures who had a confidence in your promises and an affection for your cause. Is it that you will burn our habitations? You made no small figure in that kind of business before the convention was made. Is it that you will murder prisoners in cold blood? Why even that practice, bad as it is, you are by no means unaccustomed to. This part of your letter reminds me of a speech which one of your excellent poets hath put in the mouth of a mad King. He too takes upon him to threaten those whom he cannot injure, and exclaims, \""I will do such things! What they are yet I know not.\"" (5)  To conclude, Sir Harry, though you are my enemy, I will express  to you a wish, prompted by philanthropy; it is this, that the things you have done, and the things you have meditated to do, may not totally reduce you to the situation of that unhappy creature.  I am, with the greatest respect, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant, An AMERICAN.(6)  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or the General Advertiser, October 20, 1778.  1 Sir Henry Clinton's September 19, 1778, letter to Congress demanded the Release of the Convention Army With it Clinton enclosed an extract of a June 12, 1778, letter from Lord George Germain authorizing him to give assurances that these troops would be returned to England under the terms of the agreement concluded between Gens. Horatio Gates and John Burgoyne in October 1777 and since suspended by Congress. Both the letter and the extract are in Meng, Gérard Despatches, pp. 331-32. The full text of Germain's letter is in Davies, Documents of the American Revolution, 15:139.  Congress read these documents on September 28 and instructed Secretary Thomson to return a terse reply, which he did as follows: \""Your letter of the 19th was laid before Congress and I am directed to inform you that the Congress of the United States of America make no answer to insolent letters.\"" JCC, 12:964. At the same time Congress also made plans to collect evidence of British violations of the Saratoga Convention, although apparently nothing ever came of this effort. JCC, 12:964. For a discussion of Congress' January 8, 1778, decision to suspend this agreement, see these Letters, 8:486-87.  2 For a discussion of this \""requisition,\"" see Henry Laurens to Washington, August 29, 1778, note 2.  3 Morris' surmise was correct. Clinton had received Germain's June 12 letter on August 18, 1778.

How to lessen the quantity in circulation while the war continues is the greatest difficulty, it has been proposed to Stop  OCTOBER 20, 1778  the currency of so many emissions as we wish to sink and give notes on Interest for them as our State did their Bills. Others think this would be a dangerous experiment. Some think Sufficient loans might be voluntarily obtained if the lenders were Assured that they Should be paid an equivalent in value, & that the Bills brought in Should be burnt. Some think that it would be difficult to ascertain the comparative value at the time of lending and time of payment. If we had a foreign loan of 4 or 5 million pounds Sterling in Europe on which to draw Bills we might Sell them at the current Exchange & in that way draw in & sink the currency at the rate it has been issued out: but in our present Situation it is uncertain whether Such a loan can be procured as the Security to the lenders would depend on our Supporting our Independency. It would be easy to obtain any Sums we might want if Peace was settled with Great Britain and the independency of the States acknowledged by the British Government Till then I think we must relye on our own resources. And if we can provide Such Sinking funds by taxes as will prevent further depreciation, & procure a Gradual appreciation it is as much as we can expect at present-that proper measures ought to be adopted without further delay I fully agree with you, As to the mode of doing justice to Creditors I hope the States will be able [to] devise some way consistent with the general good; there are many persons who are good Friends to our cause who have Suffered & do Still Suffer greatly & Some Orphans; some who have rented houses & other real Estates for Years are reduced to great Straits by the depreciation, and ought to be relieved in Some way or other. Certainly debtors can pay an equivalent in value as easy as tho' the money had not depreciated. I have now nothing to lose in that way but wish that none may have cause to complain of the want of public justice. We have no news here.  I am with due regards to Your Self & family, Your humble Servant, Roger Sherman (3)  ""

  My dear Sir: Philadelphia 21st Oct 1778. This will be delivered you by Major General Lincoln, a brave and able Officer, who goes to command the Troops that are to oppose any attempt of the enemy upon Charles Town in South Carolina. As the General can give you the news of this place I should not have troubled you with this letter, were it not for the following purpose. It was proposed to send 50,000 dollars to the paymaster in Virginia for the purpose of forwarding the thousand men designed to assist South Carolina-Whereupon I reminded the Congress of a motion long since laid upon their table, in consequence of letters from yourself & Mr. Page informing that arrears were due to the continental soldiers in Virginia & the militia that had been called into continental service (1)_And I proposed making the 50, an hundred thousand dollars, and to word the resolve for the purposes \""of paying the arrears due to the continental soldiers in Virginia, and to the militia of that state which had been the last year in continental service,\"" as well as for forwarding the thousand men to S. Carolina. This was readily agreed to, and the money (100,000 dollars) is ordered forward.(2) Now Sir, I presume that Gen. Lincoln will, on your application, and showing him the resolve, take measures, by ordering the payment himself if the accounts of arrear are ready, and if not, by authorizing you to call on the paymaster for the money when these accounts are prepared. I beg leave to refer you to the General for our news being in great haste. I subscribe myself wi'th much esteem and affection yours, Richard Henry Lee.  P.S. Since I wrote the letter on the other side, I find upon conversation with Gen. Lincoln that if the pay rolls of the militia should not happen to be ready when he passed through Williamsburgh, that it would not be in his power to order payment, as he could not delegate his authority-Therefore, I proposed the inclosed resolve which I hope will remove all difficulty.(3) Farewell,  R. H. Lee.  MS not found; reprinted from Henry, Patrick Henry, 3:196-97.  1 Governor Henry's May 23 letter to the Virginia delegates requesting their assistance in obtaining a settlement of the state's Continental accounts had been read in Congress on June 15, but at that time Congress ordered \""That the consideration thereof be postponed.\"" See JCC, 11:606-7; and PCC, item 71, 1:14347.  2 For this October 20 resolve, see JCC, 12:1026.  3 Congress had just authorized Benjamin Harrison, Jr., deputy paymaster in Virginia, to honor warrants drawn on Henry as soon as militia officers could submit authenticated records of service.

  Philadelphia, October 24, 1778. To the Earl of CARLISLE, Sir HENRY CLINTON, and WILLIAM EDEN, Esq;  Your Excellencies Proclamation and Manifesto of the 3d of October, is the subject of my present amusement.(1) You were commissioned for the sole purpose of amusing the Americans, and it must be confessed, even by your greatest enemies, that you have acted your parts in a masterly manner: The American nation are not a little obliged to your Excellencies for the diversion you have afforded them. This very entertaining Manifesto of yours, is addressed to the Members of Congress, the Members of the General Assemblies or Conventions of the several States in the union, and to all others, free inhabitants of those States; and therefore it naturally follows, that I may with propriety address myself to your Excellencies in return. I would not for the world omit shewing \""a just regard to the characters you bear.\""  You are pleased to say, that \""having amply and repeatedly made known to Congress, and having also proclaimed to the inhabitants of North-America in general, the benevolent overtures of Great Britain towards a union and coalition with her Colonies, you do not think it consistent, either with the duty you owe to your country, or with a just regard to the characters you bear, to persist in holding out offers, which in your estimation required only to be known to be most gratefully accepted.\"" I must confess to your Excellencies, that I think this sentence is full of dignity and elegance; it corresponds \""with the duty you owe to your country and with a just regard to the characters you bear.\"" It was not possible for me to conceive, that while you were laying down this idea, that you were resolved \""to persist in holding out offers\"" to Congress and the inhabitants of North-America, which they had treated with the most sovereign contempt. But in a moment, your manifesto convinced me, it was drawn up for the very purpose which it reprobated in the most pointed terms. Your Excellencies are happy in being possessed of a facility in reconciling to yourselves, ideas, which to the rest of the world appear utterly irreconcileable. Great poets are not confined by rules; and your Excellencies shew us, that great politicians are equally exempted.  You \""again declare\"" to Congress those offers which they have repeatedly rejected as absolutely inadmissable. Could your Excellencies flatter yourselves, that because you persisted in renewing your offers, that therefore Congress would accept them! It is true, some gallants have wooed in this manner with success, the fair being too  OCTOBER 24, 1778  gentle to resist such importunities; but the materials you are at work upon, are rather of a firmer nature. Look through the proceedings of Congress, and say whether you have found an instance of their receding from a declared determination. On the contrary, those proceedings must have convinced you, that for you \""to persist\"" in renewing your offers, is to shew the world, that you are resolved to throw away your time. I shall say nothing with respect to the offers you repeat to Congress, nor to your assertion that Congress were not authorized to reject your offers, or to refer you to foreign treaties, which though real, you are pleased now to call \""pretended.\"" Enough has been said on those subjects in several letters to your Excellencies;(2) nor do I think it consistent with a just regard to the character I bear, now to persist in repeating those arguments which fully pointed out the insidious nature of those offers, and the falsity of those assertions. But, as to your invitation to the General Assemblies separately, I must say it would be too dangerous an expedient for them to trust to, even were they disposed to relinquish their independence. And, as to your invitation to the free inhabitants individually, this is yet more exceptionable than the last. It is not by such very partial negociations, that a people are to force Britain to yield them important national advantages. And this must be obvious to every man, because during the whole course of this dispute, Britain has never been disposed to yield a single point, but when she lay under the edge of the sword of America. If then the combined wisdom and power of America is but adequate to the talk of forcing Great Britain to yield important national advantages to America, can your Excellencies really think, the General Assemblies separately, and the people individually, are so simple, as to be manifestoed by your Excellencies into a belief, that they can procure the same advantages by a disunion of counsel and of force!  \""It has not been,\"" you say, \""nor is it your wish to seek the objects which you are commissioned to pursue, by fomenting popular divisions and partial cabals.\"" \""But it is both your wish and your duty,\"" you add, \""to encourage and support any men or bodies of men in their return of loyalty to your Sovereign.\"" Now if this is not a declaration of your wish to foment popular divisions and partial cabals, I know not what can be; and if your Manifesto was not sent abroad for those purposes, I am at a loss to conceive for what purposes it was issued. You declare, you \""think such conduct would be ill suited to the generous nature of the offers made, and unbecoming the dignity of the King and the State which makes them,\"" but you do not scruple, at the same instant, to act diametrically contrary to your declaration \""amply made known.\"" By your conduct you clearly advise us to place no confidence in what you say, and yet you go on proclaiming.  Your Excellencies tell us, that, \""if there are any who think,\"" \""the independence of these\"" States \""will in the result, be acknowledged by Great Britain, to them you answer without reserve that you neither possess or expect powers for that purpose; and that if Great-Britain could ever have sunk so low as to adopt such a measure, you should not have thought yourselves compellable to be the instruments in making a concession\"" of independence. Here are many words, let us see what they amount to.  There was no occasion for your Excellencies to take the trouble to acquaint us, that you do not possess powers authorizing you to acknowledge our independence; because the act of Parliament, on which your commission is founded, had long ago fully informed us upon that point. Whether you expect such powers, is of but little moment. Because you did not expect to receive such powers, it does not therefore follow, that such powers will not be placed in the hands of other persons. The British Commanders in Chief have been changed; and so may the British Commissioners, and for the same cause, the want of success. We see these things, and we then see how idle it is for your Excellencies to endeavour to give to a very trifle, an air of importance. But you add, if you had received such powers, you should not have thought yourselves compellable to be the instruments in making a concession of independence. It is true, nothing can be more legal than your opinion, that you would not have been compellable. But it is not in the least probable, that men, as your Excellencies, who have long been used to obey the directions of their superiors, and who voluntarily submitted to engage in a business, in which others expressly reserved to themselves a power, to disown all their important contracts and to destroy all their labours, I say, it is not very probable such men would be very scrupulous about being the instruments in making a concession of independence to America. However, I need not press this point; you have not said, that you would not be the instruments, you have only said, you were not compellable. When profound statesmen, as your Excellencies, are covert in their expressions, they always have an important reservation. I therefore admit your dictum upon the subject of compulsion, and give you credit for what you mean; nor can your Excellencies desire that I should do more.  You have declared that your Manifesto and Proclamation shall continue in force \""forty days,\"" and that, except Sir Henry Clinton, you have \""resolved to return to England a few weeks after the date\"" of it. And this is a very explicit declaration, that you despair that your Manifesto will be attended with success, it is perfectly decisive. If you expected success, you must have been sensible that success would have required your stay in America several months; but by limiting yourselves to \""a few weeks,\"" and forty days are near six, you demon-  strate in the most unequivocal manner, that you absolutely despair of success. The Americans have withstood your most violent efforts to subdue them, and now even the timid whigs and tories must be too prudent to submit to you; when having seen the British power in America broken, they now hear you tell them, you despair, they will do as you advise. This last stroke of your Excellencies, is truly a masterly stroke in politicks.  Until the publication of your inimitable Manifesto, we had yet to learn, that \""the policy,\"" as well as the benevolence of Great-Britain have thus far checked the extremes of war, when they tended to dis- tress a people still considered as your fellow subjects, and to desolate a country shortly to become again a source of mutual advantage.\"" For America then had in her eye, the ruins of Charles-Town, Falmouth, Norfolk, Esopus, Bordentown, Warren, Bristol and Bedford; and the desolations about Philadelphia, on the banks of Hudson's river, in Wyoming, German Flatts, in Jersey, in Rhode Island-a mournful and wanton scene of destruction! America had at that moment also deeply impressed in her mind, the agonies of her sons in the prisons and prison-ships at New-York, where many hundreds died of hunger, cold, suffocation and filth, after having endured the most taunting, pointed and continued insults of their keepers. The wife who appeared at the prison door, with a morsel of bread and a blanket for the wretch within, was beat down with a musket. The officer on the part of America was prevented from furnishing the prisoners with food and raiment. In the morning the prisoners were supplied with water in those very tubs, which were but just emptied of the exerements with which they had filled them during the night. Great-Britain has instigated the Savages to massacre men, women and children. Her troops have refused to grant quarter in innumerable instances. The venerable General Mercer died of the wounds he received after he fell and was made prisoner upon the field of battle, as did Lieutenant Lang, who received no less than nineteen bayonet wounds after he had fallen. I write not at random; I minutely know these transactions, which with many others of a similar nature will by authority be published to the world by affidavits. Your Excellencies, Sir Henry Clinton excepted, may be strangers to these horrid enormities, but they are true. They call down the vengeance of Heaven upon your nation: That vengeance is now shaking your nation to the very centre: She feels the dreadful shock, and trembles in despair!  It is no less pleasant than useful, now and then, to look into history, and see in what manner men, in your and our circumstances, spoke and acted. The allegiance of Great Britain was in the year 1688 withdrawn from James the Second, because he invaded their laws and fundamental constitution. The allegiance of America in the  year 1776 was withdrawn from George the third, for the same reasons. As long as King James thought he could recover his throne by force of arms, so long he spoke in the loftiest tone-Executioners were to be the avengers of his wrongs: And in like manner, as long as the Court of Great-Britain thought they were able to conquer America, so long that Court demanded an unconditional submission from America. In the year 1692 all King James's hopes of seizing the throne were blasted, and on the 17th of April following he issued a declaration professing that he desired \""rather to be beholden to his subjects love to him, than to any other expedient whatever, for his restoration:\"" Promising that he would be \""ready to redress all their grievances, and give all those securities of which they should stand in need,\"" if they would submit to his authority. So in the year 1777 the British Government having lost a compleat army, finding they had not an ability to supply the men and money necessary to carry on the war, and losing all hopes of conquest, on the 13th of April following they appointed Commissioners to go out and talk to us about \""cordial reconciliation,\"" of restoring \""free intercourse,\"" and reviving \""mutual affection;\"" and to promise us \""the irrevocable enjoyment of every privilege that is short of a total separation of interests,\"" provided we would consent to return to a subjection under the Crown of Great-Britain. It is curious to observe how exactly parallel the two cases are.  There was a sensible Whig \""answer to the late King James's last declaration.\"" I beg leave to shew your Excellencies in what light the people of England in that day considered an invitation to return to a subjection under a cast off monarch. The writer of the answer says, \""I challenge all the late King's declaration-makers, to give me but one single instance from history, that ever a free people, who from a just and recent sense of an invasion upon their laws and fundamental constitution, had withdrawn their allegiance from him, did ever afterwards willingly and tamely submit to his government again. No, there is not one instance of this kind, in all the records of time: for, though scarce one age has passed without some remarkable revolution in kingdoms and states; yet a thing of this nature was never yet heard of since the world was.\"" \""But to submit the dearest and most sacred things, that a man can possess on earth, the liberties, laws, and fundamental constitutions of his country, all that either he or his children after him can call or wish their own: To submit all these, I say, to a few feeble promises of one that has broke to us much more solemn ones before, were a madness that never a nation under Heaven was yet guilty of. As it is the easiest thing in the world to promise largely, when a man finds it his interest to do so; so it is ordinarily the last refuge weak minds have recourse to, when all other means of compulsion or persuasion fail. But at the same time, he that   threatens highly, when he thinks he has power in his hands to make his threats good, and comes thereafter to cajole with soft promises of good treatment, when that power is gone; one must divest himself of common sense, if he believe that that man's mind is really changed for the better, and does not ascribe the change of his manner of treating with us, to the change of his fortune.\""  Such were the sentiments of the people of England upon King James's declaration: They are my sentiments upon the present offers of Great Britain; and I believe your Excellencies are convinced, they are the sentiments upon the same subject, of that part of the inhabitants of America, who have broken the force of Britain, and are able to maintain the independence of their country.  Judge then of the contempt with which we receive your threats, that if we persist in our independence, the question with you is, \""how far Great-Britain may by every means in her power destroy\"" America. Such a declaration on your part, does no honor to your masters, to your nation, or to yourselves. It is an outrage upon humanity. It is a proof of a narrow and base mind. But your Excellencies will do well to foresee, that in case your threat shall be begun to be carried into execution, that then it will be a question with us, how far we shall hold General Burgoyne's army responsible for the effects of your fury. I warn you, that as you burn our towns, so shall I urge to decimate your legions. I say thus much, rather to shew you that we have the means of retaliation in our hands, than because I apprehend you will drive us into such a measure. You have all along endeavoured to bully us; an old custom is not easily laid aside, and therefore you continue to threaten. God has raised us to independence, and we rest assured that Britain cannot deprive us of it. You have tried the art of persuasion, and Governor Johnstone has attempted the art of corruption, to induce us to relinquish our independence.

  Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 24. 1778  A fleet from New York Consisting of 16 Ships of the line & upwards of 100 Transports sailed a few days [ago] with Troops & heavy Cannon on bord, their destination is at present a Secret. Congress are much Alarmed fearing they may intend for the Southward (Chas. Town) which has induced them to Call upon No. Carolina for a greater body of men than I suppose can be raised in time to prevent the Enemy's Designs. Your Excellency will perceive it to be the desire of Congress that you should put yourself at the head of the Troops from your State & should you be inclined to do so, have given you the rank & pay &c of a Major Genl. in the Continental Army. Genl. Howe is ordered to head quarters, and Genl. Lincoln an Officer of great Military merit is Appointed to the Command in the Southern Department.  I hope Your Excellency has long since received the 400,000 Dollars for Bounty pay &c of the last levies. 150,000 more will in a few days be sent to Mr. Wm. Blount (1) for the use of the Troops to be sent to So. Carolina where One Million more will be sent for the expense of this Expedition. Genl. Washington apprehensive that the enemy may intend an Attack upon Boston, has Ordered on Genl. Gates to the eastward with a large detachment from the main Army. Should the Enemy Appear on that Coast, I suppose all New England will be in Motion. Some among us think this fleet has sailed either for Europe or the W India Islands. Whether N York & R Island will be evacuated by the Enemy this fall, seems at present very doubtful. The Newspapers inclosed will give you an Opportunity of forming a Conjecture of the Enemy's designs, you will find the last Speech and Dying words of the British Commissioners, with the Comments upon it by Common Sense.(2)  I beg Your excellency will not take amiss, by Once more reminding you of the Necessity of sending on as soon as possible The State Account against the Continent. Ths Charge against No. Carolina in the Treasury Books is 1,075,543 29/90 dollars, when Other States which have had ten times the money expended in them do not stand Chargable with more than 500,000 Dollars. And this entirely Owing to their having a Military Chest established within them & constantly supplied out of the Treasury of the Continent, exclusive of Commissaries, Quarter Masters &c who never Called upon the State for Money.  27. Octr. Since writing the Above & meeting with no Opportunity of sending it forward but by Post, I have Inclosed a paper of this date. It is now believed the Enemy really intend to Evacuate N York.

  Dear Sir Philada. 24th Octr 1778 I was not a little surprized yesterday at seing a Letter from you to Mr. S. Adams by Mr Archer,(1) in wch you make no sort of acknowledgemt of any of my numerous Scrawls; 14 or 15 have at least gone on the Way to you.(2) I have felt myself lately under the necessity of letting you go by guess as to what we are doing here. Congress have the Papers of the Committee for foreign affairs on their Table, and are taking their own Time to execute any Thing material for you to know; therefore I would not take upon myself to give you any Detail of those matters, further than to say that the Presence of Mr. Deane and Mr. Carmichael seems rather to perplex than clear our Views. Those Gentlemen having been at Variance for a Season and now cordially reconciled, there is a sort of a Task in accommodating the Meaning of Expressions used at different Periods under the Influence of different Passions. The only Results of Interrogatories I forsee must therefore be the Loss of that Time which had better be spent in attending to our Finances. And here, by the Way, I must ask what are become of your Terrors on that Score. Not a Word of Finance in your Letter to Mr. S. A. Do you not know that our Depreciation of Currency is the main Stay of our Enemies. We must immediately Loan 60,000,000 out of circulation & tax vigorously, or we shall be all afloat. Can we not borrow in your Neighbourhood? But, you are a wrong Man to ask. You are averse to Debts abroad. Believe me, it is the general Opinion here that our Sons & Grandchildren ought rightfully to pay a part of the purchase we are  OCTOBER 24, 1778  now making for them. We must therefore contract abroad a Debt for the Payment of which a sinking Fund must be established here. This need not hinder us from rendering such a Provision repealable by the Sale of Property which may easily be acquired southward of Georgia and Eastward of the Province of Maine.  I have been & am much unwell. I have escaped a settled nervous Fever by Care upon the most violent Symptoms. Writing hurts me. Your affectate. Frd & Servt.(3) James Lovell  ""

  My dear Sir, Philade Octob 25. 1778 Your Favor of the 24th of May did not reach my hand till yesterday.(1) The Gentleman who brought it, Mr Archer, tells me he had a Passage of Eleven Weeks. I will show him the Respect due to the Character you give him, & properly regard such future Recommendations as may come from you.  I suppose you have been fully & officially informed of the State of our military Affairs since the Enemy evacuated this City and met with a Drubbing at Monmouth. And as publick Letters will doubtless be forwarded by this Conveyance, it is needless for me to give you a particular Detail of what has happend since. By those Letters you will be informd that Dr Franklin is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary at Versailes. It is not yet determined how you will be disposd of; but as Congress entertain great Expectations from your Services, you may depend upon Employment being allotted for you somewhere.(2) The critical Situation of the Powers of Europe in general, renders it somewhat difficult for us to determine, to which of them to make our Addresses at present. Every Cabinet I suppose is busily engagd in making the necessary Arrangements and preparing for the opening of a Campaign, if War should take Place. In this Case, I should think France must be our Pole Star, while it continues, and our Connections must be formd with hers. In the mean time however, Holland, whose Policy is always to be at Peace, may be open for a Negociation; and in my opinion, we ought to take the earliest opportunity to tempt her.  The two main Armies at & near New York have been quiet since the Enemy retreated to that City. We have made another Expedition against Rhode Island. Our Arms were not disgracd, though we did not succeed to our Wishes. Genl S (3) behavd as usual with Bravery; but some will have it that there is a Mixture of Imprudence in every thing he does. He promisd himself to share with Gates in the Glory of Victory, and as an officer of Spirit, no doubt he felt vexed with the Disappointment; but he was too sanguine in my Opinion, when  OCTOBER 25, 1778  he expected that the Count D Estaing would remain there, in the Circumstances which he was thrown into by a violent Storm he met with when in Pursuit of Lord Howe. This unforeseen & unavoidable Accident left him too much inferior to the British Squadron to run the Risque with any Degree of Prudence. It was a Misfortune which we all regret, but must bear. Knowing the high Temper of the People of my native Town, I immediately upon hearing it, wrote to some of the principal Men to prevent Blame being cast on the Count for leaving Rhode Island; a Disposition which I apprehended the artful Tories (for such there are even there) would encourage with a View of discrediting our new and happy Alliance, in the Minds of injudicious Whigs. I am happy to be informd that the Count and his Officers, and indeed every french Gentleman is treated there with the highest Marks of Respect and Friendship.  For some Weeks past there have been Reports here that the Enemies Troops at N York were about to embark, as they gave out on a grand Expedition, and we are now assured that Sixteen Sail of the Line and about one hundred and fifty Transports put to Sea on Tuesday the 20th Inst. Various are the Conjectures of their Destination. Whether to Boston, South Carolina or the West Indies, a few Days will decide. The Count D Estaing has sufficiently securd his Ships in Case of an Attack on them; and if they land their Troops with Intent to march them to Boston, it is my opinion they will repent of their Expedition. It appears to me most probable that the Troops are bound to the West Indies, and that the Ships of War, after having convoyd them to a certain Latitude will return for the Protection of the Garrisons which I suppose are to be left at Newport and New York. The Enemy will be loth to quit the small Portion of Land they possess within the United States; for though they must despair of subduing us by Arms, it will be necessary for them to oblige us to continue the Expence of large Armies in order to nonplus us in the Art of financiering. This may be a Method of carrying on the Contest, the most puzzling to us; but I trust we shall disappoint them.  The Marquiss De la Fayette whose extraordinary Merit is fully known to you, does me the Honor of taking the Care of this Letter, and will deliver it to you.(4)  I am, my dear Sir, with the greatest Sincerity, your affectionate, Saml Adams  ""

  Dear Sir Philad. Oct. 25. 1778. I should be exceedingly unhappy if you impute the Delay of acknowledging your Favours of the 16 Sept. & 6th Octob. to any other Cause than a great Hurry of Business & Absence from the City on a publick Acct. Last Evening I received your Favour of the 13th Instant & devote the Hours of Rest to make you a Return.  You may remember we fixed a Rule to be observed in Case any Gentleman was injured in his Rank by our Arrangement viz. That he should apply to the Brigadier & Field Officers of the Regt. to which he belonged & obtain a Certificate of their Opinion which should intitle him to have an Alteration. I have no Doubt but the Case of Mr Bankson & others is as stated, but I fear that having laid  OCTOBER 25, 1778  down a Rule we may be blamed for departing from it, if any other Persons should conceive themselves affected by the Alteration. There will be Time to hear from you again before Publication, so that if our Idea is wrong you can set us right.  The Case of the eldest Lieutenant (when a Captain has taken the Captain Liutenancy) having the Rank of Capt. Lieutenant appears so reasonable that we shall recommend it & have no Doubt it will be adopted.  I was in Hopes that Mentges's & Murray's Promotion had been got over, after being stirrd while we were with you & seemingly submitted to by all except Mr. Lenox who resigned & came away. But since it is otherwise I wish you would converse with his Excelly. upon the Subject. I well remember that conceiving Mentgez to have got extravagant Promotion I had conceived a Design of raising up some of the Captains whom he had displaced, but the General represents that upon the Formation of the new Army in 1776 there was no fixed Rule of Promotion & that any Retrospect so as to deprive an Officer of Rank actually given him at that Time (however, improperly) would unsettle the whole Line of the Continent & introduce endless Confusion, I gave up my Sentiments & concluded it must be submitted to as an Evil. However if it can be rectified with the Generals Concurrence, by submitting the Claim to a Board of Officers I am sure the Committee will concur in any Alteration, but if it cannot be had without real & essential Injury to the Service, I trust the Gentlemen have more Virtue, & good Sense than to insist upon it.  The Case of the Gentlemen who by the Fortune of War have become Prisoners & now wish to serve again is one in which the Interests of Humanity & Justice are deeply interested & I must frankly acknowledge that I do not see how we can exclude them without a manifest Violation of the plainest Rules of Honour & Gratitude.  There are many of them who having no Title to enter into any particular Regiment must be admitted somewhere in the Line, or you tell them in the same Instt., that they shall come in, but there is no Place for them, which amounts to telling them they shall not come in at all. If you put them upon the Regiments other than the 1st, 2d, 3d & 5th, & 7th, they will complain of it as an Act of Injustice. It would be cruel to say these Officers have not fought & suffered equally with those who have not been captured-they turn'd out as early in the Cause, if not more so, & now to discard them utterly, appears to me so great a Hardship that I know not how to think of it much more consent to it, & I hope the Gentlemen who are affected so much by it, will on this Occasion apply the Golden Rule-change Places for a Moment & think how they would like to be thus rewarded for a faithful & honourable Discharge of their Duty. We have recommended the Arrangement to Congress on this Principle previ-  ous to the Receipt of your Letters, & as we acted upon it when at Camp, which was acquiesed in at least for ought we know, I cannot but flatter myself, that Justice, Magnaminity, & public Spirit will induce the Gentlemen to receive among them with Cordiality their brave Fellow Soldiers who have been long languishing in cruel Captivity & thirst for Revenge.  But if these Considerations have not the proper Effect upon the Matter being laid before the General & by him transmitted to Congress-I make no Doubt every Thing will be done that is reasonable & proper.  I cannot but regret as a publick Loss the Resignation of such Officers as Col. Frazer, Col. Johnston, & Colonel Miller & Colonel Robinson. We shall not easily replace them; but as [it] is to [be] expected that the private Affairs of many Officers will call them home, & the Appearance of publick Affairs is now so favourable to the Interests of America, they have the Pleasure of reflecting that they did not leave the Ship till she was in smooth Water, & in Sight of a Harbour.  I do not know whether the Return of some Gentlemen into the State may not be useful-the Tories are yet unhumbled & the extraordinary Attention paid them by some Gentlemen of Rank both in Congress & out of it, has had a very mortifying Influence upon the Minds of those who have partook of the publick Danger & run all Hazards. Characters are hourly emerging from Obscurity into which they had thrown themselves to avoid Notice, & are now putting in their Claims to those Rewards which are due only to those of a different Stamp. The Stale Pretence is an Alteration of the Government which if to be done by the Whigs I dare say would be attended with little Difficulty, but it is very evident that their Designs are deeper & that it is intended to let in the Tories & Quakers. A Ticket was tried by some you would not suspect, with Mr. Chews Name & others of the like Stamp, but this was too premature to take Effect tho it plainly shews what is intended & what we have to expect another Day. In my own Part provided it is a Government by Whigs I do not care who they are or where they come from.  I am sorry you have so much Difficulty & Dissatisfaction among the Gentlemen of the Line but it is a Duty we owe them & our Country to comply with all their reasonable requests & patiently to hear their Pretensions. In a Service where from the Poverty of the Country, Honour, & a Consciousness of having made that Country free, are like to be the brave Man's principal Reward I hope none will have Reason to think they are neglected or overlook'd.(1) If I can be of any Service to you here pray command me. I should be sorry to miss an Oppy. to shew you how much I am, Dr Sir, Your very sincere well wisher & Obed. Hble. Serv. Jos. Reed OCTOBER 26, 1778  ""

  Dr General. Philadelphia 26th Octr. 1778 I received your Favor and return you Thanks for it.(1) The Conduct which the Enemy may pursue with Relation to us is not quite decided. But I have not a Doubt but their Efforts during the next Campaign will be chiefly towards our Frontiers with a View to weary us into Submission. At the same Time they will perhaps endeavor to keep such Posts in our Country as to render the Communications tedious, difficult and expensive. My Ideas as to our Power of carrying on the War differ in some Respects from those whose Opinions I respect. The Resources of the Country may be drawn forth by our Paper at the same Time it must be confessed that this Paper will thereby be less valuable. After all the Debt does not increase for a certain Sterling Sum which would have paid it one Year ago will pay it now. The Depreciation in the Interim hath operated as a Tax.  I very sincerely lament that this Tax hath fallen heavy on those who have served and continue to serve their country. It is a peculiar Hardship upon us that fully to relieve the Evils they labor under is not in our Power. This leads me To the Petition you mention or Representation which I have not yet seen and never wish to see.(2) I cannot easily express to you how much I was hurt at being informed of it. Not indeed as to the Matter for that I really am a Stranger to but as to the Manner in which it was procured. For in the first Place it gave my Enemies (and who were so in some Degree for my earnest Support of the Claims of the Army heretofore) no small Cause of Triumph. This say they is the Consequence of your Zeal for an OCTOBER 26, 1778  Establishment. Besides this I considered myself in some Degree as an Advocate for the Army. I loved them from an Acquaintance with some Individuals and for the Sufferings which as a Body they had bravely and patiently endured; and therefore I could not but suffer when I found them taking Steps which In my Opinion cannot do them Honor and which incapacitated me from urging as I otherwise should have done every Redress in our Power to their Grievances. But what chiefly affected me was that this Meeting of Delegates from Brigades in a Mixture of civil and military Capacity carries with it the Air of deeper Design than I believe is in the Bosoms of those who were immediately concerned. It was by Proceedures such as these that the good Fairfax made Way for a crafty Cromwell and that he dismissed a tedious Wrangling Parliament and established a military Despotism. It is a melancholy Evil that when once Faction takes Possession of the human Heart men are hurried into Extremes which make considerate People tremble. I will not do your Army the Injustice even to permit a Thought that they wish to get Rid of their General. But Sir their and your and our Enemies do not want the Confidence to say so and indeed to say they can prove it and to attempt that Proof from the Manner of proving (Agitating as they term it); the Petition in Question. Certainly could such Ideas be inculcated it would answer th[eirl Views. It would also answer their Views to instill into the Army a Distrust of Congress and therefore I doubt not but the Enemies of both are assiduous in this Business. I find also the British commissioners are so barefaced as to hold out the Bait of Promotion in the Royal Army to such as will fall in with their Designs and doubtless a peculiar Portion of their Bounty will be disposed to those who shall sow the seeds of Dissention in an Army which as they cannot conquer it is their only Resource to divide.  Thinking on this Subject as I do it did and does appear to me my Duty as a good Citizen thoroughly to discountenance every Measure of this Kind particularly when it is ushered as the first Mention of this Affair was to me by an Observation that the Army had it in their Power to do themselves Justice. It makes me unhappy to learn that such Discourse prevails. I am certain those who use it have no Design but they should consider that it affords Matter for the Design of others to work upon. It has not made any serious Impression I believe on the Mind of those whose opinions have real Weight because it is considered as one of those light Expressions which flow from the Luxuriance of Imagination. Little do those who say such things know the Difficulties of subsisting an Army.  The Marquis will hand you a Plan &ca on which I shall say Nothing because I have already had a great Deal of Trouble with it and he can say more than I could write in a Week and you know more of the Subject than all of Us.(3)   We have no News. Let me then tell you what has the Merit of Truth if not the Charms of Novelty. That I am Dear General, very sincerely yours, Gouv Morris  [P.S.] General Lee's Affair hangs by the Eye Lids. We spent one Day upon it without even touching on the Merits. The Debate was in what Manner to proceed to a Decission. Some contended for the Propriety of resolving simply to approve or disapprove of the Sentence. Others for entering into the Consideration of the Charges and the Evidence on them separately without however making an Entry on the Minutes. A third for doing this and making the Entries. This as the most systematic Method I supported for truly I know not how to determine in the Lump. Granting him guilty of all the Charges it is too light a Punishment. And if he is not guilty in the Opinion of Congress of any one there would be an Injustice in not declaring their Opinion.  Conway hath again applied for a Certificate of his good Services and I have again opposed the Grant of it. His Letter lies on the Table.(4) Again my Friend Adieu.  Pray Excuse me to Generals Greene and Schuyler for not Writing by this Opportunity. Upon my Honor I have so many Things to do that I am much distrait. Tell Genl.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia October 27th 1778 In Reading the Several letters & other Publications of the Brittish Commisrs, you will observe that they are Constantly Endeavouring to make people on both Sides the water, Believe, That Congress Have Exceeded their powers in Rejecting their (the Commisionrs) offers of Reconcilliation & Entering into an Alliance with France; and that in both of these instances The Congress had acted Contrary to the Sentiments of their Constituents. Whither they are really Deceived by the Tory accounts they Receive from the Several States, Or whither they mean to Deceive others, I am not Certain; But of this I am Certain, that So long as Brittain has the Smallest hope Remaining of these States Submitting again to her Domination, She will never Recognize our Independance & Consequently the war must Continue. It is therefore our interest to Convince Brittain & Every Body else, that the French Alliance and the Rejection of the Brittish Commisrs offers of Reconcilliation are universally approved of by these States: For this purpose I Should think it would be proper for the legislatures of the Several States in this union (as of their own motion without the advice of Congress) to pass Resolves Signifying their Approbation of those measures: And in order effectually to Cut off All their pretences for applying to individual States or persons, To Resolve that the Congress of the united States are Solely vested with power on our part for Contracting foreign Alliances, for making & Conducting war & for Restoring peace, and that They & They only have full power for making peace with Brittain on the principles of our absolute Independance & not other wise; and that these States Repose Entire Confidence in them for those purposes.  If the Several States would carefully Draw up & unanimously pass Such Resolves, publish them to the world in the public newspapers and Send attested Copies to their Delegates in Congress to be made use of as occasion might Require, I am persuaded that it would effectually cut off all the hopes our Enemies may Still Entertain of their  OCTOBER 27, 1778  being able to Devide & flatter us into Submission, And as they are now Convinced that they are not able to Conquer us by force, I Doubt not Such Resolves would greatly facillitate their acknowledging our Independance and offering us reasonable terms of peace.  I Believe Such Resolves will be passed by Several of the Legislatures, and as our Assembly will likely be Seting when you Receive this, I thought proper just to Hint the matter to you for your Consideration.(1) In the Enclosed papers you will find the Remarks of Common Sense on the Commisionrs Manifesto, also a Geneuine petition of the Refugees in New York to the Commisrs. The petition appears so ridiculous that I Should not have believed it Geneuine had we not had the best proof of its authenticity.  You have heard I Doubt not that Mr Simpson (2) has the Command of the Ranger & that she togather with the Boston & Providence may be hourly Expected at Boston.  As my power of Representing the State will Expire next Saturday, I expect to set out for Newhampshire the Begining of next week and hope proper Care will be taken to Keep up a Representation here.(3) I am Sir with great Respect, your most Obedient Servant,  Josiah Bartlett ""

  Dear Sir Philadela. Oct. the 27th. 1778. A considerable Detachment consisting of the new levies left New York the beginning of last Week. It is believed they sailed directly for the West Indies.  By a letter recd. from Lord Sterling yesterday Morning it appears that the Troops on Staten Island are ready to embark and only wait for the return of part of their Regiments sent on the late Expedition to Egg Harbour. They are destroying their fortifications which puts it out of doubt, that they do not mean to hold that Island this Winter.  I should be obliged to you Sir to inform me whether the State has any cloathing for their Officers. Their Wants are great and distressing, and unless they are supplied it will be out of their power to continue in the Service. Some of them, I am told are at this time so circumstanced, that unless they have speedy relief it will be impossible for them to do their Duty. To purchase out of their pay would leave them pennyless for eight Months in the year-A suit of cloaths will cost them seven or eight months pay, and when obtained will not last them above five months; in this way many of them have spent their patrimonies and unless they can now find some resources in the public Benevolence, they must leave a Service in which they can no longer exist. If there are any Measures which can be fallen upon, in which I can be of Service, I should be happy in affording every assistance in my power. Would it not be a desirable thing to know the real State of the officers by sending some person to Camp for that purpose. The Men I expect will be provided for; fifteen thousand compleat Suits I am told are now on the way to camp, and materials sufficient in hand to Cloath the whole army.  I am Sir with great respect to you and the Council, your obedt. and hble Servt. J. Henry Jun.  ""

  My dear Brother, Philadelphia Octr. 27th. 1778 The Marquis Fayette left us to day for Boston where he is to embark. This letter will follow him with our dispatches. I wish that a true friendship may take place between you and the Marquis, because I discern in this young Nobleman those principles that I think cannot fail to render him a great Man. And his virtue is such as will make him superior to all those mean and selfish considerations which mark too many.

Even {virtue}t will not do alone, the strictest {appearance} must accompany this, where enemies are numerous, wicked, and inquisitive, and where the most laudable actions may be misinterpreted, and by the artful mixture of innocent truth with much falsehood, can impose on weak  OCTOBER 27, 1778  minds and such as are more than half willing to be imposed on, infinite care is necessary. I am much mistaken if your honest zeal in your Countries cause concerning the {unexecuted article }s of the { treaty} will not be diligently both from { hence } and with { you } be used to { ruin} you with the { court } of F__e (2) Will it not be well, besides taking other wise precautions, to speak to the {minister}(3) with the candor, firmness, and sincerity, on this subject, that becomes a Man concerned in the wellfare of his Country? The whole tribe of wicked ones at Passy and all their Coadjutors will be employed in this nefarious business-But a sensible and virtuous Minister will esteem the integrity of a Man who faithfully discharges his trust by seeing and pursuing the interest of his Country, in the Station you have been in. The wickedness of Deane and his party exceeds all belief, and must in the end fail them notwithstanding the Art with which they clothe themselves. The wicked and some weak can alone support them No Man knows better than Deane how to avail himself of the glare cast around him by the favor of the Great, which mere circumstances, not his merit or his virtue have procured him. This Wretch would rise upon the ruin of the first, the firmest, and most uniform friends of this Country and of France. But I trust all his Manoeuvres will fail him. If you have time it may be well to give his papers to Congress, which are now sent you,(4) a well considered and well established refutation-I can detect, as I read it, numerous falsehoods and sophistry.  Give my respects to Mr. Izard and tell him I greatly admire his spirit and good sense. Remember what I have written you about Ludwell, my bark, & Spectacles. Let the Alderman know that his affairs at Green Spring are under the care of an Able Stewart.  I am most sincerely and affectionately yours,  Richard Henry Lee P.S.

  Sir Philadelphia Octr. 27th. 1778 The great affairs of Finance, and the Clothing Department are yet unfinished-the delay of these important matters gives me great anxiety. I have used my utmost endeavours to forward them. I wish another Delegate might be immediately sent from Connecticut- was in hopes Col. Dyer would have come before now. The Committee appointed to consider your Excellency's letter respecting the late Commissary Trumbull's affairs, have not yet made report, tho' I understand they are ready when Congress can receive it. I dont know what their Report will be. The affair of the currency is to be further considered to day.(1) The members in general seem to be at a loss what can be done to restore its credit. The plan that appears to me most probable to be adopted, is to recommend to the Legislatures of the several States immediately to pass acts to raise by taxes about five millions dollars annually for eighteen or twenty years, as a sinking fund, sufficient for the redemption of all the Bills and Loan Office certificates, to take out of currency about fifty millions Dollars by loan, to lay a tax of about twelve or thirteen millions dollars for the expence of the next year; and if further emissions are necessary; that additional funds be provided for sinking them within the time limited for sinking those that are now outstanding; so that the possessors of the Bills and lenders of money be able to make a just estimate of the value of their securities.(2) A note for £100 on compound interest, payable at the expiration of 20 years would be equal to one for £321 for the same term without interest. If the Bills of public credit, so far as they exceed a sufficient quantity for a medium of trade, are to be considered only as securities for money without interest, rebating the compound interest for the time before they are redeemable will determine their present value, and they will gradually appreciate as the time of their redemption approaches. Enclosed is a computation of the annual increase of £100 for 21 years on compound interest. I wish to be favored with your Excellency's opinion on the best mode of establishing the credit of the currency. I expect that it will be referred to the several States to clothe their quotas of the army for the future, and that the Continental clothing on hand, and which may be imported in consequence of orders already given will be divided to the several States in some just proportion.  There has been a late embarkation of troops at New York, but we dont yet learn their destination. We hear they are leaving Staten Island. Some think they are about to abandon New York and leave the country. Others conjecture they will make an attack on Boston, and attempt to destroy the French fleet.  OCTOBER 27, 1778  We have no late advices from Europe-no letter from Mr. John Adams in France has been received of later date than last May.  I am with the greatest Respect and Esteem, Your Excellency's Obedient humble Servant, Roger Sherman  ""

Our finances want the support of a Loan in Europe. 81,500,000 of dollars with increasing demands as depreciation advances with emission, cannot be cured by the slow working of Taxes. The latter is, I believe, deeply gone into by all the States.  I have seen your letter to our common friend Mr. S.

  Sir Philadelphia Octr. 31. 1778  I take the liberty to address you (1) on a Subject which to me appears to be of a very dangerous and alarming nature. I am informed that the Inhabitants of a number of Towns in the State of New Hamshire on the East side of Connecticut River, have withdrawn from the Jurisdiction of that State, and joined with the people of the Grants, on the west Side of the River in forming a distinct State. The Strength of the united States lies in their union; they by their joint efforts under the Smiles of Divine Providence have made a Succesful resistance to the power of Great Britain Aided by foreign Mercenaries: but if Intestine divisions and contentions take place among them, will they not become an easy prey to a formidable enemy?  Whether the State of New Hamshire or New York have a right of Jurisdiction over the New Hamshire Grants on the west Side of Connecticut River, or whether by the neglect of the former to Claim and Support its Jurisdiction against the latter, the people have a right to form themselves into a distinct State, I shall not give any opinion, those questions will I Suppose at a proper time be judicially decided.  But for people Inhabiting within the known & acknowleged boundaries of any of the united States to Seperate without the consent of the State to which they belong, appears to me a very unjustifiable violation of the Social compact, and pregnant with the most ruinous consequences. Sir I dont know whether you live in one of the revolted Towns, but as you are in that vicinity, I trust from my acquaintance with your love of Order, and regard for the welfare of Your Country, You will use Your influence to discourage every thing that in your opinion may be injurious to the true Interest of these States. If the present Constitutions of any of the States is not So perfect as could be wished, they may & probably will by common consent be amended; but in the mean time & under present circumstances, it appears to me indispensibly necessary that civil Government Should be vigorously Supported. I hope you will excuse the freedom I have taken on this occasion, as my Sole motive is the public good. I am with Esteem & regard, Your humble Servant.  ""

Application having been repeatedly made by us in Europe for an exchange of Prisoners without effect-the promise given by the Minister of the King of CT. Britain-that they shoud be sent as soon as  NOVEMBER 1, 1778  possible to America to be exchanged-having been violated-many of them, on the contrary, Who are Fathers of Families in America, [bei]ng compelld into distant & fatal Climates & there apparently condemnd to perpetual servitude, has rendered it our indispensable duty to recommend to your retaliation.  You will change the liberal & humane treatment by the example of which you have so long endeavord to reform the conduct of our Enemies, into the utmost measure of severity & indignities that have been or may be exercisd upon our fellow Citizens, or upon the Subjects of our Allies. You will refuse them the indulgencies hitherto granted when taken-you will straiten their confinement-& abridge the quantity & quality of their provisions; according to the severe rule laid down & practisd by our Enemies. No distinction of rank whatsoever must be made between the officers & common men.

Nov. 1, 78 I duly recd your favor of Octo by the last Post, and should have immediately answerd it had I not been that day exceedingly engagd.(1) I do not keep Copies of all my Letters. They are Trifles. You was mistaken in supposing that I ascribd the Independence of America to N[ew] E[ngland] only. I never was so assuming as to think so. My words are that America is obligd to Mass., and this is an acknowledgd Truth. It is the opinion of others as well as my self, that the Principles and Manners of New England from time to time led to that great Event. I pray God she may ever maintain those Principles, which in my Opinion, are essentially necessary to support NOVEMBER 1, 1778  & perpetuate her Liberty. You may see my Sentiments of the Patriotism of other States in the Union, in a Letter I lately wrote to Mrs. A (if it is in Being), in which I relate a Conversation which passd between Monsieur_____ and my self.(2) But enough of this. I love my Country. My Fears concerning her are that she will ruin herself by Idolatry.  A part of your Letter you tell me is confidential. I will always keep the Secrets of my Friends when I can do it honestly, though I confess I do not like to be encumberd with them. In this Instance I will be your Confidant. But let me ask you-Can a difference between Mr. ______& me, either real or imaginary, be of any consequence to the World? (3) I think not. Tories you say tryumph. They may make Sport of it; but indeed my Friend, it is too unimportant a Matter for a sensible Whig to weep and break his Heart about. I am desirous of making you easy. And I do assure you, that so far from brooding in my Heart an unfriendly Disposition towards that Man, I seldom think of him unless I happen to take up a Boston News paper, or hear his Name mentiond in Chit Chat Conversation. You call upon me by all that is sacred to forgive him. Do you then think he has injurd me? If he has, Should not he ask for forgiveness? No man ever found me inexorable. I do not wish him to ask me to forgive him. This would be too humiliating. If he is conscious of having done or designd me Injury, let him do so no more, and I will promise to forgive & forget him too. Or, I would add, to do him all the Service in my Power; but this is needless. It is not in my Power to serve him. He is above it.  If you wish to know the Foundation of this wonderful Collision, ask my friend J. W., or another whom you properly call my \""closest\"" Friend.

  My dear Sir. Philada. Nove 3d. 78 In your last you ask me What we are doing? (1) Many things indeed. And if you will grant that somethings have been done well, I will frankly confess to you that others might have been done better. I think we do as well as we can, considering the Pile of Business every Morning laid on our Table. In order that the Affairs of the Treasury may be better attended to than they can possibly be by the Members of Congress, who are obliged to give their attendance there in the Hours of Business, we have establishd a new Board, to consist of a Treasurer, Comptroler, Auditor & two Chambers of Accounts, of three each. All these officers are to be chosen from without Doors. Measures are taking for the Appretiation of the Currency. Every Adept in financiering is busily employd, and I hope we shall before long agree in an effectual Plan. We have appointed Dr. Franklin Minister Plenipo. at Versailes, & written a Letter of Credence to our good and great Ally. The critical Situation of the Powers of Europe in general makes it somewhat difficult at present to determine to which of them it is proper to make our Court. Every Cabinet I imagine will this Winter be deeply engagd in making their Arrangements and preparing for the opening a Campaign in Case of a general War, which will more than probably happen. Our Friend AL is in Spain.(2) Our other Friend JA will be employd somewhere (3) France must be our Pole Star, and our Connections must be formd with hers-Holland, whose Policy is always to be at Peace, may be open to Negociation-the sooner she is tempted the better. Spain must joyn with France; but she is dilatory. I wish she would recollect how much she was injurd by it the last War, when she sufferd the Common Enemy to beat France & her self in Detail. The Spirit of Chatham is indeed extinquished in Britain. His decisive Mind might have dictated the Seizure of the Flota at Sea. Perhaps it is well that the Great Man is no more. The Millions are safely arrivd and the Tone of Neutrality at Madrid is become languid. A formidable Fleet lies equipd at Cadiz, which operating with that of France might at this juncture give a fatal Blow to the boasted Sovereignty of Britain on the Ocean.  The Count D'Estaings Squadron, I suppose will go to the West Indies. If so, Must not the British follow, with a great Part of their NOVEMBER 3, 1778  Troops, if they mean to keep the Possession of their own Islands. They may leave Garrisons at N. York and Newport, with a View of obliging us to maintain a great Army, hoping that we shall be undone by Expences while they utterly despair of subduing us by the Power of their Arms. We must have a respectable Army in the Spring, to put a face upon our Negociations if not to fight. I hope we shall secure to the United States Canada, Nova Scotia & the Fishery by our Arms or by Treaty. Florida too is a tempting Object at the South.(4) Perhaps if you were to show this Letter to some Folks, it would be thought to confirm an Opinion from whence an Objection was drawn against me on a late Occasion, that I am \""averse to Reconciliation\"". We never shall be upon a Solid Footing till Britain cedes to us what Nature designs we should have, or till we wrest it from her.  The Marine Committee have obtaind a Warrant for One hundred & fifty Thousand Dollars for your Department which will be forwarded speedily.(5) Congress has increasd your Salaries to three thousand Dollars per Annum.(6) I had this in View when I intreated you in my last Letter not to resign your Seat. Nothing could reconcile me to this but your having a Seat here. I am determind to make Room for you by a Resignation next Spring. I flatter my self I can yet be useful to my Country in a narrow Sphere. I wish for Retirement, and covet Leisure as a Miser does Money.  I inclose a Manifesto on our part (7) I am pleasd with the Act prohibiting the Return of Tories, but I am afraid the Words \""Without Liberty first had & obtained from the General Court\"" will keep an Open Door for perpetual Applications, and it may be unsafe to trust to future feelings.

Numerous complaints it is true have been heard from various Persons, of irregular and improper conduct of the Legion, but none since that which took its rise in Germantown have been laid before Congress, therefore such do not amount to a charge.  I laboured to explain to the Gentleman abovementiond that neither Congress nor any of its Members as far as I had learnt, imputed blame or censure to Count Pulaski, and that from the regard I had for him it made me unhappy to hear that he was censured anywhere for the disorderly behavior of his Men, or the unwarrantable menaces of any of his Officers, and I must impute that Gentleman's deficiency in the information which he gave, to his imperfect understanding in the English Tongue, altho in justice to myself I must observe I took some pains to impress upon his Mind the high sense I entertained of Count Pulaski's Merits.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 3. 1778 Your favor of October the 20th is put into my hands just when I am upon the point of setting out for Virginia,(1) and therefore you may suppose me not so well circumstanced for giving you such an answer as I could wish. I esteem Sir, a cooperation with you in bringing to detection and punishment the plunderers of the public as being honorable to myself and useful to the Community. I believe upon the whole, that this Country has suffered more from its pretended friends, than from its open enemies.  Such has been the variety and importance of the business before Congress, that neither the affairs of Car-m-1 or of D____e are yet finished. The delay producing powers of some men, the destruction of time under pretext of order, and by long confident speeches, that I have never seen less business done in any Assembly than has been with us the last six or eight months. Mr. Izard has written to Congress complaining most heavily both of D____e and F____ n. There appears to me to have been great misconduct, but I hope time & attention will discover and rectify all. It is my sincere opinion that with your powers, and your knowledge of facts, you can cause such instructions to be given your Delegates to Congress as will more certainly and speedily effect this, than can by any other means be done.  You wish to know how your Delegates have acted in this affair and whether they were for the Viva Voce narrative.(2) Amidst the variety of questions that are propounded in Congress it is not easy to remember what side particular Members take, nor do I recollect whether or not Mr. Lewis was present but as well as my memory serves me I think your State was against the written Narrative and for its being Viva Voce. That matter is a thing determined, and therefore I am at liberty to answer your questions as well as I am able on that point, but many other subjects of your enquiry I could answer to your satisfaction if I were not restrained by the rules of the house respecting unfinished affairs. That large sums of money have been expended in France is indubitable, that no adequate account is yet obtained is certain; and to me the reasons for its not being so are by no means satisfactory. He who undertakes public business without competency is culpable, NOVEMBER 3, 1778  and a capable man will at all times be able to shew satisfactorily how his business has been conducted even to the greatest minutiae. It is an insult on common sense to produce a Bankers charge of money issued, to account for the expenditure of Millions, during the transactions of near a year and an half.  We have a letter written by Cuningham (3) (who commanded the Cutters fitted at Dunkirk, and which have cost the public more than 100,000 Livres) complaining heavily for himself & his people of finding themself the Commander of a private Armed Vessel, when he & they conceived themselves in the service of the U.

I did not however neglect to communicate to proper Persons your Ideas of the present Stage of the Campaign. You are now in a Situation to gain further Insight into the Enemies Views & Designs, by knowing their exact State at Rh. Island. For if they still keep themselves in Force there, they mean to tarry with us till Spring at least. But here let me ask you whether any Chief ever had so little true Intelligence as Genl. Washington? Are not Spies to be had for Money? I must in Justice NOVEMBER 3, 1778  add, at the same Time, that I believe our Enemies do not form any capital Plans here. They are themselves in a State of Uncertainty waiting for Orders & Schemes from the other Side of the Water. By the Courier de Europe there was great Despondency in England the Beginning of August, both on account of Kepple's Ill Success & that of the Commissioners. They also knew of the Montmouth Affair.(1) I do not think there will be any Puzzle about Col. Hazen's Regiment.(2)  You have had a pack of cursed catalinarian Rascals plotting against you. I am not altogether without Suspicion that that that (3) some-mean Practices may take Place in your present Quarters. Chagrin will occupy more Bosoms than one upon your having the Direction of Matters Eastward just now.(4) But I take it for Granted the People will See & know their true Interest.  As to Flour, Wadsworth [has] the Lives & Fortunes of us all in his Power. I cannot see but the Inhabitants of Boston and other Places must starve. I am sure my own Family cannot eat Bread for the Money which I spare them at the Price extorted for that article. If the State had sent Vessels for Flour for the Necessities of the People there would have been no puzzle, but Recommendations were given to Individuals who may import it and get 1000 Dollrs. pr. C[w]t if they chuse it. I have told my Wife you will help her if it lay any Way within your Line. I begin now to hope we shall better our Currency very soon. We shall do great Things when we get President Schuyler here-Tace-I think that is one of the next manoeuvres.(5) But if our Money is mended I shall not longer be anxious; nor care much Who is here. We do not yet know whether you are on yr. Way to Boston but I cannot doubt it.

I missed a fine Opportunity at Baltimore of sending Flour in Expectation of One from this River But I see no chance at either Place now. The Commissary declares he cannot go on in his Line if Licence is given to any Individuals to export. The Recommendations given by our Council tended by a small Supply of the People to give princely Fortune to 8 or 10 Men. Had the Vessels been sent by the public to form a Granary for the People The Commissary could have done the whole and not have been   troubled with the enhanced Prices which Individuals create who are sure of a vast Profit let them give what they may. There the first loaded gets the greatest profit & consequently bids up in purchasing. The permit raised Flour to £6. The Check has brought it down to 4.

6290,dg011162,1778,Committee of Congress to John Connolly,"""Committee of Congress to John Connolly
  Thursday 12 o'clock. [November 5? 1778] The committee appointed to take into consideration the application of Lieutenant Colonel Connolly, request that gentleman will inform them of his reasons for not producing and pleading his commission, at the time he was first taken, and for a considerable time afterwards.(1)  MS not found; reprinted from PMHB, 13 July 1889): 158-59. The text of this letter is taken from Connolly's \""narrative\"" of his captivity, which covered the period October 1775 to October 1780. Although the letter is undated, the committee apparently wrote it sometime after Connolly had written to Congress on October 12 but before Congress adopted a lengthy resolution concerning his case on November 12, 1778. Although it is dated only \""Thursday 12 o'clock,\"" Connolly's \""narrative\"" suggests that this query was sent to him after the committee's study of his case was well under way and after he had \""a personal audience\"" with the com- NOVEMBER 5, 1778  mittee. Therefore November 5, rather than one of the Thursdays falling in October, has been suggested as the most likely date of its composition.  1 Connolly, who had been an American prisoner since his capture in October 1775, had been free on parole briefly in August 1778 after Congress returned to Philadelphia from York, Pa. Thus when Commissary of Prisoners John Beatty notified him that he was to be returned to confinement he sought to avoid reimprisonment and appealed to Congress to be granted regular prisoner-of-war status so that his exchange could be negotiated. Connolly's \""application\"" was referred to a committee consisting of William Duer, Henry Marchant, and John Witherspoon, who had previously been appointed to take into consideration a number of prisoner issues raised by Beatty. According to Connolly's own account of his relations with the committee, he demanded and was granted a \""personal audience . . . in order to know wherefore I was refused to be exchanged.\"" Of this \""audience\"" he gave the following account: \""For once I was gratified, and brought before a committee, where having briefly recapitulated my causes of complaint, the chairman [doubtless William Duer] replied to the following purport:  \""That it had been for some time past his opinion, which he had not scrupled to communicate to Congress, that I should be kept in close custody, until Sir John Johnson was delivered up to them, who, he asserted, had broken his sacred parole given to General Scuyler, and joined the enemy; since which time he had been committing ravages upon the northern frontiers, with a body of light troops and Indians, as he supposed I intended to do.  \""To this I answered, that a parole or honorary obligation, I presumed, was of modern date, calculated to alleviate the horrors of war; that no Gentleman could be answerable for any but himself; that I had been admitted to my parole above a year ago, when my conduct was irreproachable, and that I was again, without the least cause on my part, thrown into prison, and there continued for another year; that much had been said about the infraction of my parole, which I utterly denied to have been the case.  \""To this they replied, I certainly had not adhered to the spirit of it, for that I had spoken against their proceedings, and had frequently attempted to turn them into ridicule....  \""The final objection they made to my exchange, turned upon the impropriety of my being considered as a prisoner of war. They said, I had not been taken at the head of any armed troops, but privately making my way through the country; and one of them asserted, I might be considered as amenable to law martial, as a spy; but at the same time he observed, there was no intention of treating me as such.  \""The committee at length promised to consider and report my case to Congress, and as my health was so exceedingly and visibly impaired, gave me an intimation, that if I were not exchanged, I should be enlarged on parole. I was then re-conducted to prison.\""  The note from the committee printed here, Connolly went on to explain, \""was sent me a few days after the above hearing from the committee.\""  In response to the committee's query into his reasons \""for not producing and pleading his commission,\"" Connolly replied that Congress had known of his commission since 1775, because it was among the papers that were taken from him at the time of his capture. The committee apparently conceded the force of this explanation, for the reference to Connolly's failure to \""produce or plead any commission under the King of Great Britain\"" contained in the committee's lengthy report to Congress was deleted when it was entered on the journals on November 12. See JCC, 12:1126.  For this report, and a number of documents and references related to this entire episode, see JCC, 12:909, 927-28, 949, 995, 1102-3, 1109, 1125-29; PCC, item 42, 2:52-55; item 78, 5:201-2, 213-20, 229-32, 24142, 14:247-50; item 142, 2:159-60;   item 152, 6:427-28, 435-38; and \""A Narrative of the Transactions, Imprisonment and Sufferings of John Connolly . . .,\"" PMHB, 13 July 1889): 154-64.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 5th, 1778. Yours of the 15th of October by Dr. Hutchinson I recd.(1) In my last (2) I mentioned to you that I could have wished to have seen [you and] the Business of your Depar[tment have] allowed you to have visited this City. I think the Heads of Departments should now and then put themselves near Congress-Much advantage might result thereby. The Members might be better informed of the Situation & wants of the Departments, and you would more clearly see the Views & Wishes of Congress, and be perhaps usefully informed of many Matters, and abuses, which reach Our Ears; if not as a Body [then as] individuals. That there are some [. . .] Abuses in all the Departments, I am sure of, and Ld. Chesterfields Observation can hardly be admitted. For I believe the Frauds and Abuses are infinitely beyond what they are known to be. We are in the pursuit of some few, tho' of a deep die. The Complaints in Maryland & Delaware are of the most grievous abuses of Swarms of Deputy Quarter-masters, or such as pretend to be so-assistants, Deputy assistants &c &c. Their Insolence & [. . .] upon the People. One Letter [. . .] Congress immediately to take into Consideration the Grievances they labour under, that the great Disproportion of disaffected in that State, are increased by these People and even good Whigs staggered. That the publick Monies are in private use may not be doubted of. And Men will do well to consider how they will support a Character with the Publick, who while they hold important offices under Congress with great Perquisites and  NOVEMBER 5, 1778  entirely in the money Way, they are launching out in Trade foreign and domestick-and of the most [....] In vain may they say, they tend [. . .] private Fortune. For if true, their Characters will not be screened from great Suspicion. And with Truth it will be said their Commissions and perquisites are sufficient to demand all their Time and Attention, which cannot be, if privately imbarked in extensive Business. You will inquire-if Things are so round You. Let me beg that your Eyes and Ears may be fully open, retaining (as I know you will) an unbiased Mind & Determination. I have a Reg[ard for the] Publick-and I have I do assure you a Regard for Your Honor and Character, and am very desirous it should continue not only to deserve, which I am sure it will, the Applause of your Country, but that it should not suffer Reflections from any, for the Misconduct of others. 'Tis from these Principles I write so freely-I mean it for your private use; not to promote unnecessary Jealousies, but to promote a Scrutiny and proper Examination. And If I in some good Measure serve the Honor of your Department, and the Publick I shall be ve[ry satisf]ied for these few Moments spe[nt on the Sub]ject.

Under the present State of Affairs it is impossible to do Justice to the Commissioners, but Congress have increased their Salary to 3000 Dollars per Year (4) -Perhaps you consider the Levity of the Times as an Argument for Quitting the Service, if so, I will readily acknowledge that the Vices of some & Follies of others are very displeasing; but in a Revolution like the present, neccessarily producing an entire Change of the Governments & Constitutions of thirteen States, the Suspension of Law & Justice, the Want of necessary Arrangements for preventing Frauds, & the most favorable oppertunities for Speculators & Engrossers, it NOVEMBER 8, 1778  must reasonably be expected that the Morals of the people will be greatly injured, & for a while, present a gloomy prospect. But I trust, there is yet Wisdom & Vertue enough in America to recover her Citizens from their Errors, & lead a brave & deserving People into paths conducive to their Happiness. True it is, the Work is arduous, And it is equally true, that it is necessary; for should We exceed in Power & Wealth every Empire on Earth, and neglect the Morals of the people, is it not evident, that our Independance, instead of Freedom would produce a Slavery, far exceeding that of every other Nation? If the best & ablest Friends of America, who under providence have opposed the corrupt Arts, not less than the powerful Arms of G Britain, will unite in checking the Cancer of Vanity, Vice, & Folly, the Leaders of this feeble Train will vanish at the Appearance of Opposition, & leave the Way clear to the promotion of the opposite Virtues; but if on the Other Hand, those on whom We have principally relied, should suffer themselves to be disgusted at the natural appearance of Bubbles on the mighty Ocean of our affairs, & withdraw from the Service, I fear that our Liberties, like such shortlived phenomenons will burst, & leave not behind, a Trace of their former Existence. I know that You have had much Fatigue and Tryal, & met with many Things that are very disagreable, & assure You that We have had a full Share of these in Congress; I most ardently wish to return to my native Country, & cooperate with my Friends in their salutary Measures. Pray confer with our Friend Mr. Dana on these affairs, as I am persuaded he can inform You of many Things which will assist you in pursuing the necessary Measures.

  Sir 8th November [1778] Since my last of the 9th of August, I had often urged Congress on the subject matter of yours of the 1st of that Month meaning more particularly the appointment of a Garrison Chaplain. At length, after  NOVEMBER 8, 1778  laying before the House your repeated applications in your Letter of the 7th October and your Message by Captain Powell,(1) your first Letter was called for, and the Reverend Mr. John Mason appointed Chaplain to the Garrisons in the Ports on Hudsons River in the Highlands with the pay and subsistence o£ a Brigade Chaplain as will appear more fully by an Act of Congress of the 2nd Instant-which you will receive in company with this and will be pleased to transmit it to the Chaplain with my Compliments.(2) If Mr. Mason has officiated in the Character of Chaplain for any time antecedent to the present appointment I have no doubt but that a Memorial certified by you will induce Congress to make a proper retrospect.  I had the pleasure of Captain Redman's Company once since he came to town. He left very favorable impressions on my Mind, and I shall be glad to see him again.  It is too probable that such an itinerant Committee as you recommend would have happy effects.(3) The necessity even for a suggestion of this nature is mortifying, and carries with it a severe reflection on those who are squandering and peculating while Members of Congress are laboring without fee or reward every day through the Year in the same Cause. I am nevertheless much obliged to you Sir, for the hint, and will endeavour to improve it.  Captain Powell tells me he takes with him all the late Newspapers. These contain our present Intelligences from New York. Therefore I will not detain you further than to repeat the assurance of being, With great Respect & Regard  ""

  My dear Sir Philada Novr 9th 1778 I have receivd your favor of the 7th of October by Mr. Dod. I cannot say that I am by any Means pleasd with the inclosd Letter to _____ .(1) I am glad however that you allowd me the Perusal of it before its Presentation. I consider the Confidence you place in me in this Instance as sufficient to warrant me in delaying to deliver it, till I shall hear further from you, which I will accordingly do in hopes that you will alter your Determination.  We now begin to hope for Peace soon on our own Terms; or if the War should continue longer, that it will be conducted in such a Manner as will render a large Army less necessary, which will enable us to be at greater Expense for an American Navy; the building up of which is looked upon by all wise and good Men whom I converse with as necessary and highly important. General Whipple is again returnd to Congress; and as he is a Man of Sense and great Experience in Marine Affairs, and was formerly of the Marine Comte., I was sollicitous that he should again be of the Number. Congress have added him to the Committee, and I hope he will act as Chairman during the Absence of Col. Lee who is gone to Virginia. From several Hints which Genl. W. has dropt to me, I am in Hopes that Measures will be come into which may add Weight to your Board & facilitate the Business of it.  The Navy Boards especially that in the Eastern Department where it is probable there will constantly be a great Resort of our Ships of War, will be standing Boards, and of the greatest Importance to the United States. The best Men must fill those Places. I will not, least you should think me indelicate, add more on this Subject, than my earnest Request that you will for the present suspend your Resignation.  I am glad that you have discoverd the Mistake you mention, and will communicate it.(2)  The Picture, my dear Friend, which you give me of my beloved Native town mortifies me greatly. I had the Vanity to think she would afford Examples of Industry, Frugality, Temperance & other publick Virtues. I fear with you that we have lost our Labour. When ambitious Men aim at establishing a Popularity by confounding the Distinction between Virtue and Vice and through the Degeneracy of Times they can effect it, the People will tamely submit to a Master.

  Kind Sir, Philada. Novr. 9th 1778 I have been unwearied in my Endeavours to serve your Interest and that of the other Gentlemen concerned with me, as was my duty, and could I do more, I should not beg[r]udge my labour, as I should not doubt it's issuing in an ample reward to us all. You may yet depend on my utmost exertions, but be assured without the cooperation of both yourself and Mr. Cockey, one of you to be constantly at the Works,(1) until they are fairly put a going, and in the necessary supplies of Provisions &c way without a vigorous cooperation of you both in so arduous a business, I plainly foresee they will come to nothing, or the profits which would arise with ceconomy will be absorbed with Expence. I believe it is the loss of many thousands that Mr. Bedwell did not accept my first offer and superintend the building of the first furnace, but by every account he is now acting with great deligence, but he must be kept in his sphere and one of the Owners, at least, constantly employed in procuring live Stock, Wiskey, Flour &c &c &c and in seeing them transported, otherwise it is too obvious to need any argument to prove it that his being employed in any other way than in the Business more immediately committed to him, would be ruinous to our Scheme. A second furnace (a blast furnace) is building, or built by this time and [whether] it will not be ruined thro ignorance, as the first was, I cannot say, as Mr. Bedwell does not pretend to understand working one of that Construction, besides if NOVEMBER 9, 1778  there is at present sufficient skill on the spot to direct the Construction, they have no Mason but Fox, therefore anxious for the success I have again sent up Mr. Glen, and taken measure to get a Wm. Steer an old German who lives next adjoining a Mr. Trindle living about 8 or 10 miles from Carlisle to go up, which one of the Owners must see is effected, as the most probable means of success I can think of, next to getting a Mason and Smelters from Chizels work,(2) this I have also repeatedly attempted, and have received encouragement from Governor Henry, to whom I have wrote and sent my Letter open to Mr. Bedwell as my last effort desiring him, if one of the owners will be on the spot to supply his place in any manner, to proceed to Govr. Henry himself and to the lead Works in that State, if encouraged by the Governor, as the want of Company may have hitherto disappointed our expectations of any Artificer from thence, my reason for wishing Mr. Bedwell to go is, that failing of getting the men, he may pick up some knowledge himself, but if it should prove out of his power to go, then I think you or Mr Cockey should undertake the Journey. Besides these measures I have sent 40 prisoners from fort Frederick, they proving British instead of Germans which I intended, all have proved discontented, and been sent back, except twelve. These I hope we shall retain as I have sent up a worthy Officer Capt. Danl. Topham entirely to manage this department. I shall in day or two send off between 3 & £400 of Cloaths for the prisoners and our other people to prevent their starving with Cold, to be charged to them, these are ready packed and wait only a Waggon to Transport them to Carlisle from thence they must be sent on pack horses to our Works, and have given orders to have them properly packed in convenient packages. I recommend that you call upon the Qr. master at Carlisle, who has orders for this purpose, and see that the goods be sent forward under the care of a proper person & that the Stamp heads and all the other things and persons I have ordered up, are accordingly gone or sent. I wish that you would look out for & recommend a proper person to superintend and carry on the Business of farming for the future supply of our men, for the expence of transportation besides the difficulty of obtaining produce by purchase renders another mode of supply necessary. I am thus particular as my last to you was in general terms refering to what I at the same time wrote to Mr. Cockey, who I expected would go up and take charge of the things in general recommended now, but as you and he are very loath to soil paper and I am left for weeks before I know what is-done in consiquence of my much writing or wether my letters get to hand, therefore I choose to be particular at present that you may be acquainted with the state of things. My last Letter inclosed £100 for Mr. Cockey did he receive it? and is he gone up? The Cloaths that will be lodged at [Carlisle] I think out [ought] to   be attended to, except you should be of [. . . m]y directions to the Qr. master will be sufficient. I think it is [too grea]t a risque not only on accott. of the money, but [. . . ] in danger of loosing the men for want of Cloaths. I am, Sir, Yr. most ob hum Sev,  Danl. Roberdeau ""

  Sir, Philadelphia November 10th. 1778. We are honoured with your Excellency's Letter of the 2d Inst. by Messenger Brown.  The Treasury arrangement we herewith transmit your Excellency; and have the pleasure to inform that the choice of Colo. Trumbul to the head of it was unanimous.(1)  The equally alarming & embarrased subject of Finances, is yet under consideration. Congress we trust however, are nearly ripe for resolutions respecting them, which may be salutary if not decisive. A foreign Loan, how elligible soever in our present circumstances, we have yet no assurance can be obtained, & from the present warlike appearances in Europe have perhaps less reason than heretofore to expect it. Establishing a fund by taxes for sinking in process of time the capital debt, & by taxes & an internal Loan taking out of circulation some of the past Emissions to make way for future ones, is all therefore we are certain at present of being able to do. A rapid appreciation is not from hence to be expected, nor perhaps wished for.  The Committee on your Excellencies Letter of the 8th of October (2) reported in favour of a Commission to be allowed of half per Cent. This mode of allowance some members objected to as having been found pernicious & improper in their opinion to receive the farther countenance of Congress in any case whatever; tho they wished ample justice to be done in this Case & seemed fully sensible it had not been heretofore. The Letter on motion was recommitted to the same Committee who wait a favourable oppertunity of reporting again in favour of a gross sum which they hope will be accepted & do justice. The fate of their second report your Excellency will be informed of the earliest oppertunity.  Congress have no late foreign intelligence. A Letter from Commissary Loring at N York recd. this day, promises immediately to send out the officers now due to us, & proposes the exchange of the remaining ballance of our officers in their hands for their privates in ours; & that Commissioners be appointed to meet & adjust the matter & settle a full & complete exchange as soon as can be done.(3)  We are Sir, with great Respect, your Excellencys most obedt. & humbe Servants, Roger Sherman  Oliver Ellsworth ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 10th Novr 1778. I intreat you will not blame me for the long delinquency on my part in our correspondence. Permit me to assure you Sir my silence originated in a sympathy arising from my particular love & regard for you; Your kindness & your knowledge of business will supply an apology for the rest.  I have now my Eye on your favor of the 5th October.(1) I have learned enough of the services of our late friend in his Office of Commissary to know that the Public are much indebted to him & you may rely on me Sir, for doing every thing in my power to obtain suitable acknowledgements for the benefit of his family. You have no doubt been informed by Mr. Elseworth that a Report had been lately made on your Representation to Congress, that exceptions were urged to certain parts & that therefore the whole was recommitted. The best influence on that  NOVEMBER 10, 1778  occasion was to assure my friends who were unacquainted with the merits of the late Mr. Joseph Trumbull that he had been one of the best Servants of Congress, that I was persuaded, had he been continued in the Office of Commissary upon his own terms, the Public would have saved five Millions of Dollars or more & many hundreds of Soldiers, to prove this to the satisfaction of every reasonable person, will not be difficult to me. It requires only a retrospect to the circumstances of our Army at Valley forge during the last winter & to the amazing advance of every species of provision immediately after the Stores which he had amassed were consumed.  I cannot on this occasion bound myself by five Millions, the want of forethought & Industry in his Successor occasioned an advance of the price of provision & every other article kept pace with that. The Contrast of these Officers demonstrates the merit of the former, hence Sir, your requisitions & expectations on behalf of the surviving family do not appear to me ill grounded, nor do I believe there would be any great opposition, provided the Accounts were adjusted, or adjusted so far as circumstances will admit of, I shall make an opportunity to day for conversing with Elseworth on this subject & do my self the honor of writing to you again very soon.  I perceive Sir, we were in equal danger on the 28th Augt. & that we have each of us particular cause for thankfulness for the escape of our Children from dangers to which their Love of Country had exposed them,(2) My own, inform me what were your feelings while the event of that day remained unknown to us, & I am persuaded we have both learned, in all cases, under the severest pangs arising from apprehensions, such as I confess I felt on that occasion & in deep distress from real misfortunes to say \""thy Will be done.\""  11th. I have conversed with Mr. Elseworth who informs me the Committee have reconsidered their late report & are prepared to deliver another Report to the House, I hope this will be done to morrow & that the issue will afford you satisfaction.  Congress seem to be now in earnest to proceed upon measures for realizing & appreciating our Paper Money. We may make of this a fine spun theorem, but unless we strike at the Root, the cause of our immense emissions, the peculation of great public Officers, the practice of monopolizers &c &c, we may drudge on, the Evil will remain & our Country will be reduced systematically to destruction. In a word, Sir, that Patriotism which we affected to say had led us into the present contest, is out of fashion & unless we speedily revive it, we shall experience a violent convulsion which will go near to ruin us, & which will at least bring us into universal disgrace, I lament the prospect. Believe me to be Dear sir, with the highest respect & Esteem, Your obliged & obedient humble servant.  Henry Laurens.   P. S. I beg my Compliments to Mr. Jonathan Trumbull Junr.

The Articles of consumption which we would most particularly be informed of are Flour, Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Corn & Rice, Beef, Pork, Working Oxen & Horses, Cyder & Vinegar.

  In Committee of Congress Sir Circular Philadelphia 11th November 1778  The dangerous Practices of Engrossers have increased so rapidly with the Publick distresses, and have so accumulated them, that every Friend to this Country or even to Humanity, cannot but wish to see some Remedy to an Evil, which threatens the Existence not only of the several States but of the poorer part of the Individuals which compose them. We are fully sensible that this disease should be touched with a cautious & with a Delicate hand, but at the same time, we confide in the wisdom of your Legislature for this Delicacy & Caution. We do not pretend to mark out the means which they should NOVEMBER 11, 1778  adopt but the Confidence reposed in us by Congress, demands that we should at least Hint, what in our Idea may conduce to this valuable purpose. The Articles necessary for the Consumption of the Army, are easily designated, And we trust there will not be much difficulty in distinguishing between the Dealer in or Manufacturer of those Articles & the Engrosser or as he would call himself the Speculator. These two Objects being accomplished, it surely cannot be deemed inconsistent either with Policy or Justice, that he should be Obliged to part with them to the Public. The Process necessary for this purpose, must depend on the civil Institutions which may have been respectively adopted, but it should be as short and as simple as is consistent with the constitution of the State. One thing more is necessary to complete the System, namely the price. If this is such as to leave the Speculator his Profit, nothing more is operated by the Law, than merely to sanctify his unrighteous Gains. If the price be fixed by Law, the Efforts now making to render our Money valuable (and which we doubt not your Legislature will assist by heavy Taxes) will only tend to realise what he hath already accumulated. Perhaps the power Lodged somewhere, to fix the market price monthly by the name of assize, and a deduction from it of about twenty per Cent on Commodities in the Hands of Engrossers, would be most effectual.

  In Committee of Congress Sir. Philadelphia 11th November 1778  Among the many Objects which occupy Your mind, permit us to call your Attention for a moment to one of the first magnitude. In the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia,(1) the Distillery of Spirits from Grain hath become a very considerable & growing Manufacture. Amid the prejudices which it is natural to suppose the Parties concerned have raised, and the Arguments which may be adduced in it's favor, let us be permitted to mention some objections. The Effect of it in a moral point of view is certainly deserving of the first attention. Drunkenness, at all times a Crime and in this Case almost Self Murder is not discouraged by bringing the means of it home to every Mans own Door. And certainly there is the Best Authority to say that no Laws can diminish the Vice when the temptation is increased; to lead the People therefore into it or wink at their being led, is to say the least not very meritorious. An additional Weight is given to every Argument of this Kind, when it is considered that Malt Spirits of all others most effectually enervate both the mind & Body, rendering the unhappy Patient not only a stupid & useless but also wicked & for the most part a Dangerous Member of Society. But as no Political considerations should or indeed can influence a good Government to become inattentive to the Health & the Morals of it's Citizens, so we cannot doubt but that your Legislature will be most feelingly alive, when not only the Health & the Morals, but the Liberty, nay the Existence of the Society depend, upon the total prohibition of a practice at all times Dangerous, but at present fatal.  The scarcity which already begins to be felt may, for ought we know, become in the course of Providence a Devouring famine. Pes- NOVEMBER 11, 1778  tilence, Famine & War but too naturally succeed each other, & tho' we have reasons to trust in the mercy of heaven, to ward of these Evils, Yet it is our Duty to take every precaution against them, which Providence can suggest. The foremost among these is certainly to prohibit the converting of that Bread, which was meant for the sustenance of Man into a Liquid poison for his Destruction. We do therefore most earnestly entreat Your Excellency to recommend it in the strongest manner to your Legislature, immediately to enact Laws for this Purpose. Perhaps the siezing of (for the use of the Army) all which shall be distilled after a certain Day, at a low price to be paid to Commissioners, and expended in the maintenance of the poor, and particularly for the Comfort of sick & wounded Soldiers would be as effectual as any other, at the same time it would be paying a proper attention to those Brave Unfortunate Men, who have every Claim upon us, which Patriotism, Religion & Humanity, can possibly Confer.

  Dear General. Novr. 11th. 1778 Before I received your confidential Favor of I had thrown out to you some sentiments resembling your own as to the effect on little minds which would probably be consequential of your change of post.(1) I was sick at home when thoughtful Yankies made the motion,  NOVEMBER 11, 1778  founded in Regard to the real interest of the people at the eastward, and therefore honorable only by evident implication to you.  As to your moving without any continental Troops, I think good Reasons have been offered by Gl. W . The Disposition which he had made prior to our sending the Direction for your going forward was as judicious as appearances & his acquired intelligence could prompt. But giving you a Ride was as little as we possibly could do in Compliment to those states who had always exerted themselves when their neighbours were threatened no more than they now actually were. Your Reputation was judged sufficient to dispel any possible fear in our own citizens and even to divert a plan of our enemies.  I think it must by this Time be beyond a doubt that every british Corps will leave the continent; the Germans cannot be forced to opperate in the west indies; therefore they must remain at New York, if any do. A small embarkation is now making of them I suppose for Halifax to go early in the Spring to Canada.  I cannot at any rate, by an uncertain conveyance, say a word to you respecting joint opperations next campaign, which will in some measure govern the Cantonments of this winter. Indeed I am under the Rules of the House as to Secresy. Perhaps the Marquis F. in Conversation will have given you some Insights.  Our Ratification is said, in a Martinico Gazette of Octr 1st, to have been arrived in Paris Augst. 4th and on its Way to Versailles.  Bingham, intimate with Marqs. de Bouillie, gives his opinion that Spain conducts wholly in concert with France; and he suggests very good Reasons for the Face she now puts on.(2)  I again recommend Mrs. L_____ to you and with affectionate Compliments to your amiable Family am your Friend sincerely and Your humb.

  D'r General. Philadelphia 11th Novr. 1778 As Congress have delegated to a Committee, of which I have the Honor to be a Member, the superintendance of the Commissary & Quarter Masters Departments;(1) this, together with our Finances NOVEMBER 11, 1778  which we have long been cobling at, hath obliged me to consider in a more compleat View the State of our Affairs than my former detached Attention would permit, or indeed than my natural Indolence would have led to unsolicited by Necessity. While I write to you you must read and interpret with the Eye and the Mind of Friendship, and suppose a greater modesty of Disposition than the Language may indicate. For tho I by no means believe myself equal to the smallest of the Objects thrown upon me Yet in Speaking of them I must give a loose to my Imagination and my Pen nor can I find either Leizure or Inclination to attend to Style.  First then it is a Position clear that we must act according to our Powers and not our Inclinations. It is I am afraid as clear that your Army will want Subsistence if kept together. Neither the Quarter Master nor Commissary Departments can in the mercantile Phrase do the needful while you are where you are. I take it the Number of the Enemy and the Season are against active Operations on their Part. Their Situation the Season our natural and political Circumstances are equally against them on our Part. To ravage the Country and to cover it from being ravaged are then the two Objects. The first is base and beyond a certain Degree impracticable. The second is to a certain Degree dangerous and ideal. If it is reduced to a Question for instance whether the Counties of Bergen and Westchester shall be protected by our Arms or the Losses paid for I am ready to purchase the whole of both in Fee and lay them Waste by Way of saving Money. The like I take it will hold good with Respect to the Environs of Rhode Island. I cannot therefore help being of Opinion that few very few Troops should remain in the Eastern Department. But that many of them if many there be and a Part of your Army should be cantoned along thro the Towns about the Middle of Connecticut River. The Post in the Highlands cannot indeed be neglected and perhaps for the better Support of it another Post may be necessary about Fredericksburgh. To supply them with Provisions &c. will be very difficult and whenever the Frosts shall become severe these Posts will require much fewer Men and therefore it may be good Policy to place those whose Times are near expiring on that Ground. The Sick &c &c can perhaps be better and safer kept at Albany than elsewhere and then a Part of your Force will be there to cover them, mount the necessary Guards &c. At Aquaquenonck, New Ark and Elizabeth Town advance Parties may be posted to cover the interior Country and Communication. A considerable Body at Morristown will be necessary to secure the Magazines which may there be drawn to a Point from all the Communications and there most properly because perfectly secure and because naturally a good Forage Country. A small Body of Men will be necessary for the Sake of Order &c at Sussex Court House, Easton, Coryells, Brunswick, Princeton &c.  NOVEMBER 12, 1778  Amboy will I imagine be too dangerous as by landing at the Blazing Star or in very cold Weather on the Meadows between that and Amboy they might be cut off. A Part of the Army might be quartered at Trenton, Bordentown & Burlington and a Part at the Valley Forge. The Waggons of every kind and Horses should be sent away from those not exposed. The advanced Posts will require a few good Horses but they should have very little Baggage and only light very light Artillery, a few good Cavalry also may be requisite for the Videttes. I cannot conceive that any Danger can arise from such dispersion of the Army and I am confident they can in that Way be much better fed. My principle view is I confess this that almost all the Horses of the Army may travel southwest perhaps as far as beyond the Potowmack in the two Counties of Frederick and in Washington & Barclay Counties there to be boarded with the Farmers by which Means they will be fit for use as early as the Season will permit. The Cavalry might be quartered in little Villages and if the Officers are good the Men as well Horses might improve. This Peace and Ease would help recruiting but I have said too much already. However as I have disposed of your Army Pray let me now dispose of their General. I think Philadelphia would be a very proper Place for him. In short Sir you must contrive to spend some Time near Congress and I am confident you will do more good by establishing a good Understanding between them and the Army forwarding it's Business and the like than can easily be conceived.(2) To all this I add that if the General, the Quarter Master and the Commissary General are on this Spot all the Arrangements for the next Campaign will be properly made. One Thing more and I have done. It is that I wish most earnestly to see you. Adieu. I am yours, Gouvr Morris  ""

(1) Who is substituting other Means of Dissipation in my native Town in Lieu of Theatrical Entertainments &c &c? Who has mixed the Grave and the Vain, the Whigs and the Tories in Scenes of Amusement totally incompatible with the present serious Times? Who among the Grave and Who among the Whigs, I mean such Whigs as have a feeling for their distressed Country and the Multitudes of distressd Individuals in it, are present at such Entertainmts? Is there a Man among them to whom our Country has entrusted her Independence, her Virtue, her Liberty?

The House intreat Your Excellency will not delay the intended relief of Troops for South Carolina and Georgia,(1) there is still great reason to believe an Embarkation has NOVEMBER 16, 1778  been made at New York intended at least for subduing the latter, and in order to distract our Measures they have prevailed on the Creek Indians to take up the Hatchet, these Savages have already made inroads upon Georgia and committed many Murders, my last advices from South Carolina express the apprehensions of Men best acquainted with the temper of the Indians, to be, an open and general War. This alone will involve both those States in deep distress, but I view the attempts on the Western as a prelude to the part which is designed to be acted on the Eastern frontier, and Lord Stirling writes to me from Elizabeth town under the 15th Inst.(2) that the whole of the 71st Regiment Highlanders, two Battalions of Hessian Grenadiers, two Battalions of Delancy's, two of Skinners New Levies, three Companies of the 64th and two of the 33d are actually embarked and only waited a wind to sail, as from a variety of circumstances he conjectured for the Floridas, under convoy of the Vigilant (3) and three Gallies-this Navigation is exactly calculated for Georgia, either directly or by the route of St. Augustine, and the number of Troops about 2500 will be far superior to the strength of Georgia with all the aid which South Carolina engaged in an Indian War can afford her.  The dispersion of Byron's fleet which Your Excellency will learn from the Newspaper which I have the honor of inclosing may occasion very great alterations in the Schemes & Plans of our Enemies, tis far from improbable that Count d'Estaing has carried off some of the scatter'd Ships, he sail'd in the critical moment for meeting them -nevertheless it appears to be essential to the general welfare of our Union that Georgia and South Carolina should be immediately reinforced, and that if possible East Florida be subdued.

  Gentlemen November 16th. 1778 Our last of the 9th instant acknowledged the receipt of yours of the 28th Ultimo which we have since duely considered.  We shall now repeat what we have been pressing for in our late Letters vizt. your greatest exertions in preparing the Continental Armed Vessels now in the Ports of your department for Sea, being well convinced that you will do every thing in your power for the speedy Accomplishmt. of that desireable business. In future you will please to observe that when Continental Vessels arrive in your Ports they are again to be fitted with all expedition for the sea, and you are to transmit to this Committee weekly an Account of their Number, Situation and the time you think they will be ready to sail. With regard to the Vessels that are now fitting out at your ports, and also with regard to those Vessels that may hereafter arrive, when they are fitted for the sea you will send them out to cruize against our enemies either collectively or Singly as you shall judge proper, useing your discretion as to the time for which their Cruizes shall continue, and your- best judgment in directing the commanders to such places and on such stations as you shall think will be for the general benefit of the United States, and to Annoy and distress the enemy.  At present we consider it an Object of importance to destroy the infamous Goodrich (1) who has much infested our Coast, Cruizing with a squadron of 4, 5, or 6 armed Vessels from 16 Guns downwards from Egg harbour to Cape Fear in North Carolina, therefore you will please to Order A Sufficient force to range the said Coast to remove NOVEMBER 16, 1778  that nusence, Observing generally that the vessels are not to remain too long on any station least the enemy should get intelligence and send A superior force against them.  By a Vessel arrived here lately in 17 Days from Bermuda we learn that four Vessels of Goodriches Squadron were carreening at that place when she sailed.  Congress have established Pursers in the Navy to all ships not under 16 Guns, also an abatement on Slops delivered to Seamen who will enter for twelve Months, and provision in the distribution of Prize Money for the Carpenters & Gunners Mates who have been heretofore neglected. We shall send the Resolves by the next Opporty.(2)  We have desired the Commissary General of Prisoners to give strict orders to his deputy at Boston to be attentive to the retaining & exchanging of Marine Prisoners under the direction of your Board, which we hope will be sufficient to remove the inconveniences you have pointed out.(3) We request that all further attempts to get out the ship Trumbull may be laid aside for the present unless some very favourable opportunity should speedily offer.  We have lately been informed of the Capture of the Schooner Pigot at Rhode Island mounting Eight 12pdr. Cannon and wish you to purchase her Guns for Continental use. In a late letter from Captain Landais he mentions his not having received the Subsistance Money of 51/3 Dollars allowed him by Resolve of Congress of the 25th July 1777. You will please to pay him that Subsistance from the date of his Commission which is the 9th of May 1778 he being in Actual service since that time and consequently intitled to receive it. Captain Landais recommends the use of Powder proofs on board our Ships, we request you will write by the first opportunity to France for 3 doz of them. You will please to inform Captain Hinman that the Papers relative to Captain Thompsons trial are copying and shall shortly be sent forward to your Board.  By Mr. Brown an Express who carried our letter of the 9th instant we sent you 150,000 Dollars and shall shortly remit you a further supply for the use of your Department. We are, Gentlemen, Your hble Servants  P.S. It is our desire that the Ship Ranger be sent out under the command of Lieutenant Simpson. We have determined that an abatement of 50 per Ct. shall be made on the first cost of Slops delivered to Seamen who will enter for twelve months but you will take care to order them to be distributed properly so as that the Seamen shall not leave the Vessels in debt.

Count d'Estaing sailed from Massachuset's Bay in the Morning of the 4th in a very strong gale of fair Wind & went safely to Sea, in the Evening of that day a Express from arrived at Boston with information that Admiral Byron's fleet of 16 Sail of the Line which had been lying perdue, had been overtaken by the Violent Storm which happened on the 3d-the whole fleet were dispersed the Sommerset of 64 Guns wrecked,(3) 40 of her Men  NOVEMBER 18, 1778  drowned, about 500 made prisoners-4 or 5 large Ships were seen entangled among the Shoals & Rocks all their topmasts gone & several lower Masts; the topmasts tis natural to suppose had been struck; the Ships were if not already stranded were thought to be in the utmost danger.

  Novemr. l9th. 1778. Mr. McKean informs Congress,(1) that upon seeing Brigadier General William Thompson last night in the Coffee house, being lately summoned by the British Commissary of Prisoners to return to New York agreeable to his parole, and thinking he had a pleasing piece of intelligence to communicate to him, he called to the General and told him he had just heard, that General Clinton had proposed to exchange the Officers of the Convention of Saratoga for our Officers who are prisoners; upon which the General, in a great passion, said he was obliged to General Clinton, but not to Congress, they had used him damned rascally, for he ought to have been exchanged above a year ago. Mr. McKean replied he was mistaken, for Congress could not with justice or propriety have procured his exchange before, and he ought not to be angry with them without cause; upon which the General raised his voice and said, that the Congress might have exchanged him lately for one who was a General Officer, but another, who deserved little and who was not an Officer, was preferred to him; (alluding to the exchange of Governor Franklin for President McKinly of the Delaware State, as Mr. McKean apprehended) and then aloud and in an imperious tone further said, that the Congress were a parcel of damned Rascals, and that he Mr. McKean was so in particular, which he repeated twice, referring as Mr. McKean understood to his having voted for the exchange of Gov- NOVEMBER 19, 1778  ernor Franklin for President McKinly in preference to the general: Upon which Mr. McKean, with great calmness told him, that was consistent with justice and propriety, for it was not only in the civil line, Governor for Governor, but Captain General for Captain General, and that he was instructed by the Delaware State to sollicit that exchange; and then told the General, he behaved with great indecency towards Congress in his presence. The General then damned him again, and asked him if he was a Gentleman, which Mr. McKean considered to be intended for a challenge, and he then came up to him in an angry manner and touching his shoulder repeated the question; Mr. McKean told him, that he did not think him a gentleman, that he was his inferior, and behaved like a Bully and a Brute, and that he should make him repent of his conduct. The General then made use of such low expressions, as are improper to be repeated among Gentlemen, and went to the other end of the room.  Mr. McKean considering this behaviour of Brigadier General Thompson to be a breach of Privilege, to have a tendency to destroy the freedom of voting in Congress, and to be a gross insult upon this Honourable Body from one of their officers, and that in so public a place, thinks it his duty as a Member to communicate it to Congress.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 20th Novem 1778 I felt myself doubly honoured by your favor of the 14th Inst.(1) from the confidence of General Washington in the free communication of his sentiments & in the coincidence of his Ideas with my own, upon a question, on the wise decision of which the Inheritance, possibly the establishment, of the freedom & Independance of these States, seems to depend. The respect Sir, which I owe you, demands an immediate reply, & yet the variety of avocations in which I am engaged, do not afford me moments for arranging or expressing my thoughts suitably to the importance of the subject; I am nevertheless encouraged to proceed without hesitation from a conviction, that, were I to deliver my opinions at full length I should be obliged to borrow Your Excellency's words, which I have the honor of assuring you Sir, are in more than one Instance repetitions of my own, & that in every other, one excepted, our sentiments on this momentous discussion exactly accord.  I believe & upon good grounds, the scheme for an expedition into Canada in concert with the Arms of France originated in the breast of Marquis delafayette, encouraged probably by conferences with Count d'Estaing & I also believe it to be the offspring of the purest motives so far as respects that origin, but this is not sufficient to engage my concurrence in a measure big with eventual mischiefs.  As deeply as my very limited time & faculties had suffered me to penetrate, I had often contemplated our delicate connexion with France & although it is painful to talk of ones own foresight, had viewed & foretold fifteen Months ago the humiliating state to which our embrio Independence would be reduced, by courting from that Nation the loan of more Money than should be actually necessary for the support of the Army & of our unfortunate Navy.  I was one of the six unsuccessful opponents to the resolution for borrowing Money from France for paying the Interest of our loan Office Certificates (2)-we have in this single article plunged the Union into a vast amount of debt, & from neglecting to exert our very small abilities or even to shew a leading disposition to cancel any part of the former demand against us, our Bills for that Interest are now floating in imminent danger of dishonor & disgrace. Fully persuaded of the value of National honor I anxiously wished to support our own NOVEMBER 20, 1778  by a propriety & consistency of conduct & I dreaded the consequences of subjecting our happiness to the disposal of a powerful Creditor, who might upon very specious grounds, interpret National honor to our destruction-I warned by friends against the danger of Mortgaging these States to foreign powers. Every Million of Livres you borrow implies a pledge of your Lands, & it is optional on your Creditor to be repaid at the Bank of England with an exorbitant Pramium, or to collect the Money due to him in any of your Ports & according to his own mode whenever National Interest shall require the support of pretended National honor-hence Your Excellency will perceive what were my feelings, when the propositions for subduing Canada by the aid of a French Fleet & Army were first broached to me. I demurred exceedingly to the Marquis's scheme & expressed some doubts of the concurrence of Congress, this was going as far as I dared consistently with my Office or considering him as a Gentleman of equal honor & tenacity I trusted the issue of his application to the sagacity of Congress, the business was referred to a Committee who conferred with the Marquis, their Report was framed agreeable to his wishes, but the House very prudently determined to consult the Commander in Chief previously to a final determination,(3) and although Your Excellency's observations are Committed, I am much mistaken if every Member in Congress is not decided on his opinion in favor of them. If the prosecution of so extensive a project is from the present state of our Army & funds impracticable on our part, it becomes altogether unnecessary to discuss the point in a political view, & I trust the Marquis will be satisfied with such reasonings in apology for our desisting from the pursuit of his favorite enterprize as our circumstances will dictate.  The immense debts which we are involved in abroad & at home demand the most serious attention & call for an exertion of the collected wisdom of all these States in order to secure what we have saved from the Ravages of the Enemy. I am very short sighted, if there is at this time any encouragement for attempting distant conquests.  I have been uniformly averse from every proposition which tended to dissipate our strength & to accumulate our debts. Events have confirmed my opinion, & at this Instant taking in view all circumstances I have doubts of the policy & more of the success of the pending expedition against East Florida.  Congress will probably recommend to the States to raise a Tax of near 20 Million the ensuing Year, this I hope will have a good effect, by returning many of us to first Principles from which we have been too long wandering. This almost intolerable burthen will rouse & animate our fellow Citizens. They will probably send Men of abilities to investigate Causes, to enquire into expenditures & to call delinquents for unaccounted Millions to severe reckonings, they will do   what they have hitherto shamefully neglected, pass necessary Laws for this purpose. This heavy Tax & the prospect of increasing impositions will shew our constituents the necessity for consolidating our strength, as well as the impropriety & danger of new expensive Military enterprizes. Virtue & Patriotism were the Motto of our Banners when we entered this Contest, where is virtue, where is Patriotism now? when almost every Man has turned his thoughts & attention to gain & pleasures, practicing every artifice of Change Alley or Jonathan's (4)-when Men of abilities disgracefully neglect the important duties for which they were sent to Congress, tempted by the pitiful Fees of practicing Attornies-when Members of that Body artfully start apoint, succeed, & then avail themselves of the secrets of the House, commence monopolizers & accumulate the public debt for their private emoluments; I believe many such tricks have been acted. The particular instance which I allude to cost these States a large Sum of Money without putting the Criminal to the expence of a blush. When Men in almost every important public department are actually concerned in Commerce incompatible with the strict duties of their respective Offices, when the most egregious delinquents meet with support in Congress & escape examination-I am tired & fear tiring you Sir with this horrible half finished picture. I will therefore leave it but not before I add that the United States of America are in most deplorable circumstances, that the acquisition of a foreign Minister has fixed the Eyes of Europe upon them, that their weaknesses & their wickednesses are no longer hidden, that the States respectively are much to blame, & that without speedy reformation their shame & ruin collectively will follow.  The disaster of Admiral Byron's Fleet & the successful departure of Count d'Estaing's are events much in our favor, that is to say, if we are pleased to make a wise improvement of them but from experience fearing the contrary I am almost tempted to wish they had not happened. These fortunate circumstances will lull us to sleep again, & while our Ally is gaining honor, aggrandizement & the highest national advantages we shall be sinking into a State little better than tributary & dependent-be this as it may, the World will ever honor by acknowledging the virtues of the Man who from my inmost Soul I believe keeps us at this Moment from crumbling.  I have the honor to be With the most sincere Respect & Esteem, Dear Sir Your much obliged, & obedient humble Servant,  Henry Laurens.  ""

You are forthwith to proceed to Maryland, and there apply to Governor Johnston, who is requested by Congress to put under your command all the armed Gallies, that shall be manned and fitted out by that government for the expedition, and if upon your Arrival you should find any of them not ready for Sea, you will then use your best endeavours to expedite their equipment with the utmost dispatch.(2)  As Congress have also requested a number of Gallies from the State of Virginia and as your security on the voyage to Charles Town will in some Measure depend upon a junction of the Gallies from each State, it is highly requisite you should make yourself immediately Acquainted either by Letter or applying to the Governor in person, with the Number of Gallies that will be fitted out by that government, and the time they will be ready for Sea, and if those from Maryland can be equiped nearly about the same, and it is not disagreeable to the Governor of Virginia, you will then so govern your measures as to form a junction of your little [fleet] in some convenient place in Virginia from whence you will proceed to Charles Town in South Carolina.  If Virginia should not be disposed to furnish any of her Gallies for this expedition or if it should be disagreeable to either of the Governors of Maryland or Virginia that the Gallies of each State should sail in company, you will then proceed with those from the State of Maryland. If Maryland should not be in a situation to furnish and equip her Gallies for this expedition, you will then if not disagreeable to the Governor of Virginia take the command of these to be furnished by that state. You are to assist as far as lies in your power in manning and equiping the gallies from each State, and to be careful in establishing a proper system of Signals for the government of your fleet. You are to receive from the Quarter Master General on board the Gallies from Maryland a quantity of bar Iron not exceeding ten Tons. When you arrive in Charles Town in the State of South Carolina you will there receive and Obey the Orders of the commander in chief in the Southern Department.

  Sir 21st November [1778] I have been near two Months in possession of your favor of the 5th of September without power to make a proper reply until the present opportunity because Congress had not determin'd upon the appointment of a Deputy Quarter Master General earlier than the 17th Instant.  Within the present Inclosure you will receive an Act of Congress of that date, by which you will be informed that you were then unanimously elected to the Office above mentioned, and this Act will be your Warrant for proceeding in the execution of the Duties of your Appointment.(1) NOVEMBER 21, 1778  I have had more than one conference with the Board of War respecting your Rank. The Board are of opinion that there is no Rank incidental to the Office, and therefore declined the insertion of Rank in a Commission. I have instanced the Commission of your Predecessor, to this I have been answered that there had been some management in that case unknown to Congress, and altogether improper. This opinion seems to be supported by referring to all the Deputy Quarter Masters in the other Departments, none of whom, as far as my knowledge extends have Rank in the Army as of right annex'd to the Office, altho' they are generally complimented with the title of Lieutenant Colonels. In the late Arrangement of the Quarter Masters' Department, not a Commission has been issued from my Office, and I observe that the Commander in Chief directs to my Neighbour, commonly call'd Colonel Mitchell, \""John Mitchell Esqr. Deputy Quarter Master General.\"" You will naturally ask, have Congress established no Rule in this Case? This shall be my inquiry, and if I discover that you are entitled to Rank, by Rule or established precedent, you may depend upon receiving a proper Commission by the next Messenger to Charlestown. In the meantime I will endeavour to prevail on my Honorable Colleagues to move Congress for an appointment in your favor of Quarter Master General of the Southern Department. There appears at present an absurdity in the term of Deputy, when compared with the Appointment of Major General Greene, & his power of appointing all his Deputies, from whom you receive no instructions, nor are you in any respect accountable to him under an appointment descending directly from Congress. I will not trouble you Sir, with further reasonings on this subject, you will perceive my inclination from what I have already said to obtain for you all that of right appertains to your Office. I know that heretofore Commissions have been shamefully prostituted, and I am informed that former Deputy Quarter Masters in several instances from favoritism and other vicious sources derived Rank; if this be true, I am too well acquainted with your Principles Sir, to suppose you would wish me to follow such examples-the Army cried aloud against them, and the last Arrangement was intended to prohibit and abolish the practice.  I have the honor to be, With Regard, Sir, Your Obedient & Humble Servant  P.S. Upon further investigation I find that the Officers under General Mifflin as Quarter Master General were entitled to Rank, & Colo. Mitchell informs me that none of the Deputies of Major Genl. Greene in the present Establishment have Commissions. As Commissions have from necessity been lodg'd in the hands of Governors, Presidents of States and General Officers & no returns made of the disposition of such Commissions, it has been hitherto impossible for  the President of Congress or the Board of War to ascertain with precision an Army list. This has occasion'd much clashing of Rank. We are now endeavouring to lessen the mischief, and if possible to remove it altogether.  ""

When I consider the high Character which NOVEMBER 23, 1778  one Man sustains and the Depth of Art which he is Master of; the low mercantile Cunning & Plausibility of another,(3) the servile and adulating Disposition of some on this side of the Water, the Commercial Interests & Connections of others, and the too formidable Combination of Men of Ambition, Avarice and Vanity, to sacrifice the Characters of those whose Conduct is a perpetual Remonstrance against them, I cannot say I am without Apprehensions of what may befall that eminent American Patriot. I fear America is too unsuspecting long to continue free. Men of corrupt Principles, who seek to accumulate Honor & Wealth to themselves, to the Prejudice of the Publick, will endeavor to lull the People into Security, or, as they will call it, perfect good Humour, that they may not keep a vigilant Eye over them. It is the Right of the People which they ought to exercise, a Duty which they owe to their Posterity to think & speak & publish with a decent Freedom, their Sentiments of publick Men & Measures. Adieu.(4)  ""

Don Juan de Miralles a Spanish Gentleman highly recommended by the Governor of Havanna will accompany Monsr. Gérard, the whole suite may amount to six Gentlemen & perhaps a servant to each.

I beg Mr. Okely will forbear with me a few days longer. I consider him as a merciful Creditor & when an opportunity presents I will pay him more in one Act than all my words are worth.

  Dear sir, Philadelphia 23d. November, 1778. I hold myself always responsible to a Creditor & if my debt is greater than he is apprized of I think it mean to avail myself of little remissnesses on his part as a pretext for concealing a little of the Account, nor will I take advantage of my Lord because he has gone into a far Country, nor hazard my fame to be ranked with the cursed unaccountable, He to be, accountable, family, the most numerous & most infamous of all the tribes in the Northern & Eastern parts of our ununited States.  When about 13 Months ago you left York Town you were pleased to deposit in my hands five hundred & twenty Paper Dollars & said you would inform me from Fredericksburg how to dispose of them, this I esteemed an honorary procuration, & although you have failed of your promises to write, yet as I have heard of no supersedeas I hold myself to be your true & Lawful Attorney in the State of Pennsylvania, in virtue of my power therefore I have paid to Mrs. Middleton's Chestnut Street Housekeeper one hundred & twenty five Dollars which the good Woman says ought to have been twenty five golden Guineas. I received from her several articles of your household furniture which she had saved from the claws of the Enemy, & profiting by her information, I have by a little address of my own & much adroitness of Mr. James Custer [squeed?] out a great many more from your late Landlady, the whole as James informs me falls short of Mrs. Morton's account, & he is therefore determined to exercise NOVEMBER 23, 1778  his utmost skill for the recovery of the balance. You will receive within his list of every thing I mean of the things referred to which are now in my possession or rather in his. Pray order your Secretary Sir, to inform me what I shall do with them, poor as I am I have not a covetous eye upon a single article, the black silk petticoat excepted. I think it will afford me a couple of very clever under Jackets, if you should hear that it has been destined to such service impute it to no other desires than those which this frigid clime & the horrid price of quilted silk in these times naturally provoke. I have consulted our friend the Chief Justice on the propriety of selling all these articles except the one before excepted. I forget what was his opinion, I will consult him again to day & pursue his advice. James has been continually on the look out for an empty Waggon going to our Country, had such an opportunity presented it would have been embraced even at some expence in order to have put your property into your own hands, especially the finer articles & a straw Box & narrow deal Case which Mrs. Morton says contain Papers, these however you may be assured are as safe as you would wish them to be if they are full [of] all your juvenile Billets doux. Don Juan de Miralles expects a Waggon from Charles Town this may afford me a proper conveyance, but should my new Landlady our old Landlady's daughter Allen again eject me under a pretence that she mistook our bargain for Rent because she has been offered more, I shall certainly order all the heavy articles to be sold at auction in preference to lugging them from House to House. I fancy when you left York Town you had no expectation of hearing so long a tale of your deserted effects, I won't tire you with any more of it but say in a word I will do for you as I would for my self for upon my honor if you wanted an old black silk quilted Petticoat as much as I do & I had one to spare it should be at your service. You will also find under cover with this an Account from your Landlord, if he presses very hard for the paper part before I receive your Audit I must pay it, this seems to be implied in the surrender of your demeans which had been in his custody -for the Gold I must move to postpone.  The state of the Garrison at New York, the disaster of Byron's fleet, the escape of Count d'Estaing & the prospect of his running in triumph through the West India Islands are topics of our present conversation, you will read more extended accounts of each in the News Papers & this moment we learn by a Vessel from the West Indies of a second engagement between Mons. d'Orvilliers & Ad. Keppel in which the former 'tis said gained a victory. I wish this may be true.  I have the honor to be, With great Respect, Sir, Your obedient & most humble servant, Henry Laurens.  ""

Mr MK said to gen T you are a rascal, gen T said you are a damned rascal.  Quest. by Mr MK. Are you sure I called gen T. a rascal, pray recollect.  A. Yes, I am certain of it. He said to gen T. You are a rascal And I was astonished at it.(19)  The witnesses being examined brigr. genl Thompson addressed Congress & said If any expressions were used by him respecting the exchange which might give offence, he hoped the situation of his Mind & the circumstances attending his captivity would be taken into consideration and allowances made and that they will not be imputed to an intention of insulting Congress for whose honour & dignity he has the highest respect. He begs the patience and favourable attention of Congress, while he states a few facts relative to himself.  In the beginning of the year 1776 he was sent into Canada. While there Genl Sullivan being informed that a large body of troops were sent into that province judged it proper to attack them in detail, and for that purpose sent him with a body of Men to attack a party at trois Rivieres. That in Obedience to his Orders he marched & made the attack. The enemy were more numerous than was expected. He had the misfortune not to succeed and to be taken prisoner. But even his enemies acknowledged he had done his duty & behaved gallantly, that he was taken in the field with his sword in his hand. That while he was on board a prison ship in the harbour of Quebec Gen Sullivan & gen Lord Stirling were captivated on Long Island and quickly exchanged.(20) That though he did not mean to depreciate the merits of those generals, he hoped he should not be deemed presumptuous when he thought himself not behind them in the discharge of his duty. That though by this his feelings were wounded he quietly submitted to the pleasure of Congress.  That after this being permitted to return home on parole, he waited with patience until Congress should have it in their power to exchange him and give him an Opportunity of again entering into the service of his country.  That after this genl Lee was captivated and after a time exchanged.(21) The reputation of that officer and the expectation Amer-  ica as well as Congress had from his Abilities induced him (brigr. T.) to submit, though he could not forbear silently to lament his hard fortune. His spirits however were bouyed up with a glimpse of hopes that he might be exchanged for govr. Franklin. That to forward this he had written to his excellency W. Livingston governor of the state of New Jersey, which he understood claimed govr. Franklin as their prisoner; that in answer he recd. a letter from Govr. Livingston informing him that from a regard for him the state of New Jersey consented to the exchange of govr. Franklin for him & for this purpose they relinquished to Congress all their claim to govr F. That having recd. this letter he hastened to Genl. Washington's head quarters hoping soon to share in the honour and danger of defending his Country. That though some obstructions were thrown in the way of this exchange by the enemy, still he was encouraged by the Comy of prisoners to hope it would take effect.  What he felt, when deprived of this last hope, it is more easy to imagine than describe. But however deep the wound or keen the sensation, his sensibility was still more deeply wounded by reflecting on the person preferred to him and the circumstances attending the capture if not surrender of the person preferred.(22) He will not dwell on those circumstances nor on the character of the person. This may be inviduous. They are Known. Congress doubtless had good reason. But stranger as he was to those reasons he felt the most pungent pain, that a man taken in his bed, sleeping when the enemy was at his door, who had never hazarded himself in defence of his Country, should be preferred to him who was taken in the field, in the discharge of his duty in a hazardous but unsuccessful enterprize.  Still however by the courtesy of the enemy, though deprived of what he most eagerly wished for, an opportunity of sharing in the dangers of his Country, & employing his talents, if any he has, in her defence in the hour of her distress when a savage foe was desolating her frontiers, still by the courtesy of the enemy he was indulged with the sight of his wife & children. But upon coming to Town last Wednesday and finding himself by the call of the enemy deprived of this last comfort & that instead of returning to visit his wife and children, that are very dear to him & whom he tenderly loves, he must now be dragged to a prison & possibly to end his life in a prison Ship or in a cold jail in Halifax, & when under the poignancy of his grief and distress he was as he thought tantalized with a new hope by a man to whom he owed no obligations but rather thought himself aggrieved on some former occasions, his patience deserted him and under those circumstances he is sensible he expressed himself with some asperity against that gentleman. But whatever his expressions might be or however they might strike others, he solemnly declares he   never meant to abuse or reflect upon the honourable Congress or any of its Members; And is heartily sorry that under any circumstances any expressions could be extorted from him which could be construed to give this house offence. Upon the whole he submits himself to the wisdom of this house but trusts that in deciding upon the charge against him, Congress will weigh every circumstance and acquit him of any intentional insult to Congress, from which his own heart acquits him, And appealing to Heaven For the rectitude of his heart, the purity of his intentions, his zeal for the cause of America & respect for Congress submits himself to the justice & goodness of this house.(23)  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 23d Nov. 1778. Two posts have arrived and not a single line from New Hampshire. I had many promises of a constant correspondence before I left home but these I find are forgotten, however as I am determined to clear myself of a charge of failure on my part, I think it but just to tell you that this is the last time I shall trouble you unless it is your choice to keep up the correspondence. The Marine Committee have signified their pleasure to the Navy Board that the Ranger should be fitted out under the command of Mr. Simpson.(1) For very good reasons I found it improper to press for a new commission for him at present. However [. . .] his having the command will content him. I should be very sorry to loose so good an officer as I think he will make. I have wrote him on the subject.(2)  I wish I could find some method to get Flour to Portsmouth as I imagine it will be much wanted could vessels be procured with you to take one quarter for the freight and take their own risk? If this could be done I don't know but I could get some ships on the public acct but none will be suffered on private acct.  NOVEMBER 24, 1778  The villainous Monopolizers (or as they call themselves speculators) have raised the price of Flour to 20 dollars here but measures are taken to check this villainy. I wish they may prove efficacious. Please to tell Mrs. W. I have not time to write this post nor shall I find time very often unless she can. Your neglected Friend,  Wm. Whipple.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Novr 24. 1778 The President, before any of the Members could be Supplied with the printed Treaties with France, sent them on to the Governors of the Several States; I take the liberty, (fearing some Accident may have prevented your receiving them) to Inclose one to Your Excellency. These Treaties ought to have been thrown out to the public immediately, but Congress out of their great wisdom thought Otherwise. This business was done after the return of the No. Carolina Delegates, Mr. Burke & myself stayed & sat in Congress as long as we were Authorized by the State to give a Vote. Your Excellency must also have been informed by Mr. Blount when the requisition was made for 500,000 Dollars, No Delegate of No. Carolina was or could be present with propriety.  We have however-patched up this business; 400,000 Dol. have been sent on to Accomplish the first business, and 150,000 to Mr. Blount exclusive of the Other Sum, towards forwarding the Southern Expedition. The President has no doubt informed you of the Views of Congress Should The Enemy not think proper to make an attack on Chas. Town.(1) I am not at present at liberty to Communicate it, as the injunction of Secrecy is not yet taken off. I should imagine Your Excellency would have Influence sufficient to induce the late Levies, to March forward this winter & that as early as possible with Some Volunteers from the Militia. I am one of those Old Politicians who had much rather See my Neighbours house on fire than my Own, but at the same time would lend every Assistance in my Power to quench the flame. St. Augustine during the Continuance of this war (from Her Scituation) will constantly have it in her power, not only to distress our poor frontier State Georgia, by land, but to embarrass and Almost ruin the trade of the four Southern States by their Privateers. Genl. Lincoln whom I had not the Pleasure to See, will Communicate to you the Views of Congress, & I hope he may Inform them, of what may be expected from Our State, after Consulting with you. NOVEMBER 24, 1778  Genl. Howe is Ordered to head Quarters. The little ridiculous matters he has been concerned in, in So. Carolina with regard to a female, has induced the Delegates of Georgia & So. Carolina to desire his recall. Congress Complied with their request but do not intend to enter into the private Amours of their Generals. I hope our friend (should the war Continue) will have an Opportunity of displaying his abilities (which Congress Acknowledge) in the field of Mars as well as of Venus.(2)  I have mentioned Several times to Your Excellency my desire of remaining at home. I am too old to be sent here. It behooves the State to send Men of much greater Abilities than myself. I am now not many years from 60. The Other States have fallen upon a method of keeping some of their Delegates here, who have served from the beginning-Viz. Massachusetts, N York, Virginia &c. But Should the States think proper to Change their Delegates they ought at least to send forward the first men, (I mean as to their Abilities) in the State. N. York has invariably pursued this Plan & have profited by it.  I would not be thought to derogate from the Gentlemen who are with me, I have experienced on every Occasion, their Good Sense, their Honesty & Integrity of heart. But by Changing Your Members often you must of Course know as I am Convinced every Man of Sense must, that it will take a young man of Genius, Ability & Application, three Months at least to make himself well acquainted with the business of Congress-And after he has Accomplished it, in a few months, another is Appointed, who has the same process to go through before he can be made useful to his State, let his Abilities be ever so great & uncommon. I have taken the liberty to give your Excellency my Opinion on this Great Subject with an intention never more to return in the Character my Country has been pleased to honor me with, unless I am forced into it.

  Sir. Philadelphia 24th November 1778. I have already written to you by this conveyance under the 16th, since which I have had the honor of receiving & presenting to Congress your favors of the 7th & 9th which are committed to the Board of Treasury for consideration & Report.(1)  The injuries which you received by the fall from your carriage, I had heard of in much more alarming terms than your own account, I am rejoiced to learn, you were so well recovered as to be able to prosecute your journey. I am in hopes the mild Climate of South Carolina will restore your strength.  Capt Barry having made some extraordinary demands on Congress, for allowance of a Table & a Secretary, which: the House have not determined upon, is detained here. I believe Capt Barry to be a brave & active Seaman, but I am told by Gentlemen of the Marine Committee that the intended service is not pleasing to him, 'tis possible therefore he may wish to avoid it, & besides, you will find old Commanders in the two southern States who will be much mortified should he actually proceed & take the Command of them, consequences will arise which will be disagreeable to you & which may prove detrimental to the service. I have suggested these sentiments to the Marine Committee,-the determination of Congress will probably be known to morrow.(2)  Inclosed with this be pleased to receive an Act of Congress of the 17th Inst. for subjecting the Troops raised in the State of South Carolina to the same regulations as the other forces of the United States are under except in Cases governed by contrary stipulations; for explaining a Resolve of the 16th September 1776 respecting the appointment of Officers on the general Staff & for appointing Capt Ed. Hyrne dep. adjutt. gen. & Stephen Drayton Esqr dep. Q.M. gen. in the sothern department.(3)  I have the honor to be with great Regard Sir Your obedient & most humble servt, Henry Laurens, President of Congress  ""

  Gentlemen November 24 1778 Since our last of the 19th we are favoured with yours of the 5th instant (1)_we are pleased to find you have settled Colo. Langdons Account and paid him the balance. We observe you have contracted for building two of the Packet Boats we ordered which we think will be sufficient for the present as every thing is so extravagantly dear.

The enclosed Resolves of the 26th August 1776 will inform you what provision Congress have made for Officers & Seamen disabled in their service. We are now forming a New system of Rules & Regulations for the Navy and would be glad you would send us any remarks that you may think will Assist in that work. Application has been lately made to us for pay and Prize Money by Mr. Hill who it appears has served with a good deal of Merit as a volunteer on board the Ship Ranger.(2) We think when he Acted as an officer where there was a vacancy he ought to receive the Same pay as the Officer in whose station he acted, and we request you will ascertain that matter and pay him accordingly. With regard to his prize Money we cannot order him more than a Common share, but are of opinion if he did act in a vacancy that the Officers of the class should allow him the Share of the officer whose place he filled.  We request you will forward us an exact List of all the Commissioned Officers in your department with the dates of their Commissions and how they are now employed.

  Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 24th. 1778  We now take up the pen although we have nothing that we imagin is new to communicate; because we would not subject ourselves to the imputation of neglect.  Adml. Byron's Ship and five of his fleet have arrived off Sandy-hook in a shatter'd condition. The Admls Ship hath lost her Bow-spreet, mizen-mast and main-top-mast, the others are all dismasted. We may adopt Queen Elizabeth's motto on the dissipation of the Spanish Armada on this occasion. St. Vincents is taken; and, now Count DeEstaing is left uninterruptedly to persue his operations in the W. Indias, we may soon expect to hear of the conquest of all the Windward-Islands; and perhaps of the destruction of the fleet which sailed from New York about the same time that the Count left Boston. The Hollanders are well disposed towards Us. They want a share of our commerce. We hear nothing from Spain. The important business of financing is on the carpet and We hope Congress will soon be able to take such measures for reducing the quantity of money in circulation, as will check the depretiation of it at least, if not appretiate it. Taxation & loaning are the only engines to effect this purpose.  Thus, Sir, we have thrown together every thing we can recollect of any kind of consequence, and are with great respect, Your Excellency's most obedient, humble Servants, William Ellery  John Collins ""

  Sir Philadelphia 24th Novr. 1778.  Enclosed are the Treaties between His Most Christian Majesty and the United States, which Congress have ordered to be sent to the Government of each State. It is not thought expedient to publish them at present in the newspapers.(1) NOVEMBER 24, 1778  We are informed that the Assembly of New-Jersey have at length acceded to the Confederation, and authorized their Delegates to ratify it in Congress.(2) The Assembly of Maryland is also now sitting- 'tis hoped the two latter will agree to the Articles of Confederation before they rise.  Congress has for some days past attended to the affair of the Currency every day, & have agreed to persevere until some measures are concluded on. They have some votes on the subject, but no plan is completed. We have no material News from foreign parts-and whether the Enemy intend to evacuate N. York this Winter remains as yet uncertain.  The Committee on the late Commissary General's affairs have not reported since the recommitment.  The appointment of Jonth. Trumbull Junr. Esqr. to the Office of Comptroller of the Treasury was unanimous. His acceptance of the Trust, and speedy entry upon the execution of it, would, I apprehend, be much for the Public good.  I begin to be impatient for the arrival of some of the Delegates from Connecticut, as my affairs require my return home. I hope two will come forward immediately. I wrote to Colo. Dyer and Mr. Root on the subject some time ago, but have received no answer.(3)  The prices of articles are very high here-from six to eight times as high as they were in the year 1774. It is difficult for any one State to fix a Standard in trade for itself without injury to the general interest. I hope a scheme will soon be adopted for doing justice to the Public and individuals without any violation of the Public Faith.  I am with great Esteem & Regard, Your Excellency's Obedient hble Servant, Roger Sherman  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 24d (1) Nov 1778  I need not acquaint you that the State of New Hampshire has not been represented since the commencement of this month as Col. Bartlett will inform you. He left Congress the day before I arrived, which was the 4th inst. Since my arrival New Jersey has acceeded to the confederacy & it's dayly expected Maryland & Delaware will follow the example. The Confederacy then being compleat, less than two delegates will not be a representation even 'tho one should be empowered by the State for that purpose.  The Spirit of Monopolizing under the name of Speculating rages with great violence through the United States the consequence of which must prove fatal unless the interposition of the Legislatures of the several States can check its fury. The plan of finance now under consideration of Congress will have a good effect when compleated, but that as well as many other important matters are exceedingly retarded for want of a full representation. Only nine States have been represented since my arrival 'till within three days, there are now Eleven States barely represented, this tardiness in the States or their Delegates, besides retarding the most important Business makes it exceeding fatiguing to those that do attend.  I have the Honour to transmit you the Treaty of Alliance &c &c between His most Christian Majesty and the United States of America.  No intelligence has been received since Col. Bartletts departure we are still in suspence about the Enemies intentions at New York 'tho it is most generally believed they will evacuate that place.

DECEMBER 1, 1778  Our greatest Danger at present is from the wretched State of the Currency. This, Congress are paying all possible attention to, & had it not been a most embarrased as well as important subject, would before now have compleated their resolutions upon. Whatever other measures it may be necessary to adopt, a heavy Tax must be submitted to at all events & funds established for payment [of] Interest & to sink, in a reasonable time, the capital Debt; which tho' large indeed is by no means beyond our ability to discharge. The avails of one good horse or yoke of fat oxen would now, I believe, pay a midling Connecticut Farmer's proportion of it. A very cheap purchase for the prize we have been contending for; & which, it seems to be the disign of Heaven we shall soon have the full & peacable possession of.  It was very kind in you to inform me of the welfare of my friends at Windsor & particularly of Mrs. Ellsworth & my little daughter, with an anecdote upon the latter, which, however trifling in its own nature, you rightly judged would appear ot[herwise] to a parent; and I sincerely wish you in due time all the pleasures without the pains I have known under this Relation.  For the news of the day I refer you to the enclosed paper & am, with much esteem, Dear sir, your most obedt. & most hbl Servt.  Oliver Ellsworth P.S. The paper is mislayd.  ""

  Sir, Phila. 1st Dec'r 1778. The Legislature of our State having at Length complied with my ardent wishes in sending for the money which was long since obtained, and which I did hope, would have reached their Treasury many months ago, I cannot omit the first Opportunity of testifying to you my Joy on that Occasion. Money matters are, of all others, those which I wish to have least concern in. Many Reasons may be assigned for this, which your Delicacy will catch at a Glance. But among that many, there is not one which did not give me Solicitude while so considerable a Deposit remained with us. I say, with us, for altho I did not personally touch or take Charge of it, yet in the minds of my Constituents I was doubtless considered as one of those who was accountable for any accidents which might happen.  My time being continually occupied, even to a minute, insomuch that I am under a necessity of borrowing large Portions from my DECEMBER 1, 1778  Slumbers, I have not seen the act you allude to in your Letter. I am told however that an advance is made to each of the Delegates of 1000 Dollars. I am also told that in Consideration of the Expences which must necessarily have accrued by living in this Town, the Legislature have directed the additional Sum of three Dollars pr Day, to be paid since our arrival in this City.(1) I pray you, Sir, on the first convenient Opportunity to make the proper Returns on my Part for this equitable Provision. Since I am on the Subject of money, which I think will not be an object in many of my Letters, I am to observe that considering the high Trust with which I am honored by my Constituents, I determined to support the Character to the Extent of what would be afforded from my private Fortune. Whether the State would make Retribution rested indeed with their Generosity, but this was by no means a bad Foundation. At any Rate I knew the worst and after certain Expenditures, I should inevitably have quitted a station the Dignity of which I could not longer support. My expences have been by no means small.  Before I left New York, an advance was made to me, but how much I cannot at present ascertain, for as the Receipt &ca., were of Record, I took no memorandum. In order that my account may be adjusted, I am to request, that I be considered in the Public Service as from the 25th of Dec'r 1778,(2) True it is I left the State much earlier, but I staid a considerable Time among my Friends in New Jersey, wherefore, counting the Days I was really on my Journey, back from the Time I Came to Congress, will bring it to that Period. In addition to what I received there, I have had of Mr. Duer 2000 Dollars, which he will I suppose charge in his accounts. I shall also receive now the 1000 Dollars before mentioned in advance. The auditor will find no Difficulty from these Data to make out a proper account which I hope may be done.  I must again intreat that your Excellency will urge to the Legislature the Necessity of adjusting the public accounts so that Congress may finally settle the Ballance. I have the Pleasure to say that after many earnest Efforts the Treasury Board is at Length organized and I hope to see my Labors on this Occasion productive of some good Consequences to my Country. Hoping this greatest Reward I have the Honor to be your Excellency's most obedient & humble Servant  Gouv. Morris. Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:323-25.  1 In his November 8 letter to Morris, Governor Clinton had alluded to a November 4 act of the New York legislature that added three dollars to the daily allotment of seven dollars for delegates in Congress.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 1st Decemb'r 1778. We are now to acknowledge the Honour of your Excellency's Dispatches of the 18th and 21st Ult.(1) by Messrs. Bancker and Wynkoop for whose return we made the necessary Preparations without delay. This day will be spent in counting and paying the money, a Trouble which will fall on Mr. Duer who has charged himself hitherto with the Care of it.  We had the good Luck to recover the Copies of the Constitution of our State which were printed, and on our retiring to York Town, left in this City. They are forwarded by this Conveyance: part of the Expence of the Press was defray'd by Mr. Duer- & the remainder by Mr. Lewis which with the advance of 1000 Dollars for each of the present Delegates will be deducted out of the money granted by Congress.  It gives us particular Pleasure that we are at Liberty to transmit to your Excellency several Copies of the Treaties of Amity and Commerce between his most Christian Majesty and the United States. Your Excellency will see how totally groundless have been the suspicions propagated by our Enemies respecting these Treaties. They will appear to be founded on perfect Equality, and in every Respect liberal and reciprocally beneficial. It is the Direction of Congress that no Impression of them be made untill their further order.  We have not yet the Pleasure of Mr. Jay's Company.(2) Mr. Ethan Allen has lately presented a Paper to Congress, as an act of what they call the Assembly of the State of Vermont. It is calculated to shew that the New Hampshire Towns on the East side of Connecticut River which Joind in the Revolt had retracted and seperated from the Towns on the west side. The Design of this flimsy artifice is obvious: but it was a little unreasonable for the Projectors that only two days after the Production of this Paper, Lieut. Col. Wheelock presented a Remonstrance from the Revolted Towns on the East side of the River, complaining that Allen had no authority to make the before mentioned Declaration; that they utterly renounced it and adherd to their Revolt from New Hampshire.(3)This Incident renders ridiculous the Plan which Allen and his adherents boasted of as decisive. When Mr. Jay arrives we hope this important Subject will be taken up, notwithstanding Congress is pressed by a variety of Objects which call for attention and Dispatch.  While we lament the reiterated sufferings of our Fellow Citizens from the Depredations of the savages and disaffected, we agree with your Excellency that every defensive system in a predatory war must prove vain and Chimerical and that a vigorous Irruption into the Enemy's Country can alone promise advantage and Safety. To this DECEMBER 1, 1778  great object we shall extend our Views and endeavour to have it carried into Effect as soon as the Season will permit. In the mean time, if the whole of the New York Brigade which is ordered to march for the Defence of our Frontiers is not thought a sufficient Force, be pleased to inform us, and it shall be our Care to obtain the aid you may require and to promote any measures which may be recommended for the immediate Protection and future Security of the State we represent.  We have the Honour to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedient humble Servants, Jas. Duane,  Fra' Lewis, Gouv'r Morris.

It is the desire of Congress that this perfidious proceedure may be exposed in the fullest Light, and they, therefore, request that your Excellency will endeavour to procure further Evidence, and, if possible, one of General Carlton's proclamations or orders requiring those Troops to join their respective Corpses.(1) One thousand Dollars in Specie are now delivered to Mr. Bancker for the purpose of making the necessary discoveries, to be employd in such manner as your Excellency shall be pleased to direct; when it is expended you will be pleased to remit the account to the Treasury board that you may be properly discharged.

And now, Sir, finding my Brain relieved, by this little Exertion of Fancy, from the' State into which it had been beaten by the Pros & Cons in a Discussion upon Finance, I think I can venture again upon the disagreeable Subject for a moment or two. While we are plodding here to reduce the Quantity of circulating Medium, cannot Associations be formed to discountenance one great Source of Depreciation which operates more strongly than even Quantity. I mean the speculating Spirit which is devouring us in geometrical Proportions. Taxation is doubtless our first object here and will most readily be received by all the People. Loan is another, if not the second to be pursued; but then, Quere, foreign or domestic? How shall Monies now received in Loan be paid? As those received in 1776?

  Decr. 4 [1778].(1) The president communicated to Congress another (2) unsigned note from the Minister of France, relative to a plan he had proposed for  DECEMBER 4, 1778  discharging the debt due to Roderique Hortalez & Co, alias, Beaumarchais, namely by furnishing the french fleet in America with provisions for the amount of which the court would procure the United States a credit with R. Hortalez & Co. The note was delivered in english in the words following.  Leave is begged from the hon. President of Congress to submit him some reflexions upon a late conversation.  The insinuation made was founded upon the consideration that the method proposed would be more simple, more easy and more convenient than any other &c that besides, the troubles, the expences, the dangers of the sea and of the enemy, the spoiling of the cargoes &c would be avoided.  The manner of executing this plan if adopted could be very simple and attended with no inconveniency. The court shall take upon herself to satisfy the furnisher of the articles in question and Congress shall receive his discharge for ready money in his accounts with the court. December 4. 1778.  About the 2d or 3d of December Mr. Girard had desired me to inform Congress, that as the Court of France were indebted to these States for the supplies of provision to Count D'Estaing's fleet at Boston, he recommended to Congress to draw a line in M. Beaumarchais' account which should seperate the articles of Cannon & Military Stores from other articles in that account-that the amount of such Cannon & Stores might be set against the amount of supplies to Count d'Estaing, & a Balance struck as the case might be. This Mr. Girard said would be an easier & safer means of paying for such Cannon & Stores than by remittances exposed to the danger of the Sea. I asked Mr. Girard if this would not be acknowledging that the Court of France had furnished those Stores, which as I understood, the Court wished to conceal. This question a little alarmed Mr. Girard, who said Ah! we are now in War.  I reported the desire of Mr. Girard to Congress & intimated my own wish that Mr. Girard should signify what he had said to me in writing in order to avoid mistakes. Congress directed me to apply to Mr. Girard for that purpose. I applied immediately in consequence of which Mr. Girard sent me a Note of which the preceeding is a Copy, and although it is not quite a Copy of our conversation, 'tis plain enough to shew that the court had something to do with the furnishing Cannon & Stores-otherwise a Minister plenepotentiary I should presume would not have interfered in this manner.(3)  But who is the furnisher? M. Beaumarchais says he is.  Mr Deane in one place, says the Cannon & warlike Stores were granted to his request.  In another place, he says (4) \""finding there was a surplus of Cannon  in the arsenals to be disposed of I waited on the Minister & solicited the liberty of purchasing them but was refused, then proposed to procure a Man to purchase them on condition he should not be called on for Payment until he received his Remittances from America. I could not obtain this. This application I made previous to my Contracts with Monsieur Beaumarchais.\""  In another place Mr. Deane says (5) \""after which I mentioned to His Excellency (Count Vergennes) the situation in which the Cannon & Stores I had purchased actually were & prayed his advice. He asked me of whom I had purchased. I told him, he said there had been some very imprudent conduct & seemed to blame Mr. Beaumarchais.\""  ""

  My dear Sir (1) Philadelphia Decr 5th. 1778 About a fortnight ago I was informed by Mr. Dugan that the Sloop Friendship in which I understand you are interested, had been seizd by the Naval Officer in Baltimore because a Permit was not applyd for and obtaind before a Quantity of Flour was put on Board agreably to a Law of the State of Maryland. As the Flour was publick Property, and shipped partly by Order of the Marine Committee and partly by the Commissary General, I immediately laid the Matter before that Committee, and at their Request wrote a Letter to the Governor of Maryland, stating the Circumstances to him, and another Letter to William Smith Esqr. of Baltimore desiring him to send a Particular Account of the Seizure & Condemnation and wishing to know whether any Person had taken Care to prosecute an Appeal here in Behalf of the Owners.(2) I have since had the Pleasure of being informd that the Governor and Council had thought proper to send for the Papers & Evidence which appeard on the Trial and on Enquiring into the Matter had discharged the Vessel & Cargo, the owners paying Cost. I thought it necessary to give you this Information, that you may take such Measures as may seem to you best.  Having said thus much upon a private concern, I would fain talk with you a little, if I had Leisure about the Publick. I am persuaded that our Enemies have long despaird of subduing us by the Power of their Arms. They have lately sent their Commissioners to amuse and deceive us. Those Commissioners are returnd without effecting their Purpose. Great Britain is already involved in a War with France, and I believe will soon be with Spain. These two Powers have so long been preparing and are so well prepard for the Rupture that the British Fleet has not been more than a Match for one of them. If they had been joynd on the 27 of July last, they would in all Probability have maintaind the Sovereignty at Sea at least for a Season. Great Britain will therefore find herself so engagd, especially if Spain joyns with France as to be obligd to withdraw her Attention, DECEMBER 5, 1778  in a great Measure from America. Should she call off all her Troops, we must still have an Army for other Purposes besides defending our selves till Peace is established. If we wish for a permanent Peace, Canada & Nova Scotia must be ours. We may then hope for a Share in the Fishery; & you know the Importance of that to the Massachusetts State. Besides other Advantages of the Fishery, it will be a Nursery of Seamen for a Navy; & without a Navy America will never become formidable or respectable. She will never be able to afford Protection to her Trade. The Fishery then is of great importance to all the United States. It does not appear probable that Great Britain would easily be prevaild upon to cede to us Canada and Nova Scotia when serious Negociations may take Place. Will it not be wise then for us to wrest those Possessions from her, if it be in our Power? We are told there is a Time for Peace; and that Time will come, when we shall be driven to it by the Necessity of our Affairs, which God forbid! Or when we shall by the Smiles of Heaven, have obtaind such Advantages as to ensure a lasting & happy Peace. I have heard it has been said of me on a late occasion and perhaps to serve the Purposes of some political Men; that I am averse to Peace. I was formerly chargd with endeavoring to enkindle a War. I will assure you, my Friend, that whenever our Enemies will close with us upon Terms consistent with the Safety of our Country, the Honor of Independent Nations and the Faith always due to Treaties, I will most cordially consent to them; for there is nothing which for my self I more ardently wish for, than the sweet, and in this Period of my Life, the profitable State of Retirement into private and domestick Life.  Adieu, my dear Sir. With Sentiments of Esteem and Regard for all Friends in your Circle I am very affectionately, Yours, S.A.  [P.S.] I shall be much obligd if you will write to me when you have Leisure. I wish to know the particular State of publick Affairs in Massachusetts Bay.

  My Lord. Philadelphia 5th December 1778.  I am particularly indebted to Your Lordships obliging favor of the 1st December. Those of public concerns under the 29th November DECEMBER 5, 1778  & of the date first mentioned remain yet a secret to Congress, I mean the Contents; for I have day by day for some days past announced these & many other public Letters to the House.(1) Your Lordship will justly conclude that the business which has obstructed the bare hearing the import of dispatches which for aught we know may be nothing less than the evacuation of New York Garrison or the reinforcement of that place by Ten thousand new troops, must be exceedingly momentous. I speak to you Sir as a Gentleman & fellow Citizen.  My last date to Your Lordship is the 1st Inst.(2) I owe you News Papers of Thursday & this Morning two of each, together with two Copies of General Lee's & one of General Sinclair's trials will be found in the packet which will contain this. Congress have not yet decided on these Cases; this Morning's Paper shews the determination on Major Gen. Schuyler's. Your Lordship will observe the coverings of General Lee's trial are of different colours, the Marble was published by Order of Congress, the blue I apprehend by General Lee's order. I bought this of the Printer & have not had time to examine it. I am not conscious of any impropriety in requesting Your Lordship to recur to the Verdict of the Court on the second Charge which is founded on the 13th Article of the 13th Section of the Articles of War, & then to the 12th Article of the same Section. Had I the Articles before me I should score under the words & runaway & be strongly of opinion that the Copyist had, which is easy to imagine, inserted 13th when 12th had been the fact,(3) but if this be arcanum & not a plain error, it would be highly impertinent to attempt to develop a single jot-which is not my meaning.  I believe the late Report of a second naval engagement; although we have received no further accounts.  I thank Your Lordship for the offer of kind consolation, but My Lord when Liberty is tottering on the verge of a precipice & her Salvation dependant upon an hypothesis, 'tis impossible that her Sons should suppress apprehensions. Indeed My Lord the Baby Independence is asleep, the Nurse is gadding & the Wolf is at the Door; if the Gypsey does not return at this very instant the Innocent Child will be torn to peices, for besides the danger from the Wolf there's a fox in the House & a Tyger approaching. Believe me My Lord my mind is not of a gloomy cast, & believe nothing more of my understanding than bare common sense & a very little penetration, those who would ruin us will readily subscribe to the latter.  I have the honor to be, With the highest Respect & Esteem, Sir, Your Lordship's Obliged & Obedient Servant.  Henry Laurens, private ""

  [December 6, 1778] When I was about closing this Letter Your Excellency's favor of the 23d Ultimo was brought to me; three days passed over before other important Affairs under consideration of Congress before the House would permit it to be received. Yesterday it was read and committed to the Marine Committee whence I hope it will soon be returned with a proper Report.(1) I had with Colonel Smith's consent detained this Messenger from the 28th Ultimo to the 2nd Instant for the printed Arrangements, amused by the Printer with promises of having them finished much sooner, and from the 2nd to this day, DECEMBER 6, 1778  from a prospect of receiving a determination from Congress respecting the Gallies without the intervention of a Report. This day the 6th, and Sunday too, I have had such a variety and quantity of Public business on my hands as has rendered it impracticable for me to add these few lines till 8 o'clock P.M., the whole detention nine days, for which I shall order payment of the expences of Man and Horse.  I can assure Your Excellency from the best authority that in the Month of August the Court of St. James' applied to that of Madrid to use its influence in mediating between the former and the Court of Versailles. Spain listened and required the terms; these being disclosed, but I have not time to relate particulars, were highly resented by the King of Spain as an insult upon himself because they were inconsistent with the dignity of his good Ally. Spain was in the middle of September in motion with all her Armaments bespeaking the very near approach to hostilities.  I have the honor to be &c.  ""

  My Dear Marquis. Philadelphia 6th December 1778 I most sincerely rejoice at your recovery from so dangerous a fit of sickness as you described yours to have been in your favor of the 29th Ultimo. I had been given to understand that you were but slightly indisposed by fatigue, your maxim Dear Marquis is just what unfortunately is is generally out of sight when we are in good health, & stand most in need of the application.  I have presented your public Letter to Congress & thence it has been put into the hands of a Committee, which I hope will not delay to report as they are fully sensible of your anxiety to commence your Voyage & of the dangerous approaching Season of the Year.(1) I have at this Instant no remembrance of the printing the Letters you allude to & would rather say I will enquire tomorrow than risque the loss of this opportunity by an immediate enquiry, I recollect to have applied to Congress for an order to print but forget the result.(2) When Congress authorize me to write to you, the several persons you have named shall be duly notified of the Messenger's intended departure who is to conduct my dispatches.  DECEMBER 6, 1778  Colonel Laurens is still here & desires me to assure you of his respect & good wishes & he is equally mortified at the disappointment of meeting you at camp or on the Road when he was coming to Philadelphia.  There is a Comedy of errors between Mons. Giemat & Monsr. du Plessis, each are jealous of an advantage which he supposes the other has gained while each remains in statu quo Lieutenant Colonel nor would I advise these my freinds to be anxious for obtaining a Commission in an order which by the late arrangement is abolished in the American Army. I have the honor of transmitting with this half a dozen Copies of the late arrangement which shews there is no grade between a Lieutenant Colonel & a Brigadier, now suppose Colonels Commissions were given to these Gentlemen what would be said in France by any person acquainted with this arrangement, either that the Commissions had been surreptitiously obtained or that Congress had given them a blank Paper to get rid of their continued importunity & both the arrangement & the importunity are well known at their Court & will from thence diverge to all parts of the Army.  I have been about four hours writing this Short Letter & yet every syllable has been written in haste & without premeditation, judge Sir, how often I have been interrupted. I often mentally repeat Pope's words.  Shut shut the door good John fatiqued I said.  Tye up the knocker say I'm sick I'm dead.  I will not yet take a final leave of my good freind I shall have the honor of addressing him once more before this week expires. Congress yesterday confirmed the sentence of the General Court Martial on General Lee. His Letter which you will read in Dunlap's Paper of the 3d Inst. will do him much hurt, it is exceedingly malicious & will be answered, the answer will be pointed, I judge so from my knowledge of the pen, which I am told is to perform it. He has certainly exposed himself to very severe Strictures, but I will not interfere in these matters.  Mr. Dean's Letter which appeared in yesterday's Paper, astonished one of his best freinds. I have not read it, but such of its contents as have been related to me lead me to think his silence would have discovered more wisdom-you will find a Copy within.

  Sir 6th December [1778] I had the honor of writing to your Excellency yesterday by a Messenger to Lord Stirling. This will be accompanied by an Act of Congress for taking eventual Measures for emancipating the Province of Quebec dated the 5th Instant.(1) The 4th Instant Congress resolved to promote Lieut. Henry P. Livingston to be Captain in the Corps of Your Excellency's Guard vice Captain Gibbes promoted.(2) Mr. Livingston having called on me for his Commission I have delivered it to him. The 5th it was resolved to lay aside the Plan for raising a Corps to be called the German Volunteers, in which a Mr. Feuher and Mr. Kleinshmeit had obtained Commissions to be Captains;(3) these Men deserted some Months since from the Enemy's Garrison at New York and I think came hither from Your Excellency's Camp; the Board of War in their Report on this head intimate as our reason for desisting from raising the intended Corps, the late bad behaviour of the two Captain's abovenamed which revived in my Mind that they had been upon their arrival at Philadelphia conducted to me by another pretended Deserter and Quarter Master in the Enemy's Army, a Jew, who has since been discovered to be a fellow of infamous character. He interpreted from them several pieces of intelligence respecting the Enemy which were altogether groundless, and must have been calculated for sinister purposes. I therefore esteem them suspicious and dangerous  DECEMBER 7, 1778  Persons, and have made these remarks in order to apprize Your Excellency in case of their appearance at Camp. The same day Lieut. John Carter having signified by Letter that he consider'd his promotion in Colonel Baylor's Regiment of Horse irregular and injurious to other officers in that Corps and desiring leave therefore to resign his Commission, the House Resolved to accept his resignation,(4) and also on the same day Congress resolved as will appear by the inclosed Act \""that the sentence of the general Court Martial upon Major General Lee be carried into execution.\"" (5)  I have the honor to be &c.

  Dear Sir 7th December [1778] By this Sea Conveyance I shall not say much because I think the chance of miscarriage is great, and because I mean to write again in a day or two by a safe hand out of reach of Bachop, if my Packet escapes the Enemy Your Excellency will receive four or five of the latest Newspapers, the most striking Articles in these are General Lee's and Mr. Deane's Letters.(1) DECEMBER 7, 1778  The former has made neither Proselytes nor Advocates; the people in Carolina will see at the first glance how open he has laid himself and I am told he will be attacked in every vulnerable part by a Pen which possibly may not hurt his feelings while it displays truth to the World. Congress on Saturday last Resolved that the Sentence of the Court Martial against him be carried into execution, eleven States present, 6 Ayes 2 Nays, 2 divided, and 1 unrepresented-Members 16 Aye, 7 no-1 excused not having the Tryal nor heard the Debates, which deprived New Jersey of representation. I shall send particulars by Land.  Your Excellency will be so good as to recur to my Letter of the 11th August.(2) What might then have appeared trifling to many People will now be regarded as a well founded and well intended alarm. This Appeal to the people this rash unnecessary appeal I trust will this day be attended to in Congress, but as I am concerned in no intrigue or Cabal I am consequently ignorant of the designs of my fellow labourers. The Honor and interests of these United States call upon every Delegate in Congress for support; if therefore other Men shall be silent, I will deliver my sentiments in this very extraordinary circumstance and I have in prospect the production of much good out of this evil.  Your Excellency will receive among other Papers, Lord Stirling's discoveries of the Enemy's strength of Troops in America. I believe the aggregate much overrated.  The Court of London in August last applied to that of Madrid for a mediation between the former and the Court of Versailles. Spain required an explanation by a specification of terms, and being informed that a revocation of the Duke de Noailles' declaration of March, last would be expected, the King of Spain heard the Proposition with much resentment as being inconsistent with the honor and dignity of his good ally, & therefore an insult upon himself. In September all the Spanish Armaments were in motion, predicting, perhaps only threatening, immediate hostilities.(3)  I have the Honor to be &c. H.L.  ""

  Philadelphia, December 7, 1778. To the candid and impartial PUBLIC  Mr. Silas Deane having in his Address, in Mr. Dunlap's last paper,(1) thrown many dishonourable reflections on several persons highly trusted by America, and too far distant to answer for themselves, I think it but justice to those injured characters, to request that you will suspend your judgments, until the matter is fully investigated by those whose immediate business it is, and who are most likely to be possessed of the means to establish the truth, when, no doubt, all the parties will receive their due, whether of reward or punishment, and the public good be secured.  In the mean time I hope you will take a view of the several characters, from the commencement of the present contest with Great Britain; the part they have acted; what they have sacrificed; and what were their probable prospects; and then I am sure you will agree with me, that the narrative is void of probability, and ought to be supported with much better evidence than insinuations, inuendoes, and bare assertions.  As to the decency of the performance with respect to that Body, to which America must always owe its safety and happiness, I leave it to those whom it may concern. And the real friends to the independency of America will determine on the propriety of such a publication, in the present situation of our affairs. For my own part, I so reverence the Representatives of the People, and have so warm a concern for the public welfare, that I had much rather my nearest connections should suffer a temporary injustice, than offend the one, or in the least injure the other.  I too, most sincerely wish you to be on your guard. Trust not professions; hear both sides, and judge from well attested facts.

It is more readily accessible in Deane Papers (NYHS Colls.), 21 (1888): 66-76.  2 Deane's response to this letter, which appeared in the December 10 issue of the Pennsylvania Packet, consists of a quotation from Congress resolve ordering him to \""report to Congress in writing,\"" and the following rhetorical statement. \""He  DECEMBER 7, 1778  [Deane] therefore conceives he cannot with propriety continue his narrative at present: In the mean time he submits it to their [' free and virtuous Citizens of America'] good sense, Whether he ought to take any notice of a publication signed Francis Lightfoot Lee, opposed to stubborn and undeniable facts.\"" Ibid., p. 78.

  In Congress Decr. 7. 1778.(1) Hon W. A. Attlee (2) being summoned to give evidence respecting the charge against Brigr. W. Thompson, attended & being called in & sworn says  That last Wednesday two weeks Mr. McKean, Mr. Evans and himself were in the Coffee house in the evening. That Mr McKean observing Mr Harnet a member of Congress went up to him. That Mr Harnet mentioned to him that gen Clinton had proposed to exchange the officers of the Convention troops for our officers who are prisoners. That Mr. Bradford the commissary of prisoners came up-that understanding the officers out on parole were ordered into New York he (Mr. Attlee) asked Mr. Bradford if he had a list of the officers out on parole, Mr. Bradford said he had, That they both sat down in the box with Mr. Evans to look over the list, That upon perusing it he saw Genl Thompsons name first on the list-That while he was looking it over Mr. McKean came & sat down, afterwards Col Deane came and sat down-That some of the company seeing genl Thompson in the coffee house said, There is genl Thompson. That Mr McKean called Genl Thompson-That genl Thompson took no notice-That Mr McKean called him again-He then came up-That Col Deane rose and went away and Genl Thompson sat down where Col Deane sat. That Mr McKean mentioned to Genl Thompson what Mr Harnet had mentioned to him about the exchange of prisoners- That Mr McKean seemed to be in good humour when he mentioned this-That genl Thompson flew into a passion-That he cannot recollect the particular expressions of genl Thompson, but thinks genl Thompson either said Congress are a damned set of rascals, or there are a damned set of rascals in Congress, he Mr. Attlee, is not certain which, adding, and you are one in particular. And immediately after mentioned he was more obliged to genl Clinton than to Congress, that he who was taken fighting in the field was not exchanged, while others taken in their bed were exchanged.  Q. Did you hear any mention of a dispute between Mr McKean & Genl Thompson at Carlisle, and at what time did you hear mention made of that affair, was it before or after what you have related.  A. It was in the latter part of the Conversation; After what I have  DECEMBER 7, 1778  mentioned. Genl Thompson said Mr McKean had used him ill at Carlisle-that he had attempted to take his servant from him and had sent him a summons.(3) Mr McKean said it was not a summons but a polite letter and asked if he had it. Gen Thompson said he had it not and used some coarse expressions.  Q. Did you hear anything about the exchange of govr Franklin for Mr McKinley.  A. The exchange of govr. Franklin for Mr McKinly was mentioned that exchange seemed to give genl. Thompson offence. It was then genl Thompson said He who was taken fighting was not exchanged, while another taken in his bed was exchanged.  Q. Was this before or after the mention of the affair at Carlisle?  A. After this the Carlisle affair was mentioned.  Q. You said you thought genl Thompson either said Congress are a damned set of rascals or there are a damned set of rascals in Congress, Are you sure gen Thompson used either of those expressions7  A. I am not sure But it seems to me he used one or other of those expressions?  Q. Repeated.  A. I think he made use of words to that effect.  Q. When gen Thompson said to Mr. McKean, And you are one in particular Do you think he applied the expression to Mr McKean as a member of Congress.  A. I understood it so.  Q. By Mr McKean. Do you recollect my assigning reasons for my conduct in voting for the exchange of govr. Franklin for president McKinly that it was in the civil line, captain genl for Cap genl and that I was ordered by my state to solicit that exchange?  A. I dont recollect. After the mention of the exchange genl Thompson asked Mr McKean several times, are you a gentlemen. Mr McKean said I am your superior.  Q. Was this before or after the mention of the Carlisle affair?  A. This was before the mention of the affair of Carlisle.  Q. You have said you think gen Thompson either said Congress are a damned set of rascals or there are a damned set of rascals in Congress. These are two very different ideas, which idea did the expression used convey to you?  A. I was struck with the idea that Congress were a damned set of rascals.  Q. Did you hear genl. Thompson say he was more obliged to Gen Clinton than Congress, and at what time or on what occasion?  A. After the expressions I have mentioned, Gen Thompson said he was more obliged to genl Clinton than to Congress.  Q. Did you hear gen Thompson challenge Mr McKean?  A. After saying, And you in particular are one, genl Thompson  two or three times asked Mr McKean are you a gentleman.  Q. What did you think he meant by the question, was it for information?  A. I understood that by asking Are you a gentleman he meant that Mr McKean might give satisfaction as a gentleman.  Q. Did gen Thompson touch Mr McKean when he asked the question?  A. He laid his hand softly on Mr McKeans shoulder.  Q. Was genl Thompson Angry?  A. He appeared Angry during the whole.  Q. Did gen Thompson appear to be in liquor?  A. He did not appear to be in liquor.  Q. Did genl Thompson particularize the cause for which he called Mr McKean a rascal?  A. I dont remember he assigned any particular cause any otherwise than I have mentioned. He said he who was taken fighting was not exchanged while an other taken in his bed was exchanged. And that Congress had used him ill.  Q. Did it appear to you there had been any former animosity between them?  A. I did not imagine there had been any before Mr McKean called general Thompson.  It appeared genl Thompson was angry at some transaction in Congress in which Mr McKean had a part.  Q. Did genl Thompson sit down in the box.  A. Yes & put his hand over & shook hands with me.  Q. Upon the whole did you understand there had been any former misunderstanding or difference between them?  A. I thought gen Thompson's anger proceeded from transactions in Congress and the affair in Carlisle.  Q. When genl Thompson called Mr McKean a rascal had there been any other conversation than about the exchange?  A. I do not recollect any other.  Q. Did you hear Mr McKean use any terms of reproach to genl Thompson and what were those expressions?  A. I do not recollect any other than what I have Mentioned.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia Dec. 8th, 1778 in Congress.  In the letter we had lately the honour of writing to your excellency we gave you some articles of intelligence which did not turn out to be  DECEMBER 8, 1778  true notwithstanding we had part of them from Ld. Stirling.(1) This will make us cautious in future.  A few days since Capt. Reed of the Packet Baltimore arrived here after a long passage from Nantz. He brings news that the Brest Fleet had returned after a months cruise. It seems that the French Admiral had sent his compliments to the British Admiral, & told him that he was where he had lately had the honour of some conversations with him, and that he should be glad to see him there again, that after cruising ten days vainly hoping to see him he returned to Port. This we had from good authority. The same Authority, the President, informd me that Mr. Girard had told him, that the British King had desired the King of Spain to mediate a Peace between him and the King of France. Spain replied that she was ready to undertake the office provided She was made acquainted first with the proposals that Britain intended as the ground work of a mediation. This drew from Britain a number of propositions, of which the leading one was, That the King of France should retract the Declaration made the last Winter by the French minister to the Court of London respecting the Independance of these States &c &c. This most extraordinary proposal was received by Spain as a high insult, and in consequence of it every thing in that kingdom was in motion.(2)  Capt. Reed informed Us that the Fox was taken by a French frigate and carried into France.  The Baltimore last paper says that the Swift Sloop of war in chasing the Rattle snake, a privateer of this place, a shore near Cape Henry, had run aground herself. That the Enemy had burned her and surrender'd themselves to the Crew of the Rattle snake. The Enemy have already lost more ships than they did the last War.  Mr. Harrison Secretary to Genl. Washington in a letter to Congress received yesterday (3) says that his Excellency had received intelligence that the Enemy had sent about 50 sail great & small with soldiers on board up Hudson's River with an intention, as was supposed, either to rescue the Convention Troops on their march to Virginia, or to attack the forts in the High-lands; and that Genl. Washington had made dispositions to defeat their Intentions. This is all we can recollect at present. Congress last Winter recommended it to the several States to transmit to them all Acts that they had passed, since the November preceeding, in pursuance of recommendations of Congress.(4) None have yet come to hand. We should be glad to know what is going in our State, and are with great Respect Your Excellency's most obedt humble Servants, William Ellery  P.S. The Plan of finance is not yet decided.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Decr. 8th. 1778 I received your favor of the 24th of last month and am much obliged to you for the useful information Contained in it. I have disposed of the letter agreeable to Your request, after having well perused it.  We have no important News here either foreign or domestic. We have had accounts from France as late as about the middle of Sepr. The Brest Fleet that Sailed in quest of Admiral Kepple, not meeting with him is returned into Port. Kepple also remains in Port with his Fleet. We have not heard from Count De Estaing Since he Sailed from Boston. I wonder how it happened that Mr. Trumbull did not receive the Letter from the Treasury Board Notifying to him his appointment to the office of Comptroller of the Treasury. I Saw it Sealed up & directed to him. The Board will write again this week.(1) The Committee have not reported a Second time on the late Commissary's Affairs. The present regulation is that the Commissary General of purchases Appoints all the Deputies and Assistants & displaces them at pleasure-and is allowed half per cent for all monies that are expended in that business. The mode of paying Commissions for purchases in that or any other department is generally Supposed to have a tendency to enhance prices, and will probably be altered. Congress has not finished the plan of Finance. I wish I had the Governor's Sentiments on the Subject. I hope public Faith will be preserved, that the Bills will be drawn in by taxes gradually at about the value they were issued so that justice may be done to the people at large-That the lenders on loan office certificates will receive an Equivalent in value to the money lent.  I dont imagine that a Foreign loan will be beneficial further than to answer our engagements abroad, until we can make remittance in Country produce. What we owe & pay Interest for among our selves does not impoverish the States taken collectively-and our own resources I think would be Sufficient if properly applied with good economy. Enclosed are the resolutions respecting the Arrangement of the Army. You mistook my proposal to the govr about compound Interest. I did not propose to borrow Money on those terms. It was only a computation of the present [value] of the Bills of Credit in case they were redeemable in twenty Years, and considered only as notes for money without Interest. The longest period that it is proposed to  DECEMBER 8, 1778  borrow money for, is 3 years on Simple Interest, & payable in currency-but the Bills are to be redeemed by taxes within Such a term of time as it can be done without being too burthensome to the people. I should not wish to take any out of circulation by loan were it not to make room for further emissions. If we could disband our army we could easily redeem our Bills.  I am very respectfully, Your humble Servant,  Roger Sherman ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 8th Dec 1778. This acknowledges the receipt of your favor of the 16th. It gives me pleasure to hear you have passed a Proscriptive Act.(1) I should be glad to be favored with a copy of it, also of all other proceedings of the Court-but I suppose according to custom I am to be kept in profound ignorance of all public proceedings, though I think, in my present situation, I ought to be particularly informed of every transaction. Count d'Estaing's proclamation will undoubtedly have a good effect.(2) A packet is arrived from France but brings nothing of importance. She has had a long passage-left Nantz in September-the latest date by her from Paris is 31st August.  Agreeable to your desire I enclose you the latest papers, by which you will find some of the great servants of America have got into a dispute.

  Sir Philadelphia 8th Decr. 1778 I had the Honour of receiving your favor of the 6th Ulto with its inclosures, 'tho it did not come to hand till the 1st of this month.  Your Letter to the President has been laid before Congress and is refer'd, with the depositions to the Treasury Board.(1) My best endeavors shall be used for the accomplishment of Your wish in that Business.  I was informed by Col. Ethan Allen (who left this City a few days ago) of the proceedings of the Green Mountain People; that Gentleman promises to use his influence to prevent any farther trouble to New Hampshire from that Quarter. Whether his influence is sufficient to effect the purpose is a matter I can not undertake to decide upon, but by the appearence of so small a Majority in favor of his proposition, I should suppose it at least doubtful. I am rather inclined to think that nothing will effectually settle the dispute but New Hampshires opposing her claim to that of New-York; even if she should afterwards (supposing the decision to be in favor of New Hampshire) agree that the grant on the west side of the River should be a seperate State, because in that case New Hampshire would have it in her power to settle the line to her satisfaction, and perhaps avoid some disagreable disputes that may otherwise arise.  Mr. Wheelock has been here with a memorial to Congress from those people who withdrew themselves from the Windsor Assembly. After giving it to the President, he met with some discouragements and made application to withdraw it, but I understand was refused by the President. This Memorial has been read in Congress & filed, I shall endeavour to transmit a copy of it by next post, I dont know but Mr. Wheelock is still in this City. I have not had the Pleasure of seeing him; from some perticular circumstances I am led to suppose he avoided me, his reasons for so doing I am unacquainted with.(2)  A Packet is lately arrived from France but has Brot nothing new having had a long passage, the latest dates by her is 31st Augt.  Intelligence is just received that the Enemy are gone up Hudsons River with fifty transports, their intentions by this Manoeuvre at present rests intirely on conjecture, perhaps it may be a feint to cover their retreat, this however is only a conjecture of [my] own and without any real foundation. I wish I may soon have the pleasure of congratulating you on so desirable an event.  I have the Honour to be, with the highest sentiments of Respect, Sir, Your Most obt & very Huml Servt, Wm.

  Decr. 9. [1778] The foregoing I had laid aside, & probably should never have forwarded it to you, had not an extraordinary Peice appeared in the last Saturday's paper signd S. Dean, in which he avows himself to be the Author of the Queries I sent you a few Weeks ago.(1) I believe you will find the Plausibility of this Performance, which I shall inclose, to be answerable to a Character I have given you in the Letter above. He \""had the Honor to be the Commercial and political Agent of America in Europe.\"" He might have said more justly that he had the Honor of being employd by the secret Committee of Commerce as their Agent, and by the secret Committee of Correspondence as their Intelligencer. Mr. A Lee he says \""having by a wanton Display of his Errand, given great & just Cause of Disgust to the Court of Spain, returnd.\"" I will relate to you certain Matters which may explain, if that Court was disgusted with him as Mr. D asserts, how it came to pass Soon after the Secret Committee was appointed, which if I remember rightly was about three years ago, they wrote a Letter to Mr. Lee then in England, requesting a political Correspondence with him, and desiring he would give them the best Intelligence he could, and pledging to him their Confidence.(2) Mr. Lee being thus honord, in Mr. Dean's Sense, as a political Agent of America, and having the solemn Assurance of Confidence and Secrecy, with his usual fidelity & as became him in that Character, proceeded with unsuspecting Frankness to open to the Committee what he thought as well as what he knew of Men and Measures. There was at that time in England a Mr. Carmichael, who is lately arrivd in America & since appointed a Delegate in Congress for the State of Maryland. Mr. Lee had a good Opinion of this young Gentleman; and he being at that time about to return hither by DECEMBER 9, 1778  the Way of France, Mr. Lee thought him a safe hand, and entrusted him with Dispatches to the secret Committee. His Letter was written on the inner Sides of the Outside Leaves of a small pocket Dictionary, and so neatly closd to the Covers as not to afford the least Suspicion if it should meet with the Fate of being taken by the Enemy. Mr. Carmichael took the Dictionary & went over to France where he remaind till his late Embarkation for Portsmouth at which place he arrivd last Summer. In France he met with Mr. Dean. The Letter was opend! Who probably committed this Act, Mr. Dana can inform you as well as I can. To him I refer you. I desire you would ask him & if you please let him know that I desire it of you. He can tell you more than I chuse to trust in writing. I hope you are by this time become confidential with him. But this is Digression. I have seen the Letter. It is dated the 3d of June, '76.(3) There are containd in it free Sentiments of the Minister of Spain, but such as a Man of Mr. Lee's Integrity could not withhold from the Committee. Such Intelligence, I must say, being thus pyrated- Such Secrets betryd, Judge who \""wantonly displayd his Errand\""- and by whose Means the Court of Spain saw Cause to distrust Arthur Lee, if they did distrust him. I say if they did distrust him, because I doubt the Fact. If they restricted him to the City of Burgos, as Mr. Dean says, I rather think it was owing to the Caution of that Court, least she should too early offend the Court of London by giving Countenance to an American Commissioner.  Mr. Dean says, \""At this Place (Berlin) he (A. L.) was so unfortunate as to do nothing, unless indeed he may give the Name of Business to the Loss of his Papers,\"" by which a Discovery was made of the Secrets of his Colleagues & the British Ministry enabled to counteract the Measures taken for the Benefit of America. The Anecdote is this. In Berlin, Mr. Lee being invited and dining abroad, the British Envoy found Means to get his Closet and his Trunk forced open and his Papers were pilferd. But Mr. Lee having Intelligence of it, immediately made Application to the Minister of Berlin and by his Interposition the Papers were returnd; as I am informd in a few Hours.(4) Mr. Dean designs to hold up my worthy Friend in this Instance as careless of the Secrets of his Colleagues. But what Security is there against the Rape of the Lock? This indeed is the second Instance of his losing his Papers. The first by the Behaviour of the Person to whom he had regularly committed them, for which I will not now give a Name; and the other by the Theft of a British Minister. If he had been as fortunate in the early discovery of the one as the other, Mr. Dean might allow \""the Name of Business\"" to be given, if not to the Loss of his Papers, to his Activity & Address in recovering them.  It is pleasant to see Mr. Dean indulging his Talent in Insinua-  tion to lead his Readers to conclude that A. L. was secretly intriguing with the British Ministry & thereby embarrassing our Affairs in France. His Acquaintance with the Earl of Shelburne who had formerly been his Patron in England, was the Ground of Suspicion of his disclosing our Secrets; \""joynd to his undisguisd Hatred & Expressions of Contempt of the french Nation in General.\""  I have good grounds to be satisfied from a Conversation I have had with a great Man (5) who ought to be and undoubtedly is perfectly acquainted with the french Court, that Mr. L is thought of there differently from what Mr. Dean would have the People here think of him, and that the Insinuation \""that he had given universal Disgust to the Nation whose Assistance we sollicited\"" is void of any just Foundation. But so long ago as \""in the Summer of 1777 a Correspondence between a certain Dr. Berkenhout & the Hon Arthur Lee Esq took place.\""(6)Aye, and it was \""on political Subjects.\"" If Mr. L had left it to be discoverd by the Sagacity of others that there was such a Correspondence between him and Dr. Berkenhout & that Dr. B. was in the Confidence of the British Ministry, Mr. Dean might have supposd there were Grounds to suspect Mr. L's Integrity; but unfortunately Mr. Lee told it himself to his Colleagues and related to them a Part of the Correspondence. Mr. D would here insinuate as he did in his Queries that it was a criminal Correspondence. But if it has been, would Mr. Lee have exposd himself to Mr. Dean? The Man whom he conceivd to be his mortal Enemy? Surely not. A wise Minister will endeavor to possess himself of the secret Designs of the publick Enemy. This is done by a Variety of Means. Mr. Lee corresponds with Dr. Berkenhout (as Mr. Dean says) a Confident of the British Ministry. A shortsighted Politician believes or a prejudicd & designing Man insinuates that it is a Criminal Correspondence. If it was so, Why was not Mr. D who knew it in the Summer of 1777, so faithful as to acquaint his Constituents, the Congress, of it? To have done this would have shown the Appearance of Fidelity. He relates a Story & as he says himself \""simply\"" thus. \""A Gentleman of Character told me that his Correspondent in England\"" &c. (See the 3 Collumn of his piece.) Who this Gentleman of Character is, and who the Correspondent in England, it was needless to tell us; but we learn that in Mr. D's Opinion a Gentleman of Character may have an English Correspondent. This Correspondent informed this Gentleman of Character, and because Mr. Dean tells us so, it is sufficient for us faithfully to believe it and damn Dr. Lee's Character. But I fear I have tired your Patience. Adieu.  ""

  Gentlemen [December 9, 1778] (1) Ever jealous for the dignity of Congress, and prompted by a sense of Duty, I had the honor on Monday of laying before the House, informations which I had received from Citizens of respectable Characters, that a certain Letter, signed S. Deane, and address'd to the Citizens of America at large, published in the Pennsylvania Packet of Saturday the 5th Instant, which I presumed every Member had read, had created anxieties in the minds of the good People of this City, and excited tumults amongst them-that having received such information, I had carefully perused the Letter,  DECEMBER 9, 1778  and found it to contain Articles highly derogatory to the honor and interests of these United States.  That I could not be suspected of having prejudices, or of being engaged in any intrigue or Cabal against Mr. Deane, since, I could declare upon my honor, that no Gentleman on the floor knew so much of my sentiments respecting Mr. Deane's Public Character, as I had communicated to that Gentleman himself (2) that seeing Mr. Deane had made his Appeal to the People, and had intimated a design of giving them a course of Letters, it was evident, he did not mean to depart from America so suddenly as he had lately declared to this House.  That from these considerations, I held it dishonorable to Congress to hear him the following evening, and thereupon I humbly moved the House \""to appoint a Committee of three, to consider and report specially upon the contents of the Letter abovementioned- that in the mean time Mr. Deane be informed that Congress will give him further notice when they desire to hear him in the House.\""  This motion was seconded by many voices-an amendment (3) was offered by an honorable Gentleman-\""that the Printed Letter be read,\"" which being put to question, passed in the negative by a majority of one State.(4)  I then renew'd my motion, founded upon common fame and my own certain knowledge of the facts-this was over ruled by calling for the Order of the day,(5) for which a single voice, you know Gentlemen is sufficient, and from that time the motion has remained neglected.  I feel upon this occasion, not for any disappointment to myself, but for the honor and dignity of this House, the great Representative of an infant Empire, upon whose conduct the Eyes of Europe are fixed.  I have, from the moment in which my motion was quashed,(6) seriously, and almost constantly reflected on the above recited circumstances, and have again attentively considered Mr. Deane's Address to the People.  I see no cause to regret my conduct on Monday, and I am confirmed in my opinion, that the Address contains groundless and unwarrantable insinuations and intimations respecting the conduct of this House.  Mr. Deane had never offered to this House a Narrative in writing of his proceedings in France, in his character of Commercial and Political Agent, nor hath he, even to this day, produced proper Accounts and Vouchers of his expenditure of Public Money.  He was notified on the 3d Instant by your President, that Congress had resolved to take into consideration, as on that evening, \""the state of their foreign Affairs\""; that such branches as he had been  particularly concerned in, would in due course become subjects of their deliberation.(7) In a Letter of the 4th \""he thanked Congress for that intimation.\""  In the same Letter he informed them \""that he had prepared to leave this City, and had made his arrangements accordingly, which it would not be in his power to dispense with for any time,\"" and yet on the 5th he published an Address \""to the free and virtuous Citizens of America,\"" in which he complains \""that the Ears of their Representatives had been shut against him,\"" and tacitly promises them a course of Letters.  He informs the Public that he had been sacraficed for the agrandizement of others.  He charges one of your Commissioners (8) with such improper conduct in his Public character, as amounts, in my Ideas, to high Crimes.  He avers that the same Commissioner \""had been suspected by their best friends abroad, and those in important Characters and stations,\"" although he had given Congress no such information in writing, which he ought to have done, even long before he commenced his Voyage from France.  He insinuates that the same Commissioner had been improperly forced upon him.  He sets up a charge against another of your Commissioners (9) for a species of peculation and other malversation of conduct, which, if true, it was his duty long ago to have exhibited to Congress.  He arraigns the Justice and the Wisdom of Congress.  He charges and questions the conduct of an honorable Member of this House,(10) out of the House, and holds him up to the Public in a criminal light, which ought not to have been done before he had lodged a complaint in Congress, and had failed of their attention His publication is a sacrafice of the Peace and good Order of these States to Personal resentments, and so far as it regards Congress, it is groundless and unwarrantable; wherefore, be the remainder false or true, it is, in my humble opinion, a pernicious and unprovoked Libel, affrontive to the Majesty of the People.  I am neither a Volunteer advocate for the private characters stricturized in Mr. Deane's Paper, nor an Enemy to Mr. Deane. In a word, I view the performance in question as an Act, unbecoming the character of a Public Servant-altogether unnecessary, and tending to excite fears and jealousies in the minds of those free and virtuous Citizens of America, to whom Mr. Deane has addressed himself, and also to draw the conduct of Congress into suspicion and contempt-and I still hold my opinion, that it was the duty of this House to take the Address into consideration before they admitted the Author to a further hearing.   Nevertheless Congress were pleased to adhere to a Resolve passed on Saturday subsequently to the open appearance of that unnecessary and insulting Publication, for hearing him in writing, contrary to a Resolution of the fifteenth day of August last, which was obtained at that time after much debate, by the reasonings and votes of Gentlemen who had interested themselves strongly in his favor, and from motives assigned which cannot be effaced from the remembrance of those Gentlemen who were then present (11)-and time is NOW given to Mr. Deane for preparing a detail of his transactions, which, if I understand any thing of Public Business ought to have been completed and ready for presentation before he landed on the American Shore.  I feel my own honor, and much more forcibly the honor of the Public deeply wounded by Mr. Deane's Address,(12) and I am persuaded that it will hold out such encouragement to our Enemies to continue their persecution, as will, in its consequences, be more detrimental to our Cause than the loss of a Battle. Mr. Deane has not contented himself with the scope of Dunlap's Newspaper, he has caused his Address to be printed in a thousand Hand Bills-these will afford a sufficient number for penetrating the remotest part of our Union, and enough for the service of our Enemies.  I know that what I am about to do will give a transient pleasure to our Enemies, knowledge derived from a circumstance which induced me to continue in this Chair after the 31st of October last,(13) more strongly induced me than that unanimous request of this House which I was then honored with. There are Gentlemen upon this floor who are well acquainted with the circumstance alluded to (14)-but Gentlemen, their satisfaction will indeed be transitory, for I here again solemnly declare, and they will soon learn it, that I am determined to continue a faithful and diligent labourer in the Cause of my Country, and at the hazard of Life, fortune, and domestic happiness, to contribute, by every means in my power to the perfect establishment of our Independence.  I shall have less cause to regret the carrying my intended purpose into effect, foreseeing that you may immediately fill with advantage the vacancy which will presently happen.  I shall hold myself particularly answerable to my constituents for my present conduct, and in general to all my fellow Citizens throughout these States, when properly questioned.  Finally, Gentlemen, from the considerations abovementioned, as I cannot consistently with my own honor, nor with utility to my Country, considering the manner in which Business is transacted here,(15) remain any longer in this Chair, I now resign it.

  [December 9, 1778](1) (a) Mr Deane had in private at his special request related to the President the whole, as he then said of his transactions in his twofold character of Commercial Agent and Commissioner to the Court of France. When he had finished his conversation of two hours, the President replied, \""According to your relation, Sir, and which I will believe, because you have related the whole upon your honor, every thing stands fair on your part, but from my Youth I have in such cases as these been governed by the maxim, hear the other Party, therefore you will excuse me for delaying a final opinion. Another thing Mr Deane, I must say, for I flatter no Man, I think you ought to have brought your Accounts. You could never hope for a better opportunity.\"" N.B. Mr Deane came to Philadelphia in time of profound peace between England and France, in a Convoy of thirteen Ships of the Line-but had left his Accounts behind him in France, as he informed Congress, \""in a safe place.\"" About £250 000 Sterling had passed through his hands, or under his direction.  (b) This amendment was artfully offered in order to bring on debate and spin out time, and the mover accomplished his end- it passed in the negative, because every Member had already read the Letter. DECEMBER 9, 1778  (c) This measure had been preconcerted by the Mover of the Amendment above mentioned, who was in the party of Mr. Deane.  (d) In effect quashed by the artful manuevre which had parried and postponed the motion.  (e) Arthur Lee.  (f) William Lee.  (g) Richard Henry Lee.  (h) It had been moved on the 15 August that Mr Deane should render an account of his Mission in writing-this was opposed by his Party, who urged that a verbal Narrative would be sufficient, and more likely to discover truth than a formal and studied written Account. Now in December, the same party urged, merely for the purpose of foisting in (as afterwards appeared) much groundless slander and obloquy upon the Messieurs Lee and leave the same upon record.  (i) The Presidents one years service had expired on the 31 st October when he gave notice of his determination to resign the Chair on Monday the 2d November-and had requested Congress to think in the mean time of a proper person to succeed him. On the intervening Sunday, one of Rivington's New York Gazettes was shewn to him,(2) containing a Letter written by somebody, who (after much illiberal abuse upon the Members of Congress in general) speaks in the most favorable and flattering terms of the President and expresses great regret that a Gentleman with whom he had formerly the honor of boasting an acquaintance and friendship. should be sitting at the head of such a Banditti.  This circumstance embarassed the President-if said he, I adhere to my Saturdays resolution and retire from the Chair on Monday, the Writer of this scurrilous Letter will boast of having gained his point-if I retract, I shall act contrary to my own inclination, contrary to the intended rule laid down in our unfinished Articles of Confederation, and moreover I may be charged with vanity or versatility, or both, I will said he to two confidential friends, let the business take its chance.  When Monday the 2d November arrived, he repeated his motion for choosing a President the Members in general strenuously opposed the motion-at length they held a consultation in a circle, and deputed Mr Samuel Adams to address the President, and to express their full and entire satisfaction with his past conduct, and the unanimous request of Congress that he would continue in the Chair-this circumstance afforded an honorable relief to the President, and induced him for the present to submit to the will of Congress.

  [December 9, 1778.] (1) (a) Five States, Ay, for reading the printed Letter; six, No; some of the latter as the President has been informed, were influenced by an opinion that it would be waste of time to read what could give them no information, and these intended to vote for a Committee- the question for a Committee was over ruled by management in spinning out time to one o'clock, when a certain Order of the day to be taken up at that hour, and which cannot be postponed but by unanimous consent, was peremptorily called for.  (b) By the device above mentioned.  (c) The President had frequently premonished Congress of his intention to resign the chair on the 31st of October when he should have served in it one whole Year agreeable to the Articles of Confederation; therefore on that day being Saturday he reminded the House of his several former intimations, and humbly intreated them to make choice of some other Member to fill the Chair on the following Monday.(2)  The House discovered a general disinclination to the measure, and after some (disinclination) (3) determined against a decisive opinion until Monday. On the intervening Sunday Morning, the first of November, a Newspaper, printed in the Garrison of New York, was put into his hands; and he was pressed to read a Letter published in that Paper by some Person who professed much personal regard for him, founded upon an old acquaintance & friendship, and expressing the Writer's astonishment that such a Man as he described the President to be, should sit at the head of that Banditti (or some term of the same import) the American Congress.(4)  This circumstance embarrassed the President. he had been extremely desirous of quitting the Chair but now became adverse to gratifying the Enemy, who seemed to have thrown the flattering Letter above mentioned in his way as a temptation, he therefore waited in silence till Monday for the final opinion of Congress.  On Monday he repeated his request that the House would proceed to the Choice of a new President; after some conversation and debate, the House were pleased to signify by the voice of a respectable Member, their perfect satisfaction with his whole conduct, and that it was their unanimous request, he would continue to sit as President for some time longer, which the President then chearfully DECEMBER 9, 1778  complied with, and he confesses that he felt some degree of exultation in the thought of having it in his power by an event so honorable to himself, to demonstrate to his quondam friend in the Garrison, that he was not to be captivated by flattery.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 9th. 1778. I have not written to you sooner, because in reality I had little of Importance to write. The ancient Motto of \""festina lente\"" or that of \""Nil operose agendo\"" will yet apply to us with too great Propriety.  The Decision of General Lee's affair was never obtained untill Saturday last, when the Sentence of the Court martial was confirmed by a great Majority. The Sentence respecting General Schuyler is also confirmed, but General St. Clair's yet remains undetermined.  DECEMBER 9, 1778  We have unfortunately consumed much Time for some Days past on a Matter of Privilege consequent upon a Charge exhibited against General Thompson for great Abuse given to Congress in General, & personally to the Honble Mr. McKean on Account of the preference shewn to Mr. McKinly in his Exchange for Governor Franklin; and after all it remains yet undecided.  What shall I say as to the great Business of our Finances? I cannot yet determine that I have learned any Thing concerning them, much indeed I have unlearned; for although an amazing Deal of Time has been spent on this important Subject; tho one Hypothesis has been piled upon another like Pelion on Ossa; tho Scheme has been tacked to Scheme, and System succeeded System, while the speculative Genius & playful Fancies of some of our Brethren have again & again in Amendments & a variety of Substitutes exhausted themselves; & finally, when all their pretty wisedrawn Plans were crumbled away in the handling, have often in common Consent assisted to sweep away the rubbish, and begin de novo; I say tho we have ranged in this Way the boundless Facts of Finance & with great Labor & Diligence too, I have for my own Part obtained no more than to determine what will not do for the Support of our public Credit & the prevention of a general Depreciation. When I shall be happy enough to determine what will do Heaven only knows-my Enthusiasm only remains.  Our foreign affairs are in a most deplorable Situation; Mr. Carmichael having taken his Seat in Congress I suppose there is an End to Interrogation with him. Mr. Dean has never yet been heard in Congress since you left us, except an Evening or two ago, when he was before us only a few Minutes to receive Orders from the Chair to deliver in all he had to say in Writing as soon as he thought proper;(1) and in the mean Time that, if he had any Thing very urgent to communicate, he might be heard the Evening following; which then he rather declined, & in fine has not asked-how soon we shall have his written Narration I know not; When it comes I expect it will be interwoven with all those curious Criminations, which, notwithstanding he never even hinted them to Congress, either in his verbal Narration or in any of his subsequent Letters, he has within this few Days in a very extraordinary Manner thrown out to the World through the Channel of a News Paper, which I doubt not you have received.  Thus far I had written in the Morning. I am this Moment come out of Congress, where an extraordinary Event has taken Place-it is this, that President Lawrans has resigned his Seat & to morrow is assigned for a new Election. The Causes of this Occurrence will no  Doubt be given to you by your Brother; Time will not admit of my doing it.  The Enemy have a few Days since made a Movement in Force up Hudson's River. I judge their Object to have been an Interuption of the Convention Troops-in this however they have been disappointed as they were advanced so far as to be out of their Reach-it is said they landed near King's Ferry, burnt a few huts, & returned.  I expect to set out for home some Time tomorrow,(2) and to return in about a Fortnight-shall be glad of a Line from you by the first convenient Conveyance.  I have the Honor to present my most respectfull Complements to your Lady, Family & Connections, & am, Dear Sir, with Esteem & Sincerity, your Obedt. Hble Servt. Nath. Scudder  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 10th Dec'r, 1778. Mr. President Laurens, who has been in the Chair 13 months yesterday resigned, sated with honor, and worn down with fatigue. A respect as to the Confederacy had an influence on this measure. You remember this grand instrument of our federal union restrains the same member from serving more than a year at one time.  A great majority of Congress immediately determined that one of the New York Delegates should succeed in the Chair. We held up General Schuyler, which seemed to be very agreeable. On account of his absence, Mr. Jay was prevailed on to take the chair with a resolution on his part to resign in favor of General Schuyler as soon as he attends.(1) I hope we shall be able to contrive the means of his executing the particular commission with which he is intrusted.(2) On this subject we have not yet conferred any further than to learn to my utter astonishment that he is not possessed of the Maps and papers reported by a Committee of Convention to justify our claims. I entreat your Excellency to forward one of the Maps and a copy of the minutes of the Committee, or rather of their state of the territorial claim of New York.  All the States except Maryland and Delaware have actually signed the Confederacy. New Jersey without waiting for our offer. I fear it will cost me a jaunt to Maryland to prevail on that State to accede; as I am spoken of as one of a Committee for that purpose.(3) Disen- DECEMBER 10, 1778  Portrait of John Jay  gaged as we are from any obligation to New Jersey we propose to hold out the grant of the bounty lands to Maryland The want of ability to gratify their soldiery is a capital if not the material objection.  I write in a hurry after the fatigues of the day. I write in confidence because I have not time to weigh what I write. Your Excellency I wish to see what passes on every important event.  I am with respectful compliments to Mrs. Clinton, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's truly affectionate and most obedient servant,  Jas. Duane ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 10 Dec'r 1778.  Many unavoidable Delays prevented my arrival here till Sunday evening last.  DECEMBER 10, 1778  Yesterday Mr. Laurens resigned the Chair, & this morning Congress were pleased to appoint me to succeed him. This Circumstance was unexpected. Let your public Letters be public ones. I mean that public & private matters should not be mixed in the same Letters.  Commodore Wynkoop's memorial has been presented & committed. You shall have the earliest Intelligence of its Fate.1  I have heard, tho not from authority, that the Enemy have quitted the River without having accomplished any thing of Importance. God Grant it may be true. We have no Intelligence worth communicating.  The Season for bringing on the affair of Vermont is not yet arrived, nor can I divine what will be the Issue of it. I can only say that my Endeavors shall not be wanting to bring it to a Termination satisfactory to New York. Be pleased to present my best Respects to Mrs. Clinton & believe that I am very sincerely your Friend & serv't, John Jay.  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:360.  1 Jacobus Wynkoop was seeking compensation for his service as commander of the American flotilla on Lake Champlain in 1776. His September 29, 1778, memorial and an affidavit from Gen. Philip Schuyler, under whose authority he had served, are in PCC, item 41, 10:355-59. On May 4, 1779, Congress adopted the recommendation of the Marine Committee, to whom his memorial was referred, that Wynkoop \""be paid sixty dollars per month during the time he was in actual service.\"" See JCC, 12:1207, 14:544; and these Letters, 3:204n.7, 620-21.

  My dear Brother Philadelphia Decr. 10th 1778 After having been absent since the beginning of June, I arrived here the 7. of Novr. our bro'r having [left] it a fortnight before.(1) I was astonished to find that S. Deane had made so great progress in the Art of intriguing, as to have formed here a very dangerous party who think it necessary to their designs, to remove all the old friends of Liberty and Independance, for which purpose every Lie their invention can furnish, is circulated with the Air of certainty, and the blackest colorings given to Actions in themselves indifferent or accidental. This party is composed of the Tories, all those who have rob'd the public, are now doing it, and those who wish to do it, with many others, whose design, I fear, is of a much more alarming nature, and a few who wish to succeed to Offices abroad. All these together form a very powerfull body. Having prepared the minds of the people, by a number of understrappers, who have been circulating their insinuations and falshoods thro' the Country with great industry; they opened the attack on the 5th inst. with the peice in Dunlaps Paper,(2) DECEMBER 10, 1778  which you must have seen before this reaches you. The air of importance and confidence which accompanies it and the lavish professions of Love for the people, give it great weight in this City and I dare say, will elsewhere, till the truth comes to be known for they have their dependencies thro' the Continent by means of their new formed commercial Establishments.  I make no doubt you will be astonished when I tell you that Congress has not called him to account for this peice; as at the first glance you must perceive it contains a daring insult to that body, and the greatest injury to the public good. but your wonder will increase, when I assure you, that the part where he complains of the Ears of Congress being shut to him, is an impudent falshood. the fact is, that beside the two Audiences which he had, he wrote them several Letters; in all of which he never mentioned one word of this pretended treachery of yours. every day he might have communicated by Letter whatever he pleased; and some days before his publication, Congress had alotted some part of every day, for their foreign affairs, untill they shou'd get thro' them, of which he had notice.(3) The want of a Cypher, prevents my explaining this fully to you. But you may know, that the old Whigs are really struck with amazement at the boldness of this party; and seem willing to let them run on in full security, that they may the easier get to the bottom of their designs and know the whole of their strength. A great man,(4) appears to me, to give all his influence to this party. I cannot as yet discover what are his intentions. if he really means, mutual Advantage, I think he is their dupe, notwithstanding all his sagacity. If he has any sinister designs upon this Country; they are his dupes; for I know they are not friends to his State. The first consequence which they expect, is the recall of yourself and our bro'r;(5) which may perhaps take place. You will therefore see the necessity of sparing neither time, nor pains, to provide yourself with all the means necessary, both for attack and defence. in the mean time, every thing will be done, by your friends, that is in your [their] power to open the Eyes of the people, and set S. Deane in his true light. Mr. C (6) acts the same part here, that he did in France. Your old friend D-r (7) is strong with them, together with the New Yorkers and Maryland. Mr. Lovel no doubt has communicated all our news. We have just heard, that 30,000 ton of Shipping are order'd to be immediately taken up on Government service at New York, and a general embargo laid. This looks like an intention of quitting that place. a few days will determine it. Yours aff'tly, F.L.L.  ""

  Dear Sir Decr. 10th. 1778 It was not possible for me to acknowledge your favor of Novr. 29th (1) by the same post wsh. gave me pleasure of knowing that you & your lovely family were well. Nor will I now particularly notice the subjects you hinted to me. I will rather give you a few Entries of our Journals, and an anecdote of our friend Adams to enable you to read the Prints wth. a proper comprehension of the plotting spirit of some of the chaps who are scribbling therein, and of the serpentine, malicious and elusive course which others have been contriving for themselves since you left us.  Temple came to this City about 10 days ago bringing Letters of high Recommendation both to Congress & to the Delegates of Massachusetts. His Letters were from the Council of our State, Govr. Trumbull, Genl. Washington, Govr. Livingston and the first whigs indisputably of Boston. Mr. Adams conducted Mr. Temple from his Lodgings to the President's to introduce the Delivery of the mentioned Letters. This single call at the Door of the man's Lodging is termed to the public \""so frequent in exchange of Visits,\"" and probably by the very tall Wisacre who was for constituting a semblance of the french Lieutenancy of police to fall in with, pimp upon and otherwise entrap all visiting strangers, even so far as to write fictitious Letters and intercept the Answers. But I drop this pitiful subject only remarking that the HINT (2) in the prints is a good answer to our recommendatory Letters, for there was nothing public or private which Mr. T ought not rather to have communicated by Letter than by a visit. I must give you my Key to his whole Proceedings. It is in the Cry of the Preacher \""Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity.\""  1778 Novr. 30. On Motion Resolved That Congress meet on Wednesday Evening at 6 o Clock to consider the proceedings of the Courts martial on the Tryals of Majr. Genl. Lee, Majr. Genl. Schuyler & Major Genl. St. Clair.  Decr 1st. A Letter of Novr. 30th from Silas Deane Esq was read, whereupon, Resolved That, after Tomorrow, Congress will meet two Hours at least each Evening beginning at 6 oClock, DECEMBER 10, 1778  Saturday Evenings excepted, until the present State of  our foreign affairs be fully considered.  Decr. 5. A letter of the 4th from Silas Deane Esqr. was read. Ordered that Monday Evening be assigned for hearing Mr. Deane & that he be notified to attend.  Decr. 7th. Resolved that Silas Deane Esqr. report to Congress in Writing as soon as may be his Agency of their affairs in Europe together with any Information which he may judge proper.  That Mr. Deane be informed that if he hath any Thing to communicate to Congress in the Interim, of immediate Importance, he shall be heard Tomorrow Eveng at 6 oC[lock.] He published on the 5th notwithstanding our Resolve of the 1st upon his Letter of Novr. 30th. It is true he dates Novr. blank to give his Peice the air of precedency but if he had really appealed to the Public why write to us on the 30th.  He had made himself a Culprit before our Bar by refusing to answer any Interrogatories \""tending to criminate himself.\"" He was the cause of after dating.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 11th December 1778 I am much obliged to you for introducing me to the acquaintance of Mr. Hubbard by your favor of the 23d Ulto. This Gentleman's stay in Philadelphia has been so very short as not to afford me time for shewing him such civilities as would have convinced him of my respect for you. DECEMBER 11, 1778  I am now reliev'd from all duties of that multiplicity of business to which you allude; I had never any ambition to sit in the Chair of Congress & when I had sat one complete Year in it, I urged the House to make a better choice for filling it. The unanimous voice of the Members then present requesting me to continue, added to another circumstance, overbalanced my determination to retire & rendred it necessary that I should bear a little while longer a painful preeminence; but the conduct of the House under the overbearing influence of a few Members who act in my opinion an excellent part for the benefit of our Enemies, obliged me to resign on the 9th Inst. I must have been void of all feeling for the honor & dignity of the United States of America as well as for my own if I had not shewn such resentment for the Insults offered to the former, & there were no other means in my power but resignation. I shall read to Capt Hubbard the reasons which were assigned by me, previous to the final Act & if after a few days consideration it shall not appear to be improper I will do myself the honor of sending you a Copy.  With respect to our Paper medium, I can not say we have not labored at the business of mending its Credit, but our labours have hitherto been totally ineffectual. The causes are to me too visible & yet I must acknowledge we have amongst us some very sensible faithful friends; but while these have been at hard pumping to free the Ship, it would seem as if others had been equally industrious in making new leaks, for it is certain there is more Water in the hold now than there was when you left her, & I have my fears that our circumstances will not mend until we suffer some violent convulsion & rouse the slumbering States.  It is with deep grief & concern that I assure you Sir, our case is deplorable, & demands the immediate attention of every honest & faithful friend to our Independence. You will see in the inclosed papers the contempt & disgrace brought upon your Representatives by the unnecessary & insulting publications of Mr. Deane abetted by Men who pretend to have at heart the honor & Interests of the Public. Congress have by neglecting to shew a proper resentment pleaded guilty, the Eyes of Europe are upon us, I need not say to you what the consequences will be unless there shall be an immediate wise interposition.  I am with great Respect & Esteem, Sir, Your obedient & most humble Servant, Henry Laurens  ""

But, Sir, Mrs. Lovell has been too just to herself & to me to keep back one of your generous Epistles in which I was more than half interested. She has adopted the erroneous Notion that the precise Rules of Grammer and the established Tropes of Rhetoricians are essential to a right performance of that Duty which was incumbent upon her when she was made the Subject of your kind Professions & very liberal Attention. At the same time that she goes into such a mistake by calling for my Aid, she proves to the highest Demonstration by her own Letter that the warm Gratitude of her Heart had elevated her above the Necessity which she supposed she was in. Instead, however, of copying a part of it to prove my Observations, I will consider how much Pleasure you take in the very Acts of Benevolence and Friendship themselves; and I will therefore only give you my plain honest Thanks for your Kindness to my dear Polly in her present Situation; and I will wholly suppress the long Page of just Praise which she has bestowed upon her \""generous Benefactor\"" in her confidential Correspondence with me.

As to his worthy Father the Representation of Losses by the Enemy is too universal to make his Prospect of Recompence certain.

  My dear Betsy. Philadelphia Decr 13, 1778. Captn. Johnson will deliver you this Letter, which incloses a Publication in the last Tuesdays Paper. You will easily guess which of the Massachusetts Delegates it is intended for.(1) The Design of it is to represent Mr Temple as a British Emissary and that Delegate as listening to his Proposals of Accommodation with Great Britain, and thus to beget a Suspicion of him in the Mind of the Minister of France, with whom he has the Honor of being on friendly Terms. That Delegate has been so used to the low Arts of Tories in his own Country, as to have learnd long ago to treat them, wherever he sees them, with ineffable Contempt. He does not think it worth his while to satisfy the Curiosity of the Writer, but he can assure his Friends, that he had never called on Mr T but once (2) and that was to show him the way to Mr President Laurens's House, to whom he had Letters to deliver, one of which was from the Council of Massachusetts Bay. As a Delegate from that State, he could do no less than shew such a Piece of Civility to Mr T, and he is determind, notwithstanding the apparently friendly Hint, to treat him as he thinks proper. Indeed he has been told by a real Friend, that there are Persons in Pay to watch his Words and Actions. He thankd his Friend, and told him that such kind of Intimations were not new to him. It might be well or ill grounded, & he was perfectly indifferent about it. He had a private Conversation a few Days ago with Monsieur_____(3) in which the Subject of the Hint beforementiond was brought up. That (Minister) Personage was pleasd to say, that he well knew the Character of the Delegate before his Arrival in America, and that there was no Reason to doubt of his Attachment to the joynt Interest of France & America-that he had sufficient Proofs of it to prevent any ill Impressions being made on his own Mind; with other Expressions of Friendship & Confidence. Between our selves, I can not say I am not embarrassd with Mr Ts Arrival here; He is highly recommended, and I believe him to be an honest American. But the DECEMBER 13, 1778  Time & Manner of his leaving England fix a Suspicion in the Minds of well disposd Men, which cannot easily be removd; and his Residence at the Court of America, if I might so express it, gives bad Men a Sort of Occasion, to say that Congress, notwithstanding all they have publickly given out, are secretly treating with the Ministers of Great Britain through their Emissaries in America, than which Nothing can be more contrary to Truth. I do not care therefore how soon Mr T thinks of returning to New England.  It is diverting enough to hear the different Language held forth concerning me, by a kind of Men whom I despise beyond Expression. In New England they say I am averse to an Accommodation with Great Britain, and make that an Exception against me. In Philadelphia I am chargd, indirectly at least, with a frequent Exchange of Visits with the Companion of Berkenhout, Lord Lindsay, Governor Johnston & the Son of Lord Bute, with a View of secretly bringing about an Accommodation with that King and Nation which I have solemnly abjurd. What is there which Malice joynd with a small Share of Wit will not suggest! I am not apt to conceal my Sentiments. They are far from being problematical. They are well known here & at Boston; and I can trust my Consistency in the Judgment of every honest and sensible Man that is acquainted with me. The Censure of Fools or Knaves is Applause.  Mr Silas Dean has lately published a Paper here filled with Insinuations and Assertions without any Evidence to support them, against Dr Lee. I have long ago formd my Opinion of both those Gentlemen and have never yet seen Reason to alter it. I have sent the Paper to my Friend General Warren. I wish you would invite him to a Dish of Tea, and desire him to let you see it and my Letter which inclosd it. You may read this Letter to him and other Confidential Friends, but don't let it go out of your own Hands.  I never was in better Spirits than at present.

You will no doubt before the receipt of this have heard of the Revolution in our Chair. Mr. Laurens' Resignation was very sudden & unexpected. On Mr. Deane's Publication appearing in the Paper, Mr. Laurens made a Motion to the following effect, \""That a Committee of Three might be appointed, to consider and report specially upon the Contents of a DECEMBER 14, 1778  Portrait of Richard Hutson  printed Letter signed S.

  My Dear Sir Philadelphia 14th Decr 1778 Since you left Congress Messrs Jay & Duane have taken their seats. The first mentioned Gentn. was last Thursday put into the Chair on the resignation of that very worthy Gentn. you left in it. I have so high an opinion of Mr. Laurens that I must confess I exceedingly regreted his leaving the Chair. However, I hope it is again well filled. Mr. Jay is a Gentn. of acknowledged abilities and great application. I have therefore no doubt the Business will be well conducted, so far as it respects the President.  The Business of finance is in considerable forwardness. I hope in a few days more the present System will be finished by Congress & doubt not the States will do their part with Alacrity. The Tax will be very considerable, perhaps 15 or 18,000,000. This seems a large sum, but when we consider the immense sum in Circulation, I cannot think it will be difficult to raise provided it is justly proportiond.  Mr. Wheelock has been here with a number of applications, among which is one for Money for the Indian School. This is not yet determined.(1) Another that Bedel's Regiment might be kept up, this produed an order that the Regiment should be immediately Disbanded.(2) He Also brought a letter from a Joseph Marsh, a copy of which I have inclosed to Col. Weare. Mr. Wheelock was here some time before I  DECEMBER 14, 1778  saw him, & from some circumstances I thought he avoided me, but a day or two ago he favord me with a visit, the principal design of which was to perswade me that his Father was not concerned in the intended revolt of those towns on the River, however, he did not fully satisfy me on that head.  The Enemy have been up Hudson's River with 50 Transports, burnt a few huts near Kings Ferry and returned-it is supposed they expected to find a quantity of provisions there, but they were disapointed. By the last accts from New York they still seem to be preparing to go off, but the Season is so far advanced I cannot think they will go till towards Spring-our Army is going into Winter Quarters.  I have much to say to you about some late publications but time will not permit me at present. I must therefore bid you Adieu. Yours very Sincerely, Wm. Whipple  P.S. I was a little surprised at a letter from the Council of New Hampshire recommending Mr. Temple to Congress.(3) I cannot recollect any Gentn of that Board who have had an opportunity of being thouroughly acquainted with that Gentlemans Character, surely his having formerly been Lieut Govr of New Hampshire can be no recommendation, there are many anecdotes of him (some of which are well authenticated) that renders Mr Temples Character at least problematical, indeed in some Gentlemens mind, they amount to a conviction of his being a tool of the British Court, more of this hereafter, Yours &c, WW  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Decr. 14th 1778 In my last I mentioned a memorial from the People who withdrew from the Windsor Assembly; on farther inquiry I find myself mistaken in the form of the paper it being a letter from a Mr. Marsh who stiles himself Chairman of a Convention, a copy of this letter I take the liberty to inclose,(1) the paper referred to, in the letter (called the \""outlines of a plan for settling all matters in controversy with N. Hampshire\""), is in print. I therefore immagine you are possessed of it. What the views of these People are I know not, but I am much DECEMBER 14, 1778  inclined to think the western part of the State will be keept in a perpetual Broil 'till a final settlement of the Jurisdiction. There are three ways of determining this matter, that Country must be under the Jurisdiction of New-York, or New-Hampshire or it must be a seperate State. The People are so exceedingly averse to the first that they never will voluntarily submit to it, and Humanity forbid, that they should be compeled to Unite with a people for whom they have an unextinguishable avertion, arising from the injuries they have suffered, by the most cruel acts of Injustice. Should the last take place, I am very apprehensive that many Towns on the Eastern side of the River will be fond of joining them, by which means New Hampshire will be embroiled in a very disagreeable contention or subscribed to a very small compass, and that limited Territory subject to the discharge of an immense debt, incured for the defence & protection of the whole. When these matters are fully considered, I think every one who has the Happiness of Mankind, & Peace & Welfare, of New-Hampshire at Heart will be convinced of the propriety of her claiming the jurisdiction. It would be a piece of presumpsion in me sir, to point out to you, the advantages resulting to New-Hampshire from such an extention of her Territory. They undoubtedly are many & great. The perticular scituation of affairs in that Country I should suppose calls for the immediate attention of the Legislature, and if it should be determind to Claim, (which my own feeling will not suffer me to doubt) it will certainly be thought necessary to make immediate provision for the support of the Claim; in order thereto I beg leave to suggest the propriety of speedily employing some able Lawyer to collect materials and make himself Master of the subject. New-York are very solicitous for a settlement, that State has sent a Delegate extraordinary to Congress for that purpose,(2) and I have reason to think Congress will be hard pressed to do something in the matter.  I therefore wish to know the minds of my constituents as soon as possible. Whether they will send another Delegate who may be well acquainted with the business, or will Instruct their Delegates now in Congress, must be left to their decision. I must confess I most heartily wish that the former method may be adopted. I cannot suppose the the expence will be an objection when the Magnitude of object is considered, which is nothing less then doubling the Territory of a Sovereign Independent State.  I have the Honour to be with Sentiments of perfect Esteem & Respect, Sir Your most obt & very Huml Serv, Wm. Whipple  ""

  Dear Sir (private) Philad. 15th Decr. 1778 I wrote your Excellency a few days ago a hasty Scrawl which I intended to Convey by a Man who was going to Albany but who broke his promise to call for my Dispatch-it will be forwarded with this.(1)  I have receivd & returnd a Visit from Monsr. Gérard the French Minister. He is by Birth a German but bred to Business at Paris where he has passed thro' the several Offices till he arrivd at that of Secretary of the Council & the present Character of Minister at our Court. He is plain & respectful in his address: attentive to Business, & carries the Air of Candour in all he says & does. Nothing passes which may respect his Court that he does not observe with critical Vigilance. This is what I learn from others: My own Observation will in due time furnish your Excellency with other Anecdotes if any remarkable Occur.  You will see by our papers a ridiculous Squabble between Deane & the Lees. It may amuse a Leisure Hour. Our late honorable President was exceedingly wounded that Deane was not called to Account by Congress & resignd. I was not present: But from what I can discover his Zeal transported him a little Too far. Congress ought certainly to be careful how they attempt to stop the Channell of Communication in a free Country, it may give Rise to dangerous suspicions: if their Conduct is irreprehensible they can suffer no diminution of Dignity: If exceptionable it is right it should be known. Misrepresentation is only to be guarded against & Condemned.  I do not see how our Dispute with the revolted Counties can be taken up to advantage without the Maps & Report of the Committee: which ought in my opinion to be forwarded by the first Opportunity.  I think of nothing material to add.  I am with the utmost Respect, Dear Sir, Your Excelly most obedt & very hl Servant, Jas. Duane  ""

  My dear Bror.(1) Philadelphia Decr. 15. 1778 I do not wonder at your disgust at the wickedness & folly of mankind. I have so much of the same feelings, that I am sure, there can be no condition in Life more unhappy, than to be engaged in the managemt. of public affairs, with honest intentions. But hard as the lot is it must be borne at least till things have got into a tolerable way. We have had nothing from the party since my last; only that Mr. Wm. Lee's name is in the list of Aldermen, in the Calender for 1778 (2) I expect an attack in this days paper, upon S. Deane, by Common Sense.(3) He knows a good deal of the transactions, & if in earnest, can do a great deal of good. Congress has yet done nothing in finance or foreign affairs. I fear there is a design in some that nothing shall be done, that things may get into such disorder, as to make the people wish for the old Governmt. Congress has no power, & every Villain whome they want to call to account, insults them.  The inclosed Letter from Mr. Laurence, will give you an Account of his resignation & his reasons.(4) He is really an honest Man, & I hope will do a great deal of Good. Jay is President.

By every accot from York the movements of the Enemy indicate preparations for a removal but no authentic intelligence of their intentions has been receiv'd, indeed the season is so far advanced that it cannot be expected they will go off 'till towards the Spring. I have no doubt of their taking their departure then. Our Army are going into winter Quarters & at the same time every preparation making for the next Campaign. The Currency is the greatest difficulty with us. C____ have been hammering upon a plan of finance ever since I have been here. It is now nearly wrought into form, I hope one week more will fit it to be sent to the several States where it must be finished, this I hope will at least check the growing evil, part of the plan is taxation which I imagine will amount to 15 or 18,000,000 & perhaps a much larger sum taken out of circulation by other methods, however this must not be made public at present as the plan is not compleat and may undergo some alterations. Very large quantities of counterfit money is now circulating, which will make it necessary to call in such of the Emissions as have been most adulterated.  We have had no late accots from Europe but have not the least reason to think but matters are going on well there and Count D'Estaing I hope is working good for us in the West Indies. I hope another Campaign will put us in possession of Canada & Nova Scocia, or rather we shall compel Britain to quit those places, & then no doubt they will be added to the Confederacy. The post ought to have come in to day but I suppose he has been stoped by the weather. I shall be obliged to you for a copy of Your Proscription Act or any other acts that may pass from time to time. Was any notice taken of the recommendation of Congress to make Laws to enable them to call their servants to account? If this is not done I hope it will be soon. I also hope the executive authority will keep a watchful Eye on the Servants of the public especialy those who handle the public money. Many of those Rascals deserve hanging.

  Dear Sir 16th December [1778] The last Letter I had the honor of writing to you is dated the 7th Instant, and went by Sea, therefore I trouble Your Excellency with a duplicate in company with this.  The Gentleman by whom I then had intended to write in a day or two has turned his Face another way, the present is a chance opportunity which affords me but a few minutes for paying my Respects. I must observe brevity and confine myself almost to one subject, and that a bad one, myself.  The Motion which I had the honor of making on the day above mentioned respecting S. Deane's publication will appear in my Act of Resignation transmitted with this; (1) I had antecedently to the appearance of Mr. Deane's insult been exceedingly chagrined by the tame submission of the great Representative of the United States to the most gross affronts. Four or five weeks have passed since proof by the Oaths of four Persons was laid before Congress, that Brigadier General Thomson (2) had, in the open Coffee House, called Congress a Rascally set and a set of Rascals, and particularly applying the approbrious term to the Chief Justice of this State then present, on Account of a determination in Congress to exchange Governor McKinley for Governor Franklin at the particular request of Delaware,  DECEMBER 16, 1778  by which Act Mr Thomson was pleased to think himself injured. He afterwards insulted Congress by an Apologetic Letter, denying that he had called them Rascals, but acknowledging the application of the term Rascal to the Honorable Mr McKean, wantonly adds Villain, and twice repeats that he had said that Gentleman was a Rascal and a Villain, this Letter stands recorded at full length on the Journal, Thomson is voted to be guilty of a breach of Privilege, and there the subject rests. He is in favor with a party who seem determined to support him at the expence of the honor of Congress. Mr. Deane's mischievous publication alarmed me, the House would take no other notice of it, but such as Mr Deane has very improperly display'd to the World in the light of concession. Failing in my attempt to arouse Congress to the vindication of their honor, I felt for my own, and Resolved to descend from the Chair to the floor where I could be of the most real service to my Country. The Act of Resignation must speak for itself. I felt it to be right, and therefore I believed it to be so, but the party of Deanites were pleased to catch at the concluding sentence, which I would not for any consideration have omitted, because I was persuaded good consequences would follow the strong reproof, and perhaps continue at least a fortnight. A friend of mine unsolicited moved the House on the 10th Insant for thanks to the late President. He was jockey'd by \""the manner in which business is transacted here\"" and this repeated daily until Yesterday, when I in modest terms demanded a testimonial of my Conduct, intimating the honor and interests of Congress and the States were as nearly concerned as my own. If I had merited censure I would kiss the Rod, but I could no longer bear to be kept in a state of implied censure, that I held my Act of Resignation to be the best Act of my Life, that if any Gentleman had taken offence at the concluding words, I had to say in Apology, that I did not mean to give the occasion &c &c the particulars of which shall be laid before Your Excellency by the next or some early opportunity. I then retired from the House, and after some debate it was resolved without a division \""That the thanks of this House be given to the Honorable Henry Laurens Esquire, late President, for his conduct in the Chair and in the execution of Public Business.\"" This comprehends an acknowledgment of propriety of conduct within doors and without, and an approbation of the late Presidents \""sundry reasons\"" as it is entered on the Journal, for resigning. From this brief sketch Your Excellency will be further impressed with a knowledge of \""the manner in which Business is transacted here\"" and see that my repeated complaints have been well grounded. I hope my Countrymen will approve of my conduct. Now I am releas'd from the Chair, my attention shall be bent to the investigation of the Secret and Commercial Committees Accounts, and to such other Business as comes  within the compass of my abilities forsaking all thoughts of my private Affairs for some time longer.  Mr Deane, notwithstanding his groundless assertions that the Ears of Congress were shut against him, and that he had prepared to return to France and such stuff, is not ready now, at the end of twelve days with his Narrative, and 'tis not impossible that Common Sense has thrown him twelve days further back. I intreat Your Excellency will not believe that I have any improper attachment to the Lees. I am a little of opinion that upon the whole information we shall see an explication of an old proverb, although I am persuaded we shall not \""come by our Right.\""  I am distress'd for want of time to inform Your Excellency more minutely on this and other subjects of importance. I would wish that until I shall be enabled to do so, there may be no publication of what I have now the honor of transmitting. I am, With the highest Respect & Esteem &c. H.L.(3)  ""

Mr. Deans publication was particularly aimed at, but notwithstanding the Phantasticability & absurdity of the President, the House were of Opinion there should not be the least restraint on the Liberty of the Press-as for my part I shall rejoice to see more publications on the proceedings of Congress, a little gentle Satyr will be useful on many occasions & will restrain the Spirit of Intrigue & Cabal.(2) I shall say no more on this subject, until I have the happiness of seeing you, only that there never was a time when I wanted your presence more.

I should esteem it a favor that you would mention me to all the Gentlemen that may come from your State, it would give me a real pleasure to assist them in any measures for the public good, & I think you well know that I have no other object in every vote I give. Do you intend to comply with the request of Messrs Telfair & Walton, if you should not, I am apprehensive they will blame me. I should be glad if it will suit you to comply, but if not, you must furnish me with some excuse to my Colleagues.  As Mr. Jay will now have a great deal of business on his hands & perhaps sometimes want the assistance of some friend in the writing way, I should be glad to give him my assistance at any time-you may hint this to him, if you judge proper: tho' it may be unnecessary if he can get a Secretary of competent ability.

  My dear Sir Philade Decr l9th 1778 Mr Temple was so obliging as to deliver me your Letter of the of November.(1) The Day after his Arrival in this City, I offerd him my Service and introduc'd him to Mr President Laurens, to whom he had Letters of high Recommendation, and among others from the Council of Massachusetts Bay. The President read these Letters publickly in Congress. I did not fail to communicate the Contents of those which I was honord with to individual Members. But the Time of his leaving England, his coming in a Packet, the Company which came with him, and the greater Indulgencies granted to him in New York than had been allow'd to others fixed a Suspicion of him in the Minds of well disposd Persons which could not be removd. Those of a different Character took Occasion to insinuate that whatever Congress might give out publickly to the Contrary, they were secretly listening to Terms of Accommodation offerd by the British Ministers through their Emissaries in America. The Minister Plenipotentiary of France could not but be attentive to these Suggestions. In a private Conversation with him at his House the other Day, when no one was present with us, Mr Temples Name was mentiond. He said he knew not his personal Character-he understood that he was well recommended, but as he was under the violent Suspicions of the People here, his Residence so near the Congress might make improper Impressions on the Minds of Persons abroad. It may reasonably be supposd that he is determind to merit the Character at his own Court, of a vigilant & faithful Minister.(2) Mr Dean who appears to be inimical to my truly patriotick Friend A Lee Esqr has endeavord to raise the like Suspicions of him that he has a predilection for the Court of London because he showed Civilities to his Friend Ld. Shelburne in France. Such is the force of prejudice in the Minds of some Men or their total Want of political Understanding. I was my self, pointedly, though not by Name, called upon in a publick Newspaper, to be cautious of making too frequent Exchanges of Visits with J T Esqr. You know much I have been used to despise Publications of this Kind & I despise them still. But in the present instance I confess I was embarrassd, being under the Necessity of violating my own Inclination to pay all due Respect to a Gentleman, whose personal Merit I had formerly been acquainted with, and who was so honorably mentioned by some of my most virtuous & dignified fellow Citizens, or on the other hand of prejudicing the Character which as a publick Man I ought to maintain in the Minds of Congress, of the Minister of France and of the People. I have done Mr Temple the most substantial Acts of Friendship in my Power, though I could not have the Pleasure of so much DECEMBER 19, 1778  Conversation with him as I wishd & intended to have. He leaves this City suddenly. 1 am inclind to believe that the President of this State as well as the Chief Justice, with both of whom I have this day had the pleasure of dining, are satisfied in the Uprightness of Mr Temples Intentions. Having given you a candid State of things, I conclude with assuring you that I am with every Sentiment of Regard, Your affectionate Friend & very humble Servant,  Samuel Adams ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia l9th Dec'r 1778. It would give me Pleasure if the Business of Congress did not engross so much of my Time, as that I might daily devote an Hour or two to my Friends. Unfortunately however for me, and I may add for the Public, so it is, that altho the greater Part of our Time is spent in Council, our Dispatch is not proportionate to the Exigency of our affairs, and we experience the Inconvenience of those Delays which invariably attend the Deliberations of public assemblies, assemblies in which men do not always speake to inform themselves or others.  I am happy, however, to inform you that the principal object of my appointment will probably be obtained and I have some Reason to Hatter myself that New York will be the better for my coming here. Time however is necessary to prepare for the Introduction of the Business. To precipitate might be to ruin it, and tho I am extremely desirous of returning as soon as possible, my Inclinations shall yield to the public good.  The maps & Papers relative to our Boundaries, which if I remember right, are in the Hands of Mr. R. Yates, together with Copies of all such Letters to Congress &c. as respect Vermont, ought to be sent us without Delay by some trusty messenger.(1) I wish to appear with our whole Strength. My Respects to Mrs. Clinton. I am, dear Sir, your Friend & Serv't, John Jay. DECEMBER 20, 1778  Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 4:4054.  1 Jay continued to remain frustrated at Clinton's inability to comply with this request. \""I have not yet been able to find the Papers & Maps respecting the Boundaries of this State,\"" Clinton explained in a letter of February 9, 1779. \""I fear they were destroyed at Kingston.\"" Ibid., p. 555.

  Dr Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 20th, 1778 On our arrival here which was on the 9th of this month, we found the City much engaged by a publication which you will find enclosed, and in which Mr Dean has made some very home accusations. We found it had occasioned some little ferment in Congress, and that Mr. Laurens resigned the chair, because they would not take notice of it, as an affront to their dignity, we thought it but prudent to decline going in for a few days until this little fracas was over, leaving those to decide on punctilios who had been best acquainted with personal Characters. On our going into Congress we found them engaged principally on finance and that they had spent time in maturing something which we totally disapprove. I will endeavour to give you the general outlines as perfectly as they are yet come to our knowledge.  Two Emissions are to be called out of circulation viz. 20th May 1777, 11th April 1778-on pretence of their being much counterfeited, they are by Authority of Congress to be called in by the 1st of June next and not afterwards to be redeemed. They are to be replaced to the proprietors by Loan certificates or New Bills.(1) Our objections are, that Congress by its own authority can not prevent the currency of money which our Laws [made] a legal tender, because that implies a power to suspend or repeal our Laws. That the time is too short for our people so dispersed as they are and so circumstanced as not to be able to receive notice in time sufficient to enable them to bring in their money, that it is not in the power of Congress to declare any Emission of money irredeemable at any certain time, because it implies a power to destroy at pleasure the security which the people have in all the property vested in paper money, that all that should be done is to deny its currency, and leave to the States to enact Laws and fix the times of their operation for that purpose. We were however overruled, and we find that our Country will be subjected to the payment of a heavy debt-borrowed at an exchange of ten for one-and which we must discharge at par, with six percent interest. This debt too is incurred to commercial Individuals, who alone have money to lend, and who have acquired it, by engrossing and extortion. Thus shall we realise fortunes for Individuals, and subject our Country to a debt, which were it not for loans, a little DECEMBER 20, 1778  industry would pay off, but which Loans make heavier than if all we have borrowed, had been gold & silver. I believe this michief is inevitable, and having long since foreseen it; I always was averse to giving the powers of borrowing and emiting to Congress by the Confederation, a power, which I am persuaded will always be used for purposes partial, and unjust, and either to serve particular States or Individuals to the prejudice of the whole community. Besides what I have mentioned, a Vote is passed for raising by Tax fifteen millions of dollars (2)-a sum which I am persuaded is not equal to our abilities; but this simple and unexceptionable mode for sinking the excess of paper Currency is not so much favored in Congress as the intricate, injurious and ineffectual mode of Loans-and the reason is obvious enough-Loans give advantage to the States who have furnished supplies at extravagant prices, and therefore abound with money, by giving them an opportunity of lending at a high interest when money is depreciated two for one, to be paid hereafter when it will be restored to its original value.  As you will see Mr. Harnett, I will not be more particular at present, he can give you a just idea of our expenses. Mr. Hill and myself have paid one Bill for the first two days we were in Town amounting to Forty pounds, and the prices were extravagant, I assure you the Articles were few and moderate. The City is a scene of gaiety and Dissipation, public assemblies every fortnight and private Balls every night, in all such business as this we propose that Mr. Penn shall represent the whole state. We will give you our thoughts on some things to be laid before the Assembly in a separate letter.(3) Mr. Hill desires me to present his compliments to you. He will write to you a private letter by the next opportunity. I am Dr. Sir with sincere regard and esteem your Obdt. Servt.  Thos Burke ""

  My Dear Sir Philad Decr 21 1778 Your obliging Letter of the of November was deliverd to me my Mr. Temple immediately after his Arrival here.(1) I must candidly confess that when that Gentleman informd me by his Letter dated in New York, of his Intention then to pay a Visit to this City, I was disagreeably impressd with it, and interrested my self, as far as I could do it with Decency, to prevent it. A certain Dr Berkenhout was here at that Time. He had formerly been a fellow Student with Dr Lee in Edinburgh; and although he brought no Letters from him, he made an Advantage of the old Connection, and addressd himself to Richard Henry Lee Esqr, the Doctors Brother & a Member of Congress, who from the Begining of our Contest has been exceedingly obnoxious to our Enemies from his firm & invariable Attachment to our Cause. Dr Berkenhout was put into Prison by the Authority of this State on Suspicion, and afterwards dischargd for Want of Evidence against him. Perhaps he sufferd the more, from a certain Set of Men for valueing himself on Colo Lee; and the Colo himself has since sufferd the Reproach of an angry Writer and disappointed Man, for shewing Civility to a Person who was once acquainted with his Brother. So true is the Observation I have somewhere met with, that a Man hardly ever speaks with another, but sooner or later he finds that he has receivd Good or Harm from it.  Had Mr Temple arrivd at that Juncture, I do verily believe he would have shared the Fate of Berkenhout. And the Testimonials he has since brought with him, added to the warm Recommendations of some of my most virtuous and honorable Fellow Citizens have not been sufficient to obtain for him a welcome Reception. The Time & Manner of his leaving England, the Company he came with and the favorable Treatment he met with in New York, were judgd to be Grounds of Suspicion which more than balanced the Recommendations of his Friends & Countrymen, who, though acknowledgd to be very respectable, it was supposd, might possibly be partial in their judgments of him. His Connections in Boston, & the Character he had sustaind there before he left that Place, it was said, made him the fittest Instrument to carry into Effect the Purposes of the British Ministers. The honest and zealous Whigs clamord against him because they imagind him to be a British Emissary; and the artful Tories, who would cordially receive such a Character into the Bosom of their Councils, if they could be sure of keeping him among themselves, joynd in the Clamor, either because they believd him to be a true American, or, if they judgd him to be a Spy, as they pretended, they did not chuse to trust him in the Hands of those who might possibly draw from him the Secrets of his Employers and detect him. DECEMBER 21, 1778  The Tories appeard to be the most acute Politicians, as in my Opinion, I am sorry to say it, they too often are. Thus Mr T has had the Misfortune to be spoken ill of both by the Friends and Enemies of the Publick. A very grievous Misfortune, when the People scrutinize and decide upon Chraracters with Candor & Moderation, which perhaps does not take Place at all Times in any Country.  I have shown Mr. Temple the most substantial Acts of Friendship in my Power; yet I must own to you I have been somewhat embarrassd. A Delegate of the Massachusetts Bay who has been heard to say that \""Jealousy is the best Security of publick Liberty,\"" has been called upon in a publick News Paper \""to be cautious of too frequently exchanging Visits with J T Esqr who is suspected to be a Spy\"" &c. I have no Reason to think it was a friendly Caution; but rather that it was designd to bring an odious Suspicion on the Delegate himself. But though he feels a Contempt of such Kind of Publications, he has learnd that it is Wisdom to receive Instruction even from an Enemy. I have said that Jealousy is the best Security of publick Liberty. I have expressd my Fears that America is too unsuspecting long to preserve Republican Liberty. I do not suspect Mr Temple; but I have been under the Necessity of violating my own Inclination to pay every kind of Respect due to that Gentleman, or risque the consistent Character which a Delegate of that State ought to support in the Opinion of Congress, of the Minister of France and the People of America. I have converst with that Minister on this Occasion; and I have Reason to think we concur in opinion, that however pure the Views & Intentions of any Gentleman may be, yet if a Suspicion generally prevails that he is secretly employed by the British Court his continuing to reside near the Congress may make improper Impressions on the Minds of our Friends abroad. Mr Temple left this City yesterday.  I congratulate you my dear Sir on our Countrys having thus far sustaind the glorious Conflict. Our Independence, I think, is secured. Whether America shall long preserve her Freedom or not, will depend on her Virtue.  I cannot conclude this tedious Epistle without expressing an ardent wish for the full recovery of your Health and bespeaking another & another of your Favors.  I am, with most respectful Compliments to your Lady & Family, your very affectionate Friend & humble Servt, S.A.  ""

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia 21st Dec. 1778 Your favor of the 25th Novr came to hand a few days ago. Mr Temple has been some time in this City-many concurrent circumstances in that gentleman's history have tended to cause Suspicions of him in jealous minds, both in and out of Congress. I must own I have no suspicion of him but still I think neither he nor his friends have acted with that prudence which is dictated by good policy. I have been obliged to exercise what I think they have been deficient in, which has prevented my paying that attention to Mr T which my inclination strongly required or which my duty would have demanded, had the letter from the Council to the President of Congress, in commendation of that gentleman passed through my hands. A neglect of this kind may save a person in my Situation from some difficulties, but cannot fail of touching the feelings of a person of any sensibility, and he that is incapable of feeling (as I have had occasion heretofore to observe) is not deserving of the public confidence.  I feel with you the distresses occasioned by the amazing depreciation of the paper currency, but flatter myself some relief is at hand- a plan for remedying this evil, is nearly completed and I hope it will have its desired effect. Part of the plan will be to call in about 40,000,000 dollars of the circulating medium-the mode of doing this you will soon be informed of, together with other particulars.  I shall do every thing in my power to get the Naval department DECEMBER 21, 1778  arranged properly and hope in the course of the winter the business will be effected. Congress is so exceedingly pressed with business that it is difficult to get a matter attended to that does not appear of equal importance to every one. All monies that go to the Eastern department for Naval purposes must go through the Navy Board of that department.  I shall pay due attention to the several matters you mention and give you the best information I am able to obtain as soon as possible. If Mr Wentworth has brought any intelligence pray let me have it- when you see that gentleman please to present my compliments to him.(1) I must refer you to the papers for news and am with much esteem, Dr Sir, your affectionate friend, Wm Whipple  ""

Indeed in the hurry of the Business which encompasses me Time passes almost insensibly, and I find myself as easy as usual in constant Employment. Altho' our publick Affairs brighten up to the utmost of our wishes they still acquire great Application; particularly the State of our Finances in which last I am much engaged: Nor do I despair of seeing even our paper money soon placed on a Safe Footing.

We have no foreign News. At the City of New York the Enemy are collecting another Fleet of Transports as we are assured. This confirms the Supposition that they mean soon to leave the Continent-I own I do not positively Credit any Intelligence or Conjecture on this Subject; for it is my Opinion that neither Sir Henry Clinton nor his Masters the ministry will chuse to hazard the decisive Step of giving up their Strong Holds in New York without the Consent of Parliament.

  Dear Sir Philadela Decemr. 22nd. 1778 This Letter will be handed to you by Andrew Ragg Esquire, a Gentleman whose Situation and Circumstances I trust, will entitle him to your Attention and Indulgence. He is a Native of Great Britain and at the Commencement of the present War held an office under that Government. These Circumstances have kept him a silent and inactive Spectator in the present Controversy. His conduct however in every other respect, has been prudent and unexceptionable: And from the time our affairs wore a serious Aspect has lead a retired Life unconnected with Men and Measures, and being now deprived DECEMBER 22, 1778  of any Mode of supporting a Family in this Country, is desireous of returning to his Friends and Connexions. There is no Law I believe to prevent his leaving the State, but the impossibility of obtaining a direct passage to Great Britain from any other place than New-York, has induced him to pay his respects to you, and to solicit a passport to that City, from whence he will be enabled to sail directly for England. A passage round by the West Indies would be extremely disagreeable and inconvenient as he intends to take his Daughter with him.(1)  I can see no impropriety in granting this Gentlemans request. The intelligence any individual can communicate in our Situation will be of little Consequence to the Enemy; But if you are the least apprehensive of Danger on that Score, Mr. Ragg I believe will readily subscribe any parole you may think proper to direct. If Sir upon inquiry you should not see cause for detaining him, it would give me great pleasure and Satisfaction to have him supplied with such papers as may enable him and his Daughter to pass on to New-York unmolested. Your attention, Sir, to this Letter will be very obliging to him who has the Honor to be with the highest personal respect and Esteem your most obdt. and very hble. Servt. John Henry Junr.  ""

  My dear Bror. Phila. Decr. 22d. 1778 Publications still continue in abundance to blacken the Lees & make Deane the greatest Man in the World. The cry is in their favor, no one has dared to enter the lists with them but Common Sense, who tho he has said a great deal of truth, & much to the purpose, was as far as I can understand very little regarded, it having been artfully put about that he was hired, & the poor fellow got a beating from An Officer, it is said for having wrote the peice. He unfortunately made some mistakes, which are taken notice of by his Answeror Plain Truth, & throws a discredit upon the rest.(1) It is really a shame, that when so many things can be alledged against this man, that the public shou'd be so abused, because Congress will not go thro' the business. They have done nothing yet, in the mean time he continues to insult them. After having long pester'd the Congress by Letters to hear him, in justification of himself, never hinting that he has any discovery to make, urging the necessity he was under of going immediately to  DECEMBER 22, 1778  France. And after complaining to the public that he was obliged to communicate his discoveries to them, because Congress woud not hear him, as if he cou'd not have given his information to Congress in a Letter, as well as to the people. After all this Congress on the 8 inst. directed him to put in writing the whole of his transactions & discoveries while in Europe & told him that if in the mean time, he had any thing of immediate consequence to communicate, they woud hear him the next evening. He answered that as he cou'd in two or three days put everything in writing he did not desire to be heard, since which we have not heard one word from him in Congress.(2) And yet no notice is taken of him: in short the Party are determined to support him in everything, & to contradict the old opinion, that it is impossible to wash the blackamore white. Finance is yet very backward. God knows what will become of us. Letters from Rhode Island say Byron's seamen are very sickly, which prevents his fleet from moving. This is all our news.

  Dr Sir Philadelphia Decr. 22d.1778. We have been applied to, to procure some Necessary warm cloathing for Col. Hogans Regiment who are very deficient in that article so necessary in a Country Cold and every way inclement in which they are to winter. We have applied to Congress for the articles, submitting that they should be charged to the State if on future Enquiry it shall be deemed Just.(1) On these Terms we can be Supplied with Shoes and Stockings, but not with Blankets, and Col. Hogan is to be accountable DECEMBER 22, 1778  to the State for them. We deemed it incumbent on us to use every means to prevent the distress of our Countrymen who are here in Obedience to the State, and in the public Service, more especially as the time of their Service puts them out of the Common Line, and leaves them without the ordinary provisions made for the Continental Troops.(2) We are told they are to be quartered in this City, in which case we purpose to Engage as many of them as we Can to inlist in the Battalion for the War, or one year at least after their present Term shall Expire. This matter Can go no farther than proposals through their Officers, and learning the Terms on which they can be procured, until we receive particular power and instructions from the State. We wish therefore to have their Sense as soon as possible.(3) We are sorry to inform you that Congress are about to take measures relative to our paper Currency which we think our Duty obliges to Oppose. 'Tis proposed by authority of Congress to Call in two Emissions Vizt. amounting to forty One Millions of Dollars, and to declare them Irredeemable after the first of June next. Also to exchange them for Loan Certificates or New Bills at the election of the owners.(4) We urged against it that Congress could not by their own authority decry the Currency of money which our Laws have made a Legal tender because it implies a power to repeal or Suspend our Laws. That it was impolitic to throw any difficulties in the way of the Currency, because People would become very suspicious of its quality and Credit, and if they took it at all it must be at a Value depreciated in proportion to the Risque. That it was not in the power of Congress to declare Money Irredeemable for which the public faith had Once been pledged for it implied a power to destroy the Peoples Security in that part of their property at Will and even if they had the power it is indiscreet to use it, because if the People ever Considered it as subject to acts of arbitrary power they would consider the public Credit as too precarious a Security, and of Course the whole Currency must be very considerably affected. We also urged that the time would not admit of Sufficient Notice being given to People in States So Extensive and remote as ours. But the objection of highest moment is that by borrowing when money is So highly depriciated as at present to be paid hereafter when the war is over will be to charge our Constituents with a Debt which will take ten parts of future Industry to pay for One part of the present, for Loan Certificates cannot be called in by Taxes, but must be paid off by appreciated money, of which every one knows it will take a much greater quantity of Industry to procure a given Sum, than when it is depriciated. We look on borrowing in this way to be ruinous, and Realising the Debt so as to make it equal to Gold and Silver, tho in any use we can make of it, it has not above a tenth part of their value. We Conceive it very unjust to Subject the States, who have not acquired abundance of the   money, to So unequal a charge to those who have, or to make the many pay a Debt at so great a Disadvantage to the few in whose hands mony may be accumulated and who in many Cases have acquired it by Extortion. We must lament that our Opposition is likely to prove Ineffectual, for the Interest of the monied States is too powerful for our Endeavours. We deem it however not improper to advise you, and through you the assembly, of a Matter in which the property of our Country is so deeply interested. Their wisdom may possibly fall on measures to avert the worst of the Consequences.  We have the honor to be Sir, your very obdt. Servt.  J. Penn Whitll. Hill Tho. Burke (5) P.S.

The Necessity of making some inquiry on the Subjects contained in your Letter of the 10th Decemr and the Reference of the Resolutions of the General Assembly to the Marine Committee, upon which no Report has yet been made, has deprived us of the Honour of answering your Letter so soon as we intended.(1) The Expedition against Florida, always was, and still is, in our opinion a dangerous and ruinous project, attended with a certain considerable Loss and Expense, without the smallest Hope of Success or advantage; And altho' Congress have not re-considered or in any way countermanded their former orders and recommendations; yet we think it not improper privately and in Confidence to inform you, that there does not appear to us any hope of Success in prosecuting this Expedition.(2)  The re-enforcement that we have reason to expect have been sent into that Country from the City of New York; the Distance and Nature of the Country through which the Troops are to pass, before they reach St. Augustine, the place of Action, joined to the Resistance they will probably meet with in Georgia, and the length of the Blockade (three Months at least) which it is said will be absolutely necessary to reduce the Garrison, fortify us in the opinion we have formed. By this we do not mean to throw impediments in the way to stop the Expedition, but simply to express our own apprehensions of the Ex- DECEMBER 23, 1778  treme Danger, if not, total Loss of the Men and Vessels destined for this Expedition.  No Measures are as yet taken in this quarter for the supply of provisions and other Necessaries, they seem to be left to the Chapter of Accidents and the Commander in chief in the Southern Department.  Whether the Gallies from Virginia will be in readiness at the time expected we cannot certainly determine, but have some Reason to believe they will not.

We were yesterday informed by the Minister of France, that he had received the Resolves of the General Assembly respecting the Confederation. We have not seen them, nor do we know their Contents.

That hearing a Conversation passing in that Box in a higher Tone of voice than usual his Attention was drawn towards it & he went within two feet of it there being some Gentn between him & the Box, but he saw Who were in it & heard distinctly what was said in it. That the first thing he heard was Gen Thompsons saying to Mr. McKean that it was owing to him & some such Rascals that he was brought to his present Situation, adding that it was not the first ill Treatmt he had recd. from him, for that he had injured him by writing him a note charging him with harbouring Deserters. Mr. McKean replied the Note was a polite Note, Gen. Thompson sd. it was not & that he was a damned Rascal. Mr. McKean then sd. you are not the Man I took You for. That thereupon the Depon[en]t retired from the Box & did not pay particular attention to what followed- He considering the Quarrel as a personal Affair between Mr. McKean & General Thompson abt. the affair of Carlisle. That he did not hear the name of Congress mentioned in the Course of the sd. Quarrel nor any thing abt Exchanges. That at the time he first saw Gen. Thompson in the Box he was either rising or standing.  Mr Jas Searle sworn,(4) he was at the Coffee house on the evening of the altercation between Gen. T & Mr McK. The first thing that drew his attent. was gen T voice in a higher tone than usual. That he heard gen. T. say to Mr M Kean U are a damned rascal & it is owing to u & a set of rascals like you that I have not been exchanged before now. There is a nest of u but damned if I know u all. U exchanged an old woman catched in bed & left me unexchanged tho taken fighting in the field. That he did not hear the word Congress made use of at all and does not recollect hearing Mr. McKean's reply. That he heard genl T say to M K damn u who are u! MrK said I am ur superior or words to that effect. Afterward he heard genl T in a lower voice ask MrK if he were a gentleman. To which M McK repld however that may be I am sure u are none. That he heard Mr McK say Ay strike me if you dare I will make yr heart ake if u do. To which gen T replied damn u I will make ur bones ake first.  That he Thinks after what I have mentioned he heard Mr. McKean say it was not a summons To which genl. T. said it was. Mr K asked him to produce it. He said he had it not, that he had treated it as it deser[ved] & made use of indicent expressions. Is not possitive whether this was before or after what he first testified but is rather inclined to think it was after. That this passed while gen T. was in the box & at the end of the box.  ""

  Reverend & Much Esteemed Sir Philad. Decr 25 1778 I am greatly indebted to you for your very acceptable Letter of the 7th of Novr by Mr Temple.(1) That Gentleman, in my Opinion took an unguarded Step on his late Arrival in New York. I mean his writing a Letter to the late President Mr. Laurens requesting Permission to pay his Respects to Congress, and another Letter to myself. This excited a Suspicion in the Minds of the true Freinds of our Cause, that what they had before seen in the English News papers, viz that he & Dr Berkenhout were sent to America by the British Ministry might not be without Grounds. This Desire of paying a respectful Visit to Congress was judgd to be a Reason merely ostensible; and the Time & Manner of his leaving England, the Company he came with and the Readiness with which the British General granted him the Liberty of sending his Letters, the Contents of which must most undoubtedly have been under his Inspection, it was said, afforded Reason to believe his real Design was to gain an honorable Admission into this City, & the Confidence of Members of Congress & others thereby the more easily to cooperate with the British Commissioners, and carry their Designs into Effect. The Jealousy of the People when it is properly directed or as some chuse to call it, a prudent Caution, is in my Opinion one of the best Securities of publick Liberty. And we must allow them to give all that Weight to a Train of Circumstances respecting our Friend, which in other instances we shd our selves judge to be reasonable. His Friends have given him high Recommendations. But say others, his Friends may be partial to him. His Connections are among the warmest Patriots. His Testimonials come from the most virtuous Citizens. They have a good Opinion of him-True, and this might be a strong Inducement to a politick Minister to make a Choice of him, & may make him the fittest Instrument to answer his Purpose. For my own Part I know Mr Temples former Character, Conduct & Sufferings & have also DECEMBER 25, 1778  a good opinion of him. I have done him the most substantial Acts of Friendship in my Power. But so deep rooted were the Suspicions of him and so general, that I have been under a Necessity of forbearing to visit him so often as I otherwise should have done, lest I might lose that consistent Character and that Confidence which it is my Duty as far as I am able, to support, in the Minds of Congress, the Minister of our Ally & the People of America. I have Reason to believe that I am on Terms of Friendship with the Sieur Gérard; In private Conversation with him, I purposely mentioned Mr Temples Name, & I conclude we concur in Sentiment that however upright the Heart of any Gentleman may be yet if an Opinion prevails among the People that he is a secret Emissary from the Enemy, his Residence near the Congress, might, at this Juncture especially, make improper Impressions on the Minds of our Friends abroad. Mr Temple has lately taken his Leave of this City & I believe some Gentlemen of Character have since conceivd a more favorable Opinion of him than they did before.  You have my hearty Thanks for your Sermon lately publishd which I have read with pleasure.(2) The Evil you therein mention is indeed alarming. Amidst the great Variety of pressing Affairs, Congress is devoting certain Hours of every Day to investigate a radical Cure; and I am in strong Hopes that an effectual Plan will shortly be laid before the General Assemblies of the several States.  When General Gates was orderd to Boston a considerable Embarkation of the Enemies Troops had been made at N York & it was apprehended they would attempt a Landing somewhere near that Place. His military Abilities and Experience, his political Principles & Attachments and the Confidence which the Troops and People of the Eastern States had in him were the Considerations which inducd his being sent thither. Had the Enemy turnd their whole Force that way of Course the Commander in Chief would have followd. General Heath has given entire Satisfaction to Congress during his Command there. The Change took Place on the Spur of the Occasion, and probably in the Spring a different Arrangement may be made.  I am my dear Sir with the most Cordial Esteem & Affectionate your Friend & very humble Servt  ""

  My Dear Sir Philadelphia Decr 25 1778 I have receivd your Favors of the 7th & 20th of November,(1) the former of which was deliverd to me by the Honble Mr Temple. That Gentleman is intitled to my Esteem from the opinion I entertain of his personal Merit, and from your Recommendations and those of some others of my virtuous Fellow Citizens. I have done him every Act of Friendship in my Power; but Circumstances, of which he is not unapprizd, have prevented my having so much Conversation with him as I could have wished for. The Time and Manner of his leaving England, the Company he came with, the favor granted him at New York of writing a Letter to Mr President Laurens requesting Permission to pay his Respects to Congress, and another to myself, neither of which, it was presumd, could have passd without the Inspection of General Clinton, nor sufferd by him to pass unless they had been adapted to his Views-These were made the Grounds of Suspicion of him then; and they were afterwards judgd sufficient to overbalance the Letters he brought from his Friends & Countrymen, respectable as they were acknowledgd to be by all, who might be supposd possibly to have judged partially in his Favor. I am sorry our Friend has been thus unfortunate because I believe his Motives in coming here were pure; and yet we must allow those who never were acquainted with him to give all that Weight to Circumstances which in other Instances we m[ight] our selves be inclind to think reasonable. I am satisfied there is a Design among them to leave no Method untried to raise a popular Clamor against those who took an early active Part & have continued consistent in Support of the Liberties of America. They are at this time endeavoring to stimulate a Persecution against my patriotick Friend Dr. Lee, who from the Knowledge I have of his publick Conduct since he has been employd by Congress and a constant political Correspondence with him for near ten years past, I am well assured, deserves the highest Esteem and Gratitude of these United States and Massachusetts Bay in particular. It concerns those who are determin'd to persevere in this glorious Contest till the Liberty and Independence of America shall be firmly establishd to be exceedingly circumspect lest their Conduct should be misrepresented by designing Men and misunderstood by others. An angry Writer has lately insinuated in a publick Newspaper among other injurious things, that Arthur Lee Esqr communicated the secret Negociations of France & America to the British Ministers, because he showd Civility to Lord Shelburne in Paris. Had Mr Temples Friends appeard to be very intimate with him here, the like Insinuation might have been thrown out, & with DECEMBER 25, 1778  a similar View, to draw an odious Suspicion on them. Indeed such an Attempt was made as you will observe in the inclosd Paragraph taken from Dunlaps Paper. You who know much of my Heart will easily guess which of your Delegates the Hint was intended for. I leave it to your Conjecture. I have openly declared my Opinion that Jealousy is a good Security of Publick Liberty. I have expressd my Fears that America is too unsuspecting long to continue free. These I know are the sentiments of Dr Lee. When Men hold these Sentiments & honestly act up to the Spirit of them they must necessarily become exceedingly obnoxious to those who are watching every Opportunity to turn the good or ill Fortune of their Country, and they care not which to their own private Advantage. Such Men there are in this Country, in France & indeed in all Countries & at all times. Some of them you & I have known. Such Men there always have been & always will be, till human Nature itself shall be substantially meliorated. Whether such a Change will ever happen and when, is more within your Province than mine to predict or ascertain. A Politician must take men as he finds them and while he carefully endeavors to make their Humours & Prejudices, their Passions & Feelings, as well as their Reason & Understandings subservient to his Views of publick Liberty & Happiness, he must frequently observe among the many if he has any Sagacity, some who having gaind the Confidence of their Country, are sacrilegiously employing their Talents to the Ruin of its Affairs, for their own private Emolument. Upon such Men he stamps the Stigma Hic niger est, and if he thinks them capable of doing great Mischief to prevent it, he ventures to hold them up to the publick Eye. This he does at the Risque of his own Reputation; for it is a thousand to one but those whose Craft he puts at Hazard, will give him the odious Epithets of suspicious dissatisfiable peevish quarrelsome &c, and honest, undiscerning Men may be inducd for a time to believe them pertinent; but he solaces himself in a conscious Rectitude of Heart, trusting that it will sooner or later be made manifest; perhaps in this World, but most assuredly in that Day when the secret Thoughts of all Men shall be unfolded. I have many things to say to you particularly of Arthur Lee & Silas Dean Esqrs.(2) Of both these Gentlemen I long ago made up my opinion, and I have never seen Reason to alter it. But I will relieve you by putting an End to this tedious Epistle. I intend to get myself excusd from further publick Service here, and hope before long to think aloud with you & my other Confidential Friends in Boston. I do not mean however to quit the Service of our Country altogether while I am capable of rendering myself in the least Degree serviceable. I earnestly wish for more Retirement & Leisure. Esto perpetua! is my most ardent Prayer for this rising Republick. That will depend   upon the Principles and Manners of the People. Publick Liberty will not long survive the Loss of publick Virtue. Favor me, my dear Sir, with your Letters frequently while I remain here, and be assured of the warmest Sentiments of Friendship & Esteem in the Breast of your very affectionate, S.A.  ""

  My dear Bror. Phila. Decr. 25th. 1778 The day on which my last Letter was wrote, Mr. Deane produced to Congress his written narrative of his transactions & accusations.(1) The first the most pompous bloated thing that ever was on paper. The only charges against Doctr. Lee are that he is suspicious, jealous, affrontive to every body he has any business with, & very disgusting to the whole french Nation, by his hatred for them, which he discovers by all his words & actions. Mr. W. Lee is mean, & goes shares with the Agents he appointed. The whole is most grossly abusive of both of them. The Party sucked it in, as nectar & Ambrosia; & say he has acquitted himself most honorably. They whisper about that as they are very moderate, & wou'd not injure any body unheard, they think the best way is to recall them that they justify themselves. This in fact, under the appearance of moderation, is the thing they are working for. They have of their Party ready immediately to fill all the places; & then every thing being in their own hands, we shall have fine work, with the trade which the Continent must carry on for our large advances in Europe. Altho Deane had two Colleages, the word We, is never used in his Narrative, I did everything. I procured all the supplies, bro't about the Alliance, procured D'Estaings fleet, conducted them to America, discover'd the designs of the Enemy & baffled them, in short, I have establish'd the Liberty & independance of America; whose safety & happiness now depends upon my vigilance. You are sufficiently acquainted with human nature, to know DECEMBER 25, 1778  that such magnificent Ideas, inculcated in the most positive style, repeated a thousand times by many Trumpeters; & supported by a Courtly Letter from Count Vergennes; & the great Dr. Franklin will have great weight with many. The old Whigs are something benumbed, at the apparent greatness of the Party. I Shall not be surprised at their success, for meanness & wickedness increase daily. If our brothers are not disgraced now, I am sure they will be e'er long, for they will allways stand in the way of bad men; & no villainy will be left unpracticed to ruin them. I believe they mean to push for a speedy decision in favor of Deane. Finance has not been mentioned since my last. No News. Yrs Afftly, F. L. Lee  [P.S.] I forgot to mention, that I am informed Deane has sent a great many of the Papers containing his Address to Virginia to be circulated there by you can guess whome.(2)  Mrs. Lee sends her Love to Colo.

  For the Pennsylvania Packet Philadelphia, December 30, 1778. Many Gentlemen will, I know, blame me for condescending to take any notice in this way of an infamous libel, subscribed William Thompson, Brigadier General, published in the paper of Tuesday last;(1) but though the Man is beneath even my contempt, the Brigadier merits a little attention.  After trumpeting his own virtues, conduct and courage, he informs the public of his veneration for Congress, but that one of their Members had basely treated him in a subject, which had no reference to his conduct as a Member of Congress, and that upon his publicly resenting it he attempted to treat it as a breach of privilege of Congress, complaining to them that his resentment proceeded from the part the Member had taken in the exchange of Governor McKinly- That his resentment was from a matter of a private nature, and did not relate to his conduct in Congress.  Notwithstanding the great veneration the Brigadier expresses for Congress, he in this gives them indirectly the lie, because he knew at the time, that Congress had finally voted, that he was guilty of a breach of privilege. I have reason to believe also he was informed, that I moved, that his long pathetic apology (which appears to be artfully composed) was satisfactory, so far as it related to myself, and  DECEMBER 30, 1778  that I joined in voting it satisfactory generally; though I disliked the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to President McKinly. It seems a little strange, that this last Gentleman, has been taught to believe, that I obstructed and delayed his exchange, out of favor to the Brigadier, until I received positive instructions on that head from the Delaware State, which I have the honor to represent; and that the Brigadier should think it was through my influence that the other Gentleman succeeded in preference to him. The material parts of this transaction must now be published; and if I am not greatly mistaken, the apology, independent of clear evidence (though my own and Mr. Justice Atlee's, who knew most of the matter, is out of the question) will be found to contradict the publication under consideration.  There was an affair at Carlisle, in Cumberland County, when I attended a Court of Oyer and Terminer there in April last, which the Brigadier took notice of, after he had vented a torrent of abuse about the exchange; and which not appearing from the evidence, as it was deemed by Congress impertinent to the matter before them, I shall give a brief narration of.  A Capt. in our army, whose name I do not recollect, applied to me there, and shewed me orders from His Excellency General Washington to take up deserters in Pennsylvania; he told me the General directed him to call upon me, that he might have the support of the civil authority in the execution of this useful service. I accordingly gave him a warrant, and promised him every legal assistance. The next day the Captain called upon me and informed me that he had taken up a deserter, and that he was rescued or detained from him, and requested that I would give him a precept to arrest the party: I began, in consequence, to write one, when I asked for the name of the party; he told me it was Brigadier Thompson- upon which, as I had not administered an oath to him, I said I could not give a warrant for him, he was a Gentleman, and then a prisoner of war, but I would write him a letter, which would answer every purpose; and accordingly I wrote a few lines,(2) mentioning the complaint, and requesting him to call upon me, if convenient, that day or the next, and I would endeavour to settle it: I shewed it to Justice Atlee, sealed it and sent it to him by a private hand. He came the next day a little before dinner; I asked him to sit down and take a drink, he excused himself, and we retired into an adjoining chamber, where he told me the man was his servant, and that he had been inlisted (I think) in an independent company which was afterwards regimented, and that the Captain was to deliver him up at the end of the year, which he had done accordingly. I told him I wished he would acquaint the Captain with this, but he said he would not, and seemed very angrry with the Captain; I replied, then I will, if he calls upon  me. Here the matter rested, and I invited him to dine with the Judges, but he excused himself and went away. This was all that passed on the occasion. Excepting this transaction, which was not of a private nature, I never had any affair whatsoever, public or privat\"", with the Brigadier, and I never mentioned this, nor even thought of it afterwards, it made so small an impression upon my mind. Now I call upon Brigadier Thompson, to mention the affair of a private nature he alludes to, for I know it not. I never did him, nor wished an injury, nor had an angry word with him in my life, previous to his rude behaviour in the Coffee-house. Indeed I have had very little acquaintance with him personally, but from a regard for some of his connections I rendered him what little services lay in my way.  The Brigadier is unfortunately a prisoner of war; and as the first Chief Justice of a new Republic nothing shall shake the Ready purpose of my soul, by my precepts and example to maintain peace, order and the laws and also the dignity of my station. The honorable offices I hold were freely conferred upon me, without the least solicitation on my part, and without my previous knowledge. It was greatly against my interest and inclination to accept them, but private opinion and private interest were over-ruled by public consideration; and it is well known, that office is no new thing to me, and that none of the insolences sometimes attending the possessors ever appeared in any part of my conduct.  I shall take no farther notice of the low, vile epithets contained in this publication, than to inform the Author and Printer, that both are equally criminal and punishable;(3) and that I cannot set the precedent obliging a Member of Congress or a Magistrate to subject him self to a duel with every person against whose opinion he gives his vote or judgment. THOMAS MCKEAN  MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Packet; or the General Advertiser, December 31, 1778.  1 William Thompson's explanation of his dispute with Thomas McKean was printed in the Pennsylvania Packet on December 29. After Thompson's published letter brought the issue into the public eye, the Pennsylvania Executive Council began an investigation into the matter. When Thompson refused to attend a January 6, 1779, summons to testify before the council, however, the investigation died down. See Thomas McKean's Charges against William Thompson, November 19, 1778; Pa. Council Minutes, 11:653, 659 60; Pa. Archives, 2d ser. 3:26243, Pennsylvania Packet, February 24, 1779; and Gail S.

  Dear Sir, Phil. 31st Decemr. 1778. I have been honored with your letter of the 16th instant; I shall with pleasure embrace every opportunity of giving you the earliest advice, when any thing material happens.  The State of our Finances and the rapid depreciation of our paper currency is truly alarming. Congress had several weeks past allotted two hours each day for the purpose of Financing; and have at length passed the following Resolves; vizt. that 15,000,000, say fifteen mills. Of dollars be called in by taxes in the course of the ensuing year; and that thirty mills. more be taken in on loan or to be exchanged for a DECEMBER 31, 1778  a new emission to be provided for that purpose: the bills thus to be called in are of the emissions of May, 1777, and April, 1778, entire, which amount to $24,500,000: (1) that these emissions be not redeemable after the 1st day of June next, but that Sixty days after said 1st June be allowed for bringing those bills into the Treasury or loan offices: these resolves will be published in the newspapers in a few days. The next thing under the consideration of Congress is, the establishing a permanent Sinking fund, for which purpose a special Committee have a plan ready to report this day, and I hope by these modes we shall be able to give our money an appreciation.(2)  Upon a strict Scrutiny into the money counterfeited, it is discovered that they chiefly consist of the emissions May 1777 and April 1778; by the enclosed abstract, you will see it at one view.

  [December 1778] (1) South Carolina, admitting a full Months time for preparation, & no alarms from the Indians, may bring into the Field-10,000 Men, one half of them badly clad & as badly Armed.  Should the Indians be in action or threatning the Inhabitants of the back Country will not leave their families exposed on that frontier-in such Case 4 or 5 thousand is the most Militia that can possibly be collected for defence of the Sea Coast.  The Enemy by landing 2000 at Winyaw will meet little or no opposition in plundering & ravaging all the Northern part.  2000 more landed at Beaufort may act in the same manner to the Southward including all the Islands.  5000 with a few frigates may very easily take possession of Fort Johnson & Charles Town-securing the mid-country.  Fort Moultrie falls of course without firing a Gun against it.  Plunder-  Not less than 50000 Barrels of Rice in three Weeks.  Immense quantities of Indian Corn, Pease, Flour, &c.  Indigo at least half a Million horned Cattle, Sheep, Hogs &c  DECEMBER 31, 1778  10,000 Negroes- very great quantities of Merchandize-150 to 200 Sail of Ships & other Vessels for transporting the provision & Negroes-Warlike Stores &c.  We have no fleet to retake the place-if we call foreign aid, it will be ineffectual-because four fifty Gun Ships & sea frigates within will bid defiance to the whole fleet of France.  Georgia will fall immediately or may be over run by the Troops from St. Augustine & 500 Indians.  ""

  [post December 31, 1778] (1) That his having been engaged in private Commercial Trade while he was acting in a Public Character in France his further & more extensive engagements of the same nature since his arrival in America & at a time when he was strenuously endeavouring to impress upon Congress a belief of the utility of & even necessity for his return to Europe in a Public Character do not entitle him to that approbation which he wishes to infer from the past silence of this House, that his conduct in these respects particularly, is highly reprehensible, altogether inconsistent with his professions of disinterestedness in the Public service & contradictory to his declaration that from the \""Moment he engaged in the foreign affairs of Congress he put everything private out of the question.\""  ""

  Sir, Phila. 26th Jany., 1778 [1779] (1) Permit me to recommend to your Excellency's favorable attention and thro you in such manner as you may think most proper to the Legislature an application of the Bearer of this letter.(2) From the conversation I have had with him on the subject his design appears to me well calculated for the purpose of serving in some Degree our Western Frontier and consequently enriching the intermediate country. It hath also the immediate effect of procuring a number of good industrious subjects. Perhaps I should not go too far in saying that every man so acquired would be worth two. To state or enlarge on his plan would be absurd as he will personally have the honor of conferring with you. I have only to say that the honorable stars he gained  JANUARY 27, 1779  at Bemis' Heights will be a better recommendation than I can give. As a Representative of the State of New York I think I do my Duty in forwarding the Views of one who is so much its Friend.  I have the Honor to be most respectfully, Your Excellency's most obedient and humble servant, Gouv. Morris.  MS not found; reprinted from New York Historical Association, Procecdings, 6 (1906) 158.  1 This letter is erroneously dated. The British still occupied Philadelphia in January 1778 and the letter concerns an early 1779 development.  2 The \""bearer of this letter\"" was certainly Benedict Arnold, who in early 1779 planned to profit from a land settlement scheme in western New York. Arnold left Philadelphia for New York in early February, but he quickly returned when word of the Pennsylvania Council's charges of malfeasance reached him at army headquarters in Middlebrook, N.J. Arnold never met with the New York governor or legislature and this letter was not delivered to Governor Clinton. See New York Delegates to George Clinton, February 3, 1779; and James T. Flexner, The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John Andre (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1953), pp. 242, 244-46.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, May 28, 1778 [1782]. I received your favour of the 16th inst.(1) between nine and ten o'clock last night, the post having been delayed by sickness. I shall pursue your commands with respect to the bill enclosed in it.  The arrival of the Alliance frigate at Rhode-Island, and the subsequent arrival of a French cutter at Salem, have furnished congress and the minister of France with pretty late intelligence from Europe. The latter has not yet communicated the contents of his despatches. Those from our ministers at Versailles and at the Hague inform us that British emissaries had been practising every address to each of them to feel the pulse of their constituents, and debauch them from their engagements with France. At the same time very tempting concessions were held out to the latter for a similar purpose. Proper answers were given to each of these insidious applications. These circumstances afford a seasonable admonition to the credulous, of the wickedness of Mr. Carlton's mission. We have heard nothing from this gentleman since the refusal of a passport for his secretary to visit congress.  Mr. Adams seems to be making considerable progress in Holland towards an acknowledgment of his public character. He says the prince had declared his inability to resist the torrent in favour of a connexion with the United States.  We have received no letters from Mr. Dana very lately. If I do not forget, some have been received since you left us, which contained little more than a proof that he had not become sensible of the error which his preceding letter displayed.(2) Despatches from Mr. Jay, transmitted by Col. Livingston, have been lost to us by the capture of this gentleman by a privateer from New-York.(3) They were not however gained by the enemy. Col. Livingston is now here, but re MAY 28, 1782  strained by his parole from suggesting the contents of his despatches, or giving any other intelligence from that quarter.  I have written more fully in cypher to Mr. Randolph, on foreign subjects and some others, than time or prudence will permit me to repeat here. For what is omitted, I must therefore beg leave to refer you to him.(4)  The reasons which recommend an interference of the assembly in the case of the Flags, do not I confess occur to me. If the goods included in the capitulation of York were sold, and are to be paid for, it would seem that a mode of payment, which affords to Virginia a vent for her staple, and prevents the exportation of her specie, cannot be complained of by her.(5)  The enclosed gazette contains the several obscure and contradictory advices, of the action in the West Indies, which have of late agitated our hopes and fears. The acknowledged inferiority of the fleet of our ally, gives some credulity to the articles which are in favour of the enemy. Should the event however have been ever so disastrous, it can only affect the duration of the war. The issue of it is fixed by causes which are superior to every particular event. Every triumph of the enemy on the ocean is rather a new argument to all Europe in favour of our independence; and I am somewhat of Mr. Adams' opinion, that if America were to betray a disposition to relapse under the dominion of Great Britain, all the maritime powers would interpose to prevent it. The tyranny which they have experienced would render any alternation preferable to a reestablishment of the superiority of power which gave birth to it.  Notwithstanding the importance of the present crisis, the number of states in congress does not exceed eight, sometimes seven only, and most of these represented by only two members. The president is directed to write to the unrepresented states on the subject, and urge them to supply the deficiency.(6) I wish much for a reinforcement to the delegation of Virginia, and have pushed Mr. Randolph to undertake that service immediately. I calculate on your return so soon as your other undertakings will permit. In the present moment it is of consequence that every delegation should be tolerably full, as well as every state represented.  With great respect and regard, I am, dear sir, yours, &c.  J.
