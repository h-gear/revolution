 Dear Sir, New York 1st. Jany. 1786 It would be ungrateful & unjust to treat so bountiful & so punctual a Correspondent as you have lately been, with neglect; and I hope Ingratitude will never find a Place in the Catalogue of my Vices. I can now, however, afford you little more than an Acknowledgment of this Receipt of your Favours of the 27th & 29th Ult---;for which I return you my Thanks. These Thanks are somewhat like public Certificates---;easily given & often of little Value. They are, however, Evidences of Debts, which, one Time or another, may be paid. This is the 9th or 10th Letter I have written for this Post,(1) & I would yet write some more if I could find Time for it; being still somewhat in Arrears on the several Subjects of Business, Politics & Friendship, to divers Persons who have favoured me with Communications; some of which, however, & not a small proportion, are the private Concerns of Individuals who flatter me with their Confidence as a good natured Servant of the Community of which they are Members. Who knows but that this obliging Disposition may procure me some Perquisites---;or a Promotion to an Office of Profit? You will probably say it is strange that a Person, in apologizing for having but little Time to write on serious Subjects, should run into playful Observations of this Kind. But there are Moments when the Imagination will sometimes run a little wild. I often find that when I sit down to write to a Friend either without a Subject immediately in View, or when I suppose I have not leisure to  January 1, 1786  enter into the Discussion of Subjects that I have on my Mind, my Imagination is apt to be playful, and lead me into Dances that I had never before conceived the Figure of. But Vagaries of this kind must always have something to float upon that is pleasing in itself, or which affords a Foundation for Pleasure or Gratification, tho' the Mind may not have minutely investigated it's Properties and Capacities for affording Pleasures; and perhaps may not have examind to which of several Objects it is possessed of, to impute the Sparks of good Humour it finds to be acting upon it. Whether it be the Interest I feel in the present S[t]ate of Affairs in Pennsylvania, or a temporary flow of Spirits from another Cause that has now led me into an unpremeditated Train, I have not examined; but certain it is that I have let my Pen run into a playful Strain, & followed it so heedlessly that I have not looked a Sentence a Head of it from the Beginning of this Epistle. It has exhausted the Time I can now afford you; I can therefore recall it to Seriousness only to say that  I am much your Friend & obliged Servant, Cha. Pettit [P.S.] Please to deliver the inclosed Letter(2) unobserved by any other than Mrs. Pettit. The Reason for this another time. ""

 Dear Sir,(1) New York, Jany 8, 1786. . . . .Since my arrival here Congress has done but little business there being only seven States assembled at any time, which you know January 8, 1786  are unequal to the great objects of the Confederacy; and a considerable part of the time only six. Congress has lately received interesting dispatches from Europe and has many important subjects before them, they requiring the assent and consideration of nine States we have not entered into any discussion of them, and therefore it has not been practicable to collect, with certainty, the sentiments of the States on them, or to determine what part their Delegates will act in settling the interesting questions as to our conduct towards G. Britain in future, towards the Barbary powers etc., as to vesting commercial powers in Congress, settling the accounts of the several States with the Union, and carrying into effect the Continental impost system. But from the little information I have collected since here I am induced to believe that the federal Government have it in its power to carry its present important subjects into effect in time by a firm and steady perseverance. I do think the States are at present represented in Congress by candid, and for the most part, good federal and republican men---;men reasonably disposed to give up partial, or States interests for the good of the Confederacy. It is true there are several young gentlemen from the Southern States of considerable fortunes, educated in Europe and bred to the law who come with some high ideas of distinction and the etiquette of society; but these sons of a warm and debilitating climate, and a luxurious soil, think and speak plausibly, are gentlemen, and possessed of agreeable qualities but their minds and constitutions want the energy and habits of attention and perseverance of the Northern States---;they are capable by their wealth of giving aid to the Union, and I have that partiality for our Northern people, their efficient strength in the field and abilities in the forum as to believe the Southern States have much to fear from a dissolution of the present Confederacy. Enervated, disposed over a large territory but little inured to constraint they are capable of making perhaps if left to stand alone but little resistance to a foreign enemy or one near home. Nor are their best men totally unacquainted with these circumstances. These considerations must press them into Federal measures---;they surely must be alarmed even at the suggestion of a confederacy of the States north of the Potomac or even the Delaware and give up their opposition to avoid such a measure. All the States have adopted the Contl. impost except R. Island, N. York and Georgia, in the terms of the system recommended. R. Island has done it partially, N. York it is believed will adopt it this winter.(2) Their General Assembly is now convening and will soon enter upon the consideration of it---;if the question whether the Theatre here   shall be suppressed or not and matters more popular and less substantial do not engross their attention. . . .

 Dear Sir New York January 9. 1786 I have received both your letters of the 23 and 30th of December last. I delivered to Mr. Duane the letter enclosed in the former and have since taken an Opportunity of conversing with him on the Subject & he promises to write to you shortly. I also called on doct. Cha. Arding for further information. The account he gave me is this. Stephen commonly called Judge Hick left his real estate to his son Thomas and a legacy of 1500 to a natural Daughter, who married a man of the name of Hick a relation of the family. The son Thomas died about four years ago having made a will by which he devised the estate to his half sister, the natural daughter of his father, & her issue, & in default thereof to her Husband and his issue & in case neither of them had issue then to R P. Hicks. The natural daughter died leaving no issue; Her husband who was a worthless drunken profligate fellow aft[er]wards married two wives who are both dead and he himself died last fall but without issue. Being told that the law which broke entails made the estate his in fee, He made a will before his death and devised the estate to a relation. But Doct Arding says that Samuel Jones an eminent laywer [lawyer] who has seen the will & knows all the circumstances is clearly of opinion that the estate belongs to R P. Hicks. The estate consists of two farms. One called the Neck is rented on a lease of three years for the yearly rent of Â£200; the other farm he thinks is worth a thousand pounds but he does not know what it rents for. This is all the information I have yet been able to obtain. The resolutions for preventing commerce or intercourse with the enemy & empowering judges or officers of the courts of admiralty to interfere you will find under the dates of Novr. 25, 1775, March 23 & April 3, 1776, March 27 & Decr. 4, 1781 & July 17, 1782.(1) Mrs Thomson joins in Love to yourself, cousin Mary, Sally & Maria.

 Dear Sir,(1) N. York Jan. 10. 1786. You did me the honor to introduce me to an agreeable gentleman here and to mention a correspondence between us at convenient Seasons. I should have improved the favor sooner but I have been waiting for some thing to occur worth communicating and have little or nothing after all. Since my arrival here there have been assembled in Congress only seven States at any time and sometimes only six whence the important affairs of the Union have not come into consideration and nothing of Consequence has been agitated or considered by Congress. We admitted Mr. Temple in the form you see in the B[oston] paper---;this on all hands was agreed to be the most prudent measure considering the present peculiar disposition of the two nations towards each other. Mr. Hancock soon after his choice notified his acceptance of the presidency of Congress. He was expected soon to arrive here but we have not as Delegates of the States individually or in any other way had any information from him. We are enquired of daily by many persons respecting his arrival and it has been reported from time to time that he was on his way. We yesterday were informed by the letter of a friend that on the 2d of this month he was at home confined by his ill state of health. The disposition for vesting Commercial powers in Congress appears to me to be more general particularly in the Southern States than I expected to find it. Nine States N. Hampshire, Massachusetts, R. Island, Connecticut, N. York, Pennsylva., Maryland, Virginia & North Carolina have all except New Hampshire and R Island adopted the resolve of Congr. of Apr. 30, 1784---;in the terms of it---;and those two States have gone as far as the resolve required---;and it is said the other States will adopt it---;and I think it is an unfortunate circumstance that the system of federal Commercial powers recommended by that resolve was not better digested and more adequate to the purposes intended. There are many sensible men who appear to wish Commer- January 10, 1786  cial powers to be vested in Congress to be exercised as occasion may require but think we ought to be very frugal in Commercial restorations and regulations and adopt them only on pressing Occasions. It is beleived here that N. York will this winter adopt or grant the Continental impost, if so Must not Georgia adopt it & R. Island alter her act for granting it, will those two small States stand out against the voice of All the rest. We see many pieces in the Boston papers which are reprinted here and in some of the other States that reflect not a little on the conduct of our Legislature, their last Session respecting the valuation and the postponement of the late requisition, absentees &c. Massachusetts has deservedly her influence and respectability at present in the Union & in my opinion she is deeply interested in preserving them. I am sorry the General Court did not do more and that the Struggle about the valuation of the respective towns is so great but many of those rude attacks upon it can never tend to reform but only to wound the feelings of some and to irritate others to increase and expose discords and lessen us in the eyes of the world.

 Dear Sir, New-York. Jany 18th 1786 Accept my thanks for your friendly letter by Mr Gorham containing also Mr Gardiners oration.(1) I am happy that it is now in my power to repay you for your friendly attention in furnishing me with copies of your Boston orations.(2) A work which has engaged my attention for five years past is now published. It contains the history of the late War in the Southern States in two octavo volumes, price four dollars. I wait for an opportunity to send a few copies to Boston for sale & I shall at the same time request the favor of you to accept one copy as a tokn of my sincere esteem and regard. The expense of a land conveyance would be too much. I am therefore at a loss how to get them to Boston. They are bound & ready to be sent if I could hit on a proper mode of conveyance. How many copies would you advise me to send? By what route would you propose? & to whom addressed? The work will not be in much demand with you as it is limited to the Southern war; but nevertheless as it is the first that has been published I suppose a few copies might be disposed of. I shall endeavor to pay Boston a visit this winter or the next spring before I return to Carolina. We have only seven States represented in Congress & of course we proceed very languidly in business. We hope for two or three more in the course of a few days. When will President Hancock come on? I long to see him & shall with great pleasure resign to him that chair which I now occupy in his absence. I am sincerely sorry for the many restrictions under which your trade languishes. Though the Southern States suffer less than the Eastern yet they all have a great interest in vesting Congress with [com]petent powers to regulate commerce.

 Sir, New-York Jany 18th 1786 I have at last published my work & have deliverd to Mr Hazard a complete copy in sheets to be forwarded to you of which I beg your acceptance. Unacquaintd with the roads to the Eastward I presumed Mr Hazard could forward the copy to you much sooner than I could myself. If I knew how I would send forty or fifty copies to Boston for sale; but I am at a loss what conveyance to make use of. I have sent sixteen hundred copies in sheets to Dilly in London & have advertised them in New-York three days ago. I can as yet form no conjecture about the sales; but am of opinion that the trade of an author is a very poor one in our new world. My advances will not be replaced till I have sold 500 copies & my debts contracted & yet unpaid will require the sale of seven hundred more. The edition has cost me 5,500 dollars. The printers bill is 2500 dollars. The engravings 800, the binding 4/10 a copy. In short I have no brilliant pecuniary prospects before me. I fear that your plan of requiring a previous payment will hurt the subscription for your work.(1) I flatter myself that the scarcity of dollars will be a considerable reason why my sales will be little productive. This will hold still stronger where nothing is given to the subscriber but a receipt for a book to be delivered at a future period. How many hundred citizens are there in our States to whom the advance of even three dollars would be very inconvenient? If you can accomplish the work without requiring any advance it would be much for your interest. Pardon the liberty I take in giving advice. I asked my engravers to reserve their plates for you; they seemed averse from it but said they would deliver a number of copies at a reasonable price. I wish you all success & shall recommend to all my acquaintances to become subscribers to your work; but, I fear that little profit will arise from the American sales of your books or of mine. In point of pecuniary interest I would exchange all my prospects for the profits of a few benefit nights of the New York theatre.

 Dear Sir New York Jany. 19. 1786. My last(1) advis'd you of my departure hence on the 24th of August last for the westd. with intention to take a view of the indian treaty to be held at the mouth of the big Miamis, and of the country lying between lake Erie, & the head waters of James or Potowk. rivers, with those wh. empty from either side into the Ohio, thence to attend the federal court on the 15 of Novr. at Wmsburg.(2) But the danger from the Indians made it imprudent for me to pass the river, and the delay at fort Pitt, and upon the Ohio, the water being low, consm'd so much of the time allotted for this excursion, that I was forc'd to leave the commissrs. at lime stone & take my course directly thro' the Kentucky settlements & the wilderness to Richmond, so that I was neither gratified with a view of the treaty, or to such a degree with that of the country as I had propos'd. I arriv'd at Richmond on the 14 of Novr. & found there letters for me from the agents of the two States, with advice that the session of the c[our]t had been deferr'd. I therefore prepar'd as soon as possible to sit out for this place & arrivd on the 18 of Decr. I found in Virginia & in this town letters from you of 17 of June, the 5 & 12 of July(3) & have since had the pleasure to receive that address'd by Mr. Franklin of the 4th from himself. He was here a few days since upon some private business & was so kind as favor me frequently with his company. I have also been much pleas'd with an acquaintance with Mr. Otto. He hath made an impression here very flattering to himself & favorable to the Idea you entertain of him.(4) It hath been matter of great surprise & concern here that the dispatches respecting the barbary powers shd. have been so long in reaching you.(5) {This Mr. Lambe was presented to some of the gentlemen}(6) in {Congress by the late president Huntington}. At that time it was propos'd, & for wh. purpose a {report was} brought in, to carry on {these treaties} immediately from {the U.S.} & to {appoint the persons} & {dispatch them hence} to fit out {the Alliance, load her with naval stores} & {present her} to {the Emperor}. By this procedure it was presum'd we might, by telling these {powers} that we were as yet {unacquainted with them or their wants}, succeed {better than even under the mediation of France}. And the {secretary of foreign affairs having reported that this man was fit for the negotiation, the committee advised} that {he be employed}. But it was rejected. We have since heard that {he was}, from {his station in life} & probable {talents}, by no means {worthy such a trust}. We have lately heard from Mr. Adams that Mr. Barclay with Franks are sent to the Emperor & that Mr. Lambe & a Mr. Randall to Algiers. {These pirates} have already made {a great impression upon our trade} and {unless these negotiations prove successful  January 19, 1786  will materially injure it}. I am happy to receive yr. sentiments upon the subject of {commercial treaties} & will with pleasure communicate mine to you more fully than I, heretofore, have done. With great propriety you have in the first instance taken it up with reference {to the powers of Congress, for upon those does the whole depend} and I entirely agree with you that they have {no original inherent jurisdiction over the commerce of the states} and that it commences & can be exercis'd only {by treaties} with {other nations}; how then will this circumstance affect us? When we propose to them to {form treaties} they will enquire do we labor under any inconveniences wh. thereby we can remove; they will examine their situation in {our ports} to {ascertain whether treaties} can obtain, fairer or more equal terms to them, are these {temporary} or so founded in the nature of {their government that they will be perpetual}. If then it shall appear that {we can give them nothing they} do not at present enjoy, and that we can {not deprive them of these advantages}. I think it will follow they will {lay themselves under no restrictions}. It wd. not otherwise be their interest to do. To obtain {reciprocal advantages} then cannot possibly {be the object with other powers} in {treating} with us, for more than {this they now possess}. But nations are often benefited as much by obtaining {restrictions upon others} in {the ports} of a particular one {which} do not apply {to themselves} as by particular stipulations in {their own favor} and upon this principle {treaties} are {sometimes} form'd as was the case in that between {Britain and Portugal}. How stand the {powers of the union} and how {their interests} with respect to {a treaty} of this kind? For instance can they {stipulate with France that British goods shall pay ten per cent higher duties here than those} of {France} in {consideration} for a {free trade} with {her islands; this certainly does not come within the provisos} contain'd in the {confederation} and is of course within the {powers} of {Congress}. Nor have I any doubt of its expedience, if it cd. be obtain'd. {Treaties} of this kind wd. be more favorable to us and successful, as to the particular objects it might seek, than an entire {prohibition of commerce} with {the powers} with {whom we} [have] none. By seeking this {power} it wd. seem as if we were satisfied with our situation {with those with whom we have treaties}, that those with whom we have not {were culprit nations} & that we wd. exercise it immediately on them. If then we are dissatisfied with our {treaties} with {France} & {the Netherlands} this right {of prohibition} can never avail us with respect to them, and in its {exercise} upon other {powers} it may give a dangerous shock to our {commerce} & a {monopoly of} it {to other powers}, and if holding {the power}, we proceeded wisely with it & endeavor'd to turn it to the best acct. we cd. and to make it a condition {with France} that we wd. put it in force {against [h]er} for such or such other considerations, yet cd.   we not obtain the same ends for less expence, for instance for the imposition of {ten per cent} upon her {commerce}. Every expedient is unquestionably inferior to the complete & absolute {controul over commerce} in {the [hands]} of {the U.S.} but this {[plan]} of {a treaty} appears to me to be a better succeedanium for the defect than any other I have heard, since it creates the restriction we wd. wish to effect {upon the offending nation} and brings us at the same time upon {the ocean} as a {commercial people}. They might be of short duration. Those {treaties} wh. stipulate to each other {the rights of the most favored nation} obtain none of these ends and appear to me to fetter us as to the powers with whom they are made. It fetters us as to the imposition of {higher duties} on them than we impose on {others}, or subjects us to a variance, while it admits on their part of a constant deviation from the spirit of {the treaty} by the explication wh. it authorises them to make of {the compensation}. Nothing hath been done on this subject since my last. In my next I may add something further on it. The {commission} will {expire} soon but another may be given or instructions form'd respecting it. I beg you to give me further yr. sentiments on it. My several routs westwd. with the knowledge of the country I have thereby obtain'd, have impress'd me fully with a conviction of the impolicy of our measures respecting it. I speak not in this instance of the ordinance for the survey & disposal of it, but of those wh. became necessary & were founded upon the act of cession from the state of Virga. I am clearly of opinion that to many of the most important objects of a federal government their interests, if not oppos'd, will be but little connected with ours; instead of weak[en]ing theirs & making it subservient to our purposes we have given it all the possible strength we cd.; weaken it we might also and at the same time (I mean by reducing the number of the States) render them substantial service. A great part of the territory is miserably poor, especially that near lakes Michigan & Erie & that upon the Missisippi & the Illinois, consists of extensive plains wh. have not had from appearances & will not have, a single bush on them, for ages. The districts therefore within wh. these fall will perhaps never contain  a sufficient number of Inhabitants to entitle them to membership in the confideracy, And in the meantime the people who may settle within them will be govd. by the resolutions of Congress in wh. they will not be represented. In many instances I observ'd above, their interests will be oppos'd to ours. I will mention one wh. arises from their relative situation to other powers. Their eastern frontier will be covd. from the nations of Europe by the 13 old states, & I may say that their northern & southern, also will, for no power will march an army to attack them by the Missisippi or St. Lawrence without making a powerful impression on these States at the same time, or indeed after subduing them; In all questions in wh. we were parties, the attack wd. be on us; upon us therefore wd. the   burden & event of the contest depend, & we must be parties in all cases while they are of the confideracy. The tendency wh. at present prevails for a dismemberment of the old States not only increases their strength but will also add to the diversity of interest. At the instance of which of the States hath the right to the navigation of the Missisippi been carried thus far and {if you lop off the western parts of those states} by {whom it} was brought {about} will you not necessarily withdraw them {from that pursuit}. Whatever shall be done on this subject I will transmit you. The subject of the mint was taken up last summer & determin'd that the unit shd. be a dolr. It was afterwards postpon'd.(7) It will be taken up agn. so soon as we have 9 or ten states (for at present we have but 7). The proposition for recommending it to the States to vest the U S. to regulate their trade is still before Congress. What will be its fate is incertain. Accept my acknowledgments for yr. book wh. I have read with great pleasure & improvment & be assur'd I will keep it as private as you might wish, untill you shall consent to its publication wh. I hope will be the case. I shod. suppose the observations you have made on the subjects you allude to would have a very favorable effect. Since no considerations cod. induce them but a love for the rights of m[an] & for your country. Whether I shall be able to visit you is still doubtful. My dependence is almost altogether on the bar---;by my late absence I have the door open to others. The sooner I therefore return to it the better it will be for me. I feel myself returning to the same train of thoughts upon this subject as when I had finish'd my studies. I am thinking of setling at Richmd.---;building an house &c. Will you be so kind as transmit me a plan. Suppose the house when finish'd to cost 3 or 4000 dolrs. (a part to be finish'd only at first). I shall I believe commence it as soon as I receive it. Be assur'd I will attend to those circumstances wh. you mention of a private nature so soon as we shall have a sufficient number of States to do it, with effect. This must be shortly. If I shall have time before the packet sails, I shall write Mr. Short. If however I shd. fail you will make my apology. Of the death of our worthy friend Mr. Hardy you have heard. He had been indispos'd of a bilious complaint which had been badly cur'd & weaken'd thereby his system to such a degree as to have fail'd under the fatigue of a ride to Kingsbridge. A vein broke or some vessel within him---;wh. ultimately carried him off. His loss to me is considerable not only as a person with whom I shod. [have] been happy to have liv'd in intimacy hereafter, but in the delegation, more especially as I am unacquainted with those added to it, Colos. Carington & Henry Lee of the horse.(8) Mr. Gerry is lately married to a Miss Thomson of this city---;a polite & amiable woman abt. 22 years of age.

 Dear Sir(1) New York Jan. 20. 1786. Since I arrived in this place we have had only seven States at any period asembled in Congr. and for a considerable part of the time I have been here only six. We have not been in a situation therefore to enter into the consideration of the sev[eral] important matters now before the federal Government---;and of course not in a condition to collect the sentiments of the several Delegations respecting them. But since you did me the honor to propose a correspondence I improve the privilege of conveying to a friend a few thoughts on subjects of common concernment that I may be intitled to claim his in return. As Congress has been sitting but a small part of the time since I have been here I have had much leisure to examine into the affairs of the union, to collect information from the several offices and past proceedings of Congress and particularly in matters of finance and public accounts and find a person wants much more time to acquire any tolerable knowledge of our federal Systems. We have adopted a Common Government that appears to me to have many excellent principles incorporated in it's formation borrowed from the British and many other constitutions, but a government complicated, unwieldy and attended with many impediments in it's administration a government situated to preserve freedom and capable of being administered only by the attention, perseverence and exersions of freemen. Many of the delegates who do not appear to have been very industrious in their political enquiries complain they have nothing to do---;yet it is agreed that the business of Congress consists principally in laborious enquiries---;that the objects of their consultations are extensive, attended with many facts and circumstances to be examined and weighed, and that their decisions must be made to correspond not only with the many good principles interwoven in the federal polity of the States but with the various ideas, systems and interests of thirteen internal sovereignties and sometimes all these put together must be January 20, 1786  made to bear a certain proportion to foreign Interests and the measuries of other nations. It is pretty clear that Congress during the late war did not strictly practise on the principles of the Confederation but kept one object in view the support of Independence and adopted those measures and means which appeared best calculated to obtain it. But that degree of perseverence those abilities and exersions that carried Congress thro it's difficulties during the late contest would serve at present I believe for the conducting of our federal Affairs on their true principles. I confess Dear Sir that it is from a general inattention, a general apathy in the management of public affairs especially of the Union that my fears of political evils arise. Our leading characters seem to have resolved (as the powerful Grecian did on another occasion) that when Independence should be obtained they would repose. Mr. Adams in Europe it is true remains active and furnishes us with many excellent materials to work upon. Yet it seems to be acknowledged by all that this is a favourable time for making public exersions---;for settling the Accounts of the States & Individuals with the Union, for adjusting Commercial affairs and for working some amendments into our governments---;that the evils the defects are felt, and a general disposition prevails to accede to some alteration---;that Congress is generally composed of candid men and good republican character, and that the Northern and Southern States are fast approaching a similarity in their manners, ideas and habits---; that we are not embarrassed by foreign influence at present &c---;in short one can hardly realize that people who reasoned collectively through all the Scenes of a war and a revolution and effected by their deliberations & concerted measures, What other nations have gained or lost as chance would have it a people acknowledged by most foreigners to be the only people in the world who reason collectively and thereby proceed on sure ground should now be incapable of effecting any general measures for the benefit of the whole. All the States have adopted the impost system of Apr. 18, 1783 except R. Island which has done it partially---;N. York and Georgia.(2) People in this state begin to think seriously about it. Their assembly has lately convened and will be hardly pressed to come into the measure. Georgia, it is said by her Delegates, will grant it. One man has had the address hitherto to prevent it who promises to withdraw his opposition. It is curious to observe that the Grand Juries of most of the Counties in that State have presented their Legislature (as they have a right to do by their constitution) for not granting the impost as a dangerous delay and neglect.(3) All the States have passed Acts for vesting commercial powers in Congress according to the recommendation of Apr. 30, 1784---;except N. Jersey, Delaware, So. Carolina and Georgia(4) and it is said they will pass similar Acts. Some of them at present object that the powers proposed by that recommendation are not adequate to commercial purposes that   more extensive powers ought to be delegated. The Southern States say they till the ground and produce their exports and find the best market for them when their ports are open to all the world but for the sake of agreeing with us they are willing the Northern States should become their carriers submodo but not so as to make to themselves an exclusive right and thereby have it in their power to monopolise at pleasure---;that the Coml. powers of the Union ought to be lodged in the federal Govert. whether they can be exercised uniformly its effect on pressing occasions few doubt---;but I beleive few will hold who have attended to the subject well that America at present ought to effect her trade in any manner by coml. restrictions, regulations and encouragements in Common Cases but only in those cases where it may be necessary to remove impediments put upon it by foreign powers. You can hardly conceive, Sir, how much our common measures are impeded by the unsettled State of public accounts, each State brings forward her demands for supplies furnished or services rendered during the war which she urges were necessary and for the common good tho not in pursuance of the requests or resolves of Congr. These demands in the several States may amount to near 30,000,000 dollars. Some of these demands are more Just than others. Maryland, Virginia, So. Carolina & some other States bring forward regular charges of every thing they have done during the war. The amo[unt] of Virginia is near 11,000,000 of dors. but if these charges are allowable we ought to be allowed our expenses for sea coast guards, Penobscot expedition, extra bounties, depreciation on the pay rolls of the militia, old money, depreciation on paper money, payt. made at a late day for services & supplies early in the war & not so soon as to R. Island, Pennsy., Maryland & o[the]r States who kept a better look out---;but these things in part cannot be, many States have kept no Accots. We in this Case with all our exersions probably should fall in debt.(5) For the 500,000 dr's our States money which we called in at an early period and thereby created a large State Debt and only opened a Door for so much cont'l money; coming into the hands of our citizens and dying there, for other States neglected to redeem their State money but issued quantities of it. But many of the States are urgent for a settlement and will probably oppose all requisitions of Congr. till some measures are taken more effectual for a settlement. These accounts cannot it is clear be allowed or rejected in the whole, they must be examined in their nature and extent and reduced to what is just and reasona[ble] or they will slay all federal measure[s]. It is moved by some States that have large demands of this kind that the Commissioners appointed to settle Accounts between the Union and the individual States should be authorised to settle and allow these demands according to equity and good Conscience but it is the opinion of others that they are not competent to the adjustment of such important de-  mands. The latter I think is the better opinion. It remains therefore for Congress to appoint some man or board of commissioners who will be equal to the business and have the Confidence of the parties to settle these accounts and determine how far they shall be charged against the Union and for Congr. to prescribe rules as far as it is practicable for conducting the business. This has become a matter of great importance and Serious and we must be decisive and in earnest in the business, if you shall have leisure to send me your ideas or opinion as to the best mode of settling these demands &c. I shall be happy to receive such communications. We learn by the papers that another convention is proposed to be held in the Eastern Counties(6)---;nor are we informed that the Genl. Court did any thing respecting those disturbances the last Session or whether they thought it practicable to do any thing. I hope those Conventions may not be productive of much trouble and expence to the Commonwealth but I fear it. The situation of those Counties between us and the British provinces is unfavourable. The reason we have to believe that the British are privy to all that is done there makes the affair of more consequence. All kinds of information from Europe tends to prove that Great Britain would not have many Scruples of Conscience about disturbing our peace, that haughty nation feels sore and wounded & might be induced to buy peace in Europe at a dear rate in order that she might get back but an inch of our Territory. I do not imagine that those Counties at present wish to become a part of the British Governt. The people in General perhaps have no direct motives for their conduct---;a few who have local or personal advantages in coud put the machine in motion but if the towns & individuals who are opposed to the separation lay still and do not in the covnentions or in some manner Make their sentiments and opposition known the field will be left to those ringleaders and they and the world in Genl. will believe the people in those Counties Unan[imousl]y. They will petition Congr. to be made a separate State. The question for a while lay undecided. Will these people keep themselves attached to and attend on the Govert. of Massa. in the meantime & pay taxes or will they not be hatching up Govert. among themselves & keep their money at home. Congr. undoubtedly will not agree to make them a separate State, the sd. States will not wish to throw another voice into the northern interest and we shall Join with them in this instant---;and the idea of making separate states is genrally reprobated as produce of the worst evils to the Confederacy. The Assent of nine States is required at any rate---;but may not a doubt be started on the Confederation whether Congr. have a right to divide a State at all---;or whether any provision is made or the idea held up in that orig. compact for the dismemberment or separation of a State. If not then those people are violating the very constitution of the Society. It is   fully agreed that the 2 & 3 art[icle]s are a guarantee of the States to each State of its territory, sovereignty & jurisdiction and that Congr. are bound at the reasona[ble] request of any State to give her aid & assistance in this Case for her preservation. 13 States formed the body politic and no other States can be admitted unless provision therefor was made in the orig Compact the confedr. The 11 art. provides that Canada may be admitted &c \""but no other Colony shall be admitted into same unless such admission be agreed to by nine States\""---;by the 9 art[icle] Cong have a right to decide disputes between States respecting boundaries, Jurisdiction & right of soil in a given form. This supposes a prior right of which Congr. is to Judge---;provided that no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the U States. These are all the Clauses I find in the Confedn. relative to this Subject---;it is Clear and has been determined by Congr. 1781 that the 2 & 3 arts are a positive guarantee of the States to each State of her territory and Jurisdiction. If so they will not dismember a State by the implied construction of any other article. The above recited proviso in the 9 art is restrictive but of what? The art provides that where two or more States dispute their boundaries or extent of their jurisdiction or w[he]n two or more States claim the same thing Cong. Submodo shall divide that, say which shall have the territory or Jurisdiction contested but must not Cong in this Judl. capacity adjudge it to one or the other of the parties or can they adjudge it to belong to neither but to the Union at large as not being a part of any part[icular] State. Was not this proviso prudently brought in here to prevent Cong. Claiming contested territories and Jurisdictions? but on the other hand that the subject in contest should be adjudged to one party or the other Claiming it, this proviso therefore if it has any meaning at all inforces and comes in aid of the 2 and 3 arts. What can be intended by the words \""but no other Colony\"" in the 11 art connected as they stated with the word Canada (a Colony) in the same sentence. The framers of the Confedn. must have had some meaning when they used those words & their meaning at that time ought to be our rule. The people who used those words had objects in view---;the parts of any origl. State that might petition for a separation. Those words will not lead the mind to such objects in the scituation in which they stand in that article but were there not other Colonies at that time, Nova Scotia, East and West Florida &c in our neighbourhood whose admission into the union was then in contemplation. Is it not a fair construction to confine the meaning of the words other Colonies to those Colonies therein being or to such territories as at first were capable of being hereafter admitted into the Union without supposing the dismembered parts of States were in view---;if by this article Congr. have a right to Erect the province of Main into a separate State an acknowledged part of the territory and Jurisdiction of Massachusetts they may do the same as to   any part of any State in the Union and thereby in substance destroy the sovereignty of the State reserved and Secured & guaranteed in the 2 & 3 articles, nay further it would be in the power of nine State[s] to ballance the union at pleasure by dividing old States and makg new ones. Can it be supposed that if such a power was intended by the 11 art so destructive of the sovereignty and independence of each state, so repugnant to the 2 and 3 arts that the framers of the Confedn. would have expressed themselves as they did in the 11 articles. With so much apparent indifference in the contest respecting Vermont the parties appear to have been aware of these difficulties. The people of Vermont therefore claimed their independence on a fact they laboured hard to prove that they were a separate Jurisdiction and no part of N York prior to the formation of the United States the body politic, that they were detached before N. York become a part of this body politic the confederated States. The Legislature of N. York in 1782 determined that Congr. had no right by the Confedn. to divide a State or make a new State out of any part of an old one upon the Clauses above recited(7) and then seem to have exerted near their whole Strength to shew that Vermont has been an acknowledged part of the State of N. York since N. York formed a part of the present Union---; and I think it may pretty clearly be inferred from the doings of Congress that in their opinion the question rested & turned on this matter of fact---;for after Congress seems to have determined in their minds that Vermont should be admitted into the Union by prescribing the conditions on which it should be done and by appointing a Committee to confer with the people thereof and to adjust the terms and mode of their admission they resolved to guarantee to N. Hampshire and N. York accordg to the Confedn. certain lands and the Jurisdiction thereof. But whether Cong. have this right or not of dismembering a State by creating a new one by the assent of 9 States is a nice question and perhaps the legality of the Conduct of the 8 Counties rest upon it for if our frame of Government our Confederation has made a constitutional provision for dividing a State, admits of a separation it will be fairly urged that it by implication admits of the means as of meetings, consultations and petitions to effect and obtain the end the object provided for in the confedn. but if [in] the end such a separation is not provided for then all their measures for that purpose are in violation of the constitutions and rights of the Society. I wish this matter to be fully examined, it may be attended with beneficial effects to the Union and particularly to Massachusetts if it should become the prevailing opinion that no state can be divided but by a new article in the federal compact agreed to by all the States. That is by the power that formed it and can new model the fundamental principles of our   Community. These rising States that now create so much trouble would be convinced their Struggles would be in vain. This is a matter perhaps too nice for people in General but if the more thinking should adopt the opinion it may have a good effect and the people in those Counties &c checked in their pursuits. A power so capable in its nature of being abused in America as that of Dividing States, Counties, towns, &c ought in my opinion only to be exercised by those who have a right to form the Society de novo and vary its original features---;and I believe the more thinking men throughout the U. States are in a humour to be reasoned into this opinion. Some of the other states obliquely hint to us that we have had members in Cong. who cherished Vermont and now we are punished. But I believe the union would readily assist the State in carrying her reasona[ble] laws into execution against any part that should revolt. But what further laws or reasona. rules to control the conduct and actions of the peoples of those Counties the Government ought to make is undoubtedly a matter of serious consideration if they withhold their taxes or disturbe the administration of government among them they no doubt are punishable by the laws in being but our treason laws made to bind the subject to his allegiance and to punish him for withdrawing it was made in a time of war and do not appear calculated to preserve allegiance in General or to prevent the evils we now feel. I wish those laws had been revised before the disturbances in the E. Counties had taken place and made to apply to every part of the State with Justice, moderation and yet with energy than the Government in it's conduct could not have appeared pointed. These laws might have been revised and constructed on the principles that no set of men have a right to assemble for the purpose of dismembering the State and pointed out a mode of trying and punishing them for so doing. They might have pointed out a mode of stating greivances (a very difft matter) and of redressing them. It is certainly of consequence for the State so to conduct her self as to keep Justice on her side and convince the other States of the justice and equity of her Cause but whether the General Court ought now to direct the revising Committee to reverse the laws against treason &c and amend them on general and dispassionate principles---;to appoint a respectable Committee to enquire into the real situation and disposition of the people of those Counties, their Conduct and Grievances if any and for devising means to redress greivances and punish misconduct, to ascertain facts, to inform the uninform'd, to prevent the false impressions made by designing men, to devise means for them to obtain Justice more promptly and at less expence under the present government, and to adopt measures speedily. Accordingly I leave to your consideration and to the Consideration of others in   the legislature the longer they remain in their present situation the less aid we shall have from them and the more the people may become alienated and disposed to Join some other government---;but I have said six times as much as I intended already and I fear enough to weary your patience. I wish Sir you would write me about our eastern land affairs. We shall have but little business to do untill Spring I believe for want of a sufficient number of States assembled---;and may possibly attend those eastern affairs---;or do my endeavours that another person may be appointed in my place as may best serve the Interest of the Commonwealth. I am Sir, with esteem & respect, Your friend and Humble servant, N. Dane ""

 Dear sir New York 20th Jany. 1786 I am honoured with yours of the 3d instant and am very clear in sentiment with you that Congress should be invested with power to regulate trade. 'Tis also the sentiment of many others here. But we are embarrassed for want of a fuller representation, there having been no more than seven states here since my arrival: consequently the most important business can't be done. The whole business of finance goes on heavily as you will see by perusing the enclosed, which was printed for the members of Congress.(1) The legislature of N York are now sitting, it is expected by some, but much doubted by others, that they will acceed to the 5 per Cent duty, upon which the whole system of Apr 1783 turns. Comunications from Mr Adams give but faint hopes of a treaty of commerce with G Brittain; altho I am led to believe his negotiations on that subject have been spirited and judicious. The surveyors of land for our western territory returnd having done very little for fear of the indians. However a treaty is on foot which it is hoped will set the matter right. Much is said in favour of the soil, climate, produce &ca---;that when surveyd it will meet with a quick s[ale]. I wish it may.

 January 20, 1786 107 counts of others, as from his Situation in Philadelphia, from his grasping Disposition, and from the Influence he obtained with our Brother Cox, his Office extended its Ligaments into the Accounts of so many others that their Accounts cannot be settled without some Reference to & Explanation from his. Mr. Denning, at best, makes but slow Progress in the Business, and I believe rather easily permits even small Obstacles to impede and lay by an Account. The Course of Depreciation so frequently overwhelmed and unhinged the Rules established by Congress for the Settlement of Accounts that the different Commissioners are at great Loss for want of established Principles & Rules for their Government. Various Applications have been made to the Board of Treasury, to the Superintendt. of Finance, while he was in Office, and to Congress, to establish such Principles & Rules as may be more easily & uniformly understood; but the Circumstances to be weighed & measured by such Rules are so various, numerous & heterogeneous, that they get lost in a maze of Difficulties whenever the Subject is entered upon, and therefore cannot be brought to enter on any radical Measures, and it is with great Difficulty they are brought occasionally to form a Resolution of Expediency only; & when they do pass such a Resolution it is generally either of little Extent as to it's Object, or operative by a Reference to a train of former Resolutions occasionally passed on pressing Emergences, with limited and perhaps different Aspects. Hence every Commissioner is left too much to his own Discretion & Judgment in forming, as it were by Inference, the Rules by which he is to decide on various Matters that come before him. Some have Resolution enough to exercise this Discretionary Power so as to let few Obstacles impede their Progress. Others, more timid, or less inclined to dispatch the Business, boggle at many Things which the former pass pretty easily over, and shelter themselves behind the Letter, or a narrow Construction of some Act of Congress. The Commr. for the Quarter Master's Department,(3) seems to be of the latter kind, tho' I believe a well meaning Man; but he is engaged in other Pursuits, being at this Time a sitting Member of the Assembly. The Commr. for the commissary's Department(4) makes better progress. He is more liberal in the Construction of his Powers, and attends to no other Business. I believe his Conduct is also more acceptable to his Superiors as well as to the Accomptants. I have Reason to believe the Plan will soon be altered so as to form one Office for the Accounts of the 5 Departments, which are now under 5 distinct Heads acting independantly of each other.(5) The last Election in Pennsa. made considerable Changes in the Legislature.(6) The Attack on the Bank inflamed the Industry of Mr. Morris &c. They made great Efforts throughout the State. In the City they succeeded by about 1100 to 1000. I was absent & did not meddle with it, tho' I was placed at the Head of the losing Ticket. They had some Success also in other Places, & for some Time the Cry of Victory was  January 20, 1786  on their side on a Supposition of a decided Majority. The Choice of Speaker & Clerk first convinced them of their Mistake. They still had Hopes that Mr. Morris's masterly Talents in Finance would bear down all Opposition in Business of that kind, which in fact is now the leading Object of Legislation. I had conversed with him on the Subject, & I left Philadelphia in great Expectation of the Parties harmonizing in Measures relating to it, as he agreed with me in the Objects to be accomplished & promised to adopt the Means I had in view as far as his Judgment would permit on a candid Consideration of them. He framed his Plan so as to embrace the Objects I had proposed, even more extensively than I had thought it prudent yet to aim at. But on a Supposition that this would draw in both Sides of the House, and enlist all the Public Creditors in support of his Measures, he made a bold Stroke to restore the Bank by interweaving it into the Machine of the State in such Manner as to make the latter dependant upon it; and, in order to accomodate the Revenues of the State to Bank operations, he proposed such modes of raising Revenues as I conceive are wholly inadmissible even under a british Constitution, much more so under ours. He proposed to abolish our Ordinary Mode of Taxation on Land & Stock, ad valorem, and to lay on a Poll Tax of one Dollar per Head on Males fit to bear Arms---;A Duty on Flour & Grain exported---;The Revenue of Excise to be trebled, and farmed out to the highest Bidder---;and an additional Impost on the Import of specified Articles, so high as in my Opinion would either introduce smuggling, or drive the Trade from our Ports to those of our bordering Neighbours. He sent me his Plan, & in polite & even flattering Terms asked my Opinion of it fully and freely. I gave him my Opinion with Frankness & Candor. My Friends in the House asked my Assistance; I gave them all that I could at this Distance. Mr. Morris's Plan was rejected by a large Majority (12 to 5) in the grand Committee of which he was Chairman, and another Plan reported to and adopted by the House, without any Aspect to the Bank, founded on the Revenues established last Year, and pursuing the same Principles of funding then adopted, under a new modification to meet the Requisition of Congress, and extending the Plan to some other Objects which were last year in View but could not then be embraced. Bills were accordingly published for Consideration one for complying with the Requisition of Congress, and another for paying to our own Citizens so much of our Quota of the Contribution as is allowed to be discounted for Interest on the domestic Debt. This is done by opening a State Loan to receive in Certificates of certain Descriptions (such as were admitted under the funding Act of last year) and giving State Certificates on Interest in lieu of them. By which Means the State will be possessed of the original Continental Certificates & can discount the Interest on them at the Continental Loan Office according to the Terms of the Requisition, & the State will then pay the Interest to it's Citizens in it's own   Way & in such Money as it exacts from them in the Collection of Revenues. Mr. Morris's plan proposed this mode of transferring the origl. Certificates also by a State Loan---;but he made the Bank the Loan Officer for this Purpose, & the Treasurer for receiving all Revenues & making all Payments from the State: The Plan adopted does all by the ordinary State Officers & leaves the Bank unnoticed. The House adjourned the 27th of Decr. to meet again the 3d Tuesday in February. The Session was lengthy and produced much warm Debate, but did not result [in] Business in proportion to the Time expended. By aiming at too much Mr. Morris's Strength declined, and his opponents gained ground. Genl. Wayne & Genl. Hand, who were considered at least as warm if not able Partizans, resigned their Seats towards the Close of the Session. Another (tho' but a simple Vote) also resigned to avoid a Scrutiny on his Election, which it was supposed would not support him. Hands Place is supplied by one on the same side, but the other two will afford contested Elections & the Success of the Parties is at least doubtful, tho' great Industry is used in Hopes of a more Successful Attempt to revive the Bank.  If my Passions were much engaged in Party Matters in Pennsylvania, I should feel some Disgust at the Mode of my re- election to Congress. While it was supposed Mr. Morris & his Friends would have a Majority in the House, they affected to count on me for one of the Delegates. I thought it would look ill in me to refuse under their Choice when I had even left the House of Assembly to serve under the Choice of the other Side. After the House had met & were found to be nearly balanced, various Conferences were held to compound the Choice in such manner as to afford some Gratification to both Parties. Those called Republicans were more particular in expressing their Wishes & Expectations that I should serve, than the others. I did not, it is true, wish to be outvoted, but I really wished to be left out of the Nomination & to remain at home to attend to my own Affairs. I therefore meddled no farther with it than to express this Idea. On the Day of Election, however, The Republicans left me out of their Ticket, and made a strenuous Exertion to carry an entire Set of their own. They succeeded in getting in one (Genl. St. Clair) by 34 out of 63 Votes, and afterwards, by a ManOEuvre, got in Mr. Wilson to the exclusion of Dr. Jackson, who, as I have been informed, was jockeyed out of one or two Votes which turned the Scale. Col. Bayard & myself who were highest had but 39. I know not how far this History of Pennsylvania Politics will be entertaining to you; but we are apt to think our Friends feel an Interest in what we are engaged in. It is, perhaps, well for Mankind, especially in republican Governments, that there are such Dupes as me, who when they are called into the public Service engage in it with all their Might, and sometimes conceit they have the Weight of the State on their Shoulders. I have been drawn in to take a leading Part, and I   have felt an Ambition as well as an Interest to continue till I get certain Points accomplished. The Restoration of Public Credit has been my principal Object. I have the Satisfaction to see it thriving, and by it's being more thrifty in Pennsylvania than in the other States, I cannot but flatter myself I have been of some Use in the Business. If it is a Delusion, it is a pleasing one, and stimulates me to continue my Endeavours. I can perceive the Example of our State operating in divers others, and even in Congress. I hope it's Influence will increase & raise up a spirit of Emulation in every State. I am persuaded Georgia will profit by your Residence in it.(7) The State is young, and the People but little informed of the Affairs of the Union, and of their Relationship to the fOEderal Family.

If you are not acquainted with [him], you have a Pleasure to come on which I congratulate you. You will gratify me much by a renewal of your Correspondence.

Congress have in contemplation a plan of sending consuls to several parts of Europe, but the system is so undigested and imperfect that it will bear no denomination at present---;whether the consuls who may be appointed will receive a fixed Salary, or be empowered to receive fees from the Ships of their country, which may arrive where they reside, or whether they will go out upon the plan of the Dutch consuls who receive neither salary nor Fees, but are the consignees or Factors of their countrymen in the places where they respectively reside, is wholly undecided. The probability is, that they will obtain neither salary nor Fees. I know your commercial antipathies, & fear that nothing in this Line, would meet your approbation, was it obtainable---;excepting this employment of consuls, I do not know a single Office under the United States, now vacant, which is worth your attention, unless the Office to which Majr.

 Dear Sir New York Jany. 23. 1786. Since your arrival in Europe I have receiv'd one letter from you only, & that I found here upon my return from my late excursion westward. I have however frequently heard of you thro' other channels & particularly, young Mr. Adams, in August, & lately by Mr. Franklin.(1) I am happy to hear of yr. health as also of the acquirment January 23, 1786  you have made of the french language. Lately in Richmond I saw Sr. Peyton Scypwith. He was well & mention'd you very affectionately. B. Randolph & many other of your friends made very particular enquiries after you also. Wilson Nicholas intends to remain at home a few years, to erect some buildings, improve his estate, & give his seat in the legislature to his brother Jack, whom I also saw in Richmond & who harangues very freely & in the most respectable companies, upon commerce, religion, war & ca. Mercer is in the Assembly, hath a son, & hangs between the bar & politicks with the weight of a wife at his heels. You desire information whether it is the intention of Congress to extend their foreign appointments. At present I believe it is not. The idea seems to prevail that Secretarys of legation are absolutely useless. The motive or cause which originally gave birth to the office in Europe does not apply here. There a nobleman held the office in quality of his rank in the court, tho' destitute of the necessary talents to discharge its duties, in consequence of which it became necessary to appoint a person who did & annex him to the legation, but with us this is not the case. We shall appoint the man, the minister, in consideration of his talents only. Why it hath been adopted at all, arose from a ridiculous & servile imitation of the usages of Europe in the first instances & the last from a cause wh. I cannot explain to you out of cypher.(2) The only argument in favor of it is, it will teach young men to form ministers themselves, yet I doubt whether this is not rather visionary than real, for I question much whether service in our different publick offices will not be equally or more instructive. Many very important subjects will be before Congress in the course of this winter, particularly the subject of a mint, the commerce of the States, a plan of militia, the division & disposition of the western country &ca. As yet we have but 7 States present but expect a full representation in a few weeks. You have heard of the death of our amiable friend Mr. Hardy---;his loss is universally lamented, but more particularly felt by myself in the delegation.

 Sir(1) New York Jany 26. 1786. I this day received yours of the 14th Instant, inclosing Major Swan's letter; he is right in his Statement of the Affair between him and me, as one of the Committee on the Subject of Eastern lands---;the Islands he agreed to purchase not containing so much land as was expected it appears, I suppose, by the admeasurement of them, that he advanced too much; whence, if he is right in the quantity there is to be returned to him Â£119.2.9---;in orders on collectors or sheriffs or Â£238.5.6 in State notes, and the like from Mr. Phillips. I wish to pay him immediately the ballance to be returned to him tho' by this I shall be in advance to the State on account of that Eastern business. Major Swan appears to leave it optional to pay the Â£119.5.9 in orders or the Â£238.5.6 in State notes---;it will be most convenient for me to pay him the Â£238.5.6 in State notes, having a considerable part of them by me and for reasons I have given him. I wish you therefore to take what State notes I have in the house which Mrs. Dane will find in the file of notes and give you and wait on Doctor Fisher with the inclosed letter who I think will lend me notes to make up the sum wanted till I return. I don't wish to trouble Mrs. Dane with buying notes, &c.---;get notes  January 28, 1786  with as little Interest due as you can---;and draw, by taking orders on cattalogs what interest you can on my notes---;and add the residue of the Interest to the principal &c. I suppose there is no doubt but that you can borrow the Notes necessary to make up the sum of Dr Fisher, if not get them of any of My Friends---;Andrew Cabot, &c---;to whom they shall be replaced on my return---;and as soon as you can obtain the necessary sum pay it to Mr. Swan taking of him the proper receipt. If Mrs. Dane can, without much trouble, buy notes sufficient, with what I have, to make up the said sum of Â£238.5.6 which I am told can be bought for about six shillings & 4 pence in the pound it would be convenient for me---;and raise the money on any of the securities, notes, and bonds, due to me---;&c.

 Sir, New York January 28th. 1786. Our last to your Excellency of this present month detailed every particular which, occurred to us necessary to be laid before the Legislature.(1) Nothing very material has since taken place. The Inhabitants of these middle States are embarking with Spirit in the East India trade. Three or four Vessels have either lately sailed, or soon will sail to that part of the World. Our trade there, will be free from an inconvenience to which European connexions expose us, that is, an interference in our Governments. To favor this Commerce, Congress yesterday appointed Major Shaw Consul of the United States to reside at Canton.(2) We are informed by Mr Carmichael, that the Emperor of Morocco has lately treated some of our Captive Citizens with more lenity than formerly.(3) We fear that this change, has taken place more from motives of policy than those of justice or humanity. To purchase his friendship will be expensive, & perhaps more so, from a few Acts of mercy previous to the commencement of pacific negotiations. We beg the favor of your Excellency to send us by the first opportunity a certified Copy of the Law of our State under which the Sloop Chester was condemned.(4) The Minister of the United Netherlands has made repeated remonstrances on this condemnation; a Copy of the  January 28, 1786  Law is necessary for the information of Congress before an Official answer can be given to his Note on this Subject.

 Dear Brother(1) New York 29 Jan. 1786 On Sunday last I recd. a Letter from Mrs. Dagworthy informing of your Illness in Maryland and that the Danger was so imminent that Dr Jones was gone to your Assistance. I continued in a most painful State of Anxiety from that Time till Friday Evg. when Walterstroff returned to N York from Philada and brought me an Account of your Recovery. From the Acct. I had recd. of your Situation, which was very alarming, I almost gave myself up to Despair, as I thought there could be no Hope drawn from the Strength of your Constitution in a Case where a  January 29, 1786  Circumstance of this Kind is so unfavorable. I hope to God you will take great Care of yourself as Persons who have had this Disease are very liable to a Relapse and this in your present State may prove fatal.(2) I am oftentimes very uneasy about you as I know you rely too much on your Constitution and very often expose it to very severe Tryals without any real Necessity. This may be assigned as the Reason why so many Persons of a strong vigorous Make either do not reach the usual Term of Life or become liable to the most dreadful chronical Diseases. I send you herewith inclosed the Letters which passed between Mr Jay & Mr Littlepage while abroad.(3) You have no Doubt seen the first Newspaper Publications wh have given Rise to a most violent Quarrel between them and occasioned considerable Parties in this City. The latter came out just before I got to Town & were so much in Demand that I could not get them, otherwise I would forward them by this Opportunity. Littlepage is a young Virginian who in the Year 80 went over to Spain recommended to the particular Care & Patronage of Jay who was then at the Court of Madrid. The former being a young Man of Parts and of an ardent Temper could not think himself happy in a State of Retirement with Jay but being desirous of making a Campaign he went to the Siege of Minorca & returned with considerable Eclat. Having made an Acquaintance with several Persons of Distinction on his first Excursion he received Encouragement to go to the Siege of Gibralter where he distinguishd himself in the grand Attack upon that Place. On this Occasion he became acquainted with all the principal Men of Rank in the Army, particularly the Prince of Nassau with whom he has since been on his Travels thro several Parts of Europe. He came over lately to America with Letters from some of the first Personages in Europe to Congress in his Favor, and expected to have returned with some Testimonials of their Approbation, but Jay having called upon him for the Money he had supplied for his Expences in Europe Littlepage referred him to his uncle, who was his Guardian, for Payment, wh. Jay would have been satisfied with, but hearing there was a Sum of Money in a Merchants Hands in N York belonging to Littlepage, he instantly sued him which brought on the Quarrel. It seems there had been some Difference between them while abroad which Jay could not forgive---;Littlepage appealed to the Public, abused Jay personally in the Street & challenged him. The Latter replied with great Sharpness twitting him with the Favors he had recd. of him in Spain. Littlepages letters are written with great Spirit and Accuracy & in a Brilliancy of Style seldom to be met with. Jay's Language is not so pure as I could wish. Of the Merits of the Men you will judge by the Letters I now send you. I think you will see a very unfavorable Portrait of Littlepage who seems to me to possess more Understanding & Abilities than Steadiness, and Rectitude of Mind.

 Dear Sir.(1) New York Jan. 31. 1786. I at this time improve the privilege of writing to you agreeable to  January 31, 1786  proposals not so much because I have interesting information to communicate but I wish to promote our correspondince. The general tranquillity that prevails throughout the U States affords but few daily occurrences---;and there having been since my arrival here at no time more than seven States assembled in Congress we have been able to form no very interesting determinations---;however we have turned our inquiries & Congress its attention in some degree to the important matters which at present attract the attention of the several parts of the Union---;and endeavour to put them in a train of Decision. I mean the matters respecting the finances, the Commerce of and unliquidated demands upon the United States---;to carry some better federal System of revenue into effect than our present---;to regulate our trade on a broad and uniform basis---;and to settle those demands of States and individuals upon the union which at present create so much uneasiness & inequality & tend much to obstruct federal measures---;are objects in my opinion of the first consequence. Whenever measures are adopted on these heads these subjects that extend to effect the various interests of the States & parts of the Confederacy present & future they undoubtedly ought to be the result of strict laborious enquiry, candid discussion and impartial but deliberate determinations. The present time of peace and leisure is certainly favourable to these objects. The danger is that if we neglect to improve our federal polity in these important points and to adopt some different Systems till compress'd & compelled into the measure by war or a Common danger the states will then act precipitately and adopt undigested measures unequal to the purposes intended or by unguarded expressions give up what they never proposed to do. We have the good fortune to live in a Country where the people by it's laws and it's polity are Governed by consent and by informing their understandings and fairly convincing them of the Justice, propriety and good policy of the measure to which their assent is requested. Information therefore concerning federal proceedings, the proceedings, reasons, & opinions of indiv. States, and matters of common concernment are not only their due but necessary to the perfection of Government. No people in the world I believe ever adopted the best forms of government best adapted to their genius and circumstances. In the first instance they have been the productions of attention to their effect in administering them to present defects and Judicious amendments. The machinery of Social compacts is delicate and cautiously to be touched especially such combined ones as our's. And the greatest danger perhaps we run is that of incorporated in some early period in material part of it the hidden seeds of its destruction. Every combined government has its parts to be ballanced, in which the stress, the secresy, the difficulty of preserving it lies. Had the Romans been attentive to this idea they never would soon after the abolition of the Kingly office admitted plebian leaders an accession to the patri-  cian order and by the allurements of honors inticed them to shift parties. They never would have admitted an uncontroulable executive in a Roman dictator, or military Commands that drew after them the rable, the profligate and the corrupted of the Roman people. Had the Barons of France four hundred years ago reasoned well on this subject they surely would not by their oppressions have forced their tenants to throw their weight into the King's Scale & thereby give him a power that ever since has been, is and probably ever will be uncontroulable. Perhaps accidental circumstances, and hasty assumptions of power first in the King then in the barons and then in the Commons of England, rather than reason & reflection, sounded the alarm & brought forth exertions that have preserved in some degree an equilibrium there. But we have a ballance, an equipoise of power in our Government I think to attend to different from any that has ever appeared in the annals of mankind---;a Just division of power between a federal head and the Legislatures of the States. There may be at some future period a Scope for Jealousy and a field for Struggles but I doubt whether there can be much competition at present. It is true Congress hold the weapons of war & the palms of peace---;but the respective States hold the purse strings of the Union, the power of creating Congress annually, recalling its members at pleasure and regulating the rewards of their Services. Whence we seldom see a member of Congress depart from the opinion of his State even tho he may be fully convinced that that opinion is founded on mistaken facts and would be given up by the State had it possess'd itself of the true State of things and of the information he has. He will ever harbour doubts whether it is in his power to induce his constituents to alter their opinion & think with him; whence the very honor of members is often concerned in giving their States true information in the first instance and getting early their well founded opinion. However I have but little doubt that it will be always safest to leave the ballance of power inclining in favor of the respective Legislatures it being then not quite so far removed from the people---;but powers that have a foreign or Common influence cannot be uniformly ex[er]cised by Legislatures totally independent of each other---;nor can they be exercised by Congress to the best advantage of the Community in the mode in which that body at present possesses them. Yet I hold it unsafe even to attempt an alteration in our Confederacy except in those parts where we are pretty clearly convinced of the defects. I feel happy in the reflection the whole confed[er]ation was not submitted to revision as proposed by our State.(2) Such a measure must have implied more than at first the State might be aware of---;that she disliked it in all its parts and had given a kind & legal toleration to every quibbling party to attack it some where & among the variety of the proposed amendments the Community must have   been divided & confused---;nor do I think we are ripe for or ought to attempt without further experience any more amendments in the Confederation or federal System radically than are now proposed by investing Congress with the avails of the revenue system of Apr. 18, 1783---;by the proposed alteration of the 8th art. of it and by vesting them with well defined powers to regulate trade---;either by a perpetual new art in the Confedn. or by temporary laws. As to another idea that has been started by some that Congress ought to have a controuling power to bring back to their duty the parts of States that may revolt & set up for independence, it is here held by Congress & the best informed Statesmen that the Confedn. is now sufficient for that purpose, that the 2 & 3 articls are a guarrantee of the States to each State of it[s] Jurisdiction and territory & when called on are held to assist it agt. any part that may revolt---;that the 11 art does not is held by many & I believe will be by all who examine the Confedn. carefully extend to authorise Congress to divide an original State and make a new one out of an acknowledgd part of it. So much aware of this have N. York & Vermont been in their disputes that the principal point contested by them has been whether Vermont has or has not been a part of N. York since N. York became part of the Confederacy. But how shall we carry into full effect the amendments I have hinted at which a majority of the States have adopted as recommended by Congress. This is a work of time & enquiry but would not the perseverance that enabled us to combine & unite several parts of this body politic in 1774-1775 &c against the efforts of Great Britain enable us now to bring over a few little states to understand the Common good of the whole. The States make no difficulty about the Contl impost except R. Island, which has adopted it partially, N. York & Georgia, which stand out. We are informed that one man in Georgia has had the influence principally to prevent it's passing there whose conduct is disagreeable to the people & the grand Juries have generally indicted their assembly as guilty of a dangerous evil for not adopting it. This State is divided in opinion and the opposers of the System must be hard pressed soon by the States of N. Jersey & Connectt. Congress have it in contemplation in a few days to make a pressing application to their Legislature now setting on this head. It is thought the rest of States will accede to the proposed alteration of the 8th Art. of the confederation without difficulty execept N. Hampshire & R. Island about which there are some doubts. All the States have vested Congress with a large Coml. power as they recomd. by their resolve of Apr. 30, 1784, except N. Jersey, Delaware, So. Carolina & Georgia.(3) <<N. Jersey has not done it at present because as it is said their powers are not extensive enough. The gentlemen who come from S. Carolina say they are willg to confine their carrying trade to Am[erica]n bottoms sub modo, that is to lay a   heavy tonnage & light duty on foreign vessels coming to their ports & light ones on Amn. vessels but don't wish the Northern States to have it in their power to monopolize the whole carrying trade of the Southern ones on any terms the carriers may please to make>. However they rather think their State will comply with the recommendation. I hope our State will not think of rejecting the late requisition of Congress, if so respectable and so federal a State as Massa. does, A number of States will think themselves quite excused for not complying with it---;no State as yet has rejected it---;but several have adopted it. I should be very sorry if federal measures in our State should be impeded because some State demands are not settled. To obtain a vote in Cong. for the late requis[ition]---;our State & others were obliged here to croud on the Southern States who Complain loudly of unsettled accounts.

 January 31, 1786 125 Choate relative thereto & some other federal affairs. The present State of the last requisition of Congress in Massa. and from a few objections I heard made by some gentlemen to passing or complying with it in that State because certain public accounts were not settled and certain Demands as yet allowed by Congress, has Induced me to pay close attention to those subjects the short time I have been here. I am persuaded had those gentlemen who make those objections the information one here can obtain and a true idea of the State of public accounts they would not make them. We entered into the late war while our governments were unorganised, untried and unsettled---;the affairs of the States were in the hands of Congress, thirteen Legislatures or State assemblies and a variety of Committees &c. The business of our defence of raising troops, supplying them, arming them, &c fell of course into the hands of Committees & men new in the business assigned them---;of necessity often shifted & obliged to purchase as they could. States and Counties & towns often attacked or threatened by the savages or the British were obliged to save themselves and the parts of the Confederacy to arm, supply, and defend themselves agt. the immeda. danger as they could and not pursuant to the requisitions of Congress or perhaps there was no requisition existing that reach their Case <<some Counties so divided in some States into Whigs & Tories that a third power was necessary to turn the ballance>. The hardships of our army were great at times whence it became necessary to give large bounties to induce men to go into the field---;some States were too weak, & too much oppressed by the distresses of the war to supply punctually their quotas of men and money others perhaps too neglect whence a third Class of States were obliged to hire men &c at a high & unequal rate to supply the deficiencies of theirs. From these and other Causes the late war was immensely expensive to America---;an expence annually that at any future time may keep 100,000 men in the field. The expence has been a constant inequality and it is an arduous task to restore a tolerable equality. 241,562,775 old Emission dollars issued from the Continental Treasury---;36,000,000 before there was any depreciation. The worth of the whole sum issued estimated by the Contl Scale of depreciation at the times it respectively issued amounted in silver to the sum of 65,000,000 dollars nearly 122,000,000 of which paper dollars by the two requisitions for sinking that money hath been redeemed & paid in to the Contl treasury worth estimated by the same scale at the times of payment not exceeding 4,000,000 silver dollars---;whence of that kind of money to the amount of 61,000,000 silver dollars comparing the values when issued &c in part redeemed remains sunk in the hands of individuals to the amount of about 1,000,000 of which remains as a surplusage a burden on Massa. whence to the amount of 60,000,000 silver dollars has sunk in the hands and fell as a burden on the individual holders. On what States or Counties or towns the loss of this last men'd sum fell most  January 31, 1786  heavily is difficult to say probably on the Northern States where it long retained at all stages of it its value & met with receivers of it. The 4,427,470 dollars new Emission that issued in exchange for the old and the states that rec'd it could be no loosers---;another inequality was occasioned by the old money the States as R. Island, Pennsyla., & N. Carolina who made out their accounts of supplies & services & got their pay early before money depreciated---;gained great advantages that we and some other States lost---;but it so happens that some of the states whose interest is with ours in this instance is against ours in the redemption of that money. Some States as Virginia issued such immense quantities of State paper money that that and Contl paper sunk to nothing almost together so far that it passed I think at a 1,000 for 1---;so that the continental money which died in the hands of their Citizens cost them little or nothing---;and on this score of paper money the States all seem to agree we have Just demands that the money remaining in our hands ought to be redeemed but at what rate is the question, the various ideas of the States are according generally as they voted the money when it died from 75 to 1,000 for 1. One or two held to the Contract of Congress of 40 for 1---;but this money is but one source of inequality among many to be settled. We say that our sea Coast men were a great expence, our Penob. expedition, that we furnished the army with men to supply in some the difficiencies of other States at 300 dollars a man, that our militia received no depreciation---;that fixing the prices of specific articles supplied the army under the requisitions of Feb. 25, 1780 & Nov. 4, 1780(2) the estimate was made to our disadvantage but other States appear to themselves to have demands they say that make your Cause good---;that every State has exerted it self in some way or other---;& has great demands for services & supplies, that the whole accounts must be settled together. Connecticut urges that her territories lie near the Enemy for many years whereby her Citizens were harrassed & her militia often in arms. N. York, the Jerseys, Virginia, the Carolinas & Georgia say from the year 1776 to the Close of the war their subjects & militia were never scarcely at rest what of the Savages on one side and the British on the other---;if they were feeble in their defence it was not their fault but their misfortune whence they say they expended immense sums in paying their militia who acted in repelling the Common danger as well as their own for which they have no legal demands on the Union by virtue of the resolves of Congress not being furnished pursuant to their immeda. request but from the necessity of the Case & founded only in equity. Virginia has an account of more than 10,000,000 drs. regularly kept, the Jerseys & the Carolinas large accounts. Other States for the like services have kept no acco[unt]s---;I believe Massa., Connecticut & N. York have not---;the States that have kept these accos. often bring them forward. Motions are made that Comrs. be  authd. to settle them and they seem sometimes disposed to oppose all requisitions & federal measures unless they can be allowed these demands. Massachusetts, N Hamr. & some other states return the general argument that the demands must be all taken up tog[ethe]r---;if at all, that there is no equity in a partial allowance of them. Tho these Claims in their nature may be some what similar to ours on acco. of sea coasts men & Penobt. expedn. yet our Claims on acco. of the old money and extra bounties given to men beyond our quota in actual service are within the purview of the Resolves of Congr.---;but the States who do not see their way clear to acknowledge the accounts of Virginia & others like them go further & say there apparently was no economy in their expenditures if just in part that the States which make such Claims for supplies to & services of militia &c did not comply with the requisitions of Congress. Had they done it there would not have been occasion for such supplies & militia services---; that they suffered property to be taken by distress for the army which they ought to have collected by lawful assessments but these things they deny in turn & the debates are of but little effect. They urge that indifft. men be appd. to settle all the demands of the States which arose during the late war in equity and good Conscience that this is reasona. & that it is an arg[umen]t agt. some States that they think the ballance would be against them o[the]rwise they would agree to such an appointt. The answer of those States is that it has been the uniform conduct of Congress not to allow any State the expence she was carried to incurr in her own immeda. defence not pursuant to the requisitions of Congress---;and that therefore some States have kept no acco. of such expences & must consequently suffer---;by such an appointt.---;that an unthought of debt and unjust one because unequ[a]l would be brot upon the Confederacy. Many other things are said argued about State demands, they give Congr. much uneasiness. The voice of nine States in 13 is required on all the matters almost to carry any measure and as there are not often more than 11 or 12 States on the floor they must be nearly unanimous to effect any thing. But I think every possible Step will be taken to adjust these demands that have such a tendency to impede our measures. Considering therefore these demands of the Several States are the result of a glorious war of necessary & particular exertions and the unavoidable confusion in the measures of a people passing from one government to another, shall we say, shall each State say here we'll pause, here we'll Stop the wheels of Governt. here we'ill put an end to paying Just demands on the Union for interest or service till our demands are allowed by the Governt. formed of the States parties on the whole by that Governt. which by our pause, our checks, we have unhinged---;but these are things I could not believe did I not hear men declare it to be their determination---;if such men understood the nature of these demands and the   extent of them in the several parts of the union & will compared [sic] political evils, I think they would soon alter their opinion---;that we ought vigorously to push our demands on the union every possible opportunity. Their can be no doubt but it is too early to take desperate measures to right ourselves. Other States will catch at the example and we shall bring ruin on our own heads independent of dissolving the federal Governt & embroiling ourselves in numberless quarrels with each other & exposing ourselves to every foreign power. We have a large proportion of the Continental securities in our State on which the So. States often complain they are paying us interest on the nominal value. If we by an imprudent stept should imbarrass the requisition or means of supplying the federal Chest we ourselves shall suffer most---;but it may be asked what shall we do with 3 or 4 weak or obstinate States who contribute nothing scarcely to that chest. My answer is persevere in working the society into health and order cautiously but industriously proceding in ascertaining and defining the powers of the bodies & persons who govern and the rights of the governed---;& the day must come when the delinquent States must be shaken off and left to their misfortunes or they must be compelled to fulfil their several engagements & pay their quotas. But they visibly feel their dependence on & advantages in being connected with the others & are I believe endeavouring to be less difficient than they have been. I have Sir in this letter reposed that confidence I ought & have written on this subject openly & freely. With esteem & respect, Your Humble Servant, N. Dane(3) ""

 Sir, New York January 31st. 1786.(1) In conformity to the resolution enclosed it becomes my duty to write to the Executives of the several States which are at present unrepresented in Congress.(2)  Three months of the federal year are now compleated and in that whole period no more than seven States have at any one time been represented. No question excepting that of adjourning from day to day can be carried without perfect Unanimity. The extreme difficulty of framing Resolutions against which no exception can be taken by any one State, can scarcely be conceived but by those whose unfortunate situation had led them to experience the perplexing embarrassment.

Sorry I am to add that the most essential interests of the United States suffer from the same cause. The languishing State of public credit is notorious both in Europe and America. What an additional wound must be given to it when it is known that no plans can be made for the payment of our debts, without the Unanimous Consent of Nine States, and that only seven States have yet come forward with a representation. The disposition of our Western territory, An American Coinage, Commercial arrangements with European powers, particularly great Britain, and a variety of other matters are of immense and pressing importance, but for want of an additional number of States nothing can be done. I forbear to mention to your Excellency that even in private life where two persons agree to meet at a given time and place for the adjustment of their common concerns, the one who attends has a right to complain that he is not treated with common politeness by the other who breaks his appointment. I say nothing of unequal burden imposed on the States who are present. They incur a heavy expence to maintain their delegates, and this expence is rendered inefficient, because that out of the other six no two have come forward to concur with them in dispatching the public business. Least of all would I insinuate that the present States might be justified in resolving that as they had attended three months to no purpose they would in their turn relinquish the public service, and leave the other States should they come on, to suffer a similar mortification to what they have long experienced of meeting and adjourning from day to day without having it in their power to enter on the most important and pressing national business. The remissness of the States in keeping up a representation in Congress naturally tends to annihilate our Confederation. That once dis- January 31, 1786  solved our State establishments would be of Short duration. Anarchy, or intestine wars would follow till some future CÃ¦sar Seized our Liberties, or we would be the sport of European politics and perhaps parcelled out as appendages to their several Governments. In behalf of Congress in the Chair of which I at present have the honor to sit I beseech your Excellency by the regard you have for our federal Government to use your utmost endeavours to induce the delegates of your State to give their immediate attendance in Congress. I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Most Obedient and Most humble Servant. David Ramsay ""

 Dear Sir New York 1. Feb. 1786 Seven States only have been represented in congress since October, of consequence very few questions of national importance have been under the examination of this Assembly. The meetings of the Legislatures have probably detained many of the Delegates, but it is expected, that Ten States will, within a short period, be represented. There is some ground to expect that several of the Southern States will do what is right on the subject of the commercial powers of congress. I inclose a Report made by the Secretary, some weeks since in pursuance of an order of congress for that purpose.(1) It explains itself, and will give you true information upon several very important points. New York & Georgia are delinquent States relative to the Revenue system---;their Legislatures are both in Session, and it is greatly to be desired that they should comply with the impost plan, before they adjourn. Maryland will undoubtedly pass an Act granting the impost conformable to the Recommendation of congress of the 18th of April 1783. Their not having before passed such an Act, does not evidence any disinclination, because it is known to have happened from a mistake. February 2, 1786  I shall do myself the Honor to write to you by a private hand, who leaves this City in a few weeks for London---;the conveyance being secure I can then write with more freedom. Mr. Gerry is still here, although not in congress, he returns soon to Massachusetts with a most amiable Wife, whom he has married here.

I have not been unmindfull of the Debt, I owe the State for Duties, it has lain as a heavy weight on my Mind, & I have been steadily attempting to fall on some plan to discharge it, but hitherto all my endeavours have proved ineffectual. I was in hopes long before this to have been able to take up on Interest a sum of Money for this and other purposes. I also depended on receiving a large sum from Carolina but am disapointed in both.

I can truly say it is my most earnest wish to discharge this debt as soon as in my power.

 Dear Sir, New York 9th. Feby. 1786 Your Favour of the 26th Ult. has just come to me by Post---;& I find by the Post Mark that it was entd. in the Office at Phila. the 6th Instt. Writing now in the Midst of Business in Congress, you must not expect the particular Information I might otherwise run into on the Subjects you mention. Mr. Swanwick applied to me by Letter last Summer on the Subject of the altered Certificates he had purchased, & transmitted to me an Application to Congress, which I put in and prosecuted to a Reference, where it rests, no Report having been made as far as I now know or recollect.(1) I am inclined to think the Mode you mention (which I think is what Mr. Swanyck proposed) will be the lightest Mode of getting rid of the Business. But as yet we have not States enough to proceed in it. When Mr. Morris's Application came in last Summer it was delayed for farther Consideration & has not yet been acted on. I am apprehensive you have insisted on more than will be deemed proper on an Investigation---;a more dignified and liberal Line of conduct is expected from a State than from an Individual. I am inclined to think that whenever this Commutation shall be adjusted it will probably be nearly in the Ratio of the profit on the Specific Articles required from the State of Pennsa. taken complexly, & not by selecting either the most or the least profitable, or paying any Regard to Rations, & their component Parts. It may be said that it was the Duty of the State to have furnished the whole of the Articles required of her, the whole Demand being one entire Demand & the parts being apportioned to each other so as to consist with the Conveniency of the State on the one Hand, and Justice to the United States on the other. If therefore the State should attempt to avail herself of a little Profit by selecting a particular Article more advantageous than the rest; would it not be deemed a Departure from that Line of Honourable & Liberal Construction which ought to be preserved among States? But some important Papers are reading which demand my Attention. Let me however observe that I have long waited impatiently for a Relief. I left home at a Disadvantage to save the State from the Disgrace of remaining unrepresented, perceiving that my Colleagues could not be expected to attend immediately; but I was induced to believe that I might be relieved in 3, 4 or 5 weeks at farthest, that I might return to give some Attention to my own Affairs. I have since been flattered from Time to Time that one or the other of the Gentlemen  February 9, 1786  were coming; but I am yet chained to the Oar tho' the Detention is really very inconvenient to me. If a Relief does not shortly come, I fear I shall be obliged to commit the Honor of the State & embarrass the Business of Congress by leaving the State for a Time without a Vote. Out of 3 Gentlemen appointed I could not but hope that at least one of them would have followed us within less than the 3 Months which have elapsed since their Appointment. If my Convenience affords them no operating Motive, I should hope their Zeal in the service would have imposed some Obligation on them. I am Dr Sir, your most obedt. Servt., Cha. Pettit. ""

 Sir New York Feby. 11. 1786. When I had the honor three months since of proposals to communicate such interesting matters as our respective situations might afford or require I did not expect from a want of a fuller representation of the States in Congress that so little during that time would occur in the administration of federal affairs worth communicating. This inattention and delay in many of the States is not only a burden and expence to those who attend but ruinous in their consequences to the federal Government itself. It appears to me that a government formed as our[s] is on the broad basis of liberty and in the administration of which the rights of every man is considered as valuable to him and his assent to be had by himself or representative to every measure nothing but candor, political industry, and perseverance can effect the ends and purposes of it. On it's valuable principles the people at large are to be lead & persuaded to adopt measures and in many instances a great majority but men never will assent till they are informed, and convinced of the Justice & propriety of the measure or system proposed. Congress since the year 1780 have submitted to the consideration of the States several important systems & propositions to which they have asked their consent. The adoption of these are consider[ed] as essential to the preservation of the union and to enab[le] Cong. to administer the Govert. of the Confederacy for the benefit of the people and for obtaining the ends of its institutio[ns]. Most of them are adopted by a majority of the States yet none of them carried into effect. Some States are foun[d] who have objections to the one or the other of them. R Island, and N. York and Georgia to the impost sys- February 11, 1786  tem---;many of the States have objections to adopting the supplementary funds. N. Hampshire, R. Island, &c. object to the proposed alteration of the 8 art[icle] of the Confedn. Delaware, So. Carolina & Georgia have not granted Commercial powers to Congress agreeable to their recommendation of Apr. 30, 1784. It is to be presumed that the objections made by those States to adopting those federal measures are esteemed by them to be substantial and will be so considered till they are convinced of the Contrary. This Congress and the other States must do a task undoubtedly that requires attention & perseverence. But many other important matters, too many to name particularly, have lain long before Congress undetermined because some of the States do not keep up their representation. A government whose power is quite defective in two material points that wants power to regulate the Commerce of the union and to call forth its resources for the purpose of doing Justice that wants attention and, to a certain degree, energy in administering the powers it possesses must decline. If the States do not give more power to Congress the States must invent some means of obliging their delegates to attend that the powers at least may be exercised by that body timely and to effect which it possesses by the Confederation and the States must adopt and enforce the principle that Delegates are ameneable to Congress so long as they are continued in the delegation by their State. Perhaps it will be difficult to get another requisition thro Congress till certain public accounts are settled and the great inequalities occasioned by the late war in the advances of some States & delinquencies of others are put more in a way of being ratified. I hardly need mention to you I hope our General Court will readily adopt the late requisition of Cong. I take it for granted they see the expediency of doing it, we must yet pursue these ineffectual measures of requisitions which for 4 years past on an average have brought into the federal Treasury only about 600,000 Drs. a year and for the last year not more than 400,000. The people of this State especially the Dutch and their legislature reason on such narrow principles that it yet remains doubtful whether they will adopt the impost or any other federal system of revenue that the other States will approve of. But Massa. is considered as a federal State and her example has great influence on most of the States in the Union. If she should reject that requisition I doubt whether there are not many states who would think themselves excused in rejecting all federal measures. I wish our people to be possessed of an idea I am quite confirmed in since I have been here---;that the governt & state of Massa. is considered in the other States as very respectable and worthy of their imitation. The influence she had in bringing on the late important revolution the world yet Stand astonished at---;her conduct during the war and her conduct since the peace meet generall[y] the approbation of   thinking men. It is acknoledged that we have passed some imprudent laws & done injustice in some cases but that our systems of Government, of laws, of finance and modes of administring Justice are on the whole the best & have in the [main] strong and lasting features. The part she has held in federal measures, the public characters she has produced, the strength of her dicernment in most Cases and the disinterestedness with which her merchantile interest have adopted on public motives the impost systems & coml. regulations to their present disadvantage convince the other States that she reasons on extensive principles and sees her situation in an extended point of view. Another thing I want our people to bear in mind is that they stepped forward in the late revolution, had a principal hand in forming the Confederacy & bringing the U States into existence, that they had a large share in forming this body politic so far as it is formed and it's parts organised---;that we have a thousand Struggles yet to make before our complex machine of Government can be compleated and acquire a tone of energy sufft. for obtaining the ends intended. It must be cautiously mended in some parts & put into practise & operation in others. I think the [a]mendments proposed and adopted by some of the States are Judicious and ought to be steadily pursued. Other nations who have been so fortunate as to get good governments after the labor, experience and attempts of Centuries have thought themselves well off. Why should we despair because in this infant State of our national existence we find some perhaps material defects in our federal polity. We are at a loss how to govern our Commerce---;and how to call forth our resources for federal purposes. More than 4/5 of the Community have agreed that powers should be vested in Congress for these purposes in a certain degree. These are important subjects and if we attend to the progress of our ideas on them we shall conclude in favor of succeeding finally. Many years ago when the articles of confederation were under the consideration of the States it was proposed by the State of N. Jersey that Congr. should have full power to regulate trade internally & externally & to lay Duties of impost &c.(1) These propositions were then rejected by almost every State in the Union. Even their Delegates in Congress appeared pointedly against them---;but experience has faithfully taught us that we were then mistaken---;and we may ventur to affirm that more than Â¾ of the Community have changed their opinions---;since for more than 8/10 of the union have adopted the impost system---;and 9 states including the largest have granted to Cong Coml. powers as fully as they recomd. it to be done. Will not experience, the industry and influence of so large a part in time bring those who now stand out to adopt the same sentiments. I think if Cong., federal States & federal   men seriously persevere & pursue prudent and sound policy their success is certain. All the States have & will without difficulty adopt the impost except N. York---;All have and will give those Coml. powers without difficulty except So. Carolina, her member here say she will. Those two States may stand out perhaps some years but if the federal part of the Community pursue steadily their measures people will grow very uneasy with those States for it will be natural for people to impute nat[ura]l calamities to the failure of the measures which on the conviction of experience they now adopt---;and Clouds of Danger must gather over the heads of those States. Connecticut and N. Jersey who import thro. N. York complain loudly now that their articles of Consumption are taxed by N. York to her sole emolument. They will grow uneasy, make severe laws of retaliation and soon Connecticut, Vermont & N. Jersey must press N. York & annihilate her if she is not protected by the federal Govert.---;but the Condn. of that protection will be that she become a federal State. But I believe things will not go so far as to produce any great convulsion in the Government. Men soon will feel deeply interested in these points probably able writers on the subjects will appear and the people be convinced. It is sometimes said that the people of America at the Commencement of the late war had every thing at stake and had stronger motives to unite them & call forth their exertions. I much doubt it. The motives might Appear more plausible than the motives that federal men must urge for the purposes of amending & strengthening our Common Government---;but they must to every man of reflection appear less substantial. The U States have by the most manly & astonishing exertions raise themselves to a point of view that attracts the eyes & attention as it were of the whole world. They have taken rank among nations & formed connexions with many of them. We have ventur[ed] on our own political abilities and Struck out a form of Governt in some measure novel, a governt. but little understood by even our Allies---;viewed with curiosity by most nations & by some supposed to be chimerical---;our enemies in the B. Dominions are & probably will [be] very industrious in all parts of the world in making us appear chimerical, faithless, restless and ridiculous as a nation disunited and unable to support the system we have adopted. To dissolve our union under these circumstances, to become hostile to each other and a prey to the nations of Europe to me would be infinitely worth [i.e., worse] than annihilation. But this is not all we have a good government in the main to preserve one that is bottomd on excellent principles. ""

 Dear Sir,(1) New York. Feb. 11. 1786 I should have wrote to you before this had my situation furnished me with any thing worth communicating---;for want of a fuller representation of the States since I have been here but little business of Consequence has been done by Congr---;and but few interesting subjects brought forward or examined. We have of Course been confined to the dull but necessary business of examining the past doings of Congr. on their Journals and collecting information from the files of the several appendent offices. I have nearly the same opinion of our federal affairs I had when I left you at Boston---;except in this the federal Government may not be administred, even with so much attention and energy, even as I expected---;while in fact the machinery of it is of such a nature as to require in those who administer it the greatest candor, industry & perseverence. Many of the gentlemen in Congress from the Southward have recd. polite educations and possess abilities that at first appear brilliant and plausible but not very well adapted to the man[a]ging of our forms of Government. Their information in the essential parts of it does not appear to me to be suffy. extensive nor their ideas well and maturely digested. Their arguments, proportions and observations often at first appear plausible but they seldom bear that Strict inquiry they must & will undergo in Congress. The many amusements and multitude of social forms---;the unsubstantial etiquette of society in this City are not very favourable to the industry of men not naturally inclined to it. I hardly need tell you I hope our Genl. Court will pass the late requisition of Congr. and adopt it. I think they must be convinced of the necess. of doing it. I wish them to be possessed of this idea and what is to their honor---;that the example of Massa. has a very Great influence upon the other States---;if She should pass over or reject that requisition there are many States in the Union which would think themselves quite excused for doing nothing federal. The policy laws and conduct of each State is considered merely relatively and is esteemed good or bad as they appear in the comparison with those of the other Sta[tes]. Massa. is generally considered as the moving Cause in some measure in the late & great revolution---;the deliberate and firm manner in which She has conducted her policy, formed her laws & regulated her finances & administred Justice since the peace and the disinterested manner in which her merch[ant] interest have urged the impost systems &c---;& the part she has held in the fed. Governt, compared with most of the other States have given her a degree of respectability that every other State acknowledges. We are considered as a federal State  February 11, 1786  & expected in some degree to move among the first. But it may be asked shall we always bear the burden of labor and expence in conducting our Common affairs. My idea is that the large States, Massa., Connecticut, Pennsyla., Virginia &c, are disposed to unite and to mature and Strengthen government & will have it in their power to induce the small & at present delinqt. States of Georgia, N Carolina &c to alter their conduct, that those small States must soon feel their dependence on the union & see their danger and ruin in withholding the assistance. Be kind enough Sir to give my respects to Mr. Merrick---;to Mrs. Archebold & the family & our particular freinds whom you will see in Boston where I expect this will find you.

It has been referred to the Board of Treasury who have reported a Resolution to authorize them to appoint Mr. Milligan or such other Person as they  February 11, 1786  may think proper on the Part of the U.S. to settle the Commutation with such Person as may be appointed on the Part of the State. I have avoided calling it up for a Decision, because I wish it to be settled by Compromise.(1) If the Principles were agreed upon I suppose the Calculation would not be difficult; and as far as I understand the Matter the Principles suggested in my last Letter are such as I should recommend. I presume you have frequent Opportunities to Carlisle & therefore trouble you with the inclosed Letter to forward thither. I am, Dr. Sir, your most hume Servant, Chas Pettit ""

 Dear Sir,(1) New York. Feb. 13. 1786. Since my arrival here I have taken an opportunity to converse with the Secretary at war respecting the powder you mentioned to me being at Springfield in a perishable situation---;&c. He tells me great pains have been taken to try the quality of it, to dry, Cleanse & keep it in order, and that from a late examination of it it is found to be, with sifting some parts of it, in good order, and will retain it's strength. As to other affairs here I have been waiting for some interesting business to be compleated by Congress that I might have something to communicate to my friends worth their attention---;but for want of a fuller representation Congress has compleated, or even brought forward or examined but very little business---;daily occurrences we have but few---;federal affairs appear nearly as I expected to find them. Gentlemen who have been, since the peace, in our Legislature & attended to the affairs of the Union, I believe have in general a pretty Just idea of them; whence I make but few general observations about them, to my friends in that situation. However there is as little energy and perseverence in administering the federal government as I expected. The States must  February 13, 1786  find means to compel their members to attend. The non attendance of some States not only weakens the government by rendering it dilatory and inefficient in it's administration---;but throws an unequal expence on those States which do attend. The policy of our State is extensive, manly & liberal and her administration Just, wise and excellent compared with many of the other States particularly this. How far the States have adopted the Continental impost System, the proposed alteration of the 8th Art. of the Confederation, and have vested Congress with commercial powers, you will see by official papers transmitted to our Legislature.(2) They must all I think if properly pursued be finally adopted.

 My Dear General New York 16th Feby. [17]86  You desired to hear from me now and then, when I left Virginia. I obey your wishes with pleasure, & must assure you, that I continue to feel the same unabating zeal to administer to your happiness, which my public duty formerly commanded from me. I wish that my commu- February 16, 1786  nications may be always agreable; I apprehend your solicitude for the honor & prosperity of a nation formed under your auspices will illy relish intelligence ominous of its destruction. But so circumstanced is the fOEderal government, that its death cannot be very far distant, unless immediate and adequate exertions are made by the several states. The period is hurrying on, when no longer delay can be permitted. The late returns from the continental receivers in the different states prove unanimity in one point among the members of the Union---;no money. Congress impressed with the lamentable effects which await the United States from their adherence to Temporary and disunited exertions, again have addressed the states. I enclose it.(1) If success attends, we may divert the evils which menace our existence & may still enjoy that happiness which we so arduously contended for. But should the same supineness continue in our councils, jealousy instead of patriotism direct the measures of our governments, consequences most distressing must certainly ensue. Part of the principal of our foreign loans is due next year, & no certain means yet devized to pay even the interest. Our agents have arrived in Morrocco, and Algiers, & we have some hopes that their negotiations may be successful. It is very doubtful how our commissioners may succeed with the indians. We have too much reason to fear a war, which among other evils will encrease our finance embarrassments. People here are very inquisitive about the progress of the potomack navigation. The moment that business wears the prospect of certainty, rich emigrants from all the eastern states will flock to our towns. The assembly of this state are in session, & will emit 200,000Â£ paper. They are violent enemys to the impost, & I fear even the impending and approaching dangers to the existence of the Union will not move them.

 Sir New York Feby 19. 1786. I enclose to you the proceedings of Congress on an important Sub- February 19, 1786  ject for your perusal.(1) These are the productions of the reports and inquiries of several Committees, and much enquiry in Congress, and I believe every word is finally Seduced to the Standard of truth strictly. These measures were adopted at this time particularly to induce the Legislature of New York, R. Island and Georgia, now in Session, to adopt the general impost. The inclosed paper will give you a pretty just idea of the State of our finances, and shew the necessity of pursuing some amendments in our federal polity, with attention and industry. These papers will be officially sent to our General Court(2)---;you will see they are requested in Consequence thereof to adopt the Supplementary funds a part of the revenue system of Apr. 18, 1783, and at present so inseparable a part, that no part of that system can be carried into effect till the whole is adopted. Appearances in this state, as to the adoption of the General impost, are not very favourable. This State is pursuing a policy rather contracted, unfederal, and not agreeable to the other States, of which I think, she will severely repent at some future period. She is about issuing paper money, assuming a part of the Continental Domestic debt, for making distinctions between her own Citizens and those of other States---;and between Commutation, & other Securities &c. Whether our State ought to adopt the supplementary funds of the revenue System of Apr. 18, 1783 She will consider---;I am inclined to think, that it would be for the interest of Massachusetts, that all the States should adopt them. The proceeds of these funds and the general impost will not exceed the purposes for which they are designed---;the discharging of the interest, and gradual discharge of the principal of the national debt. As the impost may operate more fully on the Commercial States, the supplementary funds are situated to operate equally on all, and as the mode of collecting them when they shall be adopted will be certain they may be equally certain and efficient in their operations and productions. But there are at present several delinquent States in the Union, which contribute but very little to the support of federal measures. They are and have been always led and drove by Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and some of the great States much to their trouble and prejudice, and it may be much for the interest of the States who move in federal measures, to have some efficient system of revenue adopted that will afford effectual means of supplying the Common Treasury---;and by which these delinquent States may be held more effectually to contribute their proportion. Some States will withhold their aid till the bonds of the Union are Strengthened, and the federal Government shall become more energetic in its adminstration and fixed in it's principles. I need hardly mention to You, Sir, I hope our General Court will adopt the late requisition, I know of nothing that would shock the Union more than her rejecting it would. She is considered as a federal   State and respectable not only for her extent, but for her wisdom, her abilities, her Steady, and wise policy compared with the other States, the example of her disinterested conduct in federal affairs has great influence on them---;and I wish also the number of our Inhabitants to be forwarded to Congress this Session of the General Court. I believe we have yet many struggles to make to preserve our Union and to put the Confederacy on a respectable footing. The principles of it are certainly good, but it is combined, and it's administration require much attention, perseverence and industry, and clearly ought to be amended in two or three instances. All the States have vested Commercial powers in Congress agreeable to their resolve of Apr. 30th, 1784 except Delaware, South Carolina, and Georgia and it is said they will do it---;and in this business we probably shall find less difficulty in obtaining the Object in veiw than in matters of finance. Many other important matters lie before Congress undetermined for want of a fuller representation of the States, or in which further measures should be taken. Congress since I arrived here has done but little business on this account, and therefore we have had but very little worth communicating to our friends---;this delinquency in some of the states not only creates an unequal expence to those which attend, but is very injurious to the union. About the 1st of Decr. Congress received an answer from Mr. Hancock accepting the chair of Congress. I believe that Congress as such, or any member of it in N. York have not heard from him since.  With much esteem and respect, Your Humble Servant, N Dane P.S. I take the liberty to inclose to your Care a letter to Mr. Ely supposing it will find him in Boston---;by handing it to him you will greatly oblige me.(3) ""

 Dr Sir New York Feby. 23d. 1786. The affairs of the Union do not bear such an aspect as you or I can be pleased with. Our foreign creditors begin to be very serious in their applications respecting the provisions necessary for their reimbursement & the prospect of gaining the impost or any other permanent system of revenue to answer those demands appears to be distant. Congress have lately been considering the Impost & have agreed upon an address to the States on that subject (which you have undoubtedly seen before now).(1) This is more particularly designed for New York whose Legislature is now in Session. February 23, 1786  But from what I learn there is very little prospect of their compliance. They appear so farr as I am able to judge the most of them to be men of very narrow and partial views---;and as they have now an Impost for State purposes which producd them on the last settelment with their Collector, the sum of eighty thousand pounds this Currency---;one half of which is raised from the Citizens of Connecticut & New Jersey. They are very unwilling to give up---;and on the other hand the two latter S[tates] complain most loudly of the Conduct of N York. There is good reason to suppose that they will never agreed to Tax themselves on another requisition of Congress after the present untill N York does th[em] justice in this respect. The failure of a compliance with the requisitions you will easily see works a dissolution of the federal Government & with that an end to all our National importance & happiness. I hope you will therefore take care and procure a compliance on the part of Massachusetts with the present requisition. The Delegates have no power to take the necessary measures for constituting the Federal Court;(2) If I am not mistaken a resolution on that subject passed the General Court the last Session. If so I wish you to se[e] that it is sent forward, & if it did not pass last Session do let it be brought before the Court that they may come to some determination on the business---;as New York continue to sell the best Lands in those parts it will in a little Time be an object of no importance wither we recover or not---;as people are fast setteling the Lands & it will be very difficult to remove them; or to make them repurchas. Ten States have complied with the recommendation of Congress respecting their being impowerd. partially to regulate the trade of the Union. The noncompl[y]ing States are Deleware, South Carolina & Georgia. There is now before Congress a report of a Committe to call upon those States for their compliance(3) . . . & there is good reason to suppose they will comply---;but the powers requestd are not compleatly addequate to the purpose. The State of Virginia seem to be sensible of this & have appointed a Committe to meet the other States in Convention to consider the business(4)---;as the Eastern States are particularly interested in having an effecient power in Congress on this head. I hope you will appoint a Committe to meet them. Wither their letter comes in form before you rise or not---;more especially as the overture comes from a Souther State. We have Men among us who have sufficient Commercial knowledge, but are some what antifederal in their opinions---;you will therefore judge how necessary it is to send Men of good Federal ideas. & that if they are not so they may overthrow the whole plan. I wish you to favour me with a Line on State politic & wither you have compleated the valuation & what are the proportions of Boston & Charles Town. Please to inform me what is   the State of Mr. Hancocks health & the prospect of his coming forward.

 Dr Sir New York March 1st. 1786 Since my last, Congress has been furnished through the Board of Treasury with several resolutions passed by the House of Representatives of the State of New Jersey in which they declare they will not pass a Tax Law in consequence of & in conformity to the last requisitions of Congress.(1) One of the principal reasons on which they rely for a Justification of their conduct is---; that the State of New York by their Impost Laws draws from them a large sum of money which enures wholly to the credit of N York---;& therefore that they will not grant any money upon requisition untill the Impost becomes general & is paid into the federal Treasury. N Jersey undoubtedly has great cause of complaint against NY---;but by no means sufficient to justify the above resolutions---;which are in fact a dissolution of the Union. Congress are much alarmed and have sent an express to Tren Town for an attested copy of the resolution---; and will enter very seriously into the subject. . . .but I foresee they will be embarrased for want of a full representation (there being now only seven States on the floor New Jersey included). Every measure in the Power of Congress has been taken to procure a representation from all the States---;but hitherto without effect. It is indeed a great inconvenience to the Union that the smallest States have equal weight in Congress with the largest . . . and they are allso very careless about keeping up their representation by which neglect---;Congress for four months  March 1, 1786  have not been able to consider any one Question of a pecuniary nature & the public business in consequence is suffering extreamly indeed Congress is but the shadow of a Government. I beg you would exert yourself to procure a compliance with the requisition on the part of Massachusetts as their non compliance will through all things into confusion & Massa. will share part of the blame with NJ---;& they should consider that they run no great risque in a compliance, for if the State of NJ adheres to their present temper & other States follow their example---;the Confederation is dissolved & Massachusetts will then take care of themselves & stop the payment, which they will have time to do, as their will be no payments before the May Session. The most serious consiquence may be expected from our foreign creditors. . .the application on that head are of such a nature as to make deep impressions with Congress. Congress have now before them a Motion for calling a Convention of the States to consider wither they will establish a federal Government with powers adequate to the necessities & happiness of the Union(2)---;but the NJ affair has suspended every other consideration for the present. I wish Massts could se[e] their way clear to request Congress to call a Convention---;it would very much strengthen the hands of Congress---;if the Court should like the idea they might express their sence in such general terms as to preclude much debate or loss of time. I hope you will write me an account of State politics & when we are to expect Mr. Hancock. Want of time forbids my enlarging further than to ad that I am Your Humble Servant &c, Nath Gorham ""

 Sir, Office of Secretary of Congress, March 1t. 1786. Having occasion to write to you for the purpose of forwarding a resolution of Congress expressive of their sense of the ability, fidelity and attention of the Judges of the Court of Appeals,(1) I cannot omit the opportunity of requesting your assistance in a matter that concerns the honor of your State and the welfare of the Union. Since the beginning of November last your State has been unrepresented in Congress. I have written frequently to the president, but whether my Letters have failed to reach him or from his living out of the way of the  March 1, 1786  post his answers have miscarried or from some other cause I know not,(2) I have never received an answer to any of my Letters. The present situation of public Affairs requires a full representation in Congress of all the States, I must therefore request you would exert your influence in urging the attendance of your Delegates as speedily as possible. I have further to observe that Congress by an Act of the 27th May last requested \""The Legislatures of the several States to cause the services of the Agents appointed for the purpose of receiving and distributing the Certificates of the pay master Genl. on a final settlement of the balances due to the Officers and Soldiers of their respective lines, to be examined and to make them such allowance as they may think them entitled to and charge the same to the United States.\""(3) On the 7 June 1785 they passed an Act recommending to the several States to make provision for Officers, Soldiers or Seamen who have been disabled in the service of the United States in a manner pointed out in the Act;(4) and by an Act of the 27th July 1785 they directed the Secretary of Congress to apply to the Executives of the several States for thirteen Copies of the Legislative Acts thereof since the 1t September 1774,(5) one Copy of which to be retained for the use of Congress and one set to be delivered to the Delegates of each State (except the State whose acts were delivered) for the use of the Legislature thereof; and at the same time they directed the Secretary to procure and distribute in the same way the Acts which might thereafter be passed, to the end that every State being thus informed may have the fullest confidence in the other States and derive the advantages which may result from the joint wisdom of the whole. On the 27th September 1785 they made a requisition on the States for the payment of the interest of the foreign and domestic debt and for the services of that year.(6) On the 30th September They passed an Act regulating the Office of the Commissioners of the Continental Loan Offices in the several States making it part of their duty to receive the Monies arising from Continental taxes in their respective States and to pay the interest due from the United States in the said States respectively;(7) and in the said Act recommended to the Legislatures of the several States to direct their Treasurers to transmit to the Board of Treasury a Monthly abstract of all monies paid on account of the respective States to the Commissioners of the Continental Loan Offices distinguishing the dates and amounts of the payments and the sums paid in actual money from those in interest Certificates. And on the 12 October 1785 they passed a resolution earnestly calling on the States to compleat without delay the whole of their quotas(8) of the requisitions of 4 September 1782 & 27th & 28th April 1784, and requiring such of the States as were deficient in paying their respective quotas of the interest of the domestic debt pursuant to the said requisitions to collect and pay into the public Treasury the amount of   such deficiencies either in Certificates to be issued pursuant to the requisition of the 27th September for payment of the said interest, or in specie to be applied to the redemption of such Certificates; providing nevertheless that the sum to be paid into the Treasury in Interest Certificates as part of the requisition of April 1784 should not at any time exceed the proportion of facilities to be paid agreeably to that requisition. These several Acts I transmitted to the president; but have received no answer, I have therefore to request the favour of you, to use your endeavours that I may have an answer to these several transmissions. The best answer will be the Acts of the Legislature complying with the several recommendations, Acts and requisitions. It is my earnest wish therefore that you would exert your interest and abilities, both which I know are great in prevailing with the Legislature to pass laws as speedily as possible in compliance and conformity with those several Acts if they have not already done it and then to use your interest in having them forwarded that I may make report thereof to Congress. I shall be still further obliged if with these laws you can have the thirteen Copies sent on which are mentioned in the Act of 27 July. I should not be thus troublesome were I not fully convinced of your zeal in the cause of liberty and your ardent desire to preserve the honor and promote the happiness of this infant Commonwealth. This I hope will be my apology. I am with sincere respect, Yours &c. C.T. ""

 Sir, (Circular) Office of Secretary of Congress, March 1st. 1786. As many States in the Union continued to be unrepresented in Congress or to be represented by only two Members notwithstanding the many recommendations of Congress for remedying these defects particularly those of 1 November 1783 and the 19th of April 1784 and as from the want of a compleat representation the great interests of the Union had frequently been and continued to be neglected or delayed, and the Confederation itself or the administration thereof  March 2, 1786  might be considered as the cause of evils which solely resulted from an incompleat representation, Congress, judging it incumbent on them to prevent opinions so derogatory to their honor and so dangerous to the public welfare, did on the 17th August last pass a resolve whereby it became the duty of the Secretary of Congress once in every Month to transmit to the Legislatures of the respective States a list of the States represented and of those unrepresented in Congress and of the Members from each State.(1) The object of this resolution was that effectual measures might from time to time be taken by such States as were unrepresented or represented only by two Members, to remedy these defects. In the execution of this duty I have had the honor every month since of transmitting to Your Excellency a Monthly statement of the representation of the States in Congress to be laid before your Legislature.(2) The statement which accompanies this and which I have to request the favour of your Excellency to communicate to the Legislature is for the month of February last.(3) By this and the three other statements transmitted since the meeting of Congress on the first Monday in November last your Excellency and the Legislature will see that there has not been for a single day a number of States assembled sufficient to proceed on the great business of the Union; indeed for half the time not a number sufficient to do more than adjourn from day to day.

 My dear Friend New York 5th March 1786. What reason has prevented your writing to me? I am not conscious of having forefeited your good esteem, and am utterly at a loss why you neglect me. I will write to you with the same familiarity that I formerly have done. Our domestic affairs are greatly embarrassed, the subject of Revenue is intricate even in the simplest forms of Government; but complex as our federal Government is, all questions of Revenue are complicated in the highest degree. A late act of congress stating some of their money engagements,(1) and their means of complying with them, is a plain statement, and refers to the determination of the states a question infinitely important to the existence of the confederacy. The doctrine of expedients has brought us thus far; but expedients serve only to postpone, and not to remove, the evils which for a time they alleviate; they are therefore improper and impolitic in a republic, where the people determine on all governmental Acts, and consequently ought not only to know, but also to feel, every evil which surrounds them. A false delicacy has sometimes governed the public acts of Congress; an apprehension has been formerly entertained that foreigners would not sufficiently honor & esteem us, if they knew our real situation. This has been a mistaken policy. America was respectable in Arms, she was admired. But peace, so far from advancing her fame, has diminished her former Reputation; and there are few nations whose public credit is at so low an Ebb as our's---;the only method of repossessing what we have lost, is by giving true information to the people, and submitting to their Judgement the promotion & establishment of their own Glory and Honor. But probably you will say that you care little about these Reveries, and inform me that you have long since been tired of them. You have not given me such information heretofore---;I will not however commit myself farther. I am authorised to affirm that I am with the purest esteem & Regard, Your sincere & obliged Friend, Rufus King ""

I recd. & would observe in answer to the first part of it that the Board of Treasury have (by order) laid before Congress a plan for expediting the set[tle]m[ent] of the public Accts by which plan four or five thousand dollars will be Annually saved(1) ---;and Mr. Pennel will consequently be discharged,(2) and some other Person employed for a short time to bring the accts. in that quarter to a close, but the great inattention & negligence of the States with regard to their representation renders it impossible for Congress to pass upon this report & various other matters in which the wellfare of the Union is deeply interested---;it being a mony matter. There being only seven States represented---;R Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina & Georgia being absent---;indeed the principle of the confederat[ion] as it respects representation & the mode of voting is calculated to encourage delinquency. There is no reason that RI, Delr. & Georgia should have equal weight in the federal councills with Massa., Pensa. & Virginia---; and if the representation had been apportiond according to numbers or property---;and a suitable quorum established & the major vote to determine questions---;this inattention would not exist. But as unanimity is now necessary upon the most trivial questions we feel all the inconveniencies of the liberum Veto of a Polish Diet. The applications from our foreign creditors are of such a nature as to make a deep impression with Congress & they have thought it their duty again to call the consideration of the States to the subject of an Impost---;more especially as the situation of N York enables them so to Tax their Neighbours of Connet. & N Jersey as to create such a temper in those States as will greatly weaken if not destroy the Union. The Assembly of N Jersey have lately entered into a resolution that they will not comply with the last or any future requisition of Congress untill N. York gives up their Impost or applys it for the general purposes of the Union.(3) Indeed there is nothing but the restraining hand of Congress (weak as it is) that prevents NJ and Conne. from entering the lists very seriously with NY & blood shed would very quickly be the consequence---;but however NJ may suffer by her paying taxes for N York her refusal to comply with the requisition is unjus[ti]fiable---;and unless she re[s]cinds her resolution must work the end of all federal Government. Congress sent an express to demand an attested copy of the resolution---;he returned with it last night---;tomorrow it will be very seriously considered---; but as NJ is one of the seven States now on the floor they may perhaps embarrass Congress in their proceedings. They have however wrote in the most pressing manner for the attendance of the  March 7, 1786  delinquent States. Congress yesterday agreed on another application to the States on the subject of Commerce(4)---;it is plain from the whole tenor of Mr. Adams's Letters that unless Congress possess the power of restricting the British trade there is no probability of his being able to do any thing to purpose with that Court. I will endeavor to as farr as I am able to have an equitable adjustment of your account. We do not get any acct. of the Presidents state of health. We are therefore intirely at a loss when to expect him. Your Son Mr. Warren being returnd to Boston I inclose some letters which I recd under cover for him.

13656,dg023164,1786,Charles Pinckney s Speech to,"""Charles Pinckney's Speech to
 the New Jersey Assembly [March 13, 1786](1) Mr. Speaker, The United States in Congress assembled being informed that this house had, on the 20th ultimo, resolved, that they could not consistently with their duty to their constituents assent to the requisition of September last for federal supplies, they have conceived it incumbent on them, as guardians of the general rights and interests of the confederacy, by a deputation of their own body, a measure they never adopt but upon the most important occasions, to present to the view of the state of New-Jersey, the absolute necessity there is in the several states to a strict and punctual compliance with the requisitions of Congress, and the fatal consequences which must inevitably attend an adherence to the present determination of the assembly.  When these states united, convinced of the inability of each to support a separate system, and that on their union depended their protection and existence, policy as well as prudence dictated the necessity of forming one efficient government, which, while it protected and secured the whole, left to the several states those rights of internal  March 13, 1786  sovereignty it was not necessary to delegate, and which could be exercised without injury to the federal authority. In them were placed all those essential powers which constitute a nation. Such are the exclusive rights of peace and war---;of sending and receiving embassies---;of forming treaties and alliances---;and equipping and raising fleets and armies. To them also were delegated the power of obtaining loans on the faith of the United States, and of apportioning to the several members of the union, their quotas of the publick expences. The mode established by the confederation for ascertaining the quota of each was at that time supposed equal and practicable. Experience, however, has proved the contrary, and the states, though frequently urged, having neglected to furnish returns of the value of their lands, and the buildings and improvements thereon, agreeably to the article, Congress were induced to recommend an alteration of it. This has been under reference for some time---;ten of the states have complied, and some of them furnished the returns of their numbers in conformity to the recommendation. New-Jersey has done both. It is the best information Congress have been able to obtain of the comparative strength and resources of the different states, and the only one on which they could properly found those requisitions the services and supplies of the federal government render necessary.  The states having thus, by their voluntary act, formed one government as essential to the protection of the whole, and placed in one controling power the administration of its concerns, and to whom they were to look up for support, each state is bound according to its abilities to furnish a proportion of the expences, and the whole are jointly and severally pledged for the publick engagements, foreign and domestic. The mode prescribed by the confederation being impracticable, it follows that the proportions are to be quotaed agreeably to the best lights in the possession of the union; for, while the government exists, its members are bound to contribute to its maintenance; and New-Jersey having not only assented to the mode by which she is rated, but furnished the returns on which the assessment could be made with exactness; she certainly cannot with propriety complain of bearing an undue proportion; nor will she, I trust, upon serious reflection, suppose she can, consistently with her duty to the union, refuse the requisition.(2) If she has been over-rated, let her substantiate it in evidence to Congress, and she will always find that body inclined to do her the completest justice. Nay more, if she conceives herself oppressed under the present confederation, let her, through her delegates in Congress, state to them the oppressions she complains of, and urge the calling of a general convention of the states for the purpose of increasing the powers of the federal government, and rendering it more adequate to the ends for which it was instituted. In this constitu-  tional mode of application there can be no doubt of her meeting with all the support and attention she can wish. Had her resentment, in concert with Connecticut, been pointed against New-York, and the means in their power by duties, and by opening a free port immediately opposite their city, been exerted to oblige that state to do them justice, so far from injuring, she would have received the countenance of every federal state in the union. But her present conduct, in refusing the constitutional requisition of Congress, and involving the states who were friendly to her interests in the general confusion that must now ensue, so far from obtaining the ends she proposes, will divert the attention of the union from New-York, and from that system which could alone relieve the non- importing states, and apply it wholly to her. For, with what propriety could compulsory means be used against a state, for not assenting to a measure on which we confess she had a right to deliberate, when we suffer another in silence and with impunity to refuse a requisition she is constitutionally bound to comply with? It will be proper here to remark, that the present requisition is founded upon more advantageous principles than any hitherto adopted, so far as it respects the eight northern states, whose citizens probably hold more than three-fourths of the whole certificate debt of the United States---;for of the 11,400,485 dollars, being the total specie value of the loan-office debt, 9,998,880 dollars being more than seven-eighths of the whole were loaned in the seven eastern states. The state of New-Jersey is in proportion a considerable creditor of the union. How far therefore it becomes her to support the measures of Congress in providing for the interest of this debt, and in asserting its credit, is left to the good sense of the house to determine. The several requisitions of September 1782, April 1784, and September 1785, which have been just stated to the house, and their principles fully explained, obviate every objection with respect to a larger number of certificates being issued than are provided for, and prove that certificates will not issue from the loan- offices to a greater amount than the interest of the domestic debt to December 1784. If the states comply with the several requisitions, the funds on which the interest certificates depend will be co-extensive with them, and the certificates all be sunk and called in by the taxes levied by the states. As to the commutation to the army, it is only necessary to remark, that the late Congress found an act of a former Congress finally adopted upon the subject, and the national faith pledged to carry it into effect. The certificates are so exchanged that it would be impossible now, even if it was proper, to make any discrimination between them and the other publick securities. To the army, however, I am of opinion their country are bound by the strongest ties of gratitude and affection, and if it could be ever admissible to make any dis-  tinctions between the public creditors they certainly posess the purest claims to preference and attention. That the commercial states are indebted to the joint efforts of the whole for the advantages they enjoy, will be readily admitted. Upon these principles Congress have again, by the address of the 15th of February last, which you have just heard read, presented the revenue system to the view of those states that have not complied.(3) [In once more bringing this recommendation before them, they have stated that there will be due, in the course of the next year, a part of the principal of two of the foreign loans, and afterwards a part of the other loans, agreeably to the stipulations of the same, to be paid annually, by instalments, until the whole is extinguished---;which must, until that event, proportionably increase the sums called for; that the whole of the domestic debt is not yet liquidated, and that its amount will probably be enlarged beyond its former estimate---;that the treaties necessary for the protection of our commerce from the piratical states of Barbary---;the safety of our frontiers from the savages---;and the establishment of magazines in different parts of the union---;may perhaps increase the estimate of the military department; and that the supplies, for federal purposes, will probably be greater than they have hitherto been; that they contemplate with pleasure the prospect of extinguishing a part of the domestic debt by the sales of western territory---;but that, as a considerable time must intervene before it can be surveyed and disposed of, no immediate aid can be drawn from this source; and that since a sufficient sum for the exigencies of government, and the interest due on the public debt, was not to be expected from any of the means authorised by the confederation it follows, that unless some more efficient and productive fund could be discovered, we should soon be exposed to the greatest national difficulties and disgrace. While it is in the power of the states to prevent these incumbrances, and to do justice to their creditors, congress will certainly continue to urge them to it. They have again presented to their view, the system which has been so long under reference to their legislatures, as the only one calculated to assert the credit and relieve the distresses of the union. In examining the conduct of the states, they will find that all, except New York and Georgia, have, in some degree, though perhaps not effectually, complied with the first part of the recommendation for investing the united states with the power of levying the impost. The assent of so large a majority of the states, including some of the most important in commercial and other resources, shews that they were impressed with the necessity and propriety of its motives. Convinced of the importance of the federal government, and that on its existence their political welfare and consequence must depend, they have   liberally dedicated to its support, a part of the advantages derived from its establishment: nor have they considered this as more than justice to the citizens of those states whose situation renders them dependent upon their imports for supplies---;that they had therefore wisely determined to make the welfare of the union their first object, reflecting that in all federal regulations something must be yielded to aid the whole; and that those who may expect support, must in their turn be ready to afford it. How far their example may induce the legislatures of those states to adopt the same liberal conduct, is now left to themselves to decide. We still, however, trust that these states will be not less disposed to give vigour and efficacy to a government upon which all must eventually depend for the protection and security of the invaluable blessings they enjoy.]  Georgia, it is said, has acceded---;New-York is now deliberating upon it---;and it is hoped that a measure so just in itself, and so necessary at this time to strengthen the federal credit, will meet with their concurrence---;if not, we reflect with pleasure, that a great majority of the most important states in the union have, upon every occasion, by their acts and ready compliances with the recommendation of Congress, manifested so warm and zealous an affection to the federal compact, as leaves no doubt of a system soon being formed which will in its operation relieve every embarrassment and inequality complained of. But this will altogether depend upon the concerted measures of such states as are friendly to the system. By divisions upon the subject of the requisition, you not only defeat and prevent the measures of Congress, for obtaining this desirable end, but furnish the non-complying states with new and forcible arguments against it(4)---;[arguments founded on the impropriety of investing the exercise of important powers to a government so feebly and injudiciously constructed, as to be not only incapable of executing those they at present possess, but to be a very unsafe deposit of such further authorities as are required by the system under their consideration. The danger, they contend, arises from the inequality of representation, and the want of a proper distribution of the powers of government. Be assured, that whenever they have it in their power, they will attempt this reform.] Perhaps I do not go too far in asserting, that a perseverance in your refusal must inevitably tend to dissolve those ties which bind us as a nation. For, should the other states suspend their supplies to the common treasury, until New- Jersey complies with the requisition, the existence of the federal government must be endangered---;probably cease.(5)  [It is certainly more the interest of the small, than it can be of the large states, to preserve the confederation upon its present principles. We are aware of the necessity which compelled the latter to confederate upon terms allowing each state an equal vote in the national coun-  cils. Had the system been formed in a time of peace---;when no common danger pressed---;when deliberation was unaccompanied with apprehension, and the large states preferred conceding the point of proportionable representation, however important, to the greater evil of being again reduced to the power of Great Britain---;can it be thought that any union would have been formed upon principles so unequal and oppressive as the present? Let us for a moment suppose the confederation dissolved, and an assembly of the states convened for the purpose of adopting a system calculated to render the general government firm and energetic---;is it not to be reasonably expected, that the large states would contend and insist upon a greater influence than they at present possess? Would they again consent to unite upon principles which should allow states not contributing a twelfth part of their quotas to the public expences, an equal vote with themselves! It is not even to be hoped. It ought, therefore, to appear exceedingly important to the small states to maintain a system so advantageous to their particular interests, when they reflect that in the event of another confederation, they cannot expect to be placed in a situation, to which they are neither entitled by common justice, or an equal attention to the rights of the other members of the union. Though our present disorders must be attributed, in the first instance, to the weakness and inefficacy of the general government, it must still be confessed they have been precipitated by the refractory and inattentive conduct of the states; most of whom have neglected altogether the performance of their federal duties; and, whenever their state policy or interests prompted, used their retained rights to the injury and disgrace of the federal head. Be assured, sir, the united states can have no danger so much to dread as that of disunion: nor has the federal government, when properly formed, any thing to fear, but from the licentiousness of its members. We have no hereditary monarchy, or nobles with all their train of influence and corruption, to contend with; nor is it possible to form a federal aristocracy. Parties may, for a time, prevail in the states: but the establishment of an aristocratic influence in the councils of the union, is remote and doubtful. It is the anarchy, if I may use the term, or rather worse than anarchy, of a pure democracy which I fear---;where the laws lose their respect, and the magistrates their authority; where no permanent security is given to the property and privileges of the citizens; and no measures pursued, but such as suit the temporary interest and convenience of the prevailing parties, I cannot figure to myself a government more truly degrading; and yet such has been the fate of all the ancient, and will, without great care, be probably the fate of all the modern republics. The progress has been regular---;from order to licentiousness---;from licentiousness to anarchy---;and from thence to despotism. If we re-  view the confederacies of Greece, we shall find, that each in their turn became a prey to the turbulence of their own members, who, refusing to obey the federal head, and, upon all occasions, insulting and opposing its authority, afforded an opportunity to foreign powers to interfere and subvert them. There is not an example, in history, of a confederacy being enslaved or ruined by the invasions of the supreme authority; nor is it possible: for depending, as it must, upon the members for support and maintenance, it will always be in their power to check and prevent its injuring them.] To this house, therefore, an application is now made to rescind their act, as one pregnant with the most alarming evils. The situation of our commerce languishing under the most ruinous and opprobrious restraints, and which nothing but a wise and well-concerted system of federal policy can support, has for some time demanded our most serious attention---;to relieve it from its present embarrassments---;to place it upon terms advantageous to our own citizens---;and rescue it from the predatory invasions of the Barbary States. The hostile conduct of the savages on our frontiers---;the unexampled behaviour of our late enemy, in holding our posts contrary to the treaty, bridling the country, and depriving us of the advantages which would otherwise arise from it---;and above all, that due and sacred regard which a nation ought ever to pay to her engagements as the only solid basis of her honour and prosperity, at this time particularly call for our strenous and united exertions. To these important considerations all motives of state-policy should yield. We should recollect that the grievances and inequalities particular states may complain of can only be relieved by the timely and judicious interposition of the federal authority, and that this once dissolved, the interests of the lesser states may not only be oppressed, but become a prey to the more important, and such a scene of intestine discord and confusion ensue, as every friend to the peace and liberties of his country must wish to avert. A temptation will be offered to the great maritime powers of Europe to interfere in our politics, and this country, which, under a wise and liberal system might be the happiest, become one of the most miserable and contemptible in existence. For these and a variety of other reasons which might easily be adduced, I am hopeful the house will rescind their resolution, and pass the requisition. If they do not---;in what other light can the United States view their conduct, than in that of an infraction of the confederation, and a solemn recession of this state from its union and protection? A measure I am convinced they could not have had in the most distant contemplation. We have ever viewed this state in point of services and exertions as one of the most deserving in the union, and trust that upon this occasion she will evince that attachment to the federal system---;we are sure she bears it.  As the measures of Congress must in a great degree depend upon the determination of the house either to rescind or adhere to their late resolution, and as the public anxiety is exceedingly raised, we are to request your honourable body to give us an answer as soon as the importance of the subject will possibly admit.(6) Mr. Pinckney used a number of other arguments, which we have not been able to obtain, explaining and enforcing the principles of the requisition---;proving that it was not intended as a substitute for, or could by any means be construed to interfere with the revenue system of April 18, 1783---;stating the consequences which must result from a refusal of it, and urging the house to comply with the expectations of Congress in passing it. Mr. Gorham and Mr. Grayson followed Mr. Pinckney, and, by a variety of arguments in a very able and pointed manner, proved the impolicy of New-Jersey's refusing the requisition, it being clearly her interest to support the confederation. The latter gentleman,(7) in particular, urged with great force the impropriety of this state's risquing the dissolution of the union, as in the event of another confederation it could not be supposed the lesser states would be allowed to confederate upon equal terms with the more important.(8) Reprinted from the New-Jersey Gazette, March 20, 1786; and the American Museum, 2 (July 1787): 153--;59. 1. This date was derived from the following introductory passage in the March 20 New-Jersey Gazette account: \""On Monday last the committee of Congress, consisting of the hon. Charles Pinckney of South-Carolina, hon. Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, and hon. William Grayson of Virginia, had their audience of the assembly of New-Jersey, agreeably to the resolution of Congress of the 7th instant, and the appointment of the house assigning that day. The resolution of Congress appointing the committee, and stating its purposes, was read---;the resolutions of Congress of the 15th of February last respecting the revenue system of 18th April 1783 were also read, and a schedule of the foreign loans laid before the house. Mr. Pinckney then addressed the house in nearly the following terms.\"" For the context of Pinckney's appearance before the New Jersey Assembly, see Charles Thomson to Gorham, Grayson, and Pinckney, March 7; Committee of Congress to William Livingston, March 12; and Richard P. McCormick, Experiment in Independence: New Jersey in the Critical Period, 1781-1789 (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1950), pp. 233-44. 2. From this point to the end of the paragraph, the American Museum text reads: \""If she has been over-rated, upon stating the excess in evidence to congress, she will always receive the relief she may be justly entitled to. If, on the other hand, she conceives herself unequally situated; or that she does not participate in those common benefits which the general government was expected to dispense to all its members---;if she thinks, with me, that its powers are inadequate to the ends for which it was instituted, and that they should be increased---;there can be no doubt of the conduct she ought to pursue. She ought immediately to instruct her delegates in congress, to urge the calling of a general convention of the states, for the purpose of revising and amending the federal system. In this constitutional application, she will meet with all the attention and support she can wish.\"" In the Carey text, Pinckney then went on to say: \""I have long been of opinion, that it was the only true and radical remedy for our public defects; and shall with pleasure assent to,   and support, any measure of that kind, which may be introduced, while I continue a member of that body.\"" Although the manuscript of Pinckney's speech has not been discovered, it is clear that 15 months after delivering his speech to the New Jersey Assembly and providing Isaac Collins a text for the New- Jersey Gazette, Pinckney substantially revised it for publication by Mathew Carey in the July 1787 issue of the American Museum. The context was no longer New Jersey's threat to withhold contributions from her Continental quota, but the deliberations of the constitutional convention which opened in Philadelphia in May 1787, which Pinckney was attending as a delegate for South Carolina. There are nearly 50 variations in emphasis and phraseology between the two texts, including three extended passages not found in the earlier version which are noted below. Among other motives for \""improving\"" the text of his speech, it is easy to imagine that Pinckney desired to demonstrate continuity in the movement for \""revising and amending the federal system,\"" of which he was one of the earliest leaders, for his overture to the New Jersey Assembly had had tangible effects. Not only did the house rescind its resolution refusing compliance with the 1786 requisition, but soon after agreed to appoint delegates to attend a convention for reforming the Continental government. 3.

Bracketed passage through the following three paragraphs taken from ibid., pp. 157--;58. 6. From this point the printer of the Gazette merely summarized the substance of the committee's remaining arguments. 7. Grayson's remarks were also reported by the French chargÃ© d'affaires in New York, Louis Guillaume Otto, to the French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, in the following words (in translation): \""What is your object in hastening the dissolution of a confederation which has cost us so dear? That compact was the result of necessity; but do you suppose that in a new system of government you would be allowed the importance that you have had hitherto? Do you think that Virginia, Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts would be willing to stand on an equal footing with the handful of citizens which inhabit your state? Although much inferior to those powerful republics, you have had an equal part in the deliberations of Congress, but do not flatter yourself that in a new confederation you would enjoy so distinguished a role; they will know how to put you in your place.\"" Otto to Vergennes, March 17, 1786, Archives du MinistÃ¨re des affaires Ã©trangÃ¨res, Correspondance politique, Ãtats- Unis, 32:188. 8. The printer of the Gazette also appended the following extracts from the New Jersey Assembly's proceedings recording the response of the house to the committee's presentation. \""The house resumed the consideration of the motion made by mr. A. Clark, seconded by mr. Schenck, on the 14th instant, in the following words, to wit, \""That the honourable committee of Congress be informed, that this house, anxiously desirous of promoting among all the states a lasting union, established upon principles of justice and equality, are ready to accede to any measures founded on such a basis. \""That the present confederation, in whatever light the same may be considered with regard to equality, hath not been strictly adhered to in the requisition of September last. The valuation of the lands and buildings have not been taken by any state, nor the mode recommended by Congress for settling the quotas by the number of inhabitants which superceded the requisition for such a valuation been agreed to by all the states so far as to become a federal rule, on which account the requisition of September last can be considered only as recommendatory, and therefore, for the reasons contained in the resolution of this house of the 20th of February last, cannot be complied with further than by providing for the annual payment of interest due to our citizens, which it is supposed will nearly amount to the whole quota of this state on the national debt.  \""This house entertains the most grateful sense of the liberal assitance afforded by the friendly powers in Europe, by loaning money to the United States; and sincerely regret the want of proper funds to discharge the interest. This, it must be acknowledged, is not owing to any neglect of Congress; they have done all in their power to raise the sums necessary for that purpose, and their present inability to make prompt payment must be charged only to those states which have refused to grant the United States the duties and imposts which they now collect, as well from states destitute of any foreign commerce, as from their own citizens; and which, if paid into the common treasury at the disposal of Congress, will probably be more than sufficient to raise the specie required.  \""Whereupon, A motion was made by mr. T. Clark, seconded by mr. R. S. Smith, to substitute the following in lieu of the said motion: \""Whereas this house, apprehensive that a compliance with the requisition of Congress of the 27th September last would have a tendency to confirm the states who have not complied with the resolutions of Congress of the 18th April 1783 for a general impost and revenue in their opposition to the plan therein recommended, and considering all temporary expedients inadequate to raise a fund sufficient to discharge the interest on the national debt and to provide for other expenditures necessary for the support of the federal government, and for other reasons assigned in the preamble to the resolution of this house of the 20th ult. did resolve, that this house cannot, consistent with the duty they owe their constituents, comply with the requisition of Congress of the 27th September last, until all the states in the union shall comply with the requisition of the 18th April 1783, or until the several states having the advantage of commerce shall forbear exacting duties from other states for their own particular benefit: and whereas a deputation from Congress to this house have, by order of Congress, communicated sundry evils which may arise to the union by the determination of this house if adhered to; \""The house therefore, having reconsidered the said resolution, are of opinion, that, although the said requisition, from a want of conformity to the rule of adjusting the quotas of the several states contained in the 8th article of the confederation, the alteration of which rule not having been acceded to by all the states can of course be binding upon none, must be considered only as recommendatory: notwithstanding which, being willing to remove as far as in their power every embarrassment from the counsels of the union, and that the failure of supplies from temporary demands, though clearly evinced from experience, may not be imputed to the state of New- Jersey only, do therefore \""Resolve, That the said resolution of the 20th February last be, and the same is hereby rescinded and made void. \""To which the house agreed.\"" Thomas Clark's substitute resolution, as adopted, was merely a face-saving gesture, for the New Jersey Assembly's \""policy of not contributing to the financial support of the Confederation, adopted in 1783, was never altered or abandoned.\"" McCormick, Experiment in Independence, p. 243.

 Dear Sir New York March 19th. 1786. I enclose you a copy of Mr. Jay's publication of the correspondence between him & Mr. Littlepage revis'd and corrected.(1) It may furnish some matter of entertainment. Jersey having taken into consideration the late requisition, the house of delegates resolv'd that having enter'd into the confederation upon terms highly disadvantageous to that State from the necessity of publick affrs. at the time, & a confidence that those points in which they were aggriev'd wod. be remedied & finding this was not the case & a compact founded in such unequal principles likely, by this acquiescence to be fetter'd on them, they wod. not therefore comply with the same untill their grievances were redress'd; in the course of their reasoning they mention the failure of some States to comply with the impost & seem to rest themselves on that ground in such manner as to intimate that if they shod. comply their objections wod. be nearly remov'd. This resolution being brought before Congress gave great uneasiness. It is to be observ'd that here is no express act of the Legislature but merely the negative of a proposition to comply with the requisition in the branch with whom it shod. originate. They therefore are in a less direct opposition to the confederation than if it were the act of the legislature---;but being in a high degree reprehensible Congress resolv'd that a committee be appointed to attend the legislature & endeavor to prevail on  March 19, 1786  them to rescind the resolution & accede to the measure. The Committee were, Pinckney, Gorham & Grayson; they left us immediately & have not since return'd.(2) We have in the papers an act stated to be of R.I. passing the impost in the full latitude recommended by Congress.(3) It is believ'd to be the case---;in that event this State will most probably pass it also. It is also sd. that Georgia hath pass'd it.(4) A report urging in very pointed terms a complyance with the recommendation for changing as therein propos'd the 8th of the articles of confederation is before Congress.(5) It will most probably pass altho' some gentn. in the Eastern States wod. willingly throw it aside. The better dispos'd & better inform'd are aware of the impolicy of an opposition to it even if injurious to those States (wh. is not admitted) while they seek a more important alteration in the extension of the powers of Congress in the regulation of trade. You will before this have heard that I have it in my power to make you acquainted with a Lady of this State adopted of Virga.(6) I am sincerely yr. friend & servt., Jas. Monroe ""

  Dr Sir New York [March] 22nd 1786. I have had the pleasure of receiving both your letters, & for which I am much obliged to you though I am sorry to observe you do not speak more decidedly on your intended junction with your brother delegates. If it depends on our removal to Philada. some time must necessarily elapse, as there is but little hopes that such an event will take effect witht. a full representation of the Southern States. N. Carolina, Delawar & Georgia are still absent & we do not know when they will appear; it  March 22, 1786  seems as if many of the States had forgot the relation in which they stood to the Union As well as to foreign powers. Congress have done very little since their last meeting; indeed with so few States, it is out of their power to do any thing of material consequence. They have been lately alarmed at the conduct of our Sister Jersey in consequence of a resolution passed by the House of delegates of that state revolting agt. the requisition of 1785 & declaring they would neither consent to this or any other requisition unless the 5 Per Cent Impost is adopted: the apprehensions of Congress in consequence of this abdication of Jersey induced them to send a Commee. to Trenton to remonstrate to them on the fatal consequences that must result from their adherence to their resolution.(1) A few days ago the Commee. consisting of Mr. Pinkney, Mr Gorham & myself had an audience, & the Assembly were polite enough to rescind the resolution.(2) They are however still very much dissatisfied & complain heavily of the injuries they suffer from imposts laid by N. York on the one hand & Pensylvany on the other. They alledge that they pay as much to these States by way of commerce as their proportion of the specie part of the requisition would amount to; Some of them wish for annihilation & that E. Jersey might be joined to N. York & W. Jersey to Pensylvany. Our foreign affairs are much in the same situation as when you left us. Mr. Adams has done nothing with the Brittish Ministry; and Mr. Jay has done about as much with Mr. Gardoqui. The Commrs. in Europe have dispatched Mr. Berclay, Mr. Franks, Mr. Lamb & a Mr. Randal to negotiate with the Barbary powers, & we understand that they have actually arrived at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco.(3) As they are authorized to give only 80,000 dolls. to the four most greedy sovereigns in the world; which is a little better than Â£4000 Sterling a man, I think there is every reason in the world to suppose that some of the dramatis personae will get incarcerated. I think it not improbable that these people will look upon the offer as an insult & that we are laughing at them. There has been a great exertion in Jersey & this State for paper money. It is lost for the moment in Jersey 8 to 5 in the Council:(4) the fate of it is suspended here but I believe it will pass in the affirmative before the session breaks & with a tender to it. The Antients were more candid than we are, they contended directly for an abolition of debts, in so many words while we politely ask for the same thing in the soft and specious language of paper money. Your friends here are all well. Mr. Monro is lately married to Miss Eliza. Kortright: many other conjunctions copulative are talked of. Mr. King is about being married to Miss Alsop: they say that Mr. Hindman is thinking about some tender connections: in short we seem as if we had all got into Calypso's Island. The Hon'ble Mr. Lee is not intirely  an unconcerned spectator among all this good business; he has been assiduous at the Sycamore & at Mrs. Levingstons; various rumors have circulated in consequence of the Doctor's maneuvres: all parties agree that a storm is gathering but whether it will ultimately burst on Miss Alleday Levingston or Esther Kortright is yet in the womb of fate:(5) if I was to give my own opinion on so intricate a question & forced to bett on the occasion I should stake the Sycamore against the field. I shall be extremely obliged by a continuance of your favors, and will give you from time [to time] such occurrences as I think may be worth your notice.  From yr. Affect. frd. & most Obed. Servt., Willm. Grayson [P.S.] Since writing above I understand that Georgia & Rhode Island have both passed the 5 Per Cent Impost; the legislature of N. York are now sitting; the impost is before them, but it is matter of great doubt whether it will go through: if this state passes it, it will become efficient. I shall attend particularly to what you say respecting the Post Office. The Ordinance is ready to be produced when there are a sufficient number of states collected.(6) It being a doubt whether a Member out of Congress & before he has taken his seat is exempted from Postage: I have pro majori cautela, franked this. W G [March] 24. There are great thoughts among some of the principal members in Congress to recommend a Convention of the States for the purpose of amending the confederation, which it is said is perfectly inefficient: A resolution to this effect is now before Congress, brought forward by Pinkney.(7) ""

 Dr Sir. New York March 22nd. 1786. I should have done myself the pleasure of writing to you sooner, but really nothing occur'd here of sufficient consequence to communicate. Congress from the small number of States that have come forward have remained in a kind of political torpor. They have of course taken no active steps, till lately that they have addressed the States on the subject of commerce: they were not long since a good deal alarmed at the conduct of sister Jersey. The House of delegates of that State in a moody fit declared that they would not only comply with the requisition of 1785, but with no other requisition, until the 5 Per Ct. Impost was adopted. The State by this Act having declared Independance, Congress thought it was a matter that merited some attention. They therefore ordered a Comme. to go to Trenton & expostulate with the House on the impropriety of their conduct. The Comme. was heard, and the House were so complaisant as to rescind the resolution but they have passed no legislative act in affirmance of the requisition, & I very much doubt whether they will. It may however have this effect, that other States will not be deterred (by her conduct in an absolute refusal) from passing the requisition. There is at present a greater prospect of the Impost than has been ever known; Georgia & Rhode Island have come into the measure, & it remains only with N. York to give her consent to make it productive. The Legislature is now sitting and deliberating on this subject but I doubt extremely whether the result will be favorable. Our foreign affairs are very little altered one way or other since I had the pleasure of seeing you, Mr. Adams has done nothing with the  March 22, 1786  Brittish Ministry; & Mr. Jay has done very little more with Mr. Gardoqui. The Commrs. in Europe have dispatched Mr. Barclay, Mr. Franks, Mr. Lamb & Mr. Randall to negotiate with the Barbary powers & We understand that Mr. Barclay has actually arrived at the Court of the Emperor of Morocco. I am very apprehensive that no good will come of all this. These potentates are the most greedy & rapacious in the whole world, & yet we offer nothing worth their acceptance. In addition to this it is shrewdly to be suspected that the maritime powers will underhandedly counteract all our measures: they cannot but be pleased to see American vessels (in addition to the dearness of labor) tottering under the accumulated pressure of Corsair insurance. Some people are seriously of opinion that we should turn Algerines ourselves; they must surely be out of their senses: however not more so, than some others who thought it for the interest of the U.S. to keep constantly at war with them. This latter sentimt. which proceeds from our Secy. of foreign affairs comes fully up to the idea of fighting for nothing & finding ourselves. There has been a great contest in Jersey for the Argent papier; but though it went triumphantly through the lower house, it was lost in the Council, 8 to 5.(1) Some of the Members who were adverse to it, have been burn't in effigy, in particular Colo. Ogden at or near Elizabeth town. The old Governor was drawn up to the stake but pardoned, on account of his having been the first magistrate.(2) This same Jersey bill was one of the most iniquitous things I ever saw in my life; the money was a tender; if it was refused, the debt was suspended for 12 years, in the mean time the act of limitation ran of course, which in effect destroyed it. Jersey has not been singular in her attempts at cheating. In this place a bill is depending, of the same purport as that of Jersey, & which it is probable will pass, although it is violently opposed by the upright & respectable part of the Commy. The Antients were surely men of more candor than We are; They contended openly for an abolition of debts in so many words, while we strive as hard for the same thing under the decent & specious pretence of a circulating medium. Montesquieu was not wrong when he said the democratical might be as tyrannical as the despotic; for where is there a greater act of despotism than that of issuing paper to depreciate for the purpose of paying debts on easy terms. If Lord Effingham is right that an act agt. the Constitution is void, surely paper money with a tender annexed to it is void, for it is not an attack upon property,(3) the security of which is made a fundamental in every State in the Union. There has been some serious thoughts in the minds of some of the Members of Congress to recommend to the States the meeting of a general Convention, to consider of an alteration of the ConfOEderation, & there is a motion to this effect now under consideration.(4) It is contended that the present Confederation is utterly inefficient, and that   if it remains much longer in its' present State of imbecillity we shall be one of the most contemptible Nations on the face of the Earth: for my own part I have not yet made up my mind on the subject: I am doubtful whether it is not better to bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of. I am however in no doubt about the weakness of the fOEderal Government; if it was weaker notwithstanding it would answer if the States had power as in the United Netherlands the fOEderal Governmt. is weak but the Individual states are strong. It is no wonder our Government should not work well, being formed on the Dutch model where circumstances are so materially different. Your friend Colo. Monro has taken to himself a Wife out of the house of Kortright. Mr. King is to be married in a few days to Miss Alsop. Mr. Gerry is already Married to Miss Thomson. Mr. Houston is to be married to Miss Mary Bayard. Many more maneuvres are going forwd. among the members of Congress which seems to portend a conjunction copulative. In short I think we have got into Calypso's Island. I heartily wish you were here: as I have a great desire to see you figure in the character of a married man. I tryed to get you the book respecting canals, but all were sold but one, which at Genl. Washingtons desire I sent to him: All I could do was to imploy the book seller to import some. This will be done with all convenient speed: out of the importation I have engaged 5 Copies---;two for you, two for myself & one for the Potowmack people. I remain, with the greatest friendship, Yr.

It was the first Intelligence we had receiv'd of you, & we began to be extremely anxious about you, it therefore instantly banish'd every Idea of the fatigue we had just endur'd, & the Anxiety we felt, & fill'd us with inexpressible Joy, & gratitude to Heaven, for yr. health & preservation, & the happy prospects it holds out to us. Two Days after, I receiv'd a Letter from Capt. Bascom from Antigua, informing of yr. safe arrival, after a very long & disagreeable passage, which you also mention, & at which I was surprised, as your Letter, from the Capes of Delaware, had given us reason to flatter ourselves that it might have been speedy at least, if not agreeable. Nothing very material has occur'd to us here or at Stratford, & we have enjoy'd pretty good health except Charles's having been some time since attack'd by a Fever, which tho' severe, was happily of short duration, & went off well, so that he is now very hearty & vigorous.

Health & prosperity, I feel myself under the greatest obligations to our Friend Mr Van Dam for his very kind reception of you, & the Introduction he has given you to so many agreeable & useful Acquaintances in the Island, which I doubt not you will cultivate in the best manner you can. I am glad to find you are like to be on so friendly a footing with Mr. Bascom the Lawyer, & that he has been so polite as to offer you the Use of his Books. I will send you some, as you wish, as soon as possible, but fear it cannot be done before I go again to Stratford. The Rudiments &c, & Maxims in Equity,(1) shall be sent, & I wish you had named others, as I wold send those you most want. Would any Books of Entries be useful to you? Return my respectful Compliments to the Govr.(2) with hearty thanks for the Attention he has shewn you, & assure him that if I can render him, or his, any services in this Country, I shall always be happy to receive his Commands. And the like to any others to whom I am known that you shall think proper. The prospect you have of a Confirmation of yr. health gives us the highest satisfaction, & I pray God it may be soon  April 3, 1776  realiz'd. I shall be anxious to know how you suceed in your first Attempts, which are of much consequence & for which it is adviseable you sho'd endeavour to be as well prepared as possible by fully studying your Cases & making yourself perfectly Master of them in all their lights. Yr. Farm we will dispose of as soon as it can be done advantageously, but you are sensible it is but an ill time to sell Lands in this country, & as to engaging in other business besides your profession, Mr. Van Dam, (if he continues in the Island, for it is said here he is going to England) can give you the best Advise, & you must first see by your experience how the Island suits you in point of health, as well as in other respects. You are right in being affable & familiar with both parties, & declaring for neither, by which means you will probably be courted by both, & may avail yourself of both, & you will for a long time yet have a just excuse for not embarking with either, & perhaps may eventually be the means of reconciling them to each other, & thereby rendering your Country the most essential service. By Mr. Van Dam's Account of them they are by no means so bitter as we had been induced to believe. What Age is the Attory General, of what are his Connexions, & who supports him in the Office, either in the Island, or in England? What are the Emoluments annex'd to the Office &c? It may be of some use perhaps, if you continue there for me to be acquainted with these Circumstances. We have some of the things you gave Charles a Memorandm. for, & hope shall have them all ready by the time there is a conveyance for them. The first we can expect is Mr. Tuckers Vessel, which he says he will detain but a few Days, & tho't wo'd have arriv'd some time ago. This I must forward by the circuitous rout of South Carolina. I have Letters from Stratford by last Saturdays Stage acquainting me that they are all well there; as your sister & Mr. Verplank are there. She proposes to write you by this Conveyance, & by her appearance promises in a few Months to give you the Title of Uncle. Mr. King of Massachusetts, was last Thursday Married to Miss Alsop, with whom you was acquainted. I hope you will be as prudent as he has been, & in due time, be happy in a yet more agreeable Companion with as handsome a Fortune. They are not incompatible, & it is worthy a useful Attention to discover where they may be united. It is the most easy & agreeable Method of acquiring a Competency. With the most ardent Prayers for your health & prosperity in every respect, I remain yr. most affectionate Father & Friend, Wm. Saml. Johnson  [P.S.] Yr. first Letters are not yet come to hand. ""

 My dear sir(1) New York 4h. April 1786 I have deferred the pleasure I always felt in any sort of connexion with you to this day, that I might have opportunity of discovering the books you want. But your directions being general and such an abundance of political treatises to choose out of, none of which I consider as worthy of notice, I shall wait longer, that you may designate your choice. Then I will comply. Ramsey's revolution I have purchased [&] will send by Mr Lee provided he can carry them. I have hopes that you will contrive to procure six hogsheads of tobacco, as your resources I know to be equal to this small effort (a little negroe being enough) and place them in the hands of Mr. Stoddert for me. Indeed I would not that this should be undone, for twenty times the value my reputation depending in some degree on it. Where have you been since your last: not in Alexandria I presume, for you could not being there have passed over in silence the time which has elapsed. Do you persevere in your withdraw[al] from the Assembly, who will succeed you. Of what complexion is the body of the people with respect to their public men & public affairs. Do they impute the evils which menace their national life to their leaders, or their own vice and prodigality. Do they but see the necessity of a government adequate to its object, or still prefer the name to substance. Are they not apprized by this time, that one source of their complicated misfortune is the invitation which the state and nature of their debts offer to all orders to relinquish every profession and place their attention to jobbing in paper securitys. Agriculture, commerce and every other proper ground to render a people wealthy and respectable yields to the allurements of this vice. They must stop it, or they are undone. It is worse than the plague to the body, and more pestilential if possible, for it now comprehends both good & bad. It is high time that our people be coerced to habits of industry, otherwise our produce will be of no consequence---;for the nations of Europe are all bending their application to the culture of the land, and our only chance for existence, is to be able to undersell; & to make up in quantity what we loose in price. This quantity is attainable, if we could be brought to due exertions. Our prospects in Europe are unpromising and will be more so in proportion to our insignificance. The negotiations with the Barbary powers will I fear be ineffectual. G Britain knows our weakness & will not  April 4-24, 1786  be operated on by fear, the only passion in her mind which can ever [be] used to our advantage. The court of France is engaged in commercial projects all pointing to her specially, and will terminate in aggrandizement and consequence to that powerful nation. Spain imitates her plans, and aids her views. The emperor & the King of Prussia are quarreling about Bavaria. The United provinces are s[t]ill out of humour with their Statholder, who is patronized by his cousin of Prussia. Could we place ourselves on a respectable footing, we might negotiate among these discordant powers to advantage, but we are truely contemptible, and therefore not regarded.  What has become of Doct. Skinner, he cannot surely have spent his time in Frederic town, as he sacredly engaged in some matters of mine very consequential to my peace of mind, as well as important to my purse. God bless you my dear friend. Your aff brother, Henry Lee Junr(2) ""

 Sir New York April 5 1786 Some time in the last June Session the General Court passed an order directing the Delegates to apply to Congress for the loan of sixty pieces of Cannon for the use of the Militia---;but it has not been though[t] prudent to bring the application before Congress as it is probable it would be attended with a denial. N Hampshire made a request of the same kind toward the close of the last Congress. But they were denied---;it being then supposed imprudent to suffer the Public Stores to be taken from the Magazines & scattered through all the States.(1) There is now on the floor of Congress but eight States---;there having been nine but very few days the present year---;it is attended with great inconvenience & damage to the affairs of the Union. That the States are thus inattentive to their Representation. . .several subjects of great consideration are now before Congress & cannot (owing to the above circumstance) be taken up. It appears to me that the Congress of last Year were not sufficiently apprised of the consiquence of a Treaty with the Barbary Powers---;or they would not have conducted that business in the manner they did. I conceive it would have been much the best way to have sent a Person of Reputation & Character directly from hence with full Powers to have treated with those People. I am convinced it would not have  April 5, 1786  been more expensive---;it would have pleased those Powers much more, and would have tended to bring the business to a more speedy conclusion. By a Letter from Mr. Adams we find that Mr Barclay had not left France the 6th of December,(2) being detained by an attention to Mr. Beaumerchais accounts, & by a Letter from Mr. Carmicael of the same date 6 Decr it appears that Mr Lamb who is designed for Algiers was then at Madrid.(3) Congress have lately appointed a Committe to consider wither any further measures can be taken in this business.(4) The Delegates have no Power relative to the formation of the Court necessary to bring to issue the cause between Massachusetts & N York. I am in hopes the Court did not rise without attendg to this circumstance---;any directions which your Excellency may have to communicate to the Delegates on this or any other subject will I dare say be chearfully obeyed.(5) I spent last evening at Mr. Temples the Family are well.

 Dear Sir New York April 6. 1786. I have received your letter of the 8th October as well as those of 21 June by Mr Otto and the 14 July by Mr Houdon.(1) I read your notes with much pleasure and intended to have troubled you with some observations on them; but they have been so much out of my hands, though entrusted to such as you would approve, that I have not had an opportunity to revise them with that attention I wished and commit my thoughts to paper. I thank you for the trouble you took in sending the cylinder lamp, though I have not yet received it, nor seen col. Senf by whom you sent it. The baloon discovery has had a rapid rise and has been pursued with great spirit as a raree show. But unless some skilful artist can find out some method of directing its course & preserving the  April 6, 1786  gaz, I fear the remembrance of it will only furnish a figure in poetry and Oratory, like Phaeton's attempt to guide the chariot of the Sun. Several of the adventurers, I find have lost their lives and others incurred imminent danger. Pray what progress is made in the art of discovering ships at a distance? This seems to me something like seeing out of sight. Mesmerism or Animal Magnetism seems to be quite dropt. It has however furnished a wonderful proof of the power of the imagination over the human frame. Were the philosophers so fully satisfied on this point, that they gave it so soon the coup de grace? The people of Europe and America seem to be pursuing different amusements. While the former are diverting themselves with bubbles of air and quarreling with one another for toys and rattles, the latter are employed in the encrease of their species & providing the means of subsistance. Notwithstanding the paragraphs with which the European papers are stuffed, and the pictures they have drawn of the distress of America I will venture to assert, that there is not upon the face of the earth a body of people more happy or rising into consequence with more rapid strides, than the Inhabitants of the United States of America. Population is encreasing, new houses building, new lands clearing, new settlements forming and new manufactures establishing with a rapidity beyond conception. And what is more, the people are well fed, well clad and well housed. Yet I will not say that all are contented. The merchants are complaining that trade is dull, the farmer that wheat & other produce are falling, the landlords that rent is lowering, the speculists and extravagant that they are compelled to pay their debts and the idle and vain that they cannot live at others cost and gratify their pride with articles of luxury. It is true that individual happiness is yet the general Object, and the people are not yet sufficiently impressed with a sense of what they owe to their national character. But they are advancing in this science. Whether they will acquire it by reflection or be forced into a knowledge of it by experience I will not undertake to say. However this I can inform you that every state is busily employed in arranging its finances. Twelve states have granted the impost for discharging the principal & interest of the national debt and it is expected that N. York will grant it in the present session of their legislature. Of your Annapolis acquaintance[s] Messr Read, Gerry and Monroe are married & Osgood on the brink of matrimony. Mrs. Thomson joins in Compliments to you & your daughter.

Nothing very important has occurrd. since our last, the Representation has been so thin, that no proper Oppertunity has presented for bringing forward the Report of the Comtee. upon our Cession of the western Territory,(1) we have been favord. with nine States on the floor but for a very few Days this Year, & we fear two or three of those are decidedly against us. The Report is favorable, we have the Acceptance of it much at Heart, & shall carefully watch for a propitious Moment. It requires a delicate negotiation, & we have more Doubts than hopes as to the issue, but shall do our endeavor to bring the Business to a Decision before the Assembly meets.  Congress are studiously pursuing an oeconomical Reform in the civil list Department. The five great Departments viz Marine, Commissary, Cloathing, quarter-master & hospital, all are abolished, & placed under one head, with the same Sallary which has been given to the heads of each of those Departments.(2) Could we be furnishd. with a full representation from the States, a Reform would probably be attempted in the Department of Commissioners for setling the Accts. of particular States with the united States, in such a Manner as to bring those Accts. if possible to a speedy adjustment. The Commissioners sent to conclude Treaties with the Indian Nations have returnd. & in some Measure effected the Object of their Mission's.  We Have not as yet been able to learn what Success our Legations to the barbary powers have met with, they in all probability arrived at the place of Negotiation about the first of January last. Tis much to be lamented that Congress were unable to supply them with such presents as to ensure a successful Negotiation. America must conjecture that no Nation loves money equally with herself, & acts conformably thereto, in affording no Means wherewith her business can be effectually done. No official Acct. from Georgia has yet arrived of the granting the Impost, alth'o such Information has been recd. as leaves little doubt in the Mind upon the subject. Tis still problematical whether New York will comply, when her Intrest pleads so powerfully for other methods of supplying the fOEderal Chest. Yet the friends of the Measure have been successful in carrying a Collateral Motion this Morning in the House who have now that subject before them which gives us some incouragemt. to hope for a favourable issue.(3) In fine our affairs seem to indicate the Approach of some great Crisis. Our Trade in a very distracted Situation, Britain watching for some oppertune season to revenge her smarts, the fickle Indian nations ready to join those, who can best supply their wants, & jealous of the Approach of the Americans so near their Territories; the states unwill-

General politics are so uninteresting to those who are not particularly bound to examine their probable effects---;that I have declined writing to you on the subject. My personal concerns have been few since my being in Congress, and I therefore have not troubled you with any notice of them. This silence has not, I hope, been construed into a want of friendship to you or any of the family. Indeed I cherish the truest attachment to you all and am deeply interested in every event which can affect your happiness or prosperity. My own---;if anything human is certain---;are secured by my late marriage. My wishes never exceeded my present felicity. When you know my Mrs. King, you will not withhold, what she certainly merits, your genuine friendship and sincere affection. She is the only child of Mr. John Alsop, long a very respectable and eminent merchant in this city. Mr. Alsop declined business in 1775 with a very handsome fortune, and served a number of years as a delegate in Congress from this State. He is now wholly free from public and private employments and venerable for his years; and respected by his friends, enjoys the reward of an industrious and virtuous life. I pray you to communicate this event to each of our family. I am so hurried at this time that I cannot write to Mrs. King or Dr. Porter. I hope to see you all in June or July.

I differ with you in one thing that \""revenge is a vice growing out of warm climates.\"" I acknowledge that irascibility is but revenge appears to me to grow more naturally out of cold climates than warm. Revenge is not the passion of youth. The odia longa are the vices of age & also of cold countries. A disposition to resent injuries & affronts instanter is one thing & the deliberate resolution of punishing at a distant day another. You would do well to send some copies here for sale. I have not made that one publick you were so kind as to send me lest it might injure the sale by previously gratifying curiosity. I wish to see matters on such a footing in America that an author may be on at least a footing equal to a taylor or shoemaker. Your example has in many instances inspired me with laudable resolutions. In the confidence of friendship I mention that from a wish to follow you though it is confessed hard passibus Ã¦quis. I have some thoughts of proposing an annual oration in our Charleston Library society & of offering my service in the first instance. The subject which has occurred is an enquiry into the nature & effects of the climate & soil of Carolina on the inhabitants. I fear this would lead to unwelcome truths; but without sacrificing truth I could say many things that would be agreeable. I beleive the vices of that country are more chargeable on slavery than on the climate. I wish you woud resolve this in your mind. You can furnish me with some leading thoughts & facts.

I cannot find that they are in my possession, or do I believe she ever gave them to me. As to Allen, he has no claim for the year 1781 whatever. On Ledger No. 1, he is charged with a certificate (specie) issued to him in March 1783 upon a full settlement which he made with me for that years services. The certificate is for 105 dols. as the sum then due him. Now if he has certificates for the service of that year still in his possession they would be duplicates which, with all my care, the inferior Officers would give.

What were the numbers of inhabitants & what the annual revenue of New-Jersey at the commencement of the war?

 My Dear freind New York 16 Ap. 1786 I am made extremely happy with the information that Mrs. Gerry is so soon & so happily recovered. I pray you both to accept Mrs. King's and my affectionate congratulations. I will look after the Letter of Mr. Adams relative to interest on British Debts, and communicate his sentiments by an early post---; indeed I now well remember the marrow of his Argument on that subject, which I never thought a good one; because it was the introduction of an artificial muniscipal principle of Law, to govern in a case Standing on the broad foundation of national Laws, and which ought to be determined by the justice of its own circumstances. Mr. Adams stated to Mr. Pitt,(1) that the revolution in America was unlike the case of a war between two independent Nations; that the war was not only different, but that the Effects thereof were various. That the contracts between individuals of two different countries rest on different laws for their execution, from those which are to carry into Effect contracts between the subjects of one nation or Government---;the former depend on the laws of nations, the latter on the municipal laws of the country of which the individuals are subjects---;That the condition of war is contemplated in the former instance, but not in the latter---;that although in Time of war there is a suspension of the Duty to pay the enemy Creditor, yet on the restoration of peace the Duty returns and retrospects to the commencement of the war; and the principal Debt & the interest ought to be paid---;but in the case of a Division of a nation, by the laws of that country when an entire nation, is the Debt recoverable---;one of the laws of the British empire was and is, \""that a personal Right once suspended is lost forever.\"" The war between G Britain & America suspended the several Rights of the individuals of both Countries---;they were therefore according to the British laws lost or destroyed. But says Mr. Adams the treaty revived them, and took them at the conclusion of the peace in exactly the same situation in which they were at the commencement of the war---;and excluded the period of war. This reasoning as I before remarked is more artificial than solid in my mind---;if the rights of the British Creditors were extinguished by the war as Mr. Adams contends, then there were not in America any British Debtors---;if so what power have congress or their ministers to assent to a treaty which shall subject John & James to pay sums of Money to subjects of G. Britain, and exempt Thomas & Harry, who were as much bound to pay as John & James? My idea is, and uniformly has been, that the exemption of the merchants of America from the payment of Interest depends on other  April 16, 1786  and more substantial principles than those alluded to by Mr. Adams in his conversation with Mr. Pitt. But my dear freind, nothing has been agreed on between the King's ministers & Mr. Adams, and the probability is light, that any thing will be concluded. Let the question be tried under the Treaty. I am sorry our state passed any restraining law on the Subject, because I think no jury ought or would have given the interest. Excuse my hurry---;I write in the room with three or four chattering Girls; I recite opinions incorrectly from my memory, and that memory charged with the Contents of an elaborate official letter by hearing it once only read. I will inquire farther---;one thing I write from self-conviction, that I love and esteem you & that I am affectionately your's, R King. [P.S.] The House of Assembly of New York have agreed to an impost but reserve the power of making the laws for its collection, and render the Officers accountable to and removable by themselves.(2) This is so great a departure from the System that it amounts to a Denial of the impost.

 My dear friend,(1) New York 16 Ap. 1786 The same embarrassments which have vexed you, have perplexed me---;there existed no single Reason why I did not early write to you after my leaving Massachusetts. Had I consulted my own ease and interest, I certainly should have written and courted your correspondence, because I had long known the force & it marked the progress of your most excellent understanding, and friendship early taught me that your mind was a source of good Council on which I could draw for information in questions not merely personal and relating to myself, but of an extensive and important nature, such indeed as concern the safety, the honor, & happiness of our country. Yet I omitted the solicitation of your correspondence, probably because you did not appear to wish it---;let us order the matter better in  April 16, 1786  future. I once complained to the General of your neglect, and in the complaint included Baylies;(2) he and you have observed the same line of conduct towards me, & I have been equally silent to you both. Baylies knows that I revere and love him, that I now am, and have ever been intimately concerned in every thing, which can affect him---; without professions you know my attachment to you---;perhaps I have been in fault. But compare situations; you were perfectly at ease, and diligently pursueng a profession, to adorn it. Baylies secluded from the world, as independent as the Rocks he lives upon, and as proud as the only surviving son of virtue---;of what value would my Letters have been to either of you? on the other hand, my duties have been often arduous, and my own Judgement insufficient to guide me when compelled to tread unbeaten Paths: in these moments I wanted your support, and had I dared should have often asked it. Friendship should have dictated to you both the propriety of authorising me to call on you for its choicest fruits, sincere council and candid communication public, & personal. But I will cease to remember the past---;and I pray you to forget. I am happy to hear that Baylies enjoys his health, and pleased with the information that he has increased his family. I thank you for your kind congratulations, Mrs. King most respectfully joins me in proper acknowledgements. I pray you to present my best respects to your Mrs. Lincoln, although unknown I am bound to esteem---;she shall become acquainted with Two friends at the same time; Mrs. King will not detach me from Massachusetts---;you are well informed of my increasing love for our particular country---;there I began & there I pray God I may end my life. The General wrote me a very sensible letter on a very important subject.(3) I have been considering it, and as we are not wholly in sentiment I will reply soon. I should have answered before now, but marriage and its &ca. have prevented. I am now still, and applying to Business. Pray mention this to the General and beg his acceptance of my very sincere Respects. With sincere friendship & Respect, Your's Affectionately, Rufus King ""

N. York has passed an act effecting a compliance, but clogged with conditions and provisions which render it inadmissible. Your Excellency will observe that Virginia having in her act granted only the impost part of the System she stands of course in the representation of the 15th of Febry amongst those States who have not fully complied. We think it not amiss to inform you that most of the States, who have in any degree complied, have left out the supplementary funds. It will be to no usefull purpose for Virga. to take the subject under consideration at an earlier period than the fall Session--whenever all the States have so formed their acts as to embrace the impost alone, that part of the System may go into effect, so far the act of Virginia is already competent to its operation, and it is not probable that her accession to the other part will become necessary before the fall.

In obedience to your order I have paid three hundred dollars to Doctor Witherspoon and enclose his receipt. I did not know when I made this payment that the sum required was 95Â£ four shillings or I should have paid the whole demand. This I will rectify as soon as I can. The Doctor complains bitterly of the injury which he sustains by the difference of the interest received from you and to be paid by him for Money which your debt would have supplied, had your remittances been punctual. We have very gloomy prospects with respect to national faith, dignity & importance. Indeed unless matters soon alter, the United States must inevitably become more insignificant than words can express. Every state in the Union but this, have granted the impost to Congress; whether New-york will or will not, is yet a matter of doubt. The house of delegates have passed a bill yeilding the duty of five per cent on imports for 25 years but have cramped it with certain modifications which will render the system unoperative for another year, unless the senate should amend the bill in its passage.

The first question which arises with respect to the government is, Shall it be upon Colonial principles, under a governor, council and judges of the U.S., removeable at a certain period of time and they admitted to  April 20, 1786  a vote in Congress with the common rights of the other States, or shall they be left to themselves until that event? In the former instance how the correspondence or superintendence of such colony or colonies, shall be systematically preserved and presented to the view of Congress? The same question occurs with respect to the Indian department. These subjects altho' not immediately within your province we consider as intimately connected with it, and shall be happy in your assistance in forming those arrangements which will become necessary respecting them.(1) I have the honor to be with great respect and esteem, your most obedient servant, Jas. Monroe MS not found; reprinted from The Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay, ed. Henry P. Johnston, 4 vols. (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1890--;93), 3:190--;91. 1. For the background of the appointment on March 27 of the committee on the temporary government of newly-formed western states, see Monroe to Thomas Jefferson, April 12, 1785, note 11. The committee, consisting of Monroe, William Samuel Johnson, John Kean, Rufus King, and Charles Pinckney, reported on May 10 and the report was ordered printed. Before it was debated, however, Congress took action on two reports of a grand committee which had taken into consideration on March 11 Monroe's motion of October 12, 1785, on western land cessions. The grand committee, on which Monroe served, submitted two reports on March 24, which were ordered printed, and Congress resolved on July 7 to recommend that Virginia revise its act of cession to allow Congress to divide the northwest territory into three to five states which would enjoy the same freedom, sovereignty, and independence as the original states. See JCC, 30:112n, 131--;35, 390--;94, 960; and Charles Thomson to Patrick Henry, July 11. Congress then considered the report on government on July 13, recommitting it after adding four amendments. It was read again on August 23 and assigned to a new committee whose September 19 report was debated September 29 and October 4, when it became clear that no ordinance on western government could be enacted until Virginia responded to the July 7 recommendation to revise its cession. See JCC, 30:139n, 251--;55, 402--;7, 502n, 561n, 563, 667n, 669--;73, 686n, 700--;702, 738, 962, 967. The organization of an Indian department became the task of essentially the same delegates who developed the plan for western government when Congress directed Monroe, King, Pinckney, Nathaniel Gorham, and Stephen Mix Mitchell on March 21 \""to prepare and report an Ordinance for the Regulation of trade with the Indians.\"" Before the committee could report, however, it was superceded on June 6 by one consisting only of Pinckney, Monroe, and King who were charged with the larger task of forming an Ordinance \""for the complete arrangement and government of the Indian department.\"" The committee's June 28 report, dividing the Indian department into northern, middle, and southern districts, was printed for distribution. It was debated and amended July 20, 21, and 24 when it was read a second time. On its third reading on August 4 opposition from the North Carolina and Georgia delegates led to an August 7 amendment preserving state sovereignty in Indian negotiations. The amended ordinance, organizing the Indian department into two districts administered by a northern and a southern superintendent, was adopted the same day. See JCC, 30:118n, 332n, 368--;72, 418--;21, 424--;28, 439n, 31:485, 488--;93, 964, 965. April 21, 1786

My cheif object in my correspondence with you, was to manifest the unabated respect which continues to govern my feelings, when change of situation and circumstances, forbid the derivation of my attachment from any principles, but those bottomed on the purest and warmest respect. Then my dear sir, let me hope that you will not consider it as due or expected that you should be regular in your replys, but rather be governed by inclination and leisure, other[wise] I shall be forced from the same feelings which induced me to commence a correspondence so truely agreeable, to decline the continuance of it. Your communications with respect to the progress of our internal navigation, has given to me and our countrymen here, the highest satisfaction, for certainly no event comprehends more fully the strength and future consequence of our particular country than the cementing to the interest of Virginia by the strong ties of commerce the western world. This I beleive will take place effectually if the Potomac & James river companys succeed in their exertions before the navigation of the Mississippi becomes free to the western emigrants. I have my doubts whether good policy does not dictate forcibly every measure which tends to delay to distant time the free use of that river. It is very certain that the Spanish court are in no temper for admitting it at present, in any degree; nor will they ever consent to it as long as they retain in subjection their American Colonys. I have taken the liberty to shew in some private circles your observations with respect to the present prospect of our fOEderal affairs, and I flatter myself the justice and decision of your remarks will aid the friends to the Union in this city in their exertions to incline the Assembly of this State to adopt the revenue system asked for by Congress, and at this period essential to the existence of the Union. The lower house have passed the impost fettered with conditions which render it inadmissible by Congress. I hope the senate will amend it, and that at length we shall be possessed of some permanent and adequate fund for the discharge of our foreign debt.(2) We have no accounts by the packet of the progress of our negotiators with the barbary powers, nor have we much reason to hope for a  April 21, 1786  tolerable termination of their mission.

 Dear Sir, New York 22 Ap. 1786 Whether your foreign correspondence has furnished you with two arrets of the King of France, one of the 18 & the other of the 25 of Sep. last relative to the cod Fishery, or if you possess them, whether their operation will in any degree affect your mercantile arrangements, I am unable to determine, if your individual interest is not concerned, that of some of your freinds may be, and as these Regulations may not be within your or their Knowledge, I find a sufficient apology in communicating to you the substance of them. The arret of the 18th of Sep. grants a Bounty of Ten livres the Quintal upon all dried cod fish the produce of the french Fishery and introduced into the French Wt. Indies in French bottoms navigated by the Kings subjects, and five livres the quintal upon all such Fish introduced in like manner into any of the Ports of Portugal, Spain, or Italy; The arret of the 25th of Sep. imposes a Duty of five livres the quintal upon all dried cod Fish imported in the French west Indies, by any stranger, or in any foreign bottom. These arrets are now translating in the office of foreign Affairs, I will transmit to you copies of them as soon as they are finished.(1) The policy of these measures are most obvious, and ought to be a new motive with  April 22, 1786  the several States to vest the power of regulating commerce in some body governed by a single will, and whose authority would be sufficient to reciprocate these disadvantages to the power imposing them. At the same Time that France adopts these measures to encourage her cod Fishery, and thereby establishes her marine; she is desirous of promoting the whale Fishery of America, lest England, her most powerful Rival, should exclusively possess it, the Facility lately given to the introduction of Whale oil into France originates in this principle; and in consequence of the Relaxation of the French laws in favor of Strangers, England may continue her Duty upon foreign oils, and yet we shall not want a good market for our's---;a number of papers on this subject, and relating to the contract of Mr. Barret, which I received from Mr. Adams by the last British Packet, I shall transmit by this post to Mr. Tracy, and beg leave to refer you to them for the information they contain; a paragraph in one of the letters of the M. de La Fayette mentions the probability of the completion of the contract proposed by Mr. Tracy for the supply of naval stores, I most heartily wish its accomplishment, because I conclude it will be advantageous.

 Dear Sir, New York April 29. 1786. I have hitherto omitted to call on you for money as a Delegate---;as it has not been easy to sell bills here on our Treasury, or to get money conveyed from Boston to this place. I therefore took a general letter of Credit from two of my freinds in Beverly on a house in this City but as I must make provision for repayment on my return of the money I have so taken up to the amount nearly of my allowance from the State. I wish you to lay by for me as much money as you can towards paying my allowance as a Delegate for six or seven months. I expect to be in Boston about the first of June. I am sensible, Sir, our State has not money to pay their servants punctually for their services---;my expences hitherto have been about five dollars a day, and as I have a family and but small property it will be a very grate injury to my affairs  April 29, 1786  not to receive from the State on my return a sum at least equal to what I have expended while a Delegate in Congress.

 Dear Sir New York 2d May 1786 Mr. Alsop of this city, whom you must recollect as a delegate from this State to congress in 1775 & 1776, and whose daughter I have lately married, requests me to ask your Opinion, whether a Refugee, whose Estate has been confiscated here, and to an amount exceeding that of his Debts, can by the British laws, or the Treaty of peace between G. Britain & the united States of america, be compelled by Process in the British courts to pay a Debt due to an american Citizen, antecedent to the late war? The Determination of this question is of some importance to Mr. Alsop, and indeed to many others of our Countrymen.(1) It has been objected against such recovery that the confiscated estates of the Refugees being by the act of confiscation liable to, or by subsequent laws charged with, the payment of their Debts, in all cases where the confiscated estate equalled the amount of the Debts of any Refugee, that there the State to whose use the estates confiscated ensued, took upon itself to pay the Debts, and the Refugee was discharged---;and being discharged by an american law, the treaty could not affect them, for no Debt was due from them. How far these objections are founded, is submitted to your good Judgment. If the estate of a Refugee escaped confiscation, his american Debts must be paid under the Treaty. So if the confiscated estate is insufficient to pay the whole of his Debts, the Deficiency is in like manner recoverable. How then is it in the principal case?(2) Will you have the Goodness to examine this question, and oblige Mr Alsop, & myself with your Opinion. With the highest Respect, I have the Honor to be Dr Sir your obt & very Humble Servt., Rufus King ""

 Sir, New York May 3d. 1786. Your Genl. Election approaches fast, when by all I can hear you will have electioneering to go thr'o a second Time,(1) & be under the necessity of making a Governor; as the freemen seem not to be well agreed in their choice, I do not grudge you the pleasure of that business. I expect Doctr. Johnson will shoulder some of us out of Council & perhaps others who stand in Nomination may step forward who are not now in the Council. I wish to hear whether a sufficient Number of the Council meet this Week, to make a Quorum for yr. supreme Court, & whether The Leiut. Governor is sufficiently recoverd. to attend, how they proceed &c &c &c. This Day we have ten States represented in Congress, & one Delegate from each of the other three, Georgia excepted; Tomorrow we propose to bring forward the Question relative to our Cession of the western Territory, but we have but little hopes it will be accepted, there is a per adventure that it may be & we shall leave no stone unturnd. To effect our purpose, we dare not delay it any longer as the Assembly meets next Week, perhaps a Delay of a few Days would prove favorable. The Impost is granted in this state after a Sort & the paper money is receivable in pay for the Duty & a promise (I am told in the Act which I have not seen) that if any Depretiation should take place upon the money, by which the Continent should be subject to a Loss, the state will make it good.(2) May 3, 1786  Another Obstacle has arose to the operation of the Impost in Pensylvania, which is, that the Impost on their part shall not be carried into Execution unless the Supplementary funds are provided in all the States, when the time will arrive for all the States to agree in any one thing I know not. No late Intelligence is recd. relative to the Success of our Legations to the Barbary powers. Everybody prognosticates ill success in that Business on Acct. of the blundering Talents of our Connectt. Man Mr. Lamb, & we have the morti[fi]cation to see now & then a Shrug & Sneer at his Expence, I hope he will convince the world he is a Ram or at least an Old Sheep, the world speak of him in a very contemptible Light. I intended to have seen you at Hartford e'er this time, but cannot yet content myself to leave the state unrepresented when we have only two New England States on the floor, ours included. I enclose to you a Letter for Col. Trumbull which was handed me this Day & beg you to forward it.

 Sir New-York May 3d 1786 I have received your favor of ---;---;---;.(1) The deficient pages of my work  May 3, 1786  I suppose have been furnished by Mr. Dilly long ago. Your wish to get some shrubs from Carolina shall be gratified if possible. Mr. Watson shall be applied to and if he can furnish what you desire they shall be transmitted to New York to Mr. Otto to be forwarded by him. I have to return you many thanks for your attention to my interest; but I have a much higher obligation to acknowledge. Your notes on Virginia have been lately put into my hands and been read with infinite pleasure. I admire your generous indignation at slavery; but think you have depressed the negroes too low. I believe all mankind to be originally the same and only diversified by accidental circumstances. I flatter myself that in a few centuries the negroes will lose their black color. I think now they are less black in Jersey than Carolina, their [lips] less thick, their noses less flat. The state of society has an influence not less than climate. Our back country people are as much savage as the Cherokees. I believe in opposition to Dr. Robertson(2) that were it not for the commercial cities on the sea coast even the use of a plough would far to the westward be forgotten. You have given M. Buffon a decent but a merited correction. Europeans affect to under value Americans. I acknowledge an inferiority but this is chargeable on the state of society. Less industry, less perseverance & less knowledge will answer the purposes of our country than in old established countries but human nature is certainly radically the same in both. Your book has set me thinking on a variety of subjects. I wish such an one was written in every state. Our country suffers in Europe for want of being known. They abuse us for not paying our debts. The same objections would be made against themselves in our circumstances. We are a country of farmers and planters & as such credit is not a matter of the last consequence; but John Bull forming his ideas from the mercantile punctuality of a commercial people instead of philosophising on the state of society in a wide, extended, fertile country supposes there is more natural honesty on the one side of the Atlantic than the other.

Long before this time, the Dispatches from Mr. Jay's Office will have convinced you that Congress entertain the same sentiments, which you possess, on the Subject of an exchange of ministers between the United States & G. Britain; they will not be inattentive to the Dignity of their country, nor the Etiquette of courts. Mr. Temple will be confined to the authorities of his commission, & will not be permitted to travel out of his consulate. The Determination is, that the court of St James must send a minister here of your Rank in consequence of the proposal for that purpose, or congress must recall their minister at London. May 4, 1786  Although it is admitted by every one, that the Duties of your legation have been ably discharged, yet it seems to be as generally allowed, that little good can be expected, in the present disposition of the British ministry from the continuation of a minister from our country at the British Court. On this Subject congress will be very temperate, and nothing will be decided hastily---;there certainly was a time since the war when there existed a very general disposition in America to be intimately allied with the country of your present Residence. That disposition has since changed, is now universally weakened, and in several parts of America does not now exist. Whether the measures pursued in the British Cabinet, and which have produced this change in America, were best calculated to advance the prosperity of Great Britain or America, a short futurity will determine. Certain it is, that they have a tendency to produce that Unanimity in America so much to be desired, as the Basis of those national Regulations, which alone can establish our commerce, and make our country respectable. Indeed they have in some sort already produced this good Object. The Arrets of France relative to the Cod Fishery tend to the same purpose---;America begins to learn, that she must depend upon herself, for Prosperity & Happiness.

 Thursday 4th May 1786. The report respecting the Cession of Conecticut to the United States (to wit all of that Country to the Westward of a line runing parrellel with the Western bounds of Pensylvania, and one hundred and Twenty Miles distant therefrom). Mr. Johnson, to shew the right of Connecticut to this Country, gave a Well digested historical account of the Charters, of N. England, Virginia, N. York and Pensylvania, and of the disputes that had arisen about them, and the decisions on the King and Concil in Several Instances and then Made Many judicious Observations thereon.(1) He said one of three things Must be done 1. Congress Must Accept the Cession---;or 2. Contest their Claim---;or 3. Admit Connecticut to Settle the Lands. That the only Objections he had heard was That Connecticut by Agreement with N.Y. had fixt their Western boundary. That their Tittle has been Tried in a Court of Law (in the dispute With Pensylvania) and the decision was against them---;And That the Territory they offer to Cede is already Ceded by NY and Virginia and these he Endeavour'd to Answer. Mr. Grason of Virginia Opposed the Cession and asked the Gentleman of Connecticut if he remembered the Canada or Quebeck bill or Act passed in 1774.(2) Limitting the Western boundary of all the Colonies---;Did Connecticut put in her Claim on that Occasion or remonstrate against that bill---;Did she ever Claim the Western Territory before the Revolution---;the Quebeck act took in all that Country, and Virginia, had a right to what She Conquered with her own  May 4, 1786  arms, and the United States had a right to all the rest of that Country by Conquest. That the Crown did no more with respect to the Quebeck bill than, they did in grants of N.Y. & Pensylvania, by taking away what had been granted before---;therefore the Canada Bill having fixt the rights in the Crown the Land belongs to the United States by Conquest &c. My persecutors being hard at work agst me at home my stay was short in Congress at this Time.(3) Never the less I advised those who were disposed that way on a mode of seconding the Ordinance respecting the back lands and laying them open to sale. Also prevailed on leading Members to alter the principle of requisition for Taxes which had occasioned so much distress in the Country & as far as possible to Cure the Evils of former ones for several years past---;both these things were soon after done. While at Congress at this Time I was waited on by all the foreign officers & returned their visits. I was frequently waited on by Gardoqui the Spanish Ambassador---;Who seem'd particular in his Attention to me. Mr. Pierce & Mr. Burrel two of our Commissioners for settling Accts. and Mr. Anesty the English Commissioner for settling the Refugee Accts. board in the same House.

 Sir New York 5 May 1786 It has undoubtedly been said in England that the Act of congress of the 15 of February relative to the federal Revenues,(1) is full proof that the United States are in the utmost confusion, and that the Union is nearly dissolved---;ignorant as the People of England still are of the Genius and Temper of the Citizens of America, it will not be extraordinary that such Opinions should be fondly embraced---;when in fact the Resolutions, to which they refer to establish the Justice of their conclusions, have produced measures the reverse of their expectations, and most salutary in favor of our union. If the people are truly informed of their situation, they will eventually acceed to such Measures as will best secure their Freedom and Honor. Rhode Island, which had continued five Years in opposition to the system of a general impost upon the Terms recommended by Congress passed an Act agreeing to the system in consequence of the Act of congress of the 15 of Feb.; Georgia has likewise made the Grant, and Maryland has acceeded. New York has passed an Act upon the subject within a few days; it has not been before congress, but if I have heard it truly recalled, it is imperfect. However as twelve States have made the Grant to the acceptation of Congress, I think there can be little Doubt, but that the next Assembly of New York will fully acceed to the System,  May 5, 1786  and thereby authorise the commencement of a plan of Revenue substantial & productive. That there exists a criminal neglect in several of the states in their most important Duties to the confederacy cannot be denied. I hope a reform will take place. The People generally through the confederacy remark that we are at a crisis---;our Finances are not on that firm basis, which the Riches of our country will authorise without Danger to the liberties of the Citizens. Our commerce is almost ruined, because Jealousies of an unwarrantable nature have been disseminated through the more southern States. But there is good reason to expect that our Finances will be strengthened, and made certain---;and a proposition has originated in Virginia for a convention of Delegates, in September, from the several States to agree on such commercial regulations as shall extend the american navigation & promote the Trade of the Union. The most important states have already appointed Delegates for this purpose, to assemble in Maryland and if any thing can be concluded from the general Reputation of the Delegates already appointed, there is reason to hope that wisdom will govern their Deliberations, and that their Result will produce an union of Opinions on the subject of Commercial Regulations through all the States. The situation we are in with the Barbary powers is a great discouragement to certain Branches of Trade; Wheat may be shipped from America cheaper than has been the case for many years. Produce of all sorts has greatly fallen in price---;but it is difficult to persuade our Seaman to navigate unarmed vessels on those Seas where the Barbary corsairs cruize. The consequence is, that even our own merchants charter foreign Vessels which are protected from the Barbary Cruizers, to carry our produce to Market. We are in anxious expectation of the issue of the Barbary negotiations---;every one wishes the Abilities of our Country were more adequate to an effectual Bribery of these powers than they are; and my own wish always has been, that the small sum dedicated for these negotiations, had been put into abler hands than those of Mr. Lamb; but I suppose a better character could not be obtained by the commissioners when he was authorized. The arrets of the French King, relative to the cod Fishery, will very materially affect our Eastern Brethren.(2) The difference of 15 Livres the Quintal on the west India Fish destroys all competition. Add this farther circumstance concerning the west india Trade from the Eastern States---;you very well know that we took from the Islands large quantities of Molasses at a very low price, and distilled it into Rum with a hansome profit. Since the war the French Merchants & Planters have gone into the business of Distilling their molasses, of consequence they have increased the price; and so considerably as to affect the Profits of our Distillation. For all these disadvantages to which our   commerce is exposed there is a full remedy in the power of the States---;that remedy you long since have discovered and repetedly recommended. I hope the proper measures will be agreed to---;these inconveniences will urge their adoption; and in this view are far from disagreeable. They will teach America, what [s]he has to learn, that her Honor, prosperity, Riches, & Glory, must depend upon herself. I pray God that the day may soon arrive when all our fellow Citizens may see this subject in the same light that you do---;when this is the case, their natural good sense will dictate the necessary measures. With perfect respect I have the honor to be, Sir, You[r] obt. & very hble servt., Rufus King ""

 Brothers [May 5, 1786](1) We are glad to see you and to find that you have so great a friendship for our people. The United States alone possess the sovereign power within the limits described at the late Treaty of peace between them and the King of England. The white people who are subjects of that King must move off, from all the lands within these limits. The United States are therefore the most natural friends and Brothers of the Indians, as they will remain with them, when all the rest are gone. The United States are now at peace with the King of England and all the Kings of Europe. When that peace was made at the close of the late war the King of England gave up to the United States all the lands to the South of the great Lakes which are described in this Treaty. (The ratification of the definitive treaty signed with the hand of the King of great Britain was then produced and its contents explained to Captain O'Beel.) Here is the name of the King of England subscribed with his own hand and in this he gives to the United States the land of the Indians therein described. The treaty, which our Commissioners have shewn you is a true Copy from this Original,(2) you may assure your Nation, and all the Indian Nations that what the Commissioners of the United States have told them is true, and that all the treaties lately made with them, were made by order of Congress; and that Congress faithfully keeps their arrangements as specified in these Treaties. You may also assure the Indians that they tell lies, who say that the King of England has not in his late Treaty with the United States given up to them the lands of the Indians. They are also bad  May 5, 1786  men who say, that the United States will not abide by the Treaties, which they have lately made with the Indians by these Commissioners. The United States will take care that none of their Citizens shall intrude upon the Indians within the bounds which in the late Treaties were allotted for them to hunt and live upon; and if any of the people of the United States shall molest the Indians within the said bounds, upon a proper Representation they shall be calld to account for it.  Congress have under their Consideration a plan to open the path between them and the Indian Nations, and to send a trade among them, and will do what is right and proper for the Indians. We believe what you have said, and that you have been appointed to speak to us in behalf of your Nation. We do not therefore think it Necessary at present, to send any of our beloved men to your Council fire, but when it shall be necessary we will do it. Congress recommend it to you and all the Indians to remain quietly and peaceably on the lands allotted to them by the late Treaties; and if the people belonging to any other Nation, disturb them within those Lines, Congress desire that the Indians will make a proper Representation of the matter to them, and they will inform the King of those people of the conduct of his subjects and will use their endeavors that the Indians shall have justice done them. We present to you Captain Hutchins who is the Officer appointed by Congress to survey the lands purchased from the Indians at the late treaties. We recommend him and his Companions to your kind Offices and protection while agreeably to our orders he is employed in doing our business. Congress hopes to enjoy the friendship of the Indian Nations, and to live with them like brothers as long as the sun and Moon shall last. We recommend to you peace and a steady adherence to the Treaties made between the thirteen States and your people. We wish you a good Journey home, and pray that the great spirit above may direct you, and take you under his special care. ""

 Dear Gerry, New York 6 May 1786 I now inclose you Translations of the two Arrets concerning the cod Fishery.(1) Fifteen livres the quintal in favor of the French Fish introduced into the west Indies must destroy all competition. Will you inform me what will be the operation of these arrets on our Fishery. These Regulations were urged by our freind Marbois, and will afford him peculiar Gratification. If you have concluded your contract for the Cambridge Estate, will you inform me what it costs you? I request this information upon the idea that the contract is a notorious one, if this is not the case, you will consider the request as improperly made. Although I informed you in my last that Eight States only were represented and it was quite uncertain when a greater number would be on the Floor, yet the Fact now is, that north Carolina & Delaware have come on, and we number Ten States---;Two only from New England and a number of visionary projects already introduced and proposed to be adopted by Congress. What we shall do, I know not---;this is certain that I should feel much happier were the new England States all represented. No arrivals from Europe, consequently no foreign information---;nothing domestic has occurred worthy of communication, except that the assembly of New York this day broke up having granted the impost to Congress, to be collected by Officers of their own appointment & accountable to & removable by the Legislature---;the regulations to be of their own making, & the Duty to be paid in Paper money or  May 7, 1786  Specie at the option of the persons paying the Duty.(2) This you observe is a total Deviation from the Grants of every other state.

 Sir, New York 7th. May 1786. We do ourselves the honor to transmit herewith a Copy of a Representation from the Board of Treasury to Congress,(1) recommending the discharge of the additional Commissioner for liquidating and certifying the Claims of the Citizens of Pennsylvania against the United States and for settling the Accounts between the Union and that State. This Representation has not yet been acted upon in Congress, but it is likely to be, and probably will be taken up and decided upon in the Course of a few days. In the mean time it would be highly pleasing as well as instructing to us to be favoured with the Sentiments of Your Excellency and the Council on this Proposition.(2) We are induced to believe that a considerable Proportion of the Claims of the Citizens of Pennsylvania yet remain unliquidated, and that from the want of a General Knowledge among those Citizens of the time limitted for presenting their Claims, which expired the seventeenth of March last, many hundreds of those Claimants are now left remediless by other Means than an Application at the Treasury Office in New York; that considerable time must elapse, before Mr. Stelle can enter upon the Settlement of the State Account; and that therefore two Commissioners may yet continue to be usefully employed in Pennsylvania for some time to come. May 7, 1786  We have also conceived that it would be proper to obtain an Extension of the time for Claimants to present their Applications in Pennsylvania for the Reasons before suggested. Congress have been moved to grant such Extension in the State of New York, but without Success.(3) If Council should be of Opinion, that it ought to be done in Pennsylvania, we hope to be armed with their Instructions for that Purpose as early as may be. We also transmit the Report of a Committee on a Proposal of the State of Connecticut to cede part of the Claim of that State to lands lying Westward of Pennsylvania.(4) If the Proposal had been to cede the whole of the Claim of that State to the western territory, there would scarcely have been any hesitation in accepting it, without enquiring how far the Claim was well or ill founded. But an Apprehension that the Acceptance of a Part, as such, may be construed as an Admission of their Claim to the Residue, creates some difficulty. The proposed Deed in order to obviate this Objection, is worded in such manner as not to express any Reservation. The Delegates of Connecticut urge warmly for an Acceptance of this Cession. Cessions somewhat similar have been accepted from New York and Massachusets which are pleaded as Precedents. They urge as a Special Motive for our agreeing to it that it will induce the State of Connecticut to discountenance the farther Pretensions of the Delaware and Susquehanna Companies to Lands in Pennsylvania, and tend to detach the Real Settlers at Wyoming from the more disorderly Partizans of these Companies.(5) Permit us also to mention that an Advertisement has appeared in the Connecticutt Paper calling a Meeting of those Companies on the 17th of this Month for certain Purposes,(6) and amongst others to take Measures for counteracting the Machinations of the State of Pennsylvania. Some debate has already passed on this Report of the Committee and from the Warmth with which an early Decision is urged for we imagine a decision will be obtained in the Course of this Week, and from present Appearances it will probably be in favour of the Report. We have the honor to be very respectfully, Your Excellency's Most obedient and Most humble Servants,  Charles Pettit, for the Delegation.(7) ""

 Dear Sir New York May 11. 1786. Since my last I have recd. yours of Decr. 11th & Jany. 27th last.(1) Untill lately we have had so thin a Congress that few acts of consequence have pass'd, a very pointed recommendation to those States who have hitherto declin'd, to accede to the recommendation of(2) respecting a revenue system only excepted. Since which R. Island & Georgia have acceded to the impost fully, so that it now depends on New York, who has also granted it but under restrictions as to the officers to carry it into effect, & Pena. & Delaware who have limited the operation of that part wh. respects the impost to the adoption of the other or supplementary funds by all the States, having adopted both themselves. I am inclin'd to believe this measure will pass the union in the course of the year, so as to be carried into operation. We have now 11 States present & a member from the other two---;it is expected we shall have the 13 shortly. The Commissrs. for treating with the western & southern Indians have concluded treaties in both instances with the principal tribes & return'd a stat[e]ment lately of their proceedings to Congress.(3) The object for wh. these commissions was instituted seems to be now fully obtain'd, and as further managment of those tribes so as to regulate the trade & keep up a good understanding with them, is to be effected by some permanent arrangment, I apprehend these commissions will be annull'd and such system adopted. The subject is now before a Committee.(4) In my last I mention'd to you that the propriety of the acts of Congress founded on the condition of the acts of cession from the States, fixing the limits of the States westwd. was question'd. A proposition or rather a report is before Congress recommending it to Virga. & Mass. to revise their acts as to that condition so as to leave it to the U.S. to make what division of the same future circumstances may make necessary, subject to this proviso, \""that the sd. territory be divided into not less than two nor more than five states.\""(5) The plan of a temporary govt. to be instituted by Congress & preserv'd over such district untill they shall be admitted into Congress is also reported.(6) The outlines are as follows. Congress are to appoint, as soon as any of the lands shall be sold, a govr., Council, Judges, secretary to the Council, & some other officers; the Govr. & Council to have certain powers untill they have a certain number of inhabitants, at wh. they are to elect representatives to form a genl. assembly---;to consist of the govr. & council & sd. house of representatives. It is in ef- May 11, 1786  fect to be a colonial govt. similar to that wh. prevail'd in these States previous to the revolution, with this remarkable & important difference that when such districts shall contain the number of the least numerous of the \""13 original States for the time being\"" they shall be admitted into the confederacy. The most important principles of the act at Annapolis(7) are you observe preserv'd in this report. It is generally approv'd of but has not yet been taken up. The treaty with Prussia will be shortly ratified and forwarded for exchange.(8) Upon the subject of commerce I have nothing new to give you. The plan of a convention at Annapolis which I believe will be carried into effect, has taken the subject from before Congress. As it originated with our State we think it our duty to promote its object by all the means in our power.(9) Of its success I must confess I have some hopes. The investigation of the subject will always be of advantage since truth and sound state policy in every instance will urge the commission of the power to the U. States. You will be surpris'd to hear that I have form'd the most interesting connection in human life, with a young Lady in this town, as you know my plan was to visit you before I settled myself, but having form'd an attachment to this young Lady (a Miss Kortright, the daughter of a gentn. of respectable character & connections in this state tho' injur'd in his fortunes by the late war) I have found that I must relinquish all other objects not connected with her. We were married abt. three months since. I remain here untill the fall at wh. time we remove to Fredericksbg. in Virga. where I shall settle for the present in a house prepard for me by Mr Jones to enter into the practice of the law. I intended to have made you a remittance by this packet to replace the money you have advanc'd for the Encyclopedia but have been unable. I shall not neglect this. We were unfortunate in an imposition at Annapolis---;but yrs. I hope ended there---;mine has since been encreas'd. A young Mr. Grymes in the most iminent distress, prevail'd on me lately to be responsible for his payment of 50Â£ Virga. currency. He moved off and the payment fell on me. I have since made application to his father in Orange(10) who I hear disowns him and will have nothing to say to his engagments. My friend Short will I hope pardon my not writing him at present---;a variety of circumstances have interrupted me for a few days since, so as to put it out of my power. If the packet does not sail tonight I will. I observe the {king of France}(11) has {issued} an {edict} to encourage his own {fisheries}. I mention this more for the purpose of suggesting to you that this event has reach'd us circuitously---;that this circumstance has been noted here. There are always some who deal in things of this kind and although it was no sooner suggested, and that in {private}, than an apology was made for the suggestion, yet I have thought proper to {bring it to your view}.

 My dear Son, New York May 14th. 1786. I have receiv'd yr. several favours of the 25th of Decr. 1785, Febry 21st, March 4th, & 28th 1786, but not in the Order in which they were written, the first having come to hand last of all. To that of Jany. 24th, which arrived first, I answer'd by the only Opportunity that has offer'd of writing since you left us. I heartily bless God for the restoration & continuance of your Health, & for your favourable prospects in business. We too through the favour of Heaven have been bless'd with good health upon the whole, tho' as I mention'd to you, Charles had had a Fever of short continuance, & I have this Spring had several returns of the Gout, but they have happily not been severe; nor confined me for any length of time, & the whole Family seem now to be in perfect health. Mr. Verplank & Betsey are on a Visit at Stratford, where I have not been since the beginning of March, but hope soon to make an excursion there. Mr. Verplank go's to Fish Kill before they return here. Our Winter has been moderate, but the Spring is backward, as the phrase is. The severest snow Storm since you left us, was on the first of April. In the fine Climate of Bermudas, I presume, you experience few inconveniencies from the changes of Weather which give us so much trouble here. Your Introduction into that country has been favourable, & I hope your continuance (while you shal1 chuse to remain there) will be equally fortunate & agreeable. It was particularly fortunate, it seems, that you fell so early into Mr. Van Dams hands, from whom I had a very friendly Letter upon the subject & have returned him my hearty thanks for his kindness to you, & pray God he may have a happy Meeting with his sister & Neices, who go in the Vessel by which I expect to send this. I am also under very great Obligations to the Governor, & all those other Gentlemen you mention, who have shewn you so much polite Attention, to whom I wish you, if it be proper, to present my Compliments & assure them of my gratitude. It gives me particular pleasure to see that you have so speedily & successfully engaged in Business, & pursue it with so much Ardour. You seem at once to have adopted the true Spirit of business, to engage boldly in everything, & to labour earnestly in all things; It is the sure road to fame & fortune, & tho' it is not to be expected but that you will meet with difficulties in affairs, yet I hope by perseverance & assiduity, you will experience the truth of Seneca's observation \""Non quia difficilia sunt, non Andemus; sed quia non Andemus, difficilia sunt.\""(1) The Admiralty Cause was indeed a bold undertaking at so early a period of your Practice, but it was happily successful, & success justifies the boldest at- May 14, 1786  tempts. Even failure is sometimes honourable in noble & generous designs. Est quoddam magnis cecidere Ausis.(2) I am much obliged to you for your frequent & particular Letters & hope you will continue them, that we may be as often as possible acquainted with the situation of your affairs. The last Vessel, said to come from Bermudas, bro't us none; but we trust it was accidental, & console ourselves with those we have receiv'd, & the pleasing hope that others are on the way, & may soon arrive. We will certainly sell your Farm, as soon as it can be done to any tolerable advantage. But in truth there is so little Money in our Country, & so much Land at Market, that the prospect of obtaining a beneficial price for it, is by no means favourable. I shall however be attentive to it, as far as my situation will admit of. Charles, I imagine is now at Middletown taking what Care he can of it, & I have directed him to offer it for sale at every probable opportunity. I shall also endeavour to sell Property of my own whenever I can do it to advantage, & it will be indifferent to me out of what funds I advance to you, provided I can but obtain what is necessary for you, & yr. Brother & Sisters. But in all these matters, you are sensible, my residence here produces unavoidable embarrassments & delays, which however I will surmount in the best manner I can. I will certainly procure, if possible, a Copy of our Act of Confiscation for Mrs. Brown(3) when I go again into Connecticut. You are sensible that our Laws have been revised since the War, & consequently that those temporary Acts are out of Print, but at worst I can have it transcribed from the old Law Book. As far as I now recollect, it do's not specifically comprehend Estates Tail, & consequently cannot affect the Estate in Remainder after the Death of the Tenant in Possession who incur'd the Forfeiture, but there is no dependance to be plac'd upon Memory in such Cases, & we have so few entail'd Estates that it could hardly have been an object of attention. Charles has sent some Books, but not all that I wrote for. Whether he could not find them, or what other reason there was for it, I cannot tell, as there is no Letter come with them. I shall buy Burrough's Repts.(4) here that you may have a good series of L. Mansfields Decisions, & add a French Book or two which I have with me. There are no Books properly upon the Theory & Practice of the Admiralty that I know of except Praxis CuriÃ¦ Admiralitatis, & the Practe. of the Ecclesiastl. Courts therein Cited.(5) An old Edition of the latter is sent, the former is not come, & must be deferr'd till I go to Connecticut, when I will also select some other Books for you. The Practice of the Admiralty, of the Ecclesiastical Courts, & in Chancery you are sensible all stand on the same general ground, & are derived from the Civil Law, so that the same general Principles apply to them all. The Books of Practice in Chancery are very similar, the Cursus CancellariÃ¦(6) now sent you may I hope answer your purpose for the present, but if there is any other   more in Use with you upon mentioning it I will, if possible, procure, & send it to you. The Causes Celebres are French, somewhat in your professional line, & tho' odd Volus. it makes no difference, as the Cases are totally unconnected & independent of each other. I will send you other volumes of them, if, upon trial, you find this kind of reading agreeable & useful to you. I am unfortunately disappointed with respect to Burrough's Repts.---;there is not a set of them to be had in New York. I have therefore substituted Stranges(7) & Wilson's Repts.(8) & even of the latter I am obliged to borrow a second hand set under an engagement to replace them with new ones as soon as the Ships arrive from Ireland, when I hope also I shall be able to get Burrough for you. Such other Books as you particularly wish to have you will mention. The Squash Seeds you desired, you will find in the Trunk, & by way of Stowage I have added the News Papers since the Middle of March, which tho' not important may afford you some amusement. Charles is return'd from Middletown, & says in a Letter to me \""Seth Wetmore wishes much to buy the Lott Walker has sown with Wheat. He offers Â£5.5.0 per Acre for it, & I am told it is its full value, & the disposal of it will not hurt the sale of the farm.\"" Perhaps he has written you more fully in the Letter I forward you from him. And you will say whether it will be agreeable to you to sell this piece of Land detach'd from that residue of the farm, or not. They were all well at Stratford two days ago. I enclose you the key of the Trunk & a List of the articles contain'd in it, & am with the most ardent Prayers for your health & felicity, & compts. to Mr. Van Dam, Capt. Bascom &c, yr. most affectionate Father & Friend. Wm. Saml. Johnson ""

 My dear friend, New York 14 May 1786 You must know the deranged condition of the confederacy. New York has granted the impost to be paid in paper money, & to be collected by Officers amenable to & removable by themselves, and under Regulations formed by their Legislature.(1) This Grant you see is a mere name---;the consequence is, that Congress not having it in their power to put the impost in Operation, no money will come into the federal Treasury. You may be assured that our Barbary Negotiations will issue in a fruitless attempt for peace. Instead of 80,000 Dollars, it turns out that 200,000 Guineas will be the least sum necessary to accomplish this Object in a proper mode---;will you tell me where the money can be had? Will the Merchants lend it, or any part of it? I have letters from Mr. Adams by the Ships which arrived last week from London. The Newfoundland Bill is renewed, and Mr. Jenkinson who is of the ministerial party, moved, and obtained leave, in the commons to bring in \""a Bill vesting in his Majesty the regulation of the intercourse between his Dominions & the U.S. of America\""(2)---;this procedure demonstrates the Sentiments of the ministry to be against any commercial treaty---;and I look upon the business of Mr. Adams on this subject as fully concluded. An explicit refusal has been given to the demand for a surrender of the posts;(3) and the refusal grounded on a violation of the Treaty in America by the laws passed, and existing, creating \""legal impediments to the recovery of the Debts due to the British Creditors---;the particular laws are pointed out; and it pleases me to find that there is no complaint agt. any State in New England except Mass, and even that not founded or truly stated. I allude to the Resolve suspending a Judgement for interest &c &c which I think justifiable & no violation of the Treaty. These are facts and observations which do not require my comment. I am mortified as the Citizen of an enlightened State, by the publications in Boston defamatory of an order or class of men to which I myself belong---;the proceedings of several Towns in correspondence with these publications, forbode a confusion which virtuous men must deprecate---;to what length the authors of these measures intend to extend them I am unable to say. One inconvenience only will accrue to me in consequence of them. I intended to have returned home in Time, but as the Legislature will then be in Session, I am doubtful of doing it, lest it should be supposed I have in Contemplation to canvass for a Reelection as a delegate. May 14, 1786  Should I return early, and resign my Trust, to which I have no manner of objection, it may be said on the other hand that this measure proceeded from a fear, or conviction, that I should not be reelected. I am a little embarrassed. I assure you as my friend, that I shall retire the instant, I discover any of those legislative measures, which I think by no means improbable to take place---;the correction of abuses is wise, but an indiscriminate attack upon a class of men, prostrating the virtuous Citizen with the Knave, is wholly unworthy the Justice or moderation of Government. I have a remedy in my power. Adieu my dear friend, your's affectionately, R King ""

An amicable adjustment of the Differences on that Subject, is and has been an Object of my earnest Wishes, and I am confident that it has been for some Time past a prevailing Disposition of the Councils of Pennsylvania to treat these Settlers [with] Lenity and Generosity as far as they will permit [such] Treatment to be safely administered. I have conceived also that the Settlers themselves have a Disposition to become orderly Citizens on reasonable Terms, if they were permitted to think and act for themselves undisturbed by the unjust and irritating Suggestions of designing Men who may conceive it to be their Interest to keep up the Ball of Contention, in order to avail themselves by Force, under Cover of Tumult & Confusion, of Possessions which an orderly Discussion would not assign to them. It is said, and I believe with Truth, that many People drawn from the neighbouring States since the Decision of Trenton, under pretence of assisting the afflicted, now claim the Rights of Possession. Whether the Conduct of certain People acting or pretending to act under the Authority of the State of Pennsylvania in 1783 & 1784, did or did not afford a plausible pr[etext] for the Settlers to associate with these Auxiliaries,(1) I shall not now pretend to say. The Transactions alluded to did not meet with the Approbation of the People of Pennsa. nor of the Legislature. The Disapprobation of the Government was shewn by the  May 14, 1786  Punishment in a legal Course of some of the Offenders;(2) but the Misconduct of Persons on both Sides had run so high, that it became the Wish of good Men to cover, as with a Veil, Enormities which could not have been strictly accounted for in a legal Course without endangering many Lives & hazarding Consequences which every good Man would deprecate. The Assembly chosen in 1784 were much disposed to lenient Measures. In March 1785 They sent a respectable Committee of their own Body to confer with the Settlers in a conciliatory way, to enquire into their Complaints, their Expectations & their Wishes. The Report of this Committee did not fully justify the Expectations which had been formed of the Moderation & conciliatory Disposition of the Settlers. The State was nevertheless disposed to Moderation as far as could be consistent with the necessary Dignity of Government. An Act was passed, at a Subsequent Session, for quieting the Disturbances at Wyoming & for pardoning such offenders as should enter in to Recognizance by a certain Day for future good Behaviour.(3) In the early part of the last Session a Resolution was passed to strengthen the Hands of the Executive in Case Force should become necessary, and some of the old Leaven of Resentment seemed to urge for Active Measures; but towards the Close of the Session it subsided, & the Minority joined with an appearance of Cordiality in lenient Views. A Bill was brought in & published for Consideration for laying off a new County in which Wyoming will probably be the Seat of Justice.(4) By this the People will have the Choice of their Officers [from among] themselves, and be the Jurors to try the Causes arising within the County. If they prudently improve the Opportunity, the Bill will probably be enacted at the next Session,(5) and by it I imagine they may obtain every reasonable Object of their wishes. Having not the Acts & Resolutions alluded to with me the Information I now give you may be less minute than you wish, but the general Tendency of it I believe it substantially right. I hope the Wise & the Prudent in your State will embrace this Opportunity to induce such of their Friends as are interested in the Welfare of the Settlers at Wyoming to act with Prudence & Discretion. In such Case I doubt not the establishment of Peace and a fair Investigation of and Decision upon every reasonable Claim to Property in that Part of the Country. I am, Dear Sir, with much Esteem, Your most obedient Servant, Chas. Pettit(6) ""

 Sir New-York May 14th 1786 Your favor of the 9th of February with the pamphlet inclosed came to hand on the 13th instant for which please to accept my thanks. Your official dispatches of the 4th of March contain very important intelligence. I am not distressed at the footing on which the British put their tenure of the western posts. It will promote the general cause of justice & restrain our legislatures from interfering in private contracts which they are too apt to do.(1) The Algerine depredations have made more converts to the necessity of vesting Congress with larger powers and of supporting public credit than the many labored addresses heretofore presented to the public. I hope for much good out of these partial evils. Mr Dilly has declined publishing my history from an apprehension that it would expose him to prosecutions.(2) I cannot but be of opinion that his apprehensions are ill founded. I expect the end of the matter will be a pirated edition & that mine will remain unsold. I flatter myself he will make no difficulty in furnishing you with the copy designed for your own use. Congress have now eleven States on the floor. I have to tell for the first six months we did not for four days exceed eight. A strange languor seemed to prevail; but I hope it is going off. When the contents of your last dispatches are communicated confidentially to the Gover- May 14, 1786  nors I think they will produce salutary consequences. The British posts will effect a repeal of every legal impediment to the recovery of debts. The Foreign debt will force on us systems of revenue which will also comprehend the Domestic debt. Things for some time past have been proceeding from bad to worse. I trust we have already reached the point of ultimate depression from which public affairs will revert in a direction contrary to what they have lately been in. The States seem generally impressed with ideas of the necessity of commercial systems. Almost all have appointed deputies to attend the proposed convention in Annapolis. A plan will shortly be brought into Congress to recommend a continental convention for the purpose of enlarging the powers of Congress. Our government hitherto has rather been advisory than an efficient system. You do me great honor by requesting a continuance of my correspondence. Your letters have given me infinite pleasure & have established your reputation in the minds of every member of Congress as not only the industrious but the able Statesman. In this opinion no one joins more heartily than he who has the honor to subscribe himself with the most exalted sentiments of respect & esteem your most obedient & very humble servant, David Ramsay.(3) ""

The following day Secretary John Jay was ordered to consider and report on the documents, the ramifications of which were so far-reaching that the \""Injunctions of secresy [were] taken off 17 May.\"" Carefully considering whether state infringement of a national treaty constituted a violation of the peace, Jay concluded in his voluminous report of October 13 that under the 9th article of Confederation Congress had \""the sole and exclusive right and power of determining war and peace, and of entering into treaties and alliances,\"" and therefore \""the Legislatures of the several States cannot of right pass any Act or Acts for interpreting, explaining or construing a National treaty.\"" All such acts should be \""forthwith repealed\"" as a necessary pre-condition to serious negotiations with Great Britain on the contested points.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York 17th. of May 1786 Yours of the 22d ult came safe to hand, for which I thank you, & should have answered it before had not my hands been full. Mrs. Manning informed me of the application to you to be my successor in the Meeting at Providence. I should be happy in your society & should Providence order your Lot there I shall, while there contribute my best endeavours to render your Life happy & useful to the People; but think it best to interfere as little as may be with their determinations in setting a Minister, as I conceive it might lessen my Influence in his favour, when settled, should they have it in their power, when his support might be felt, to say that I was any means of it. Not that I hereby mean to excuse myself from doing my personal duty in that case; which I hope would be a pleasure. I hope, should you accept of their Invitation, that your Piety would more than compensate the defect of Politeness, a high degree of which I cannot deem primarily essential in a Gospel Preacher, any more than distinguished Rusticity. Habits of easiness in access & gentle unaffected manners are most pleasing in that Character. I hope you may have the Pleasure to find that your Labours at Providence are followed with a blessing. The Lord is doing wonders in this City & its vicinity; but especially in the Jerseys, at the Plains, Mount Clair,  Piscataway & Cranberry. I attended the June Meeting. Mr Runyan, on Saturday baptized 12. The Sabbaturian Minister 3. Great Power appeard to attend the Preaching---;multitudes appeared deeply affected, &, during the Meeting several professed to be brought into Gospel Liberty. Such a Meeting I believe was never seen at Piscataway before---;I am told the Thirsay following 12 were baptized at Quibble- May 17, 1786  town, & Lords day 13 at the Plains. There appears a remarkable turn in the Minds of the People, throughout that quarter. Mr Wilson flames out & is remarkably blessed, & goes on Preaching, Exhorting & baptizing from place to place, with surprizing success. The Lord, indeed, is doing great things in this Land. Of your mother I can give no Information, but presume she is living, or Mr Guthrie or your Brother Jeremiah would have told me of her death. My situation here is, indeed, very awkward without a Colleague, without money, & in dout what to resolve on. Our public Affairs wear a cloudy Aspect, I hope it is that the Interposition of Heaven may be seen in extricating us from difficulty. His former unmerited favour to this guilty Land, encourages one to hope for it, though it should almost be against hope. The Savages have begun their barbarous depredations on our Western frontiers, but probably not without Provocation from some of that Lawless Banditti which forms the Van of those Settlements. It is expected, on investigation, this will be found true. Many of the innocent must, doubtless, be involved in ruin in consequence of it. The wretched deranged State of the finances of the federal Government, will allow us, if disposed, to afford these People but feeble aids.  I am treated with respect by Congress & the Heads of departmts, and think the present Congress possess great Integrity, & a good share of Abilities, but for want of more States on the floor the public, & important Business is from day to day neglected. We are, however, in daily expectation of a fuller Delegation. If personal matters could be so adjusted that I were not disquieted, I should be very happy in my Situation here, for I commonly preach onc[e] or twice on Lords Days, either in Town, Long, or Statten Island or in the Jerseys.

 Sir New York 18 May 1786. The revival of the Newfoundland bill in the late Session of Parliament & the renewal of the Act vesting in the King in Council the regulation of the intercourse between the US & his dominions is satisfactory evidence to every impartial man, that Great Britain will not enter into a commercial treaty with this Country; & that if the accomplishment of that measure is the only object of the residence of a minister at London, Mr. Adams may be recalled without farther delay or disappointment. These acts are for one year, & if during that term the States of America continue as destitute of an union of measures, as they have remained since the peace they will probably be made perpetual---;unless the fear of a rival in America induces the British Government to relax their Navigation Acts, no other motive will; for in fact the effect of every project of a commercial treaty must be an alteration of the Laws of Navigation. The present ministry are unquestionably against a treaty; indeed were they well disposed to treat they would not dare do it without the approbation of Parliament; there the measure would find few or no advocates---;the nation is wedded to their ancient regulations; & the prejudices of the Kingdom are so much in favor of the Navigation Laws, that he must be a bold minister who should propose an alteration.(1) It is said however & from probable authority, that the Nation would have relaxed these Laws in favour of the United Netherlands could  May 18, 1786  they thereby have prevented the defensive alliance between them & the King of France. But the party of the Prince of Orange, together with a corrupt attempt of the english minister, failed, & the alliance was concluded in November last. It was tho't that this alliance would have disposed the British ministry to measures of friendship with our Country, & that apprehensive that the United States might become a party in this combination they would not readily deny or refuse to evacuate the posts now possessed in America in contravention of the treaty. In pursuance of this idea & under instructions for that purpose Mr Adams made a demand for an evacuation & surrender; & in February Lord Carmarthen delivered to Mr Adams the answer of the King which declares his Majesty's firm determination to abide by, & carry into full & complete effect every part of the definitive treaty of Peace between his Majesty & the US but remarks that it cannot be expected that his Majesty will carry the same into effect unless he discovers a disposition in the US in like manner to abide by & execute the same. That the 4th article of the treaty stipulates that no legal impediments shall be opposed to the recovery of the bona fide debts of British creditors, but that Laws exist in many of the American States which are interpreted by their respective Judicatories legal impediments to such recovery---;that so long as these impediments remain in violation of the Treaty on the part of the US they have no right to require a full compliance therewith on the part of his Majesty; but that his Majesty will unequivocally execute the same as soon as he is ascertained that a similar disposition prevails in the United States.(2) An abstract of the Laws of the several States which are said to be in violation of the treaty was delivered by Lord Carmarthen to Mr Adams, & by this minister, transmitted to Congress.(3) No Acts of any of the four New England States are complained of, except the Act of Massachusetts, passed in 1784 relative to interest, this however is not truly stated, & as it exists cannot be construed in contravention of the treaty. It is a pleasing reflection, that nothing is charged against any of the States on the subject of the Refugees---;this silence tends to evince the truth of the construction which has been contended for by many persons in America that the clauses in the treaty relative to a restitution of their property & their residence within the States are merely recommendatory, & not absolute. The foregoing communications are considered as of the first political importance. I have written in much haste; but judging the information necessary, I have tho't it my duty to transmit it to you as first Magistrate of our Commonwealth---;my remarks are totally unnecessary---;one truth is most obvious, \""that the happiness, prosperity, & safety of Our Country must depend upon the United Systems & exer  tions of the several States & not on the seperate arrangments of individual States, or the kindness, favor or friendship of foreign nations.\"" Mr Gorham informs me that he shall write to you in answer to your last.

Two days since we recd. dispatches from Mr. Adams in which he informs us of his demand of the surrender of the posts, & remonstrance agnst the violation of the treaty also in the instance of the negroes, with the answer of the minister to his memorial.(1) In this answer it is stated that the King admits a violation in those points on his part, but on the other hand states the instances of violation on our part with respect to the debts in particular enumerating the acts of all the States contravening it, finally giving assurance that it is the Kings desire to carry the treaty fully into effect on his part provided the U S. will do the same on theirs. This I think is the amt. of the communication recd. & from which the injunction of secrecy is remov'd. It appears as if his expectation was that we shod. take the first steps in this business.

 Thursday May 18th 1786. In Congress. Mr. Johnson moved to Take into Consideration the Connecticut Cession.(1) Mr. J. Wilson (Pensylvania). Objected that if Congress accepted this Cession it woud imply that Connecticut had a right to grant and of Course, to the ungranted Territory between this Grant and the West bounds of Pensylvania, and that He Suspected under cover of this they wou'd renew their Claim to that part of Pensylvania that was lately decided against them in favour of P---;---; by the federal Court at Trent Town. That the United States had never pretended To Claim the Territory reserved or ungranted by Virginia, New York and Massachusetts, but that their acceptation of the part Ceded was considered as a ful acknowledgmt. of the part of the United States, that the Ceding State was entitled to the reserved Territory, and that this Construction was Agreable to the Municipal as well as to the Law of Nature & Nations, &c. &c. &c. Mr. Johnson, replied, That Connecticut only wanted Congress to Accept their Cession on the Same Terms that they had done those of the other States, That according to the Idea of Congress, the Accepting those Cessions only Operated as an Extinguishment of the Claim of the State in the Lands Ceded and Not as an approbation of the Claim of such State to the Land reserved or Not granted. &c. &c. &c. That as to the Claim of Connecticut to the Lands held by the Delaware & Juniata companies which been determined by the federal Court to be in Pensylvania, there was no intention of Connecticut actg. against the Decission of that Court &c. &c. Mr. Wilson then introduced a Motion, to make it a Condition in accepting this Cession that Connecticut shoud ackowledge the right of Pensylvania to said Lands &c. May 18, 1786  Mr. King (Massachusetts) then observed that this was unnecessary and improper, That the Matter had been decided in a Regular Judicial Manner by a Court appointed agreable to the Confederation for that purpose. And that it had been the Uniform Idea of Congress, that these Cessions were only Considered as an Extinguishment of the Claim of the State to the Lands Ceded and that the acceptation thereof by Congress was not to be Considered An Acknowlegment of the Claim of the State to any Lands reserved or not Ceded; That therefore the Claim of Connecticut to the Lands not Ceded would be in the same situation after acceptation as before, that it woud be neither better nor worse, therefore all provisos were unnecessary. Mr. Dana(2) (Massachusetts) spoke to the same purpose. Mr. Mitchel (Rhode Island)(3) spoke to the same purpose. Mr. Grason (Virginia) Objected to the Amendment, for several reasons, he said that he Considered the Accepting the Cession as an Acknowledgement of the right of Connecticut not only in the Lands Ceded but in the Lands reserved or not Granted, And that this Amendment confirmed that acknowledgement. That the grant of Virginia differed from this Grant, that grant only reserved the Lands to the Southward of the Oye, and had granted all the Lands north of that River to the United States as well the jurisdiction as Soil, That New York and Massachusetts had done the same and their grants included the same Territory that Connecticut now Claims both to Cede & reserve, and therefore it would be Acknowledging the right of Connecticut in the 120 Miles reserved, that is in the Territory already granted to the united States. &c. &c. Mr. Carrington, (Virginia) Spoke to the same purpose. Mr. Monroe (Virginia) Spoke to the same purpose and then Moved an Amendment (to wit) \""Provided also that Accepting the said Cession shall not be Taken or deem[ed] an Acknowledgement of the Right of Connecticut in the Land laying between the said Cession & the West boundary of Pennsylvania heretofore ceded to the United States by Virginia, New York and Masachusetts.\"" Mr. Pinkney (S.

Pray have you not obtained the money necessary? If not are you likely to obtain it & when? I wish you to inform me by the first opportunity. Some great national matters are now before Congress, and are suspended for a fuller Representation. Eleven States are now on the Floor. New Hampshire & Rhode Island are the only delinquent states. You see that what is called the Southern Interest, has greatly the Advantage of the Eastern, and, in many cases, we have found the want of these two States. But I know you are not delinquent of choice. If you are doubtful of your being able to come at all, I should wish to know it by the first Opportunity, that I may make my Arrangements accordingly. I perceive that [our] State have directly violated the Treaty with Great Britain in making the Paper Money a tender in all cases of debts contracted before its Emission. You may find this in the 4th Article of that Treaty. We have just received, through Mr. Adams, the British Minister's Answer to the demand to deliver up the western Posts; & he assigns as the principal reason the Laws made in several States, whereby British Subjects are deprived of their Property, as they cannot recover their Bona fide Debts, as stipulated in the Treaty. Congress have now referred to a Committee to report the necessity of respealing all these Laws, & sending it forward to ob[t]ain, as soon as possible, a repeal of such Laws in the respective States. I am sorry that Rhode Island is now to be ranked in the Number of the States, which have violated the Treaty aforesaid.

Be good enough to accept my affectionate Gratitude for your polite and freindly congratulations, at the same Time be assured that the event must be far more extraordinary than marriage, which will separate me from Massachusetts; the Frenzy however, which at this Time possesses numbers of our fellow Citizens relative to our profession, if carried to an Extent by no means improbable, would go farther in my mind, towards removing my Residence than almost any imaginable Event. I forbear writing a Detail on the subjects before Congress, Questions of the highest national Magnitude are at this Time under their consideration; and if the Wisdom of our Confederacy is now fully represented, my ideas of the Abilities of our country men have been improperly magnified, and I am forced to the Beleif, that Great Events are more frequently the Effects of Accident, than the Result of human systems. The British ministry will not consent to any commercial Treaty with Mr. Adams, they know our disjointed condition, and despise us. Mr. Adams demanded the Evacuation of the Posts, and has been officially refused. Repeal your laws against the Recovery of British Debts before you demand a compliance with the Treaty on our part, is the language of the Reply to Mr. Adams's Demand. Eighty Thousand Dollars were appropriated for the Barbary Treaties---;the sum is too small, 150,000 Guineas being the least sum necessary. May 21, 1786  There is no money in the federal Treasury---;the civil list is in arrear---;the Troops in service mutinous for pay---;the loans abroad exhausted---;the foreign Ministers destitute of Funds to draw on for their Daily support---;and the payments maid by the four Eastern & three southern States for 15 Months past not equal to 4 thousand Dollars. Adieu---;Believe me my Dr. Sir your affectionate freind, Rufus King ""

The Packet for France in whose bag I put your letters sailed the 14th instant since which finding Vessels have arrived from England---;by whom Congress have received letters from Mr Adams, as late as the beginning of March in one of which he says Lord Carmarthen has officially informed him that his Britanick Majesty was determined to hold the western posts until the United States on thier part manifest a real determination to fulfil the treaty among things less important the States of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and the Massachusetts must repeal certain acts now in existance that prevents justice being done to British creditors.(1) Mr. Adams likewise advises Congress that an envoy is in London from Tripole on the business of bringing about a treaty with us---;he was very particular in his questions respecting extent, climate and soil of this country and from the information he received aforesaid it was a great country. But Tripole was at war with us but are disposed to be at peace which was his business with him---;he has proposed to Mr Adams to make a perpetual peace for 30,000 guineas 12,500 paid in land and 3,000 per annum---;until the 30,000 are paid. He has assured him that Tunis and Morocco are ready to agree to their terms and has no doubt but the Algerine Monarch will come into the same agreement which four sums will amount to 120,000 Guineas besides a large present that must be made to the Ambassadors and 500 guineas to each consul. I am inclined to think that this business including all charges will cost 200,000 guineas. Mr Jefferson is arrived in London to assist Mr Adams in negotiating this affair. We have eleven States on the floor sincerely wish New Hampshire was here for it appears to me New England should never be unrepresented. The act of Assembly of New York passed in consequence of the recommendation of Congress of the 28th April 1783 is together with all  May 22, 1786  the other acts on the same subjects, referred to a committee whose report will be before Congress in a few days(2) at which time I will do myself the honor to inform you how far the several States have complied with said recommendation.

 Sir,(1) New York 24th May 1786(2) I have examined your plan for empelling a Boat forward by the force of a steam engine, and do apprehend it to be rather too complicated to succeed well in practice. The Well and pump which you propose for obtaining a partial vacuum is certainly necessary yet perhaps injecting of cold water into the cylinder would be better as it would obtain a compleater vacuum. The horizontal position of the cylinder may be proper for the reasons you mention and also for the more convenient application of the power, yet I fear it will be apt to make a leaky Piston---;but as action and reaction are equal may not the end proposed be obtained simply by discharging the steam under the surface of the Water at the stern of the Boat; no objection lies against it, but the great expence of steam. However I wish you success in whatever mode you may pursue and am sir Your obedient svt, Jos. Hornblower(3) ""

November last a memorial to the ministry requiring a delivery of the posts & compensation for the infraction of the treaty respecting the negroes, to which he recd for answer \""that it was unquestionably true that by the 7th article the posts shod. have been evacuated, but that by the 4th and 5th it was also stipulated that there shod. be no legal impediment in the way of the recovery of British debts---;that these articles had been violated by almost every state in the confederacy.

We have lately been much perplex'd by a proposition from Connecticut for ceding her claim to territory westward 120 miles of the Pena. Line by which she obtains a right by implication to 120 miles. We have been informed that she & Pena. are on the point of variance with respect to Wiomin & that this land is necessary to satisfy the Susquehannah & Delawar Companies of Connecticut who create this mischief, whereby peace will be restor'd to the union. We are also assurd that unless we accept this cession Connecticut will open an office for the whole degree claim'd by her to the Missisippi for sale. A proposition has been made reserving to the U.S. whatever they have acquir'd under the cession of Virga., & negativ'd, & one confirming the decree of Trenton or rather requiring that Connecticut shod. cede her claim to Pena. as therin decreed met with the same fate, the latter as connected with the former which being negativ'd gave a more pointed implication in favor of Connecticut.

 Dear Sir New York May 26th. 1786. I wrote to you sometime since informing you, that I had requested Mr. L.

Wm. and at which I meant to attend; I am sorry to inform you that I have never recieved a line from him in answer, neither do I know whether any steps have been taken relative to the affair. When I undertook this business I did it in expectation of being able to go through with it agreable to your satisfaction, and in such a manner as would advance both your and my interests; I now, (in consequence of my appointment to Congress) find it extremely inconvenient to conduct the matter in such a manner as will an[s]wer your expectations or satisfy my own feelings: the great distance, between this and our State, and the duties imposed upon me by the trust which has devolvd on me, will I hope be a sufficient reason with you for this request; & which I would not make if I thought I could give you satisfaction in the management of it; but which however seems impossible on account of the above mentioned causes: I am willing however to do you justice and to make you immediate satisfaction for the small tract of land purchased, which will be some assistance in conducting the suit; I shall be extremely thankful for an answer to this letter, immediately; all I am sorry for is that I had not made the proposition on my being first appointed to Congress. We have very little news here; Mr. Adams has informed us, he has made a demand of the Posts & been refused by the Brittish Court: the King it seems will not comply on his part till the states shew a disposition on theirs to carry into effect that part of the treaty which relates to the debts.

 Sir New York 26 May 1786 Agreeably to the directions of the General Assembly at their Session at Greenwich I proceeded to New York & took my seat in Congress, as a Deligate, the 2d of this Inst., in full expectation that General Miller would follow me in a few Days, with the necessary supply of money, to support us; but to my surprise I have not heard from the General since my departure from Rhode Island. Destitute of money to defray my necessary Expences, & at a loss to conjecture the reasons of the General's delay, you must naturally conclude my situation is far from being agreeable. I wish to be informed whether the State mean to support a Representation in Congress or not, that I may act accordingly. My private purse will not support me here, and you Sir, know the Expence attending this Character too well to be informed that money in hand is necessary for the support of your Delegation. Congress are highly displeased with the conduct of Rhode Island in not sending forward her Delegates. I have made the best Apology I could for this neglect, but am obliged now to be silent, as I have no advice on the subject. I think it my duty to inform you that this honourable body is not a little alarmed at the present Crisis; with an empty Treasury, while pressed on all sides for money. The Requisitions not complied with in many of the States; the Collection of Taxes postponed; Our trade embarrassd & all most prostrate; The Barbary Powers fitting out more formidable Armaments than ever sailed out of the Straights. G Britain, through our Minister, has absolutely refused Surrender of the western Posts, until the United States comply, on their part, with the 4th Article of the Treaty, which provides that British Merchants shall be under no legal incapacity of recovering, in Sterling money their bona fide debts from the Citizens of the United States. Against which Article (since the passing the money bill in our State) Nine States in the Confederacy have passed Acts; and several of the Indian tribes, as we learn from recent dispatches, have already commenced Host[il]ities on our western frontier. This is our deplorable Situation, and Congress obliged this day to adjourn for want of a sufficient Number of States to proceed in the necessary & most important business of the Confederacy!(1) In a word, Sir, all the old members here look serious, & are alarmed for the safety of the Confederacy. A motion is made, & it is proposed to assign a day to go into the State of the Nation in a Committee of the whole house, that we may send forward to the States, without loss of time, the dangerous Situation of the federal government, that they may acquitt themselves of censure, should disasterous Events happen through the neglect of the States. This motion has only been postponed for a fuller Representation, as they were in daily expectations of having both Rhode Is- May 26, 1786  land & Hampshire on the floor. I assure you, sir, that the above is not an exagerated Account, but done in the words of truth & soberness. We have lately been employed in reducing the expence of the civil List,(2) which we have done upwards of ten Thousand Dollars; nor do we mean to stop here, but embrace every Opportunity to retrench, as much as possible, the Expences of the federal Government. I have the pleasure to inform you that I think the present Delegation in Congress Rhode Island apart possess great Patriotism, Ability & unanimity. But the want of energy in the federal, & the respective Governments of the States, is by every true friend of this Country to be lamented.

 Dear Sir New York May 27h. 1786. I should have done myself the honor of writing to you sooner, if any thing had occurred at this place worth communicating. There has been a great dearth of foreign news, & till within a short time the representation has been so thin as to render it impracticable for Congress to undertake any matter of importance, although there are many which require their serious attention. Of late there has been tolerably full representation but the time of Congress has been chiefly taken up with an investigation of the Connecticut cession of Western territory.(1) That State some time ago offered to cede all her claim to Western territory within the following limits Beg[innin]g, 120 Miles Westwd. of the Pensylvany line at the beginning of the 42nd degree, extendg. N. as far as two minutes of the 43rd, West to the Missisippi, the meanders thereof the same breadth; East to the beginning, reserving out of this cession the 120 M[ile]s between the ceded lands & the Pensylvany line, with the jurisdiction of the same; this cession was at first much opposed, but Congress have at length agreed to accept it whenever the delegates of that State shall be authorized to make a proper deed; The consequence of which is I apprehend a clear loss of about six million of acres to the United States & which had been already ceded by Virginia & N. York: for the Assembly of Connecticut now sitting will  May 27, 1786  unquestionably open a land office, & the fOEderal constitution has not giv'n a Court in this instance. The advocates for this measure, urged in favor of it's adoption that the claim of a powerful State although unsupported by right, was under present circumstances a disagreable thing; & that sacrifices ought to be made for the public tranquillity as well as to acquire an undisputable title to the residue; that Connecticut would settle it immediately, with emigrants well disposed to the Union, who would form a barrier not only against the Brittish but the Indian tribes upon the Wabash & lake Michigan; That the thick settlement they would immediately form, would enhance the value of the adjacent country and facilitate emigrations thereto. Some alterations have been made lately in the Land Ordnance; the surveyors are now allowed to survey by the magnetic Meridian, & are limited to the territory lying Southward of the East & West line as described in the said Ordnance; the navigable waters and the carrying places between them are made common highways & forever free to the Atlantic States as well as any new States that may be created, witht. any tax or impost therefor. An attempt was made to change the system altogether, but negatived; indeed the Eastern States & some others are so much attached to it, that I am satisfied no material alteration can ever be effected; the Geographer & surveyors have directions to proceed without delay to carry the Ordinance into execution,(2) which I presume they will execute provided the Indians will permit them, of which however I have very great doubts. Mr. Adams has informed Congress by letters lately received, that he has made a demand of the Posts, and has been refused; the Marquis of Caermarthen has giv'n as a reason for the refusal that many of the States in the Union have violated the treaty with respect to the debts; that the King of G. B. will comply with his engagements when the States shall shew a disposition to perform their part of the contract respecting this matter; the States not included in the accusation are N. Hamshire, R. Island, Connecticut, N. Jersey & Delawar. I beg leave to inform you confidentially that there does not appear at present the most distant prospect of forming treaty either with Spain or G. Brittain; That the treaty with Portugal is in a proper train; that peace can be procured with Tripoli & Tunis on reasonable terms, ie. for 30,000 Guineas each, & probably with Morocco & Algiers for double that sum respectively, if money can be loaned in Holland for that purpose. The late treaty with Algiers cost Spain one million three hundred thousand dollars.

 Dear Sir, New York 27th May 1786 Your Favour of the 21st now claims my Acknowledgement. Yesterday Congress agreed to accept a Cession [from] the State of Connecticut of her Right, Claim &c to Western [terri]tory, lying westward of a Line drawn from lat. 41. to lat. 42Â° 2\"", 120 Miles westward of & parrallel to the Western boundary of Pennsylvania, whenever the Delegates of Connecticut, duly authorized, shall execute a Deed of Cession for the same.(1) This Subject has undergone much Discussion, & has taken up more Time in various ManOEuvres than I thought it merited; but the various Interests and Views of Parties whetted the Jealousy of each other in a high Degree & called forth great Exertions in various Modes of Attack & Defence. I was the less exercised on the Occasion, because I felt the State of Pennsa. perfectly secured by the Decree of the federal Court against all State Claims on the Part of Connecticut. Some of my Colleagues, however, wanted an express Reservation which should cover our State from future molestation, on a supposition that  May 27, 1786  the implied Reservation of Connecticut, might weaken our present Security under the Decree of the Court. It was thought by others that such a Reservation in behalf of Pennsa. would imply a Right in Connecticut to the 120 Miles not ceded, which Right they (the circumscribed States) would not willingly acknowledge. The States who have made Cessions tho' they disavow any Intention to claim by Implication, any strengthening of their Claim to Lands not by them ceded, yet are very careful to avoid relinquishing the strength that pretence may hereafter give them. From Considerations of these Kinds you will perceive three or four different Interests which in their Nature are opposed to each o[ther]. The Delegations of Pennsylvania & of your State per[ceive] this Dilemma, & desirous of promoting Peace & Harmony in the Union, & in order to obtain a good Understanding between the two States, agreed to meet each other on the ground of reciprocal Confidence & Generosity. It is understood that the State of Connecticut will on her part give no farther Countenance to the Claims of the State or of her Companies within Pennsa. but on the Contrary use Means to induce these Companies to relinquish their Pretensions to such Claims. That Pennsa. will take the Actual Settlers on the late disputed Territory under protection as Citizens & treat them with Generosity as well as Justice as to their private Rights. That the implied Right of Connecticut to the 120 Miles not ceded will not be questioned by Pennsa. and that Connecticut may find Means from that Source to quiet her Companies with respect to Western Lands. These Objects were not unperceived by Congress & their Desire of promoting Peace & Harmony induced them to acquiesce in the Views of the two States under an Expectation, as I conceive, that Connecticut, paying the Proportion of Expence in purc[hasing] it from the Indians & avoiding any Claim of States Jurisdiction will enjoy & dispose of the soil within the 120 Miles. But these Things being understood rather than expressed, may be differently conceived of by different Minds, & therefore I cannot pretend to say what Interpretations may hereafter be given on this Subject. In Compromises of this kind it is [fo]und dangerous to go too minutely into Explanations. The [cir]cumscribed States do not like the Result we have come to, and will keep up their Claim to a Share of all the Lands which they suppose remained in the Disposal of the Crown immediately before the Revolution, especially that part which was severed from the old Colonies by the Description of the Province of Quebec. But the States which have made Cessions & those which expect to make them will, I imagine, acquiesce in the Ideas I have stated if Prudence be used in pursuing them, and Pennsylvania I am persuaded will observe and act upon a liberal Construction of these conciliatory Views. You will consider this Letter as purely Confidential. I mean not to debar you from making any proper use of the Sentiments it contains; nor from drawing & even communicating such Inferences as you may think fairly deducible from what I have said; but it is intended as a confidential Key to open a view to your own Mind of a complex Business in the Light in which I view it. Others may view it in a different Light & of course may describe it differently. Such Descriptions contrasted may bring on unprofitable Discussions, and occasion the Revival of Disputes which ought never again to be unveiled. Besides I write on this Occasion with too much Haste & Freedom for the Inspection of any Eye but that of a Confidential Friend. The Information from your transatlantic Corres[pondent] deserves attention---;and it appears to me to depend [entirely] on ourselves whether his Apprehensions will be verifi[ed or] not. Our political Situation, merely from want of [a]rrangement & Combination of our Strength, is indeed wretched. Our Friends exhausted---;our Credit lost---;our Confidence in each other & in the federal Government destroyed. Resolutions unexecuted; Requisitions but partially complied with in the best of the States, in others not at all; Recommendations as little regarded as the Cries of an Oysterman. The States separately pursuing their own whimsical Schemes of dangerous Experiment, regardless of federal System, and destroying their own Strength by intoxicating Draughts of Liberty run mad. By attempting to conceal our   Imperfections from others, we have but deceived ourselves & increased our own Maladies. Instead of supporting the respectable Rank which we assumed among Nations, we have exposed our Follies to their View---;they treat us accordingly---;they severally shut the Door of commercial Hospitality against us, while ours being open they enter & partake with us at their pleasure. The Mischievous Consequences of our Folly are now pressing upon us. [They] are felt every where, but the Cause is duly perceived(2) as yet by a comparative few only; it must pervade and alarm the great Body of the People in every State before they will be in earnest to take the proper Measures to secure their own Strength & Safety. At present even those who are selected for the public Service & to whom the political Interests of the Country are confided, are not sufficiently awakened to keep a competent Number of States represented in Congress. Many Gentlemen really & some affectedly accept appointments to this Assembly reluctantly, and it seems to be fashionable to make public Duty yield to private Convenience even on Occasions comparatively trivial. Monthly Returns are made to the Executives of the States of their several Representions in Congress daily for the preceeding Month; by these Returns you may see how faulty your State has been in this Respect. I do not suggest this as blaming the two Gentlemen who have occasionally attended, but you will find that you have had at no Time more than two either in this year or the last, & these two in each Year never relieved, tho' I presume you have constantly had a greater number in your Delegation. If a State so respectable in point of Information & Capacity, & so conveniently situated is thus Negligent in federal Affairs, what can we expect of some others? Seven Months of the present federal year have passed away without the attendance of Nine States (a bare Quorum for most purposes) for any one Fortnight at a Time. The few who attend constantly, become wearied & soured, & find themselves unable to pursue any Plan with Effect, bec[oming] negligent & desponding. The Comers & Goers who som[etimes] raise us to 9, 10 or even 11 States (which we had for a few D[ays]) do not continue long enough to get the Information necessary to form a competent Judgment of the Business before them, & hence the most important Matters must remain in Suspence, or be decided upon at Hazard on partial Information. Is it possible that a great political System, however wisely formed, can be preserved & well conducted in this Manner and yet we seem to be as supinely inattentive to our own Dangerous Situation as a flock of Sheep in their way to a slaughter Pen. This is not an exaggerated Description of our internal Disorder, which is hastening our Political Existence to destruction, like a spreading mortification under the lulling Influence of an Opiate.  Foreigners perceive our lethargic Imbecility. That Respect which they were disposed to shew us is held in Suspence. The Barbary Powers, as if by Way of derision, are set on to insult us. Our late Enemies seeking a Rupture with us by withholding military Posts within our Territories are teaching the Savages to despise and insult us. They openly charge us with a Breach of the Treaty by obstructing the Recovery of British Debts by Legislative Acts in some of the States; in this, however, there is some Truth, tho' less than they pretend; but I should suppose that their refusal to pay for the Negroes they purloined & which they acknowledge to be a failure on their Part, might have been a balance for this breach of ours, as it was in some Measure the Occasion or at least the pretence for it. Such Disorders both within & without cannot fail to bring on a Crisis of some kind ere long. What will be the Result, or what Turn it will take, is uncertain. However we may dread the Event, it seems to be the only chance we have of restoration to political health, & therefore a convulsion of some kind seems to be desirable. When I had finished the first Sheet I was necessarily taken off, intending to finish & put my Letter in the Post Office the next Morning, but a scouring of the cholera morbus kind incapacitated me for some Days & my Nerves are yet unrestored to the proper Tone. Be assured of the Esteem of Dr. Sir, Your most obedt., huml. Servant, Chas. Pettit ""

 Dear Sir New York May 28th. 1786. Your letter(1) has come safely to hand; & I should have wrote to you sooner but could not find any thing to communicate worth your acceptance. Till lately Congress have been perfectly inactive: for about a fortnight past we have had a tolerably full representation; however Delawar has grown uneasy & left us, and Connecticut having prevailed on Congress to accept her cession moves off tomorrow. It is a practice with many States in the Union to come forward & be very assiduous till they have carried some State jobb & then decamp with precip[it]ation leaving the public business to shift for itself. The delegation of our State was very much embarrassed with the Connecticut business, as it was said it was but neighbours fare that Connecticut should be treated, as we had been before with respect to our cession; & that cessions of claims conveyed no right by implication to the territory not ceded. We however after some consideration took a hostile position towards her & voted against the acceptance in every stage of it: it appeared to the delegation that the only proper claim was already vested in Congress by the cession of our State: & that their cession was nothing but a state juggle contrived by old Roger Sherman to get a side wind confirmation to a thing they had no right to. Some of the States particularly Pensylvany voted for them on the same principle that the powers of Europe give money to the Algerines. The advocates for the acceptance have however some plausible reasons for their opinion such as The tranquillity, of the Union: The procuring a clear title to the residue of the Continental lands: the forming a barrier agt. the Brittish as well as the Indians: the appreciating the value of the adjacent territory & facilitating the settlement thereof. The Assembly of Connecticut now sitting mean immed[iatel]y to open a land Office for the 120 M[ile]s Westwd. of the Pensylvany line which they have reserved: & I don't see what is to prevent them from keeping it always, as the fOEderal constitution does not give a Court in this instance, & a war with them would cost more than the six million of acres is worth.  Mr. Adams has just informed Congress that he has made a demand of the Posts & has been refused; the M. of Caermarthen states in substance as a reason for the refusal, that several of the States in the Union have violated the treaty with respect to the debts. That whenever the States shew a disposition to fulfill the treaty on their part, the King will perform his engagements according to good faith.(2) The States which are not included in the accusation are R. Island, Connecticut, N. Hamshire, N. Jersey & Delawar. The charge agt. Massachusetz is only this, that she has passed a law preventing executions from issuing for interest untill the judgment of  May 28, 1786  Congress should be had thereon. The only charge agt. Maryland that I recollect, is her having recieved large sums of money (the property of Brittish subjects) during the war, from their debtors. The charges agt. N. York are heavy & numerous. With respect to Virginia I think she may at least be speciously justified for what has past; the proclamation of Governor Harrisson is not imputable to her as it was not Done by any authority from the legislature, & if I am rightly informed it was dissaproved of as soon [as] they met.(3) As to the installment act it never did pass into a law, & the Brittish Commee. of merchants had no right to mention it in their report; but the State of Virginia has not repealed her prohibitory laws on that subject.(4) To this it may be answered that no such repeal was necessary for that the definitive treaty as soon as it was ratified by the contracting parties became the law of the land in every State: if it became the law of the land it of course (by repealing anterior obstructions) opened the Courts of Justice to all those creditors who came within it's description. This principle no doubt will subject the debtor who has paid into the public treasury; but where is the hardship of this if the public are liable to the debtor for such payment. From this it must result that the Brittish have no right to complain, untill the Courts of Justice refuse to take cognizance of their claims on the principle of prohibitory laws. Should the legislature view this business in as serious a light as I do, & wish to preserve the honor of the State with as much decency as the nature of the case will admit of, I submit it to your consideration whether it would not be proper for them to enact, [\""]that the late treaty of peace now is & ever has been since it's ratification by the contracting parties the law of the land in each State & of course has repealed all lawful impediments to the recovery of any Brittish debts therein described, any law, custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.[\""] I am not certain I am right in my positions on the ground of the law of nations as applying to fOEderal governments of separate sovereignties; though I have understood this was the opinion of Count de Vergennes, as it respected the treaty with France. At all events if it is doubtfull ground it is plausible ground; & I know of no other principle that will save the honor of the State. If it is said the Brittish have first violated the treaty with respect to the negroes, they acknowledge the fact & agree to make satisfaction. What more can be desired? As to the Interest it is a subject of negotiation; if the point is gained, it will conduce to the benefit of Virga. as well as every other State; & in the Mean time where is the danger of submitting the point to a Jury, composed of American citizens. There is no doubt one great difficulty in the matter: if the State of Virginia adopts this or some other system confirmatory of the treaty, she then complies on her part; while at the same time if the other States adhere to their refusal, she leaves Great Brittain at liberty to act as she pleases with respect to the negroes & the Posts: perhaps a proper attention to   this difficulty may lead to the striking impropriety of the interference of States as to the construction of a treaty in any case whatever. Your sentimts. on this matter will greatly oblige me. The treaty wth. the King of Prussia has been confirmed in Congress: it is in my opinion as far as it respects commercial objects, of no great importance. Mr. Monro I know has informed you that a day is assigned for Congress to go into a Commee. of the whole on the State of the Nation; also for what purposes this is intended.(5) I am apprehensive this will produce nothing & that Congress will never be able to agree on the proper amendments even among themselves; the Eastern people mean nothing more than to carry the Commercial point. There they intend to stop & would not agree if it rested with them that Congress should have the power of preventing the States from cheating one another as well as their own citizens by means of paper money. Mr. Pinkney who brought forward the motion, will be astounded when he meets with a proposition to prevent the States from importing any more of the seed of Cain; N. York & Pensylvany will feel themselves indisposed when they hear it proposed that it shall become a national compact that the sessions shall always be held in the centre of the Empire; how will Delawar, R. Island, Jersey & some others like to vote (with respect to any new powers granted to Congress) according to their real & not their supposed importance in the Union? I am of opinion our affairs are not arrived at such a crisis as to insure success to a reformation on proper principles; a partial reformation will be fatal; things had better remain as they are than not to probe them to the bottom. If particular States gain their own particular objects, it will place other grievances perhaps of equal importance at a greater distance: if all are brought forward at the same time one object will facilitate the passage of another. By a general compromise perhaps a good government may be procured. Under these impressions I cannot say I think it will be for the advantage of the Union that the Convention at Annapolis produce any thing decisive: as in this event nothing more is to be expected from Massachusetz &c. &c. &c. The State of Virginia having gone thus far, it is matter of great doubt with me whether she had not better go farther & propose to the other States to augment the powers of the delegates so as to comprehend all the grievances of the Union, & to combine the commercial arrangements with them, & make them dependant on each other; in this case her own objects ought not to be pretermitted; among which a proper and liberal mode of settling the public accounts ought not to be forgotten. Some alterations have lately been made in the land Ordinance; the Surveyors are liberated from all kind of connection with the stars, and are now allowed to survey by the magnetic Meridian, & are limited to the territory lying Southward of the East & West line as described in the said Ordinance. The navigable waters & the carrying places   between them are made common highways for ever & free to the citizens of the Atlantic States as well as those of the new States without any tax or impost whatever. An attempt was made to change the system altogether and was negatived; indeed the Eastern & some other States are so much attached to it, that I am satisfied no material alteration can be effected; the Geographer and surveyors will set out it is supposed immediately to carry the Ordinance into execution,(6) provided the Indians will permit them, of which however I have very great doubts. I beg leave to inform you confidentially, that there does not appear at present the most distant prospect of forming treaties with Spain or G. Brittain: That the treaty with Portugal now carrying on in London is in an apparently proper train; that peace can certainly be obtained from Tripoli & Tunis for 33,000 Guineas each, & probably from Morocco & Algiers for double that sum respectively, provided money can be loaned in Holland for that purpose, & (which being the only resource) will be attempted: That Mr. Jefferson has lately informed Congress that he has applied to the Court of France to destroy the Monopoly of the farmers general respecting Tobo. His reasoning & calculations on this subject does him the highest honor: he has proved incontestably that it is the undoubted interest of both nations that this injurious monopoly should be destroyed. I shall not make any observations on this Subject, as I am satisfied you must have long since fully considered it, in all its relations. I only beg leave to submit to you the propriety of the State of Virginia & Maryland through Congress representing to the Court of France in strong but affectionate language the fatal consequences of an adherence to this measure. This representation when added to the Commercial Interests of France & joined by the natural enemies of the Farmers general, will possibly shake this ruinous sytem. The delegation have lately recieved a letter from the Governor stating the depredations and murders of the Wabash Indians on the Kentucki Settlements; these Indians refused to come to the treaty last year i e, they gave no answer and are now at war with the Citizens of the United States; they have therefore left no alternative to them but hostilities; the delegation intend to move tomorrow that Colo. Harmar with 400 Continental troops and such a number of Kentucki Militia as may be necessary, march to their towns & destroy them if they do not make concessions & deliver hostages as security for their good behav[i]our in future.(7) They will also press for the arrangement of a standing Indian department. In all this however they expect opposition, from the circumscribed States who being themselves in no danger, will reluctantly yield assistance to those who are exposed. I have with pleasure understood from Colo. Munro, that you intend   paying this place a visit in the course of the summer. I hope you will do it in such a seasonable manner as to preclude the necessity of an immediate return, as was the case last year. I remain with great sincerity, Yr. Affect. frd. & Most Obed Servt. Willm. Grayson. ""

 Dear Sir New York May 31. 1786. Since my last a letter has been recd. from Mr. {Jay}(1) to the following effect \""that difficulties {had taken place} in his {negotiation with Gardoqui} & requesting that a Committee be appointed with {power} to direct {& controul the sd. negotiation}.\""(2) It was immediately perciev'd that the object {was} to relieve him from the {instruction} respecting the {Missisipi} & to get a committee to {cover} the measure. That this wod. be thus brought forward I was appriz'd upon my first arrival here in the winter, & have been acquainted with all the previous arrangements, those in favr. of it found necessary to make, to prepare for its reception---;his plan is, from evidence conclusive on my own mind; not to be simply quiet as to that object but to enter into engagements, at least for a certain term, for its {occlusion} & further to enter into a reciprocal {guaranty} of their respective possessions {in America}; in consideration for which we are to be admitted reciprocally, they into our ports here & we into theirs in Europe, upon an equal footing with our citizens & subjects respectively. What we are to gain on our part then simply is, the aid of this power in favor of the posts & this commercial stipulation. When the letter was presented Mr. {King} who is associated in this business in a long speech in which he took a view of the insidious designs of {France in} the late {treaty} especially, & of the little dependence to be put on her in future, made a tryal of the pulse of the house on the subject. The letter was committed, {Pettit, King} & {myself} are of the committee---;as yet the Committee have not met, to morrow they will. {Jay} will attend it. From the best investigation that I have been able to give the subject I am of opinion that it will be for the benefit of the U S. that the {river} shod. be {opend} that although we may not be in a situation, nor even think of it for the present, to contest it, yet if we enter'd into engag[e]ments to the contrary, we seperate those people I mean all those {westward} of the {mountains} from the federal {government} & perhaps throw them into the hands eventually of a foreign power.  May 31, 1786  That under the direction of Congress the produce of that country will be in trade the source of great national wealth & strength to the U S. That a reciprocal {guaranty} stipulates an important consideration to them without a return. That whether it may not tend to weaken the connection between us & {France} is doubtful. That the commercl. engagement will operate upon its own merits only to the disadvantage of the U S, I remember upon a former occasion, unconnected with objects & considerations of this kind to have remarked to you---;after the publick debt is pd. (& if the western land is properly dispos'd of, great part of it will be pd. shortly) the situation of these States will be such as to make it unnecessary for them to lay such duties on the trade of their citizens as the expensive civil & military establishments of the European countries will require. The duties of our citizens & their subjects in our respective ports will of course be unequal, ours depress'd with the weight of their govt. & theirs entitled to all the benefits which arise from our ease & happy situation. If we knew precisely the duties impos'd on our trade by our citizens in their ports, we might put their subjects on equal footing here. The indulgence then given to our people in our ports arising from the ease of our circumstances, superior to that wh. the subjects of other countries can possibly obtain, wod. be a manifest advantage which might enable them to improve their circumstances. {Tobo} I am also inform'd is to be exluded from the benefit (if it can be term'd such) of this treaty. I am clearly of opinion that {Spain} is of all the powers of {Europe} the most in our hands. That for a guaranty we might obtain not only the points in contest but whatever else we wish'd. But such is the folly of our councils & the {vice} of those who govern them in many instances, that the real blessings of our situation in those few cases which exist, cannot be turn'd to any publick advantage. {Petit} who is always here & the influencial man from {Pennsylvania} is a speculator in certificates. He came forward under the patronage of {Reid}(3) with impressions entirely {Eastern} and the opposition given the requisition last year by the delegation of {Virginia} has given him an opinion that she wishes to defraud the publick creditors. The evidence of her payments, of passing the requisition upon terms unfavorable to her, of her honest & federal attachments, are no proof to him. He always acts under this impression & the utmost prudence, good temper (personally), and assurance on the part of the delegation cannot remove it. His State therefore can generally be calculated on in favor of all the measures of {Massachusets}, who is always zealous upon all subjects of old emission money---;publick securities &ca. She always hath some influence with {Delaware} & {Jersey}; {King} hath {married} a woman of fortune in {New York} so that if he secures a market for {fish} and turns the commerce of the western country down {this river} he obtains his object.  We have not as yet brought on the claims of the State, we shall do it in a few days.(4) I am thoroughly satisfied they will be rejected---;all the expences of Ld. Dunmore's expedition although precisely on the same footing with the first campaign at Boston will be thrown on the State. Yet Mass. hath (& did in the close of that campaign) draw money to defray its expences. It appears to me as if the State debt wod. never be settled and if it is, upon terms highly disadvantageous to us---;that the certificate debt will be press'd only untill by the operation of the facility system most of the securities are mov'd southwd., after which it will be given up. We shall however bring the subject on shortly, and upon the fairest principles for the State, in the event of a decision agnst. her, put her pretensions on the journals. Many of these questions you will observe are as important as they are intricate. That to a wise decision as to the expedience, the greatest industry & ability in their management will be necessary. I must confess I have little hope that they will take a direction agreeably to my own impressions of propriety. One great advantage is, that the delegation are in genl. in sentiment, & act together---;but there are such powerful combinations agnst. us, supported by & founded in considerations of private interest, that I almost despair. What effect these measures may have, especially in the instances of the {tobo} & our accts., upon the State I cannot determine. Whether they may extend their influence to other objects than those they particularly affect, is incertain; fully persuaded however I am that they will give arguments to those oppos'd to an extension of fOEderal powers of greater weight than any they have had before. I most sincerely wish you may come up and that if you shall not be able you will give me yr. sentiments fully on these subjects. I am yr. friend & servant, Jas. Monroe ""

 Sir New York June 1st. 1786 In my letter of the 21st Nov [May](1) I had the honor of informing your excellency that when the committees had reported on the import [impost] acts as granted by the respective States I would advise you thereof but as no report has as yet been made and it is uncertain when there will, I beg leave to make the following observations on some of the acts. 1st. That several of the States which have passed acts investing the United States in congress assembled with power to levy the duties on imported goods agreeable to the recommendations of the 18th April (83) have inserted in their acts express conditions that the same shall not be in force or begin to operate untill all the States in the confederacy have passed acts vesting the United States in Congress assembled with power to levy in the several States like duties. 2d That the act of the State of New York does not invest the United States in congress assembled with power to levy in that State the duties therein mentioned but revenues [reserves] to the State of New York the sole favour of levying and collecting the same in the manner directed in and by an act of that State entitled, an act imposing duties on certain goods, wares and merchandise imported into that State passed the 18 November (84) and consequently prevents the operation of the imports [imposts]: since some States have made the exercise of this power by the United States in Congress assembled an indispensible and express condition of their grants. 3d That the act aforesaid does not make the collector of the said duties amenable to and recoverable by the U.S. in C[ongress] A[ssembled]. June 1, 1786  and 4thly That the duties to be collected may at the option of the importer be paid either in specie or paper money. From these circumstances together with some paragraphs which [are] exceptionable in the Pennsylvania and Delaware acts I cannot suppose that this system of revenue can be put in operation this year. Having nothing to add but an ardent wish for a colleague, I am with sentiments of respect and esteem, Your Excellency's most obedient and humble Servant, Pierce [Pierse] Long ""

 Dear Sir New York June 3. 1786. When I had last the honor of writing to you(1) I expected by this time to have been in Massachusetts, and ready, if necessary, to have attended to the business relative to our unappropreated lands---;but finding it impracticable for me to return as I expected there being only three gentlemen, with myself, in the Delegation who can, probably, attend Congress this Summer, I have inclosed to your Care my  June 3, 1786  resignation as a member of the Committee charged with the Dispositions of those lands---;which I wish you to transmit to the Governor---;having had some apprehensions that I might thus be detained here I sometime since in a letter to you, which I fear you have not received, hinted that it might be proper for me to resign. My connexions with you and Mr. Wells and my sincere friendship for you and him, would have induced me to have consulted you and him further on this subject, had circumstances of time permitted. But 'till Yesterday we have been in expectations that Mr. Hancock would attend in Congress, in which Case I might have returned to Massachusetts immediately on his arrival here. But now we have no expectations of his coming on to Congress at all. It being out of my power to attend to the business of that Committee, I consider it as my Duty to resign that the legislature may early in their present Sessions take measures if necessary to supply my place---;and if I stay here till late in the summer my private business will be in that situation that it will be impossible for me to attend the business of that Committee, as it ought to be attended to, after I shall return. It is of particular importance that our Delegation be kept up during the residue of the present year. Our State is now the only State East of New York represented in Congress, and there are now before that body several interesting subjects many of which have been examined in Committees only---;and some measures are necessary to be taken by Congress to give them effect. The impost cannot be put into operation 'till New York, Pennsylvania, & Delaware, shall make some alterations in their laws granting it, and Congress shall separate it from the supplementary funds, and pass laws directing the mode of collecting it. Or until the supplementary funds shall be adopted by all the States---;now adopted by three or four only. Some further measures are under consideration for expediting the sale of the federal lands---;for vesting Commercial powers in Congress---;for keeping up a full and punctual representation of the States in Congress---;for effecting treaties with the Barbary powers---;and two or three powers in Europe---;for obtaining terms of peace with the Indians---;-for establishing a general militia---;for establishing a mint and regulating the value of the Coin---;for regulating the trade of the Indian Department---;for forming a requisition on the States for 1786---;for obtaining the ends of the proposed alteration of the 8 art. of the Confederation, which is adopted by all the States except New Hampshire and R. Island---;for making the trial of piracies &c more conformable to the laws of the several States, &c.---;for the future government of the New States---;for the final Settlement of public accounts accrued during the late war and some other matters of less importance. For want of a moderate but certain revenue, Commercial powers---;and a full representation of the States in Congress we suffer greatly.  June 4, 1786  The States are not aware how much they suffer for want of a full representation in Congress, business is delayed and the administration of the government rendered weak and defective. Had the States assembled last November Congress might have finished the business of the union, &c. and been ready to have adjourned before this time---;many gentlemen appear to attend only as it suits their private concerns; this never can answer the purpose in the administration of a government where great attention and industry is required to understand its parts, and its relation to the States. As it will probably be the opinion of our Delegation to write an official letter to the legislature giving that information which is necessary and proper respecting the subjects now under consideration and which concern the States, I do not at present enter minutely into the affairs above referred to. But one circumstance I will mention on Mr. Adam's demanding in December last a surrender of the Western posts from Gr. Britain. We have received for answer, that by the 7 art. of the treaty they ought clearly to surrender them.(2) The answer then States that by the 4th art of the same treaty(3) it is as clearly stipulated that there shall be no lawful impediments to the recovery of Debts, &c---; that Massachusetts by her resolve of Nov. 10, 1784---;New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, N. Carolina, So. Carolina and Georgia by laws---;(particularly named) have obstructed the recovery of Debts, &c. This matter is in examination, and a full Statement will soon, I expect, be made to the States of it. With Sentiments of much esteem and friendship, Your Obedt. Humble Servt., N. Dane P.S.

13773,dg023282,1786,Rufus King to Elbridge Gerry,"""Rufus King to Elbridge Gerry
 My Dear Friend: New York, June 4, 1786. I have long entertained doubts concerning the line of conduct, which Congress ought to pursue relative to the Territory of the U.S. Northwest of the Ohio, and am every day more confirmed in the opinion that no paper engagements, or stipulations, can be formed which will insure a desirable connection between the Atlantic States  June 4, 1786  and those which will be erected to the Northwestward of the Apalachian or Alleghany Mountains, provided the Mississippi is immediately opened. The pursuits and interests of the people on the two sides will be so different, and probably so opposite, that an entire separation must eventually ensue. This consequence appears to me so obvious, that I very much doubt whether the U.S. would ever receive a penny of revenue from the Inhabitants who may settle the Western Territory. Should there be an uninterrupted use of the Mississippi at this time by the citizens of the U.S, I should consider every emigrant to that country from the Atlantic States as forever lost to the Confederacy. Perhaps I am in error, but when they have no interest in an Union inconvenient to them in many points, I can discover no principle, which will attach them to such a connexion. I know not what advantages the Inhabitants of the Western Territory would acquire by becoming members of the Confederacy. They will want no protection; their location would sufficiently secure them from all foreign hostility; the exchange of Merchandize, or commerce, would not be across the Apalachian Mountains, but wholly confined to the Mississippi. If these conjectures are just, in true policy ought the U.S. to be very assiduous to encourage their citizens to become settlers of the country beyond the Apalachian? The object of Congress appears hitherto to have been a sale of this country for the sinking of the domestic debt; the immediate extinguishment of this debt is certainly a very important consideration; but it has its price. I suppose that a treaty could be formed between Spain & the U.S. upon principles of exact reciprocity, so that the Citizens of the latter might introduce into the European & African dominions of the former, all sorts of goods & merchandize upon the same terms on which the subjects of Spain could introduce the same articles; and on the other hand, that the subjects of Spain might import into any of the U.S. all sorts of goods & merchandize, upon the same terms, as the citizens of the U.S would introduce the same. I suppose farther, that the Treaty should stipulate that all the Masts, Spars, Timber &c. &c. wanted for the national marine of Spain should be purchased and paid for in the U.S. with specie, provided the quality of the materials equalled that of the same articles in other countries. I suppose yet farther that the Philippine Islands be opened to the American ships and in consequence the gold and silver of Acapulco placed within their reach. Add to the foregoing an article, not to relinquish the right to the free navigation of the Mississippi, but \""stipulating that the U.S. should forbear to use the navigation of the Mississippi for 20 or 25 years.\"" Would not such a treaty be of vast importance to the Atlantic States, particularly to the Western division of them? Would not the Fish, Flour and other products of the U.S. acquire thereby a manifest superiority in Spain over similar commodities of   any other country? Would not the conventional forbearance of the use of the Mississippi implicate most strongly the right of the U.S. independent of the Convention or Treaty? If these queries are answered in the affirmative, what objection is there on the part of the U.S. to conclude such a Treaty? This question brings into view the plan of extinguishing the domestic debt by the Sale of the Western Territory, the system whereby it is proposed to govern the people, who shall settle Westward of the Apalachian Mountains, within the U.S., and the ability of the U.S. at this time to contend with Spain in vindicating their right to the free use and navigation of the Mississippi. I am very sensible that the popular opinion throughout the U.S. is in favor of the free navigation of the Mississippi, and the reasons must be strong and important, which could be offered to oppose this opinion. I am also pretty well satisfied that the free navigation of that River will some day be of vast importance to the inhabitants within the Territories of the U.S.; yet admitting, what will not be denied, that Spain will on no condition agree that any people, except those of their own Nation, shall navigate the Mississippi, are the U.S. in a condition to assert their right? If you answer this question as I should, (believing as I do that a war with Spain, France, or England would terminate in the loss of the Fisheries, and the restriction of boundaries, perhaps by the Kennebeck on one part and the Apalachian Mountains on the other) is there any substantial objection against an Article in a Treaty with Spain relative to the Mississippi such as is alluded to? It is a consent to what we cannot alter, considering other benefits to be obtained. It must be wisdom then to consent. But how will this article affect the sale of the Western Territory? The answer which the delegates of Virginia (all of whom are probably deeply interested in the Ohio and Kentucky lands) would give is, that the value of the country west of the Allaghany Mountains depends in a high degree upon the opening of the Mississippi. Admit the fact; it is desired that the U.S. should under these circumstances open that River to their navigation. If so the value placed upon these lands which depends upon the opening of the Mississippi, is an ideal value, at this time. With those therefore who do not wish to involve the U.S. in a war against policy and sound reason, this objection is of little consequence. The lands perhaps will not produce so much under the present circumstances of the Mississippi, as they would if the river was open. But to all persons desirous of becoming settlers, they will sell for a reasonable price and go a good way in extinguishing the domestic debt. But how will such an article affect the intercourse between the inhabitants of the Western Territory and those of the Atlantic States? In my judgment, very favorably. If the former are cut off for a time from any connections, except with the old States, across the mountains, I should not despair that a Government might be instituted so   connecting them with the Atlantic States, as would be highly beneficial to them both & promise a considerable trade. My dear friend, after all, these are but speculative opinions, and I am very doubtful of them, when a variety of influential motives, which seem to promise well for my country, authorizes my assent. I alluded to this subject in my last letter to you; I wish for your counsel; I wish the New England States were here. I pray you to read these remarks with candor, and in confidence. If I had taken time and care to have expressed my sentiments on this subject, I would have requested you to have communicated this paper to your friend Gov. Bowdoin and prayed through you his advice. I shall be brought to a decision on this question. Congress must determine. If Spain don't conclude a Treaty with the U.S., I think they will endeavour to guard against the Evils they fear from us, by an intimate connexion with Great Britain. I am of a committee now in conference with the Secretary of Foreign Affairs on this subject.(1) Spain should form a treaty with us, in preference to any other nation, and there is no nation with whom the U.S. could form more beneficial treaties than with Spain and Portugal. Spain will not give up the Mississippi. But I will not add, I write in great haste and in full confidence. If you are at Boston and can consult Mr. Bowdoin I should thank you to do it. I intended to have written to him relative to the Barbary treaties, but have not been able to find time. Adieu yours affectionately, R. King [P.S.] Inform me of the receipt of this and of my last.

 Dear Gerry, New York 8 June 1786 The lawless, and probably unjust, conduct of the inhabitants of Kentuckey towards the Indians bordering on the western side of the Ohio, has lately occasioned the loss of a number of valuable lives on the Frontiers of Virginia. Nothing yet exhibited has proved to my mind, any association of Tribes against the people on this side of the Ohio; but the Murders, which have imfortunately happened have been perpetrated by a few vagrant Indians who are without a name or Tribe. The Govr. & Delegates of Virginia clamour for war against the indian Towns, and have brought the business before Congress.(1) We are without nine states, and the question cannot be examined. I am decidedly against any such war, as I at present understand the situation and state of the Affair. I suppose you are now at the General Court, Sedgwick joined us here a few days since,(2) he requests me to inform you that he had signified to Mr. Bacon & some other Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, that he could not serve as a Delegate after November, & therefore proposed not to be considered as a candidate. Since we find, how the Senate was filled, he prays that it may not be considered that he has withdrawn himself as a candidate for the next years Delegation, lest it should be supposed that he withdrew from an apprehension, of a Defeat in the election, grounded on his professional Character.(3) I have discharged my engagements by having made the foregoing communication. With respect to myself, although Dalton writes me, that the suggestion has been circulated, that I intend quitting Mass. & residing here, I am not anxious to combat the Falshood; I see the approaching Storm that awaits the federal Government, and shall be happier in private than in public life---;in either, I shall continue affectionately your's.

 Sr N. York June 8th, 1786  It may, perhaps be necessary to apologize to your excellency, for not having written, since my arrival,(1) for any instructions, or commands you might have to communicate. One cause that rendered me less ready to trouble you with any letters, was, that very little worthy your attention, was in my possession; moreover I expected you would be informed of every circumstance you would wish to know, by a gentleman in person who is going, & who is master of every information. In obedience to your first directions I wrote to you on my way, to Wilmington. The letter, I make no doubt, was delivered by the person to whom I committed it, as he appeared desirous of waiting on you. Perhaps it may now be my duty to mention, that I learn from Colo. Blount, that he is much better acquainted with that gentlemans character, than I was at that time. I must acknowledge that on my arrival at congress, I recd. official papers respecting the indian treaty. It gave me infinite uneasiness that nothing in that business, could be done by us to any effect. Every thing respecting it was transacted before we arrived. And I am not [now] to inform your excellency that those treaties require nothing further than to insert them on the journals,(2) without any ratification here: this was done before my arrival from Philada. where the necessity of providing for my subsistence here, had called me. If any thing can be done, at this time, to counteract the evil we have to complain of in the indian treaty, & you will please to suggest it, our duty will be to comply with it. As nothing will compel me to leave this but the difficulty of subsisting in the way we are supplyed, I flatter myself you will not be averse to giving an order for the remainder of my sallary. If it can be  June 9, 1786  paid here, that will be a relief demanding my acknowledgments; &, from what I understand of a resolution of the legislature in the May sessions 1784, That mode will not be inconsistent with their intentions.

 Dear Sir, New York 9th of June 1786. Yours of the 20th ult. came safe to hand. My situation here without a Colleague, without Money; & what little I had of my own expended to the last Guinea; my Bills unpaid; without so much as a Line from General Miller, or any Instructions from Government what to do, I am placed in a Situation truly mortifying. I have addressed the Govr. & General Miller both requesting them without loss of time to give me an Ultimatum whether the State will support a Delegation or not, & hourly wait for an Answer, that I may govern myself accordingly. I know your zeal & Promptitude to support the federal & state Governments; & am decidedly of opinion that thrusting men of that spirit from the helm, in this critical conjuncture of our Affairs, augurs no good to the federal Govert. But as a wise Statesman once said Madness is in their hearts, and had it been only a remanent act, We should have had less to fear, than we now have. I have now the fullest conviction that the most complicated distress, only, will bring us to our senses;  June 9, 1786  there is, however, too much reason to fear that we shall wake up at too late an hour, when, to borrow a sacred figure, The Summer is over & the Harvest is ended &c.(1) The Genius of Liberty & the spirit of Patriotism have flown from this Country. An Ideal, impracticable, selfish & topical Policy have been, & I fear will be the ruin of this Confederacy. Tracing back the transactions of America, I am fully convinced, that flagrant injustice have not only, in the Eyes of the Nations, stained our national Character, but provoked the just rules of the Universe. The cloud thickens in the west portending a Deluge of Blood on our extended, & almost defenceless frontiers. The subject is under Consideration in Congress, whether to send a force into the Indian Country, especially against the Wiandots, with the Sword in one hand and Conditions of peace in the other, but has been postponed from day to day for want of a sufficient Number of States on the floor. Of those here on my arrival, Connecticut, Delaware & South Carolina are off, & North Carolina talks of going soon. This too is the only reason why we have not drawn up & forwarded, before now, a pointed address to the States. In expectation of more we are reduced to a less number of States. The same reason has prevented me from even moving in the Affair of the College;(2) for it is rarely we have nine States on the floor, & then so much business of National Importance, which, together with my being a new member, have prevented me from moving in that Business. Congress are highly displeased that the States are running mad for & in the Emission of Paper money; but it is even out of our power, with any Grace to remonstrate against the Measure. It is considered by them tantamount to a Declaration that they will not support the federal government. I have laid your Demand,(3) inclosed before Mr. Walker, who is at the Head of the marine Department. He sais that the Books by order of Congress were sent to, & still remain at Boston where Pennel left them, & the Treasury Board will immediately make Application to Congress to put that Business in train to be setled. He assures me that as soon as he can become possessed of the Books it shall be the first business he would transact. It was necessary to leave the award in his Office, but has given me a Receipt of its Lodgment there for Adjustmt., which I think sufficient. Would you have me retain, or transmit this Receipt to you? A letter read yesterday from General Clarke addressed to the President of Congress, informs us that several tribes of Indians in Conjunction with the Wiandots, had in a War Council declared war, in a formal Manner, against the United States,(4) & urges the speediest decisions of Congress on a subject so important & interesting to our western Frontier.

 Sir, New York 9th. of June 1786. Yours of the 22d & 23d ult; & also of the 29th have been duly recd.; & the reason why I returned no answer was, that I could not satisfy you on the subjects of Enquiry. The Acts of the several States granting the 5 per Ct. & the requisitions of Congress were committed before I recd your Letter, & I have waited for them to report, which has not yet been done. Whether Congress can receive them upon said grants remains yet to be decided: for those States which have granted them have embarrassed them with such proviso's that it is doubted whether these can be accepted. I have several times enquired for Information on this subject & have recd, for answer that it cannot be known till Congress takes up this Business, which I see no prospect of their doing soon, for want of a sufficient number of States on the floor. This is the 3d day running that Congress have been obliged to adjourn for want of a sufficient number of States to transact Business.(1) I have felt several of the members on the subject of the Loan Officer, or a Deputy in Providence, but am silenced by being told that this is admitted in no other State, where they have to travail some hundred miles to get their Business accomplished. They seem not to listen to the complaints of the Distance of 30 miles, though by water, & the Island some part of the year inaccessible. I can give but little encouragement that an Application will succed, in this Business; but if you think proper to try, by way of Petition to Congress, which in my opinion is the best way, I will afford it all the support in my power, but I cannot speak incouraging as to its success, though I think with you, that it is a real Grievance. It would furnish a Precedent which would give Congress a great deal of trouble in the larger States. When you reflect on the tardiness of the State in supporting their Delegation, you cannot think that they would pay much attention to the complaint of Ellerys appointmt. before our Delegates arrived.(2) I would wish, should you petition, that Argument to be omitted. The appointment of a Person to transact the Business at Providence, would also augment the Expence, which is contrary to the present views of Congress who are determined to reform, as much as can be deemed reputable, the civil List. Besides the Treasury is at present intirely empty,  June 9, 1786  for I heard that board this very day tell the Minister at War that they would not, on any account furnish him with 100 Dollars to forward the amunition to the troops on the frontiers, & that they had yesterday borrow'd 16 Dollars to reimburse the Indians, robbed in Elizabeth town, as ordered by Congress, such is the situation of our Treasury! As to any other method proposed for paying the public debt, I have heard of none besides requisitions, 5 per Ct. & the sale of the western territory; none of which promise very soon to be productive, while Congress, or the federal Government, is so totally inefficient, & the States (disregarding the federal Government) by their paper emissions, inattention in keeping up a Delegation in Congress, & postponing the Collection of Taxes already assessed, &c, &c, &c. totally defeat all the plans of Congress. In short it is my candid Opinion without a very speedy reform in the policy of the states, they will not long be cumbered with a federal Government. Then where we shall land next is out of my province to divine. I yesterday proposed going immediately into a Commee. of the whole house on the state of the Nation, and to draw up, if expression did not fail to describe our Situation, a true state of the Confederacy & forward it, with our best advice to the respective states, that we might acquit ourselves from that heavy censure which must eventually fall upon Congress if she did not lift up her voice like a trumpet, & shew the People their transgressions, & warn them of their rapidly approaching ruin. It was thought that the remonstrance of only 7 States, for there were no more present, would be disregarded: & that we should wait for a more full representation. To day I proposed that, in addition to that measure, we should immediately, on forwarding this address adjourn to next September, to save the states expence & ourselves the reproach of sitting here to do nothing of the least Importance. Should the States form, in the interim, a Convention & vest Congress with adequate powers to conduct the federal Government, we might then meet to some purpose; & the States be convinced that it imported them to be more federal if we meant to retain a name amongst the nations. Several Gentlemen thought well of the Idea, & I hope yet to see it reduced to practice.(3) I wish it may be in time to be laid before the next meeting of our General Assembly, but this will, probably, depend on the arrival of more of the States by their delegates. You can easily see from the aforegoing that I have not had the least chance to propose the affair of our College; nor have I much reason to expect a sufficient number of States on the floor to flatter us with the least prospect of success. Should an opportunity offer, I mean to embrace it. Not a lisp have I recd from General Miller, nor a copper from Government for my support. I am now reduced to my last Guinea & my Bills unpaid. Relying on Gl Millers promise to send forward an 100   Dollars from the Election, then on hand, should he not then come forward, has placed me in this untoward situation. As he has not written I have been in hourly expectation of his Arrival. I have written to him, & to Govr. Collins on this subject but recd no answer. Congress do not think that the Confederation, even by implication, sufficiently vests in them the Power of Coining or emitting, exclusively, paper Money. Besides the present Congress dont chuse to assume any powers which are not expressly delegated to them. They too well know the Jealousy of the States to risque their Character in this way. The consequences of paper Emissions cannot be veiwed by you ruinous, in a stronger point of light, I believe, than they are by me, though possibly you may have a more feeling sense of it. At present, should the Eastern States support their delegations, there is little reason to fear that the southern States can carry it for an indiscriminate location of the western Territory, though I am fully of opinion that there is an impracticability in carrying into effect the Land Ordinance, as at first established. I have mentioned to several Members a plan of my own, which I think will nearly meet the ostensible wishes of both the Southern & Northern Interests. It is to survey, if possible, the whole tract from a Point where the Southern boundary line of Pennsylvania intersects the Ohio, down said River to the River Scioto, up that River till it intersects a line drawn due West from the place of the beginning, & thence due East to the Ohio. But as the present hostile State of the Savages may not suffer them to actually survey the lines of the Townships; that, after running round it, the Surveyor General delineate the Townships upon paper, with the respective Lotts, and immediately advertize in every State in the Union that said Lotts shall be sold at Auction in New York, under the direction of the Treasury board, beginning perhaps the first of next November. This measure would certainly very soon extinguish a considerable Sum of the domestic debt, & woud avoid many of the inconveniencies complained of in the Ordinance. This is thought well of by several to whom I have mentioned it. But it is time to request you to present my best respects to Mrs. Brown & Family, & assure you how much I am, Dear Sir, Your very humble Servt, J Manning ""

All the matters to which these papers refer are under the Consideration of Congress and in a train of examination. The Injunctions of Secrecy relative thereto being removed the several Delegations would probably before this time have communicated to their respective States Copies of those Dispatches touching the posts---;but on attention to this subject and said Statement of Supposed grievances it appears proper previously to ascertain several facts relative to it. Some doubts arise how far several laws mentioned in that Statement ever had in fact the effects of laws---;and what constructions the Courts of Justice have put on those laws which passed in due form the several branches of the legislature, [and] how far other laws of  June 10, 1786  the States and various important consideration are also to be attend[ed] to in order to determine with propriety how far the grievances stated by the Br. merchants are well founded. But Congress cannot come to any determina. on those subjects till there shall be a fuller representation of the States. And on this occasion also, Sir give me leave to express that anxiety I feel arising from the present feeble administration of the federal Government owing principally to the nonattendance of the Delegates from several of the States. <<The powers vested in the Gover't by the federal Compact even as it now is seem to be vested in a body where in many instances they are scarcely for the reasons above mentioned ever used. > It must give peculiar concern to any who feels for the honor and welfare of this Confederacy to observe our interestg negociations with foreign powers <<where the prosperity, liberty and property of many of our Citizens are so deeply concerned, where the honor and welfare of these are so deeply interested, exceedingly...> impeded and delayed for many months together by this inattention---;and at a time when so many good, well informed men in the union are disposed to cement the Social compact and <<when the exertions of federal men ought to be aided by a due adm'n of the powers already vested in Congress> with this anxiety I cannot but express my ardent wishes that the attention of the Several States may be turned to the adoption of means for keeping up a full and punctual representation in Congress and to the adoption of those regulations that shall make it a Duty in the Delegates to attend not to be dispensed with, So [far] as shall be necessary to keeping each State represented.

If the measure was accomplished it was sufficient; there existed no necessity for telling all the world of it; we shall hear of it in congress. Another mistake (unfortunate just at this moment) is committed by the Govr.; he says that Mass. did not grant to Cong. 'the power to levy the impost,' but agreed to levy it themselves, and grant the product.(2) Now this is a misrepresentation---;examine the act and you will find that it grants to congress \""the power to levy\"" &c with certain Provisos.

 Dear Sir, New York 11. June 1786 I intended sooner to have replied to your's of the 10th ult, but have been disappointed from post to post until this Time. I wish, most sincerely, that your Opinions concerning the manners, and Government, of our country were more general, than I think they are. The views of individuals are so various, and the imaginary interests of the States are so opposite, that without the Danger of some Evil that will affect each member of the Confederacy, a reasonable Hope cannot be indulged of a Reform. The Situation of the federal Government is now critical; the authority of the confederation is found to be inadequate to bring money into the common Treasury, and the Credit of the states is not sufficient to procure loans at home or abroad: indeed if the public credit was better, it could not, in my Judgment, be reconciled to the principles of common Honesty to borrow, without foreseeing the means of Repayment. In this condition every inconvenience, which can flow from a Violation of national engagements, & a loss of national Character, might justly fall on our Country. The embarrassments of commerce are better known to you than me. I cannot discover how the merchants of America, can bare a competition with Foreigners. No commercial nation will regret our disjointed condition, or wish the states to unite in any System of commerce. Every partizan of France or England residing among us, uses his utmost exertions to inspire the People of the different States with Jealousies of each other; and some of them have even sounded the alarm that the liberties of the People were endangered by the plan of delegating additional powers to congress. How long the most valueable, & important, interests of the States, will continue to be sacrificed to these unfounded Jealousies, cannot exactly be determined, but it is not possible that the public Affairs can be in a much worse situation, & there is therefore consolation in the Reflection that they will not long remain as they are. I fear that the commercial convention proposed to be held in Maryland in September, will go but a little way in Effecting those measures Essentially necessary for the prosperity and safety of the states. Georgia & South Carolina have not appointed Delegates; and their legislatures will not be in Session before the Winter. Maryland has not appointed; although the convention is to be in that State. The Assembly of North Carolina have not elected Delegates, but it is said that the executive of that State has nominated persons for the Office.(1) It is doubtful What the real Sentiments of Virginia are on the Question of commercial powers---;this is certain, that the proposition for the Annapo- June 11, 1786  lis convention, which originated in the Assembly of Virginia, did not come from the persons favorable to a commercial System common to all the states, but from those, who in Opposition to such a general System have advocated the particular Regulations of individual states. The merchants through all the states are of one mind, & in favor of a national system. The Planters in the southern states are divided in their Opinions & it is to be feared that the majority is against the only plan, which can insure the prosperity & honor of the confederacy. Your Ideas of the French Trade correspond with mine; their Farms, and Monopolies, are hostile to liberal commerce. How the experiment of American Oil will answer is very doubtful. The Marquis & Mr Adams(2) think that it will be a Great acquisition to procure a longer time than January 1787 for the introduction of american Oil under the Reduction of Duties. The Duty exacted from strangers is 36 L[ivres], 15 Sous, the Barrel of 500 lb French Weight. This Duty on the same quantity is reduced to 11 L[ivres], 5 Sous; or about 2 livres for every English hundred weight, on all american Oil imported before Jany. 1787. This Relaxation is stated to be an indulgence; but it ought however to be remembered, that this Sum is precisely the same as that, which is stipulated, in an ancient treaty between France and the Hanse Towns, to be paid on oil imported into France by the Hanseatic Merchants, and consequently, since the Treaty between the United States & France gives to each the rights of the most favored nation, that the Merchants of the former have a right to import into France their Oil on the same Terms as the Hanseatic Merchants. The monopoly of Tobacco by the Farmers General was the subject of the letter written by Mr. Jefferson,(3) to which the Marquis alludes. I have taken an Abstract of the letter and will inclose it---;it produced no beneficial Effect; little attention was probably paid to it; the Reform would have affected the Farmers General, whose influence has been sufficient heretofore to shake a Minister in his Office. Mr. de Calonne at this Time would be particularly careful to stand well with all men of influence about the court, being apprehensive lest Neckar shd. displace him, and again come into the Department of Finance.(4) But it is time that I put an end to Politicks. Mrs King joins me in respectful compliments to Mrs. Jackson, and in sincere wishes that the present Season may prove favorable to her Health. Mr. & Mrs. Guild passed us to the Southward without our Knowledge, although I had learnt by a French Gentleman from Boston, some Time before, that they were coming this way. Unfortunately Mrs. King was confined the two or three days they stayed here, on their Return to Boston. They left us a few days since & I hope will arrive safe. Mr. Gerry & myself have strengthened our Defence by the acquisition of our common   friend Mr. Osgood. I hope we shall be able to justify ourselves without calling in the Assistance of `Advocates'; this would appear too much like countenancing \""the Order.\"" With sentiments of Respect, I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, Your most obedt. servt., Rufus King ""

 Sir, New York 12th of June 1786 Yours of the 27th ult came to hand two days ago.(1) Am mortified exceedingly that you are not come forward nor sent on the money on hand, for I am reduced to but a few Shillings & my Bills not paid. My Situation, without a Colleague, without money, & without any instructions, or favourable prospects from Government is painful. Rhode Island has not many more strides to make to compleat her disgrace & ruin too; but that is not all, she is likely to hold a distinguished rank amongst the contributors to the ruin of the federal Government. Never, probably, was a full delegation of the States more necessary than now, for you may rest assured, that in the opinion of every Member of Congress, & in the several departments, things are come to a Crisis with the federal Government. You say you think the present house do not want a Congress, they may, more than probable, very soon see the Accomplishment of their wishes: For without a speedy reform in the Policy of the States, the federal Government must be no more. The flagrant violations of the public faith, solemnly plighted, in the late Emissions of Paper money on the Conditions on which it is emitted, is here considerd as the com- June 12, 1786  pletion of our ruin as a Nation; but I wrote you before on this subject, it is too painful to repeat.

 Dr. Sir New York June 16 1786 You may perhaps recollect that neither you nor I were very fond of Massachusetts passing a Law for the regulation of Trade & for the excluding British Vessells(1) ---;unless there was very good reason to suppose the other States especially those in the Neighbourhood would come into similar measures---;but I think Massachusetts must now be convinced that there is not the least probability that any one State will joyn them in this measure---;any further than to impower Congress to make the necessary regulations, and in the mean time they are very willing that Trade should continue on its present footing---; which is very advantageous to this State in particular---;there having been many Vessells from all the British Islands in the West Indies at this Port since I have been here. The demand for Lumber, pickeld fish, and indeed dryd fish whenever they could get it has consiquently been great. I am told Boards have generaly been at 5Â½ dollars at Boston while at this place they have been 8 and 9 dollars per thousand. Our Law can now have no other tendency than to injure ourselves for the British will never feel restrictions untill they become general. You are the best judge wither Mass. will not be in the right to repeal her Law---;wither a repeal will not allso opperate toward restoring the Province of Main to good humour. June 16, 1786  New York continue sellg. the Lands that Lay in the Country which Massachusetts claim. A large quantity was sold yesterday & more is selling at this moment. Some of that sold yesterday brought 12/ per Acre in final settelments.(2) I wish you to consider wither it would not be proper for our Government to impower & direct their Agents to make some publication to discourage those Sales in future. Perhaps it may not be improper to go as farr as to impower us to offer the same Lands for sale, as they may advertize in future for they mean to continue and they will very probably make use of our silence against us at the time of tryal. New York have impowered their Agents to compromise this business.(3) I was long ago of Opinion that if Massachusetts could get a handsome sum of money to quit claim their right it would be best to do it. The expence of bringing the Court togeather will be very great, and if Massa. recovers there will be great dificulties with those people who hold under N York, who perhaps to secure their property will adopt the example of Vermont. At any rate Massachusetts cannot exercise Jurisdiction over a people so remote. It is therefore so farr as relates to a compromise a business that requires the consideration of Government. The business of Congress is excessively retarded by the delinquency of the States in their representation and what has heretofore been unusual this delinquency is principally with the Eastern States---;NH., RI. & Cont. being unrepresented & have been so for some time past---;RI ever since November last. The interest of the Union suffers extreamly by this conduct---;many important subjects now before Congress cannot be passed on for want of nine States. There is no prospect of our Finances being in a better state for this year at least the Impost Law of N York is attended with so many just exceptions that it cannot be recd. by Congress, and a Comtt. have so reported.(4) For it is so different from all the other State[s] that it would be manifestly unjust to them to accept it, and it is inconsistent with the conditions on which the other States give theirs---;to recieve this. The Assembly of N York do not meet untill next Winter so that no remedy can be had this year. Pensylvania have allso annexed a condition---;which is that all the States shall give the supplementary funds before theirs opperates . . . & no State except North Carolina has as yet gone thus farr. I hope you will not think of paper money, but if you wait a very little while you will se the effects of it in those States where it is. It has lately fallen about 15 per Cent in Philadelphia, though the sum emited by that State is no more than the quantity proposed by the small State of Rhode Island. The Currency of North Carolina is the same as N York:   but it requires 12/ of their paper to buy a dollar and it is not probable that it will long hold at so good a rate as that. By what I have seen & heard I find the publications against the Lawyers have had considerable weight in Massachusetts, perhaps they have or may have influence in the choice of Delegates to Congress.(5) But this I can say for the Gentm. my collegues, that there are not three Men better acquainted with the affairs of Congress or held in higher estemation than Messrs. Sedgwick, King & Dane. They know not that I mention their names & least I should be thought to take a part what does not become in speaking their praise I conclude by assuring you that I am Your Huml Serv, N Gorham ""

 Dear Sir N. York June 16. 1786. Since my last but little hath been done in Congress. We have had generally no more than 7 States present. The only time that 9 were their time was employ'd upon the subject of the Connecticut cession, which ultimately was accepted; whereby she cedes all the land lying westwd. of a line to be drawn westwd. of the Pena. line parellel with the same. Our State voted agnst it but were in sentiment for it. It is hop'd it will terminate the variance respecting the Wyomin settlement by enabling Connecticut to give the claimants other land in lieu & thereby establish the government of Pena. in the benefit of the decree of Trenton. Other reasons there are which apply to the geographic-position of the land & the influence that consideration may have on the councils of Connecticut. We voted agnst. it under the sentiment, upon wh. our State hath always acted of her right to the no[rth]west  June 16, 1786  line from the northern extremity of her charter limits---;which we suppos'd shd. be regarded, even after the right w[as] given to the U.S., by the delegation. What shall finally be done with {Spain}(1) respecting the {Mississippi} becomes an interesting question, and one pres[sed] on us for a decision. {Gardoqui} has been {long labouring it's occlusion with Jay.} For some time I have been perfectly satisfied {the latter required no arguments to bring him into the same sentiment; the proposition is that it be shut for thirty years, in consideration for which Spain will} admit us into {her ports}, upon a {footing with her own subjects, we reciprocating}. This you may recollect was rejected at Annapolis upon its own merits only.(2) It is however magnified here as a great advantage & equivalent to the consideration requir'd. {We are also threatened with the project of a treaty} between {Spain} (in case this fails) {and Britain}. Yet I cannot comprehend upon what principle it can take effect. {Jay} stated difficulties in the managment of this business {with the minister} & proposd, without bringing any of these circumstances to {view that a committee be appointed with power to controul} all circumstances respecting {the treaty} with a view of {evading his instructions} & {concluding the treaty} before they were known. But as they were known to some who had mark[ed] the progress of the business each proposition was discuss'd [on] its own particular merits in the first instance. A committee was appointed to report---;{Jay} attended it. Of this {I} was a member. To us he cd. make no communication we did not already know---;so that the plan fail'd in not carrying a committee in the first instance for the purpose. This was a fortnight past & as yet we have made no report.(3) I have given circumstantially the state of this business [as] it has appear'd to me, not on evidence absolutely presum[ptiv]e only.

The Sum requisite for these Purposes and to be paid to the Surveyor General will be Â£420 New York Currency in Specie. Your Proportion of the Expenses, that have been and will be incurred will amount to a great Part of this Sum. You will not be surprised at this when I inform you that Col.

Unless the States make great exertion the very appearance of the federal Government must cease---;the civil list being without their pay for almost two quarters. Exertion is the more necessary as the collection of the outstanding taxes is the only dependence for every purpose. New York having made their import [impost] Law upon such conditions as renders totally inadmissable consistent with justice to the other States and as they do not meet again until winter nothing further can be done in the import [impost] this year---;it is, however, necessary that Massachusetts should determine wither they will grant the supplementary funds as Pensyla have made it a condition that their import shall not take place until all the States have granted those funds. Yesterday & the day before N York sold a large quantity of Land at auction being part of that claimed by Massachusetts some of it brought 12 (shillings) / acre in final set[tle]m[en]ts.

 My dear Sir, New York 18 June 1786 I intended by this post to have sent you a copy of the North Carolina law granting the supplementary Funds, but it is very voluminous, & the copy is not finished. I fear it will come too late, as I presume your Session will be a short one. Connecticut & New Jersey have finished their Sessions without attending to the situation of the confederacy; the former took into consideration the Requisition of last year, and refused a compliance with it. The latter in their late Session did not even treat the subject with the attention it received in Connecticut. You my dear friend, must know our Situation, as fully as I do, who am a daily witness of the humiliating condition of the Union---; you  June 18, 1786  may depend on it, that the Treasury now is literally without a penny. By anticipations, and the collections from Virginia, Maryland & this state, the Board of Treasury have made provision for the Dutch interest, which fell due this month---;but there is no prospect of their being able to provide for the payments which will be due in January. The posts on the Ohio are not well supplied with military Stores, the Secretary at War applied a few days since for 1000 Dollars for the transportation of the necessary Amunition to these Posts. The Board of Treasury, urgent as the occasion of this application is allowed to be, explicitly declare their utter inability to make this pitiful Advance.(1) What are we to expect? I wish I could see you for a few hours; It is impolitic to write any thing as information, which cannot be clearly proved---;and yet you and I have been under the fullest Conviction of the views & intentions of men, concerning which such clear proof did not exist. Be assured that your apprehensions of a certain influence in this State are well founded---;nay farther, the influence is not confined to this State. Those men who have hazarded every valuable consideration in the cause of their country, and those who are willing to pursue their example, are now held up to the people as their Enemies & not their friends. Every man who wishes to strengthen the federal Government, and confirm the Union, is represented as unfriendly to the liberties of the People. These expressions of anxiety for the Liberties of the people, come not from those who have lent their aid in the days of Adversity, but from those artful & venal Miscreants, who withdrew themselves from their country's support, and existed her bitterest enemies. They now successfully gratify their hatred of our Independence, by scattering Jealousies among the People. I am not vain enough to think my country has much interest in my services; but inconsiderable as they truly are, they have been considered as inconvenient to certain views. I have made it a certainty that a character in this City, which you & I never did, or shall confide in, has industriously communicated to a number of our Fellow Citizens, that I was in the Interest of N York, & opposed to Massachusetts, & that I intended to leave the latter & become an Inhabitant of the former. So far as the effect of this measure is personal, I ought not to be anxious---;but concerning the Objects wished for I am, and must be, concerned.

The Board of Treasury some Time ago reported it to Congress as expedient that the additional Commissioner be dismissed;(1) we have as yet kept the Business suspended conceiving that both Commrs. may be usefully employed, at least for some Time, and I conceive it to be an Object of importance to get the Accounts of our State with the Union as forward as possible;(2) especially as some of the States, instead of allowing us the Credit we deserve for being the foremost in our Payments on Money Requisitions, seem to cherish an Idea that we shall fall greatly in Arrear on the general Settlement of the Aggregate Account; and of the Account of specific supplies on Requisitions in the Year 1780. It is much my wish therefore to be prepared to meet them in a settlement of these Accounts.

 Sir, New York 23d. of June 1786 Not long since I wrote you(1) & gave the Information which I thought it my duty to give, since which, for want of a sufficient number of States to transact any business of importance, little has been done; and for several Weeks past Congress have been, the greatest part of the time, under the necessity of adjourning from day to day, as they could not make a Congress; though business of the highest importance to the Union demands the decisions of Congress. Those States who keep up their Delegation are not a little displeased with the delinquent States; and it is the unanimous voice & opinion of those on the floor of Congress that a continuance of this Neglect, will ere long, be attended with the most serious, not to say the most fatal consequences. On this Head I am in full of, I think, well founded fears. June 23, 1786  In obedience to the Orders of the General Assembly at their Session in February, I, on the 27th of April ult. embarked for New York, & immediately took my seat in Congress, in the full expectation that the State determined to support a Delegation. But I have not recd. a single Dollars to defray the great Expences attendant upon my present Situation. As I was not in Cash of my own, I could not discharge my Bills; & they consequently all remain unpaid, & that to my no small mortification; and this must remain to be the case till I experience the Assistance of the State. Add to this I am without a Colleague without whom the State cannot have a voice.  I now solicit explicit directions from the Legislature in referrence to my future conduct. My present situation is peculiarly disagreeable, & I beg your Excellency, as early as possible in the Session to lay my request before the house, that I may have their Ultimatum, whether they mean to support a delegation or not, that I may conduct myself accordingly. But I must presume that that Honourable House will not recall me without furnishing me with efficient means to enable me to leave New York, in a way which may not wound my feelings, nor reflect dishonour on the State. Please, Sir, to communicate, on this subject without loss of time.  I have the Honour to be, Sir, Your Humble Servt, J Manning ""

 My dearest Pamela. New York 24. June 1786. Your favor by your Mamma I received, she has been so obliging as to undertake to purchase the articles mentioned in your memorandum, so that I suppose you will receive them all by Mr. Brown's return. I have likewise desired her to purchase some little memorandum of my remembrance for our dear Fanny & Dory. Sweet little ones how much I wish to see them. Mrs. Dwight informs me you have not yet weaned little Harry, I am sorry, because I do really beleive your continuing to nurse him may be detrimental to your health, an object to me of the highest importance. I was in hopes a certain reason why he was not earlier weaned ceased when I came from home. Congress this day resolved itself into a committee of the whole house to take into consideration the state of the nation,(1) objects of more importance never came before an assembly. What will be the result god only knows, but unless the Government is reformed I am confident that what is commonly called accident will determine the state of our future existence. I am sorry my dearest & best beloved, you do not write me more frequently, because I think it in your power & I am sure I am not mistaken in your goodness of disposition, nor in your affection to me when I say, that you must be ignorant of the happiness I should experience in your correspondence, or you would write. Tell me my love, your wishes, your hopes, your fears. Make me your confidant, be assured that I will be a faithful one. And pardon me, I pray you, when I say that an appearance of distrust or want of confidence in you is the cause of as great pain as my heart can know. You have always been the pride of my heart, & how my love dos that heart exult when it experiences a reciprocal inclination in yours. There is a very general disposition to uneasiness on account of the profession of the law, in Massachusetts, and I am told T. G---;---;d(2) now in Boston is become a vehement paragraph writer on that question. If so & my information is probably well founded I will abandon him without any further exertion to his fate. This ferment is not to me unaccountable, Massachusetts has lost every advantage, she as a State expected in consequence of independence. In addition to this she feels herself pressed with an almost intolerable burden of taxes. Under these circumstances how easily are her passions agitated even to a degree of frenzy? the people who are meerly an instrument in these cases are greatly to be pitied, while those who drive them into excess are the proper objects of gibbets, & racks. Mrs. Dwight tells me that when she came from home Dewey and Williams were both absent from my Office, I wish you would be  June 28, 1776  pleased to tell Dewey or shew him this Paragraph that it is my peremptory direction that the Office shall in no instance be so neglected, & I should not be sorry that it should be further suggested to him that was I as regardless of his interest as he appears of mine his chance of being forwarded in the world would be less than it now is. I am the more surprised as [at] the Conduct of Mr. Dewey because I gave him before I came from home express directions on this subject. I hope however my resentment is without foundation & that Mrs. Dwight is mistaken. Pray dont forget the papers for which I wrote. I am my dearest & ever your Affect. Theodore Sedgwick ""

 Sir, New York, 30th June, 1786. It is with Regret we find occasion to mention that the discontents which arose between Congress and the Executive Council of Pennsylvania in the year 1783, are not wholly forgotten. An Application from Mr John Sullivan for pay and commutation as an officer of the Line or Quota of Troops of Pennsylvania, which has been pressed on the Commissioner of Army Accounts in an unusual Manner, has occasioned a Reference to Congress, and of course a revisal of some of the circumstances which accompanied those Discontents.(1) The matter we more particularly allude to, is a supposed Reluctance in the Executive of Pennsylvania to call to account & punish the persons concerned in the Mutiny of the Soldiers in 1783 which produced consequences not necessary to be now described. This Mr Sullivan and Mr Carbery were supposed to be promoters of the Mutiny, & to have fled the Country in consequence of it. In 1784 Mr Carbery returned to Maryland and was there arrested. Notice, it is said was given to the Council of Pennsylvania, where the offence was committed, and certain affidavits and other Documents tending to prove the guilt of Mr Sullivan and Mr Carbery were transmitted to Council & still remain in their custody; but that Mr Carberry was not demanded, nor any legal cognizance of the Affair taken on the Part of Pennsylvania. Some time in 1785, it is said, Mr Sullivan appeared and that he has since remained publickly and without disguise in Philadelphia, unquestioned by public authority touching the said offence. We know of no late Act of Congress as a Body, except the Resolution approving the Conduct of the Commissioner in refusing the Demands of Mr Sullivan, on which to ground this communication; but in the course of the Investigation suggestions and Insinuations were used which indicated opinions and sentiments less honourable to the Executive Authority of Pennsylvania than we could perceive without Pain, tho' we were not sufficiently informed to oppose them with Success.  June 30, 1786  We are not apprized that Congress either desire or expect any Explanations on this Subject, nor would we be understood as desirous of reviving Discussions which have been heretofore permitted to subside; but we conceive it to be our Duty to advise your Excellency of the existence of some remains of those discontents which we had hoped would forever have remained in oblivion. Your Excellency and the Council will judge whether any and what use to make of the Information. We do ourselves the Honour to inclose herewith a Copy of a List of Papers transmitted to Council by the Secretary of Congress in 1784,(2) which List was called for and read on the occasion we have alluded to; and a copy of the Resolution of Congress on the application of Mr Sullivan.(3) We have the honor to be very respectfully, Your Excellency's most obedient, & most humble servants. Cha. Pettit, John Bayard. MS not found; reprinted from Pa. Archives, 1st ser. 11:27--;28. 1 A June 26 letter from the commissioner of army accounts, John Pierce, enclosing 11 documents concerning the claim of Lt. John Sullivan for the arrears of his pay and commutation of half pay, had been read and debated in Congress June 27. Lieutenant Sullivan, one of the leaders of the Pennsylvania mutiny of June 1783 who had escaped prosecution by fleeing the country, had returned to the United States in 1785. Apparently emboldened by the lenity of the treatment accorded the mutineers who had been seized in 1783 and the failure of authorities to prosecute Henry Carbery, a fellow conspirator who had also fled but returned in 1784, Sullivan had originally written Pierce October 7, 1785, for the settlement certificates that would have been due him had he remained an officer in good standing to the end of the war. And when Pierce, knowing the circumstances of the lieutenant's flight, refused to issue them, Sullivan petitioned Congress October 17. The case had originally come before Congress in response to a query of October 26, 1785, from Pierce, which was referred to the secretary at war, who reported that as Sullivan had left the United States in 1783 \""without special permission,\"" it was up to Congress to decide \""Whether the so withdrawing himself from the United States. . .is deemed a relinquishment of the emoluments.\"" This, however, Congress had refused to decide. Although Secretary Henry Knox's December 9 report was read in Congress on December 27, no action had been taken on it. Sullivan accordingly attempted to revive his claim in May 1786, submitting letters and petitions to Congress dated May 12, 18, and June 12, and to Pierce dated May 26, June 6, and 19. See JCC, 29:904; and PCC, item 38, fols. 207--;26, 237--;78, item 78, 21:451--;57. Congress apparently still wished to avoid dealing with Sullivan's case. His May 18 petition was endorsed by Secretary Charles Thomson: \""The reading of this interrupted & Stopped by Congress, May 24, 1786.\"" But when Pierce again asked for instruction June 26, enclosing copies of his entire correspondence with Sullivan, Congress finally declared its approval of the commissioner's conduct \""in refusing [Sullivan's] application\""---;\""the said John Sullivan having withdrawn himself from the United States without leave obtained before the conclusion of the War.\"" JCC, 30:307n, 355. 2 For this enclosure, see these Letters, 21:628; and Pa.

 Dr Sir,(1) New-York 1st. July 1786 Your favor of the 20th of June has come safe to hand and it gives me pain to find that our land transaction should have caused any difficulty or uneasiness to you, and the more so as I view myself the person by whose advice you were engaged in that transaction. I am hurt at observing the emphatical manner in which you introduced the words \""favor of being admitted.\"" Is it possible that you can suppose I either meant or wished to injure or deceive you, my engageing in the same enterprize must put that out of dispute. I most certainly then thought it a good speculation, and even now after so great a change of an inverse nature of lands and certificates I still think it no bad bargain, and I have no doubt that in a few years hence it will bring more than double the money. The situation of that land far more the [than] compensates for its poverty which can easily be removed by manure from the Town which will be an inexhaustable source. I find here that the poorest lands, if not beyond the distance of five or six miles from the City sell from twenty to thirty pounds per Acre, and nearly the same price prevails near Philadelphia. I agree perfectly with you that the best method is that proposed by you of geting a title to the land and parceling of it out and had I in my possession the Certificates I would not hesitate to transmit them  July 1, 1786  for that purpose, the few I have remaining are lent out, I parted with Â£1,500 of them last winter & this Spring in improvements and providing for my fisheries, from which I expected to draw at Least Â£2,000, specie, and instead thereof I have Â£50 worth of fish in the whole. I think it but fair and right as matters have turned out that Captn. Cole and myself should be equally concerned with you in the land. Calling upon the Heirs or Executors of Mr. Russell would be attended with great difficulty and delay and would prevent a partition, I therefore think that altho his estate is liable to make good his contract, yet we had better not insist upon it. You may charge me with three times the sum lodged by Captn. Cole. I have considerable expectations that our final settlements will hereafter pay that debt, but that depends upon many contingencies and events. I have at length taken my seat at the great council,(2) and am much distressed to find our affairs in such a situation as makes it more than probable that a very short period will bring about a National Bankrupcy and of course a dissolution of our confederated Union and what effects this may produce God only knows. Congress will be under the necessity in the course of a few months to plainly tell our foreign creditors that they cannot make them any payment, and that they have neither any money nor a power to command any. The foreign demands are now made rather in a threat[en]ing tone and it is to be feared they will take measures to pay themselves. I have rented that pleasant and elegant House known by the name of the White Conduit House on the North river together with the furniture, I have sent home for my servant and expect in a few days to be in a situation to be made happy by a visit from any of my friends, amongst home [whom] in a peculiar degree I place yourself and Mrs. Williams, I flatter myself you could spend a few weeks here with much satisfaction. Mrs. Ramsey has not yet come on from Philadelphia, I expect her here tomorrow or next day. I shall [be] much gratified by your weekly correspondence. Your friend and Humble servt., Nat. Ramsey(3) ""

 My dear Genl.

The letter from Sr. Arthur Young came in the packet, but was not accompanied by any thing else. The british Consul here tells me it is not customary to send packages of  July 3, 1786  any sort by the packets as they sail from Falmouth or Portsmouth 300 miles from London, but that they come in vessels directly from London. Perhaps the letter is only meant as a letter of advice & that its copy will arrive in Potomac with the books, tho it is strange how Mr Athaws could think of sending the letter via New York. Unaccountable as the procedure appears I hope no loss may accrue, as Mr. Youngs works are the most valuable production of the sort extant.(2) Solicitous to gather all useful knowledge respecting farms & farming I sought this author out, on my arrival here, I could only obtain his tour thro Ireland, which I take the liberty to transmit to you now by favor of Doctr. Griffith. Before my return it is very probable you may receive the whole of the authors work, and these two volumes(3) will in the mean time afford you an opportu[nity] of putting into practice Mr. Youngs system of culture. If you should be in want of a new set of china it is in my power to procure a very gentell set, table & tea. What renders this china doubly valuable & handsome is the order of the eagle engraved on it, in honor of the Cincinnati. It has upwards of 306 pieces, and is offered at the prime cost, 150 dollars. Your reasoning on the navigation of the Missisippi is perfectly conformable to the prevalent doctrine on that subject in Congress. We are very solicitous to form a treaty with Spain for commercial purposes; indeed no nation in Europe can give us conditions so advantageous to our trade as that kingdom. The carrying business they are like ourselves in, & this common source of difficulty in adjusting commercial treatys between other nations does not apply to America & Spain. But my dear Gen. I do not think you go far enough. Rather than defer longer the benefits of a free liberal system of trade with Spain, why not agree to the occlusion of the Mississippi. This occlusion will not, cannot exist longer than the infancy of the western emigrants, therefore to those people what is now done, cannot be important; to the Atlantic states it is highly important, for we have no prospect of bringing to conclusion our negotiations with the Court of Madrid, but by yielding the navigation of the Missisippi. Their Minister here, is under positive instructions on that point, in all other arrangements the Spanish monarch will give to the states testimonys of his regard and friendship, & I verily beleive that if the above difficulty could be removed we should soon experience the advantages which would flow from a connexion with Spain.

 My Dear Son. New York July 4th. 1786. I retire from the rejoicings of this great Day of American Independance, which is now celebrating here with much Pomp & splendour, to acquaint you that your last Letter went on by the Post to Stratford a few Days since, while I was on my Passage here by Water. I have the pleasure however to hear by persons who came in the Vessell that you was well, for which I bless God. I left yr. Mamma & all the Family at Stratford very well, as Mr. Verplank's is here. Yr. Sister is particularly hearty & well, yet we cannot avoid being a good deal anxious for her as her time approaches, tho' we have every reason to hope that under the protection of Providence she may do very well. Your Letter will I trust be return'd to me in a few Days, by which I hope to be confirm'd in the Intelligence of your Health, & to hear that the Books & other things I sent you some time ago, came safe to hand. By this Vessel, which I am told sails tomorrow Morning I send you a Chest of Books, agreable to the inclosed List, & hope they will be useful to you. I believe I have before mention'd that if there are any particular ones that you wish for, upon your pointing them out I will send them to you, as soon as possible. Hindes Practice in Chancery(1) is the latest thing of the kind, & is very well esteem'd here, but I have not had time to examine it. We cannot find the Praxis Curia Admiralitatis.(2) Would not the British Statutes be of Use to you? If they will I can send you Ruffheads Edit. of them.(3) Would you have a Latin Edition of Grotius in addition to the old English one I have sent? There are two or three in the Library. I enclose you the Connecticut Confiscation Act, for Mrs. Browne,(4) & hope she will find it not so bad as she apprehended. In this Vessel sails Duncan Stewart Esqr. before the late War Collector at New London, now appointed to that Office in Bermuda. I was very happy to see him here. He is a very worthy sensible Man, has been long my Friend, & I trust will be yours. I have recommended you to his attention, & doubt not he will render you any reasonable service in his power. He conducted with great good sense & Prudence at New London, in very difficult times, & from thence I infer that Bermuda will be very happy in him as an officer & a Gentleman. He tells me there is some probability that Bermuda will be made a Free Port, if so,  July 4, 1786  you may soon become a place of great resort, & of much consequence. I am very glad to hear from him that Govr. Brown is like to retain his Government which, we were told in the Papers here was to be given to Lord Dunmore. Mr. & Mrs. Verplank, & Majr.

 My dearest Pamela, New York 4. July 1786. Your kind letter of the 24th ult. I recd. by Mr. Edwards. The several matters contained in your memorandum are forwarded by Brown excepting the cloak which will be sent by Mr. Edwards. Jo was mistaken in supposing my orders to be that the hay should be put in the new barn, my intention was to put every thing in the old barn it would hold. I am informed by every body that he and Henry do very well, pray tell them that I say so. Tell the Doctor & Harry that if they wish to correspond with me, I shall be happy in carrying on my part of it, but that I can't be convinced of this unless they first begin for I verily beleive they either have more leisure than I have. Our public affairs are in a situation as bad as almost the imagination can conceive. Yet I dispair not, for even now a virtuous exertion, aided by the blessing of Heaven, would open our prospect to permanent happiness. On Saturday night I had letters informing me that I was left out of the delegation of the next year. Whether because I am an old offending lawyer, or because, I had previously declared my intention not to serve, I am not informed. If the former, and I can get the information before the rising of the general court, I shall hold myself obliged in honor to resign,(1) at all events I beleive you may rely upon it that I shall leave this by the middle of August, & then return to the vale of private life for many years perhaps forever, when I do it I shall possess a consciousness, that in the variety of tumultuous scenes thro which I have passed, in no instance have I been induced to deviate from the strict line of my duty either thro motives of self interest or actuated by views of popularity, and I do think it can hardly be considered as arising from vanity when I declare, that I think the public owe me more for my exertions, than a ballance for the pageants confered on me. You know the pride of my heart, I hope it is not a dishonest pride, but such as it is it will always prevent on the one hand the meanness of sacraficing to popular vices or popular frensy, and on the other from the adulation of any man or body of men in power. I will be myself, and actuated I hope by purity of intention, having performed my duty, the event with humble resignation I will leave Where it ought to rest. May God almighty bless you & our sweet little ones prays your ever affect. Theodore Sedgwick ""

 My dear Sir New York 6 July 1786 The commercial treaty with Portugal was signed at London on the  July 6, 1786  25 of Apr.(1) Congress are not yet in possession of it, but probably will receive it by the first private american ship from England. You well know the regulation formed in Portugal in favor of the Millers of that Country, exertions were not wanting on the part of the american ministers to obtain a relaxation of this Regulation, and permission to import into that Kingdom the american Flour---;but without any success. The Treaty will not therefore be so extensively beneficial as could have been wished, but such as it is I think will prove the most valueable Treaty congress have yet formed regulating commerce. The letters from Mr. A. & Mr. J. of Apl. 23 are most explicit that nothing is to be expected from the disposition of the court of London(2)---;the language there is, why should we form a commercial Treaty, when we at present, pocket all the advantages of the american Commerce without a Treaty?

 Dear Sir, New York July 8. 1786 I have just received by the way of Baltimore your letter of the 22 April with the new invented lamp,(1) for which I return you my most  July 8, 1786  hearty thanks. I conclude you were disappointed in sending the one you mentioned in a former letter by col Senf, as he never called on me. The one you have now sent is an elegant piece of furniture, if it were not otherwise valuable on account of its usefulness. I am informed this kind of lamps is coming into use in Philadelphia and made there. I wish I could send you any thing from this country worth your acceptance. But arts here are yet in their infancy; and though Philadelphia begins to imitate yet has she not arrived to the perfection of inventing. I have heard much of those Mills near London, which are worked by steam, but cannot learn whether the steam is applied as an immediate agent for turning the wheels or raising water for that purpose. I am informed that there is a man in South-Carolina who has invented a machine to raise an immense quantity of water in a short space of time, by which it is said he can flood rice grounds, or draw off the water from drowned lands with great ease and little expence. I have not met with any person who could give me an Account of the principles on which it is constructed, how it is worked or what may be the probable expence. The inventor of the steam boat, which is to go against the stream has applied to several legislatures, which have passed laws giving him for a number of years the exclusive privilege of constructing those boats, but I have not heard that any are yet built and in use. During the course of last week we have had here for several evenings a display of Northern lights. The wind had blown for some days from south west & the weather was warm & dry. As my house nearly fronts the S.S.W. & has a large opening back, I had a full & beautiful view of the lights from the windows of my back parlour, which is raised one story from the ground, the opposite houses only intercepting about four or five degrees from the horizon. As I viewed them on Friday evening the 30 June there appeared just over the tops of the houses a white luminous cloud extending in a horizontal position from NE to N.W. From this cloud, at different places darted up successive streams of light tapering to points, some of them to the heighth of 50 degrees. The stars were bright & the north pole clearly discernable among the streamers, so that by it I could judge of their heighth. Some times the white cloud appeared in places a little darkened before the stream ascended, in which cases I observed the ascending stream was tinged with red & continued to have a redish hue. Having a lofty steeple in view to guide my eye and direct my judgment I observed two or three of the streamers which rose in the North east & were of this hue, moving with a slow but regular progressive motion towards the North, still continuing perpendicular & very high. From one of them I thought I saw a flash of lightening; but not seeing it repeated I concluded I was mistaken. The light was so great as to cast a shadow from my body and from my hand against a wall. On the   following evening viz. Saturday July 1 We had nearly the same appearance but not in so great a degree. These you will observe are only common phenomena, which philosophers have endeavoured to account for on various principles and about which I should not have troubled you but for a phenomenon which appeared on Saturday night. This was a luminous Belt, or stream of light forming a great and regular bow from east to west. At what time it made its first appearance or how it was first formed, whether instantaneously or by degrees, I cannot say as I did not see its first formation. My attention was called to it about half after 10 o clock. It was then quite compleat, and seemed to form an Arch passing through the zenith from horizon to horizon. As I viewed it to the west, it seemed to rise from behind the opposite houses like a stream of pale white light about a yard broad, spreading as it advanced to the zenith to two or three times that breadth. Viewed to the East, it had the same appearance down to the horizon where its breadth appeared the same as just over the tops of the houses to the west. I watched it for half an hour during which time it continued invariably the same. At length to the east I saw it drawing to a point at the horizon and gradually abating in light for four or five degrees upwards. After it seemed to have vanished to that heighth or rather more, it darted down at short intervals from the luminous part a pointed quivering stream. Soon after the light began to abate through the whole circle. I did not continue to watch it till it wholly disappeared as I was indisposed and afraid of catching cold; but I am told it lasted till about half past eleven. I have conversed with a person who saw it at a place about 30 miles north from this City. There it had the same appearance and seemed to pass through the zenith. I have written to Philadelphia to know whether it was seen there, but have not yet receivd an answer. The day following was very hot. Monday morning was overcast, but sultry. About 9 o clock the Sun broke out and it seemed as if we should have a very hot day; but about noon there arose a dark smoky vapour which covered the whole heavens, sometimes so thick as quite to hide the sun sometimes only obscuring it so as to make it appear like a great ball of fire or a dark red full moon. This smoky vapour last the whole day & in the evening there was a smell very much like that from burning green brush wood. Next day the Vapour continued but in a much less degree. Since that we have had two thunder gusts which have cleared the air and the northern lights have disappeared. I mention the circumstances before and after the phenomenon only to point out to you the state of the atmosphere.(2) I have sometimes had it in contemplation to hazard some thoughts on the general Deluge & endeavour by an hypothesis somewhat different from any I have seen to prove not only the possibility but the probability, I had almost said the certainty of the waters covering the  July 9, 1786  whole Earth. But having lately had a cursory reading of an ingenious piece written on the subject by Mr Whitehurst, which I dare say you have seen, I should be glad first to know your Opinion of his hypothesis & reasoning. And while your thoughts are turned to the subject I wish you to consider what would be the probable effects of a sudden change of the position of the earth, say for instance by an alteration of the poles, an inclination of the axis 23Â½ degrees, or a change in the Annual Orbit. I do not mean by this to divert your attention from political subjects in which I find you have been usefully employed. I have read with much pleasure the two papers containing observations on the transportation of flour, and on Contraband. I am glad they were written and delivered. For though at present the object is not obtained, yet I am confident if the proper moment is watched & improved, the arguments there stated will on some future Occasion have due weight & influence. Mrs. T. desires to be remembered to you & to your Daughter. I am with unfeigned affection & esteem, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble Servt Cha Thomson ""

 Dear Gerry, New York 9 July 1786 What effects will flow from the Grant of the supplementary Funds by Massachusetts at present is doubtful---;indeed the value of the domestic Debt becomes more and more uncertain.

The Officers of the late Army have most of them sold their Certificates; and are now clamarous against their Redemption except at a depreciated amount.(1) Mr. Osgood is decided in his Opinion, that the best mode of conducting this Business, will be an apportionment of the whole Domestic Debt upon the states or in other words for congress to make a requisition for the whole Principal of the Domistic Debt, & leave it to the states to arrange the payment with their own Citizens as they may please.

 Dr Sir, New York July 14. 1786 I am to beg your pardon for having suffered your three last Letters to ly so long unanswered. This neglect has been owing to a severe Rheumatism which kept me for upwards of three months disabled to write without excessive pain---;indeed that and the Ague have until within a very few days past nearly disquallified for business of any kind. The first of these Letters respects Colo Mentges' Forage Accts. The Prices of forage in South Carolina have in no year been so low as to reduce the allowance for deficiencies which accrued in that State, to less than 30/90ths of a dollar for a full Ration---;nor have I allowed less---;observing however that if Officers were on Command or Furlo in any other State, any part of the time, to allow for so much of the deficiencies as happened during such absence from the Army, only the prices applicable to where they really were. Upon these principles Colo. Mentges' acct. appears to be justly Stated in the debits. The statement of the Credits I suppose are also right upon the principles of allowing double of either Species of Forage when both are not to be got, and allowing that the Rice straw drawn with the grain supplies the Hay part of the Ration. As to these Accounts being paid out of the Funds appropriated to the debts of my department,(1) they were not taken into the Estimate, but still I believe, allowing that several of the  July 14, 1786  debts will from the remoteness or obscurity of the Creditor never be demanded, the funds might be Sufficient to embrace them provided the southern Bonds were fully collected, that however is far from the case and the paper money System nearly stops any further progress. Some money still remains in Mr. Webbs hands which I wish not to be disposed of untill I know what have become of several large debts which you will see on the list for Waggons & Teams purchased in 1782 payable by my special note personally binding in Jan. 1783. Upon the whole I suppose you may venture to adjust the Accounts and suspend payment until the collection in So. Carolina shall produce the money to discharge them. There is no purposes to which I would with more pleasure see the spare Money applied than those for deficiencies of forage to the Officers of the Army. As to Mrs. Carrol I positively deny that she ever gave me her certificate, and Whether the Commissioners would any of them take up the Certificates I cannot undertake to judge. As to the claim of David Atcheson He stands in the Ledger for 1781 Creditted for 29 27/90ths for services as a Teamster in 1780 on a Certificate of Robert Brit---;it does not stand in the Pay Rolls but is a seperate entry in my Genl. Acct. I do not recollect the certificate you mention, or is any such creditted in the Books---;perhaps it is for the same & that a mistake has been made in the Sum---;if you will enclose it to me I will see & send it back to you. Having now got tolerably well recovered I wish to go on with the settlement of my Accts. The Vouchers I lodged with you will be necessary---;can you get some good freind who may be coming here & whose care can be confided in to bring them to me? I suppose it will be proper for you to keep the Accts. which we examined & I must have them recopied from the Books here. I am, Dr. Sir., with great regard, your Afft. ob svt, Ed. Carrington ""

 Dear Sir New York July 14. 1786. I shod. have answer'd your kind letter sooner but delay'd it untill I should hear from Mr. Marshall who acts for me in your affair with Randolph that I might advise you of the State of that business. By him I have been inform'd that he instituted a suit soon after I left the State agnst. him, but that by his death which has lately taken place it hath abated---;that he hath in consequence thereof renew'd it agnst his Executors.(1) He fears sometime will elapse before it will be decided but  July 14, 1786  assures me of his utmost exertions to promote it. I shall particularly charge myself with it so soon as I arrive in the state which will be in the fall. A subject of some importance hath lately been submitted to congress upon the letter form Governor Henry of Virginia for Assistance agnst. the Indians. As the ultimate decision of Congress upon the propositions presented to them in a report founded on instructions to the delegation from the Executive hath been contrary to the sense of the State and may perhaps be the subject of investigation as to its propriety upon the principles of the federal compact, and policy, in the present State of the confederacy derang'd & out of order as it is, being rather of the irritating than conciliating spirit, I take the liberty to possess you with all the evidence upon which congress acted, except the letter to the delegation which I fear will not be copied in time; if however it is not I will forward it to you in my next.(2) I will also in my next enclose you a subsequent dispatch from the Executive on the same subject.(3) It was with great reluctance that we brought forward these propositions & especially so after we found they wod. probably be negativ'd, that we were constrain'd to take a decision---;but that it was our duty I am persuaded you will find by an examination of these papers. Believe me I have no secrets of a publick nature or which particularly respect myself that I will not with pleasure commit to you in confidence. The intimation which respected myself was from the gentleman now in the chair to a gentn. in presence with Colo. Grayson; by the latter it was handed to me. As I knew myself to be above the influence of such considerations I was hurt exceedingly that an apprehension of the kind cod. get admittance into the breast of anyone. I therefore immediately withdrew myself from a station wh. cod. possibly subject me eventually to such an imputation.(4) I had absented myself the last year from Congress for the purpose of attending this court & in consequence incurr'd in some degree the displeasure of the State; certainly I subjected myself to the unfriendly imputations of some who did not wish me well. This circumstance perhaps hurt me as much as any other consideration. But upon more mature consideration I am inclind to believe circumstances which might be suspected to exist of personal interest in the lands, but which my last I inform'd you did not, wod. upon the common usage of the world justify such an apprehension; I am indeed therefore far from reprehending this gentn. upon this occasion. I have only mention'd it to yourself & some one or two friends here whom I cod. not avoid mentioning it to. Mrs. Monroe is well & promises to shew her friends she did not write but to some purpose. She joins me with the whole family in best wishes to yrself, Mrs. Gerry & Miss Thomson. I am dear Sir very sincerely your friend & servant, Jas. Monroe ""

 Sir. New York 15th. July [17]86 Yours of July 4th came to hand yesterday. I have not Leisure to pay much Attention to Mr Bowlers Publication at present.(1) I put one of his  July 17, 1786  pieces into the hands of the President, to whom it was directed, but have not heard his opinion on the subject. I shall mention it to Gentleman of my Acquaintance, but fear his prospects of Sales here are not flattering. Two days ago Genl Miller arrived(2) with the Allowance made me by the State, which will not amount to much, as those Indents sell from Virginia to this place at 6/ per Pound & under---;And for less still southard of that. I doubt my being able to get more than 5/6 in Cash for them here. They were, Col Lee informs me 15/ per Â£, in Virginia till the floods of them from the Northward lowered their price to 6/. Informing you what States have passed the Requisition, will not give you any rule by which you can know where to send your Indents; for South Carolina is allowed to pay hers by the Large Advances she made towards the close of the War: so that, I am told they will not fetch more than 2/6 per Pound there. In short I cannot find that you will find any Market for them in this quarter, except New York, Pennsylvania & Virginia, & then at the Prices I have mentioned. Connecticut, New Jersey, Delawar, Maryland, &c not having passed the Requisition is doubtless the cause of this low price.  I agree with you that the delay of the Requisitions is an unfortunate circumstance, but if the States will not keep up their Delegation, these delays will be unavoidable; & as a Rhode Island Delegate must I not shut my mouth? A requisition for this Year is reported by the Treasury board, has been committed & the Committee are now sitting to form a Report thereon to Congress, what will be the fate of this time must determine, but I fear it will be too long delayed;(3) & when sent forward I fear the neglect of the delinquent States, in not passing the Act, will retard its movement through the Legislatures. In short there is such an amazing inattention in many of the States to the great Interests of the Confederacy, & their respective Duties, that I fear; I greatly fear that nothing but great public Calamities will sufficient[l]y awaken them. As to Mr Chinn he told me that the State had not got their Accts ready for Adjustment,(4) or rather that they would not bring them forward, lest they shoud not be allowed, intimating they were such that they were conscious ought not to be allowed, & therefore did not bring them forward. I could not deny this but told him it was quite different from what I had understood to have been the case. General Miller tells me that he intirely misrepresents the facts. These Commissioners are amenable to the board of Treasury. I moved in Congress that an Enquiry should be made into their conduct in this Business, & was told that it belonged to that board to call them to account. I have proposed to Gl. Miller to wait on the board soon on that subject, but unless we are urged forward or at least supported by complaints from the State, our Application must be quite lame. Mr Dane & myself have proposed soon to bring forward a motion in Congress that their  July 15, 1786  Commissions shoud all terminate next December; & that after that all the States should compleat their Settlement with the board of Treasury by an Agent or Agts. from the States. This I conceive will be in favour of our State as the Commissr. appears so untoward. I spoke with him myself upon my arrival here on the Subject of the College, but he told me that his Appointmt. would admit of no claims to be brought in now; so that our only prospect is to obtain a Grant from Congress, & they are so crouded with important Business at present that I fear I shall be able to do little on the subject, tho I mean to make the Experiment, when I have so paved the way by an Acquaintance with the Members that I may hope to succeed. I am Sensible that the Procrastination of the Settlement of the public Accts. is a radical Evil in this Confederacy. How to cure it is a question of no small magnitude. A reduction of the Salarys may have its influence. General Miller has given me a full account of the Politics of Rhode Island, which to use a Parliamentary Phrase, are damned by all I hear speak of them. The Ship of the State in my opinion is caught by a violent tempest but I recollect that you have got an old experienced Sea Captain at Helm.(5) You I conclude construe the late prop to the Law, as extending to all members of the State whether in or out of its Jurisdiction, & of course I must not speak, not to say think against it. Till lately, I had conceived that money included in the Idea of it some thing desireable, & of course the Possession of it was esteemed a great good; & that when any thing ceased to be viewed in that Light it, with Propriety, could no longer be called money. If this way of thinking was founded, perhaps the late paper Emission ought not to be called money now. I most sensibly feel the embarrassments of my friends, but the extreme rigour of the Law, will, I think, defeat itself, & probably the Legislature, at their late Session could not have more effectually subserved your wishes than by the severity of that Act. I am glad Delegates are chosen to meet those of other States respecting the Regulations of Commerce.(6) But find several of the States have made no Appointments, & Maryland for one. Connecticut is also in that number.  The Alarms of an Indian War are growing more & more serious; & it appears from recent, & authentic Accounts from the western frontiers that they must be sacrificed, or we must immediately raise a considerable Armament to repel, if not extirpate some of those Savage tribes. Great Numbers have already suffered by their barbarous hands. With an exhausted Treasury this is a calamitous event, but possibly this may awaken the lethargic States. I hope you will be able to settle matters agreeably in College. Am sorry Mr Fobes's Health will not permit him to attend constantly.(7) Accept my hearty thanks for your communications & continue them when anything worthy of Notice occurs. Present my best Respects to   your worthy Lady & the rest of the family, & believe me to be, With the highest Sentiments of Esteem, Sir, Your Humble Servt, J. Manning ""

 Dear Sir New York July 16th. 1786 I have not heard from you for several months past, the last being dated sometime previous to your removal to London.(1) Not knowing you wod. have staid so long I have wrote you by every packet to France. We have now present 12 States & hope this will be the case for some time. Soon after my arrival here in the winter I suggested to you my apprehensions that the condition of the act of cession from Virga. which respected the extent of the States to be erected over the ceded territory was an impolitick one & that it might be proper to recommend it to the State to alter it.(2) A proposition of this effect was submitted to Congress which ultimately pass'd advising that it be vested in Congress to divide the sd. territory into not less than 3 nor more than 5 States.(3) But the investigation of this subject has open'd the eyes of a part of the union so as to enable them to view the subject in a different light from what they have heretofore done. They have therefore manifested a desire to rescind every thing they have heretofore done in it, particularly to increase the number of Inhabitants which shod. intitle such States to admission into [the] confederacy, & to make it depend on their having on[e] 13th part of the free inhabitants of the U.S.(4) This wit[h] some other restrictions they wish to impose on them evinces plainly the policy of these men to be to keep the[m] out of the confederacy altogether. I consider this as a dangerous & very mischievous kind of {policy}(5) & {calculated to throw them into the hands of Britain}. I know not with certainty whether they will be able to carry this point but if it is press'd & a probability of being carried we shall object to the power of the U.[S]. to determine the numbers without the consent of the State. It having been left open in the act, does by no means put it in the power of the U.S. to make such restrictions on this head as to defeat the condition altogether. If they do not therefore agree with the delegation to leave it upon the ground of April 23d, 1784, we shall propose a subsequent convention between the parties as to that point---;& deny the right of the U.S. to act otherwise in it. In my last I advis'd you of an {intrigue} on foot under the {management of Jay to occlude the Missisipi supported by the delegation} of {Massachusetts}.(6) Since my last no further measures have been openly taken in the business, yet it is not relinquish'd. As yet there hath not been a fair tryal of the sense of Congress on the subject. I have a conviction in my own mind that {Jay} has manag'd {this negociation dishonestly}. On the other hand I am persuaded that {the minister here} has no {power} on the subject---;yet I am firmly persuaded that he has conducted himself in such manner in this business as to give him & {his court hopes} which {the sense} of {Congress} nor {his instructions authorise}. Having been on all foreign business laterly, indeed since you left us, I have had an opportunity of knowing {him} well, & this communication is founded in circumstances this opportunity hath  July 17, 1786  given me. The {Massachusets delegates} except {the president}(7) whose talents & merits have been greatly overated (tho preferable greatly in the latter instance to his brethern) are without exception {the most illiberal} I have ever seen from {that state}. Two of these {men} whose names are {Dane(8) and King} are elected for the next year which is my motive for making known to you this circumstance. It may possibly be of some service to you, as I shall leave Congress, to possess information, of this kind. The former is I believe {honest} but {the principles} of the latter I doubt. It has been propos'd and supported by our State to have a Colonial govt. establish'd over the western districts & to cease at the time they shall be admitted into the confederacy; we are fully persuaded it will be beneficial to the setlers & to the U.S. & especially those to whose frontiers such establishment form'd an immediate barrier. This hath not been decided on---;& hath only been postpon'd in consequence of the inordinate schemes of some men above alluded to as the whole policy of the affrs. of that country. I am not aware of any thing else that I can give you new. In October I shall leave this for Virga. & shall settle in Fredericksburg for the purpose of commencing the practice of the law. I hope by this you have reachd Paris agn. & at home---;that you have been well pleasd with your trip. Mr. Madison writes me today [he] is at Phila. & intends in a few days a visit here.

 New York 18. July 1786. Thank you my dearest Pamela for your obliging & affete. letter by J. Edwards. I had just sent you a letter by Eglerton, accompanied with your cloak and a small Bundle of I dont know what to Miss Pynchon. I mention this now because I have not to my recollection given you as I ought this information before. Return if you please my compts. to Miss P. tell her she has my thanks for her attention to the instruction of my children. So far as mental information extends, I always supposed her an excellent instructress. But her Ideas of polite behavior or mine are extreamly absurd. All formality, and attentive precisions of behavior, as it implicates pain, is to me disagreable, but ease, and unconstraint as it excites an idea of satisfaction causes an agreable sensation. Hence the great difference between the well bred and polite, and those who discover a painful oppression from the presence of the company. While I am speaking of the business of schooling permit me to request you to speak to the doctor respecting the erection of a school house. To me it is an object of importance. So far is your being pleased at my being left out of the election for the next year, from requiring any apology that I sincerely thank you for it. I have long since been convinced that public life is not a source of happiness, but the reverse. Vulgar applause was never to me a cause of exultation, and I think that I am not degraded in the opinion of the respectable, & virtuous. A consciousness of rectitude and no inconsiderable share in the esteem of good men will not admit a regret that fools, & knaves are gratified at my expence. I can, and I hope  July 20, 1786  without regret descend, (if indeed it is descending) to private life. I can attend more than of late I have been able to the instruction of my children. I can enjoy more of the company and conversation of my dearest & best beloved. I can make a better provision for my family, and enjoy more of that ease which a long course of unremited labor has rendered eligible, if not necessary. Indeed I am now precisely in that situation which previous deliberation had made the object of my choice. But compulsion and not choice is the cause of my being placed in these circumstances, and you know Shakespear makes Falstaff say, That, he would not give reasons on compulsion though they were as plenty as Blackberries.(1) I am sorry one of Miss Betsy's volumes is lost, with great attention I put them in one bundle, Bacon told me he would take particular care of them, and if I am not mistaken he informed me he has put them together with the tea, and I think some thing also into P. Dewey's chest. Perhaps an imediate enquiry may restore it. I am sorry for poor Williams, he is the child of misfortune. I hope however he will soon recover. I wish my dearest love you could spend not only an evening, but a night at my hotel. O my dearest had I your company, I should enjoy life with much greater satisfaction, than at present falls to my share. Make my Compts. to all my freinds, particularly Mr. Edwards. Tell Harry I say he is a very lazy fellow, or before this he would certainly have wrote me. Give my love to the Doctor, & remember me kindly to all the members of my family. Farewell! & be assurred I pray you of my unaltered, & unalterable affection, Theodore Sedgwick ""

 My very dear sir,(1) New York the 24th of July 1786. Your kind letter of the tenth instant like a precious cordial was very pleasant to me, I received it with great satisfaction, and it adds not a little to the portion of happiness I have yet remaining, to learn that my friend is basking in the full beamings of connubial bliss. I too have had my sun shine of prosperity since our last interview at Morris Town, but those days of felicity were transient, they are gone, and the stage of life seems at present to be hung round with gloomy scenes. I beg sir that you will present my sincere respects to Mrs. Ward and observe to her that tho' I have not the honor of an immediate acquaintance, yet I find myself much interested in her happiness since it is inseperably connected with yours. Sir the political part of your letter contains sentiments in perfect unison with my own on the state of our nation. I know very well that our enervated situation will afford cause of triumph and songs of joy to our enemies, and the consideration thereof mortifies me most sensibly, but until the several states awake from those baneful slumbers of insensibility, and shake off those groundless jealousies which forbid their vesting in Congress, powers, adequate to the governing of a nation whose interests are so complicate[d], and in many respects so local, I do not see but that our political ship must inevitably be wrecked: and I much doubt whether we shall be able to rouse them until some fatal catastrophe involve us on[c]e more in blood & war.  July 24,1786  These are distressing reflections indeed, and I am ready to cry out Oh! such an event must not, shall not take place; but my dear sir let me ask you what rational grounds there are to induce any other opinion: there is not a state in the Union which may not be charged with great delinquency, many with inveterate obstinacy, some indeed with avowed hostility to Congressional measures. And what are we better than other nations of whom history abounds with example, who having had pleasing prospects dawning upon them, by some inconsiderate act, some fatal dissension, or unaccountable omission have precipitately fallen from the most envied station to become a bye-word and reproach. Perhaps you may wish to know what we are doing in Congress? why sir to tell you the truth, in my opinion we do not even do those things for which we have sufficient powers: very little indeed is in our power to do, but this we might do, we might take effectual measures for selling the federal lands, last year was spent by vainly attempting to carry into execution a plan for laying the whole country into townships of six miles square, previous to the sale of any part. This season the same scheme is again put into operation, but I fear that like the former attempt it will prove fruitless as the Indians are still hostile. Thus year after year is wasted away, the public debt enhanced by the interest ariseing thereon; to say nothing of the great expence attending such a train of surveyors, when by opening a land-office in some proper place for the purpose of selling the land and granting warrants of survey, the public would be put to no expence, and millions of dollars in certificates would be immediately paid into the land office by men who would not be baffled in their views of taking up the land, by a few hostile Indians, as the public surveyors are from year to year,(2) and which cannot well be prevented. When we shall effect a sale and settlement of that most delightful region is altogether uncertain, but my attention at present seems wholly engrossed by the object; I purpose to make a journey into the western country in October next with a view of feasting my curiosity in that fertile soil and unparallel'd country;(3) I expect to spend a year on the tour, if I live to return I will do myself the honor to give you a brief relation of its true character. I make no doubt but in a few years there will spring up in that western hemisphere many Towns and even cities of the first distinction, the Country is finely interspersed with navigable Lakes and rivers well adapted for commerce, and the soil by all accounts will prove the Egypt of America. Our posterity may flourish there in some after age in a manner of which their progenitors have at present few or no Ideas. But in the mean time my friend we have to struggle through a group of surrounding difficulties, God grant us success. And be assured sir that however gloomy my future prospects may be, it shall  July 24, 1786  always brighten my days to hear of your happiness and that of your family, which I beg you will often communicate to, dear sir, Your most obedient humble servant, John C.

 Sir, New York July 26th. 1786. Some weeks ago the Board of Treasury thought proper to direct the Continental Loan Officer in Pennsylvania to suspend the Payment of Interest on Public Securities to Citizens of the State on a Supposition that the Legislative Act of March last did not amount to a full Compliance with the Requisition of September 1785, though the same Board had before admitted it to be such Compliance, and had directed the Loan Officer to proceed accordingly. When the Board communicated their suspending Order to Congress, it was referred back to them for Report. We took Occasion to confer with them on the Subject, endeavouring to convince them of the Impropriety of the Order, and of the Mischievous Consequences that would probably ensue if it should  July 26, 1786  be persisted in. The[y] appeared to wish the Order had not been made, but having officially communicated it to Congress they did not think themselves at Liberty to revoke it without a Special Order for the Purpose, and promised to make as favourable a Report as they could to induce Congress to give such Order. On Thursday last their Report was presented, a Copy of which will be inclosed herewith.(1) The next day, which was as early as forms would admit, we moved for a decision upon it; but, several Gentlemen demanding time to prepare for the Question by an Investigation of the Facts it was postponed. Yesterday it was taken up on our Motion to have it referred to the Board to take Order when, to our great Surprise, it met with a vigorous Opposition. After a debate of some hours, the Motion was negatived by ten States out of the twelve present.(2) The Report, however, is not dismissed by this decision but remains still open to another Motion, tho' We do not think it proper at present to agitate any farther Question upon it.(3) Time will not permit us at present to state the heads of the Arguments used on the Occasion. But as it may be useful to the State that they should be known, we may think it our duty to trouble your Excellency with a farther Communication for this Purpose at another Time.(4) I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your Excellency's Most obedient and most humble Servants, Charles Pettit, John Bayard.

 [July 27? 1786](1) The subject is of importance, for the state of our finances is miserable. We need immediate relief, if therefore this Law can be accepted & operate it ought. This plan is only recommendatory. The States have a right to deliberate & to refuse---;that if they grant part it should be if possible accepted. I cant but remark that Cong. have spoken in a more rigorous stile to such States as have not complied with, their recoms. than to those who have refused to comply with their constitutional requisitions. It seems the fashion to find fault with N. York---;witness the requisition---;& the report of the Board---;&c this ought not to predjudice. The Law is not a full compliance---;no other State has---;yet congress have declared most of them a compliance. This shews Cong. conceive they have a right to determine. The question then is, is this Law such a substantial compl. as will answer the main end Congress had in view in requiring. The main end was to raise money to pay the debt. If this act provides effectually to raise the money, it then answers the end, which was in view by the recommendn---;and so is a substantial compliance. It Does make this provision---;it directs it shall be collected agreable to an act in force---;this act a good one. July 27, 1786  That most of the States have complied with the recommendations sub modo, or under restrictions & limitations, which grants much less than is asked, will appear if we consider, what is included in the powers to levy---;and compare the powers granted by the laws therewith. The power to levy, includes in the opinion of the Committee, that of forming the necessary regulations or revenue Laws with suitable penalties of declaring the money in which the duties shall be received of establishing the number of revenue Officers, & ascertaining their duties---;& may I add of instituting courts for the trial of Offences &c. In short, as the power to levy is a general power for the purpose of collecting the revenue, it must, accordg. to the reasoning of the Comm. include in it all power Legislative, judicial & executive, so far as the exercise of these powers are necessary to the purpose of collecti[n]g the Revenue. Let us now enquire how far the States have granted these. 1. Legislative---;New Hampshire grants this, under a variety of provoes. Mass., Virginia, S. Carolina---;the same. N. Carolina. All of them provide that persons Offending shall not be deprived of a trial accordg. to the Laws & Cons[titution].  Connect. provides the Ordinances shall not be incons[is]t[ent] with the cons[titution] & internal police of the State. Delaware that they be not repugnant to the Laws & consttn. N. & S. Carolina & Georgia provide no duties shall be laid on Negroes. 2. Judicial. The following States expressly reserve this power to be exercised by their own courts. New Hampshire to the court of common pleas with an appeal to the superior court whose determ. shall be final. Virginia, Mass., R. Is., & S. Carolina the same. N. Carolina before some Court of record without an appeal. How far the Officers of Congress can execute the pen[altie]s after trial & convict[ion] I will not determine. But it appears clearly that Congress cannot under most of the Laws exercise, appoint or controul any judicial power at all. The Courts of the diff. States are only competent, and not accountable or controulable by the U.S. The Legislative power is extremely limited & confnd. Connecticut & Delaware in particul. by the reserve they make limit it, the one by the court & internal police, & the other by the constitut. & Laws, & the others limit the mode of trial to be according to the Laws & cons[titutions]. These are so general as to afford occasions for continual disputes, & for a state to defeat the operation whenever they please.  From these observations it appears that the States generally have not given the powers asked, yet Cong. have determined these Laws are a compliance---;a strict compliance they cannot be---;it must be meant then that they are a substantial compliance---;and so a sub. comp. is suffi[cient]. The quest. then is, Is the Law of N.Y. a substantial compl. That is a subst. compl. which will effect the end congress have in view. The end was to raise money. The Law of N.Y. makes effectual provision for this. But it is objected 1. That several of the States have inserted in their Acts express conditions, that the other States give a power to levy. To that I answer, that though this is made a condition of several of the Acts, yet I apprehend this cannot be meant to be construed strictly---;for if so, then the acts of the other States cannot operate, for it has been shewn that very few of them give the power to levy, in its full latitude. It seems evidently to have been the design of the States, to authorize Cong. to put it in operation when[eve]r the other States passed effect. Laws, to collect the impost for the benefit of the union---;hence some express the condition one way, some another. The design was that as the monies arising from the impost was for the benefit of all---;all should grant it, and provide effectually for its collect. 2d. The State of N.Y. reserves the power to levy. This is a material depart. from the plan &c. If we recur to the reason of this condition it will appear that it was to prevent a fluctuating system in the States, and to destroy equality of the Tax &c. These objections do not lie against the Act of N.Y. The reason why Cong. shd. make the [?] are, that 13 dif. Legislatures would introduce different Laws, ordain various penalties for the same offence, destroy the equality of the Tax, & in great measure defeat the revenue. Suppose the laws are different---;& the penalties various---;is it of any consequence---;may they not yet be effectual? Laws may be different & yet effectual to attain their end---;penalties may be various, and yet sufficient sanctions to Laws. Laws in different countries are diff. on the same subject, and yet answer the purposes for which they are made. The same offence has in different place different penalties, & yet are effectual. This is the case in the different states. Stealing in this State is punished with death---;in some others it is not capital---;but in both the Laws are in great measure sufficient to deter from the crime. The rev. Laws in the several States are difft. and the penalties various but yet effectual. But it will destroy the equality of the Tax. If the respective States reserved the right to alter the revenue Laws at pleasure, this obj. would be valid---;but in the case before us the impost is granted to be col-  lected in a certain mode, which mode cannot be changed, for 25 Years, without a recall of the grant---;witht. a breach of faith. The other States may as well repeal their Laws or N.Y. alter hers---;if this Law then is effectual the equty. of the tax cannot be destroyed or the revenue defeated by it. 3. A further objection is that the Law does not make the Collectors of the duties amenable to & remov[able] by Congress. The Act does make the Officers amenable to Cong.---;for it is expressly made the Duty of the Collectors, to render a just and true account thereof from time to time to Congress when thereunto required---;they shall from time to time pay the Money to the U.S. or Order---;and the Atty of Congress are authorized to prosecute them in a summary way by information, either in the supreme Court or Court of exchequer. The Officer, it is true is not remo[vabl]e by Congress, but only upon convict[ion]. But still the Law is effectual, to induce a faithful execution of his duty. If he neglects to prosecute, he is to be accountable to be sued by the Treasurer, to acco[un]t every three Months. N.H. whenever Cong. shall notify that all the States have passed Acts granting like duties to be appropriated in like manner. Mass. the same. R. Island, whenever the other States in the union shall agree to the impost to the acceptation of Congress. Connect. N.J. No Condition. Delaw. Until Laws be passed by all the other States granting the same duties---;& establishing funds for pay[ing] their quotas of 1.1000. Maryland when Congress shall pass such Laws as Congress shall accept as a substantial Compliance. S. Carol. To take effect as soon as the U S shall notify to the gen. Assembly or to the gov. in their recess that all the States have passed Acts vesting the US in Cong. with power to levy in the respective States like duties. Georgia. The same. ""

 Dear Sir New York July 28th 1786 I have waited with impatience for a proper subject of Information to give official Intelligence, & am reduced to the necessity of pleading an apology for intruding on Your patience with Frien[d]ly correspondence, Congress having com to no Decision on any interesting subjects. We have now twelve states on the floor. Delaware Yet remains unrepresented, the Impost of New York has employ'd our Deliberation for som time without full Determination. In this Act the proceeds of the five per cent is given but not the Power to levy, nor the removal of the officer at the will of Congress without regular proceeding by  July 28, 1786  way of complaint. This measure has occationed endles Debates, many Gentlemen are for rejecting the Grant, whilest others viewing the critical situation of national Credit are inclind to accept. My opinion accords with the Latter, being fully persuaded it is not a period that will admit of punctilioes. Yesterday after various Debates a Committee of five was appointed to Draw up an ordinance to carry the Impost into execution, & report what Acts required amendment.(1) The organization of the Indian Department will com under consideration this Day, being pospon'd untill the Impost was Decided. The Delegates from Georgia, & North Carolina, have joind in opposing the unfederal measures attempted in this ordinance. I have Ventured to assert in the face of Congress, that they have, by their Commissioners, Trampled on the Constitutional & legislative rights of the State of North Carolina. This observation remains unanswared. No Gentleman appears wiling to meet the argument in Point, but give indirect answares by observing that if the States deny the Power to Congress, they must expect to Defend themselves against the Depradations of the Indians. To which I reply'd, that the Federal Union made no such Distinction, but demanded the United force in this case, as wel as against foreign Powers. The Indian Department is Divided into three parts, Northern, Middle, & Southern, we shall endeavour to prevent the appointment of a Superintendant for the Southern Department at present. Congress have under consideration the recommending to the states, the granting more efficient powers for Federal purposes. This subject is under Committment.(2) The subject of Treatyes is also under consideration. The particulars I am not at liberty to mention, which I sinceerly regrett, as I wish Youre sentiments on the subject. Should any thing occur to You in the line of my Duty, a free & unreserved communication will be receiv'd with gratefull acknowledgment, & esteem'd a mark of Freindship. It will not be in my power to continue here through the winter, should Youre Excellency grant the permision, unles Coll. Blount would return in time for me to go home, & bring Mrs Bloodworth, without whome I don't intend to serve another Tower [Tour].(3) My naval stores is Yet on board & have lost considerably by leakage, what the[y] will sel for is Yet unknown. Trade is very Dul, & money scarce. The paper currency is expected out in a few Days. The State of Rhod Island is in convultions on the account of their paper Money. The Merchants have shut up their stores notwithstanding the severe penalties of the Law. How the matter will terminate remains uncertain, som are apprehensive of a desolution of Government in that State. Hope Youre Excellency will pardon this tedious scribling on subjects of such triffling importance. My respectfull compliments wait on Mrs Caswell.

 Dr. Sr., Nyork 30th. July 1786(1) I some time ago receiv'd two Letters from you one recomeng Mr. Ansty(2) to my Attention, the other relating to yr. own & my affairs for both which I return you thanks. Mr. A. is a very worthy & agreeable young Gentleman, & I am happy in the honour of his Acquainte. He is now assiduously engaged in the Objects of his Mission, & I doubt not will do everything that depends on him to accomplish them in the most satisfactory & effectual Manner, but I confess it appears to me to be an Herculian Labour in which he is engaged & equally difficult & dubious in its Execution. I sho'd have acknowldgd. the favr. of those Letters before this had I not expected every day for six weeks or two Months past to have been able to communicate to you the result of the enquiries I had proposed to have made respecting your Farm & the dispute between Messrs. Eliot & Reade. The Gentn. were appointed to this Enquiry six Months ago & were to have enter'd upon it as soon as the snow was off the ground & the spring open'd so that they could view the Farm properly. At farthest I expected it would have been accomplish'd in the Month of May, but about that time I find one of the Gentn. was unexpectedly but unavoidably call'd away & oblig'd to give all his Attention to other affairs which very nearly concern'd him while my necessary Attendence in Congress at the same time confin'd me here, & prevented my pursuing it in the manner I wish'd & sho'd otherwise have done. I have however frequently written to them upon the subject & finally rec'd for answer that after several disappointments they were to enter upon the business about four Weeks ago since which I have continually expected the result but have not yet rec'd it. As soon as it comes to hand you shall be inform'd of it, & In the mean time I presume that Reade is doing as well as anybody else that we could procure. As to public affairs we have little worthy yr. Notice. We are negotiating affairs with the Indians to preserve peace on our Borders---;making Purchass's of them---;Surveying our Western Territories & preparing to sell the vacant lands there in satisfaction of our Domestick Debt; which we hope to sink chiefly if not entirely in that way. Our foreign Debt is attended with more difficulty. The States exhausted by the  July 30, 1786  expences of the War & their Trade being in an Embarrassed State are neither so able & not so well disposed as we could wish to make the necessary exertions to supply Congs. with the means of discharging it & satisfying the Interest in the mean time. These Difficulties nevertheless we hope to surmount, & by Degrees to place our affairs upon an agreeable footing. Some Bickerings have arisen with respect to our Eastn. Boundry. at St. Croix, & we have some dispute with Spain relative to the Navign. of the Missassipi & our Southn. Limitts, but we have no doubt those matters may be settled amicably as a small extent of Country either way is of very little Conseqe to us who perhaps have too much already & We have no object but to Cultivate Peace with all Mankind & Our situation with respect to our Northn. Posts you are well acquainted with. While writing I have the Honr. of yr. favour of the 29th of April acquaintg me with yr. having reciev'd Â£165 of the assignees of Robinson & Trotten for my Dividend of their papers. I can at present only repeat my sincere thanks for yr. Attention to this business to which I have no doubt alone I am indebted for recoverg their Money. I will very soon draw upon you for that sum & in the mean time have the Honor to be with the most perfect esteem & respect, Dr. Sr., Yr. most oblig'd & most obedt. humble Servant. ""

 Dear Sir, New York July 30. 1786. I have received your letter of the 10 of May and am happy in the opportunity of being serviceable to you or any of your friends.(1) I shall with pleasure honor the draughts of Mr Watson or Mr Eveleigh and take care of and forward the seeds and plants as you desire. While on this subject I shall beg leave to mention a circumstance I have heard touching the introducing the native plants of one country into another. The late Duke of Argyle being fond of gardening and desirous of having some of the indigenous plants of America engaged a captain of a vessel on whom he had conferred some favours, to go, on his arrival in America, into the woods and after raking off the leaves to scrape or pare off about a quarter of an inch deep of the Surface of the earth, put it into hogsheads and bring it to him. When it arrived he had a bed prepared in his garden and spread the American earth over it to the same depth it was pared off from the native soil. The consequence was, as I have been informed, that there came up next year a number of plants, many of which were quite new in that country, & undescribed by any botannical writer. On the 8th of this Month I acknowledged the receipt of your favour of the 22d of April and troubled you with an account of a singular phenomenon that appeared in our sky on the night of the 1st at the same time with a Northern light. I wrote also to you on the 6th of April & acknowledged the receipt of yours of the 8 Oct. I hope my letters have got safe to hand.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York, 2d August, 1786. The requisition for the year 1786, has this day been passed in Congress, so nearly in the form & on the principles contained in the printed copy of the Draught I sent you some time since,(2) that I shall not now trouble you with the mention of the little alterations that have been made, especially as we are yet sitting & in debate of other matters. I will, however, mention some attempts we made (tho' unsuccessfully & with very little support from any other State) to obtain some essential alterations in the Estimate, and of course in the sum to be required. For this purpose I send you another copy as the shortest mode of explaining what I mean.(3) The Requisition is for money for the service of the year 1786, we therefore moved to strike out the article marked A,(4) as relating to a future year, as providing for a second years Int. on the foreign Debt, when but one years Int. is provided for on the Domestic Debt, tho' the latter was before, one years Provisions behind the former; and because it was beginning a Provision for the Payment of the Principal of the Foreign Debt, even before it becomes due, without holding out any intention of a Provision for any part of the Domestic Debt, which has been long due; and that this (unnecessary at present,) attempt to anticipate payments, which we have heretofore rested on the Revenue System, recommended by the Act of April, 1783, would be considered as contemplating the relinquishment of that system on the Establishment, which we suppose the public credit so much depends, & that this Idea would have a great tendency to defeat the Establishment of that system now so nearly matured. This being denied, we moved to double the article marked B, in order to make a Provision for the Domestic Debt, proportioned to that made for the Foreign; this was also denied.(5) We therefore thought it our duty to oppose the general question on the Requisition as it stands; but is [it] was carried by 9 or 10 States. I am streigtened for time & can say no more at the present moment. This may serve as information to Council, though it does not go in official form. I am Dear Sir, your most obedient servant, Chas.

 Dear Sir(1) New York 3d. of August 1786 Yours of the 29th ult came this day to hand. Am happy that your Journey was so prosperous; and that the School is erected with such flattering Prospects, as well in reference to the Superintendent of the School, as to the promoting education amongst our people there. I am glad you are so highly pleased with the Country as to become a Proprietor; and also that you met with such Attention from the people & compensation for your services. I presume you mean Dr. Stephen Gano.(2) He was ordained yesterday, and is to move next week to Hudson, the new City up this river. I also greatly rejoice at the flourishing state of religion there. I cannot resolve the important question, \""Will you or will you not go there.\"" Nothing can be more ardently wished for, by more than an Interview with you. I had appointed Mr Wilson to be here by the 17th of this Instant, as I meant that day to sail to Providence, & he means to accompany me; and, previously to the reception of your Letter I had made an Appointment, on Business of Consequence, to be at Tappan the Friday before the 2d Lords day in this month (which I cannot recal) though I wish I could. If Business of the highest Consequence were not now pending before Congress; Business too, that relates immediately to that good land from which you recently came; & Business which I am not at liberty to communicate, and business which I am bound to attend, I say if these were not facts I should with Pleasure wait on you at Pennepack. But situated as I am, I heartily wish to see you at New York on Wednesday next [if] possible. The reason why I wish this is the important business which I referred to, comes on the next day, on Thirsday; and from what I can conjecture, I expect Rhode Island will probably have a casting voice on that subject. As you are interested in Kentucky, I wish much to see you before that question is decided. Should it not be in your power to arrive here by Wednesday afternoon, In the right of the State, I can have it postponed one day. When you consider my calls from the East- August 4, 1786  ward; my duty to the federal Government, together with my other attentions here, you will not think me ungenerous in this Proposal. Were I at my own disposal, I declare that I neither should regard Money, time nor fatigue to meet Mr Jones in Pennsylvania, on this subject; & when my friend recollects that I last October went from Providence to Philadelphia for the sole purpose of promoting this Object, I presume he will not impeach me of coolness in this business. Should your visit to New York, at the time proposed, be impracticable, I would wish to meet you at Mr Van Horns at the Plains, the Thirsday Evening following the time you mentioned, being the 17th Inst; and if I hear nothing from you before I will meet you there; though, should you come to the Plains at the time appointed, I think you might, the Monday following, come over to New York. This I shou'd greatly prefer; & if you cannot visit York on Next Wednesday, Try to come the Monday following. At any rate I must see you if Providence spares my life, before I return.

 Dr. Sir New York August 6th. 1786 I do myself the honr. to enclose you a news paper, for your perusal, which contains the price current of Merchandize in this City.(1) I have always flatter'd myself that we should before this have been at peace with the Barbary powers---;but to my sorrow I am disappointed. Congress have received letters from Mr Randal, assistant to Mr Lamb, giving an acct. of their return to Spain from Algiers---;without effecting the purpose of their Mission.(2) The Truth is their demands are so extravigant---;and the finances of the United States are so deranged that it cannot be obtained in their present condition. I am not certain that Spain has concluded a peace with them as yet and have my doubts whether they will or not. The truce ceased in the spring---;and we have news paper accts. of depredations being committed on their Trade since that Time. We have undoubted advice from England, that the people of that country, are in general very unfavourably disposed towards us, and the language wch. prevails there, is that we have no right to neither will they consent to form any commercial system with us, and boast that they will be our carriers, and enjoy all the advantages which would (was a commercial treaty concluded on) result to us.  A treaty of commerce between the United States & Portugal, I hope will soon arive to be ratified as it was finished on our part in the month of April.(3) The trade to that country has been favorable to us in former times. I hope it will again revive, & that some of our citizens may derive such advantage thereby---;as will in some measure compensate for former losses---;(I had forgot the Algerines are yet in the way, I should be content if no earthly power can remove them, that they might be removed from the earth, by the powers above). I have said we have as yet had no official account of a peace being concluded between Spain and Algeirs---;but if it is, in all probability Portugal and the other nations at war with them, will endeavour to conclude one also---;in which case the United States will be their single object---;if so what is to hinder their distroying our trade, in the proper season, even on our own coast. Is their no way that can be found out, to begin a navy. However I have got hold of a subject, that requires in the execution theirof a great deal of what we have none of, Vizt Cash---;therefore conclude, D Sir, with very great Regard & Esteem, Your most Obedt.

 Sir, New York August 6th. 1786 In conformity to your Excellys. desire I have collected the best information in my power on the subject of paper money which is as follows.(1) Rhode Island has emitted Â£100,000 to be issued on landed Security, in double the amount of the sum borrowed, to run seven years at 4 Per Cent intrest, then the intrest to cease, and one seventh part of the principle to be called in yearly, until the whole is in. The money is printed & deliverd to, & signed by five men, who are called a grand committee. Their is another man who keeps said committees office, receives the money when compleat, and delivers the same to two men in each Town, who are appointed by the Legislature as trustees, their business is to lend the money taking the security aforesaid. A seperate bond is taken by the trustees, for each years intrest---;payable to the keeper of the grand committees office---; whether this money is depreciated or not, I cannot learn. If news paper accts. are true, the State is in great convulsions, on Acct. this money it is a Tender in all cases. New York has emitted Two hundred thousand pounds. One hundred and fifty is placed on loan, upon landed Security of double its value---;fifty thousand pounds is appropriated to discharge part of the intrest of the State debt, about Â£4000 only is yet in circulation, & has hitherto passed equel to specie, its no Tender Except in cases of suit. New Jersey in 1784 emitted about Thirty one thousand pounds, called revenue money, for paying to her citizens the annuel intrest of their public securities which sum is called into the Treasury by taxes yearly and again reissued for said intrest to continue for 25 years, at the expiration thereof, to be stoped in the Treasury and cancelled. Its not depreciated in that State, but is in Philadelphia & here from Six to 15 Per Cent---;its a Tender in all cases.  August 6, 1786  Pennsylvania has emitted One hundred & fifty Thousand pounds. This was put into the Treasury as money, to be issued in common with any other money in such payments as the state has occassion to make---;but the principal object was the payment of the intrest of their public debts. The revenues of State in current taxes, duties, fees &c amount to near Â£200,000 per annum, besides which, there were upwards of Â£300,000 in arrearages of specie taxes due at the time of passing the act, all of which is receiveable in this money, or coin, at the option of the payer. More money than the amount of the paper must necessarily come into the treasury in the course of every year. Out of the taxes of the year 1786 Â£20,000 of these bills of Credit are to be cancell'd and burned, and the like sum in each succeeding year, till the whole shall be absorbed. This money is not made a Tender in any case whatever except that the State is obliged to receive it on equality with coin in all payments of taxes, imposts and other debts and duties due to the state. In North Carolina the officers of the late army applyed to the Assembly of that State requesting they would make paper money and they would take a part of their pay in the same. In consequence thereof the Assembly passed an Act to emit Â£100,000 reserving the confiscated property for its redemption of which sum they payed one fourth of the ball[ance] due to the officers & Soldiers of that State---; and the residue of said sum was exhausted in the payment of the Civil list. This money is not on intrest, is no tender but at the Treasury for State duties and Taxes. They have lately emitted and put in circulation Â£100,000 more, which has caused the whole to depreciate near 30 Per Cent. South Carolina has emitted One hundred thousand pounds Sterling on loan for five years. It carries an intrest of Seven Per Cent and issues on landed Security of three times its amount. No person can borrow more than Â£250 nor less than Â£50. Its no tender except in duties and taxes to the State---;and as yet, has not depreciated. These are all the States that have made paper money. Mr. Lamb and Mr. Randall are returned from Algiers to Spain. Congress have letters from the latter---;as also from their Ministers in Europe by which I am sorry to say, that at present their is no prospect of a peace being brought about between the United States and those barbarians. Mr. Barclay was at Morocco when these despatches left Europe, but whether he will be succesfull is very uncertain. I have no doubt but a General peace might be effected with all those powers were our finances not so deranged as they are. At this time have nothing further to add, only that I am with Sentiments of Respect & Esteem, Your Excellencys Most Obedient & Huml Servant, Pierse Long  ""

 My dear Sir,(1) New York 6. August, 1786. By the last post I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 28th ult. The contents convey evidence of such a disposition in my countrymen as must give pain to every well disposed mind. The affairs of the continent are in such circumstances as afford no balance to the disorders of the particular states. Should Massachusetts fall into anarchy the great prop of the union would be prostrate. For altho the public conduct of Massachusetts when viewed by itself would not strongly inspire veneration, yet when compared with any other State in the union, the comparison will irresistably compel conviction that her councils produce measures more the result of wisdom and integrity than any other. Our commissioners are returned from the mediterranian without effecting anything, no reasonable hope of any other event could have been formed. The interest of every commercial and maritime power in europe opposes ours as related to this object, and Great Britain, which is in strict friendship with the pirates would go great lengths in gratifying her malice and jealousy to defeat our purpose. Congress have not yet come to any ultimate decision on this subject. I have formed my opinion as to policy in the object to be persued, but this must not at present be put on paper.  No reasonable expectations of advantage can be formed from the commercial convention.(2) The first proposers designed none. The measure was originally brought forward with an intention of defeating the enlargement of the powers of Congress. Of this I have the most decisive evidence. It well becomes the eastern and middle States, who are in interest one, seriously to consider what advantages result to them from their connection with the Southern States. They can give us nothing, as an equivalent for the protection which they derive from us but a participation in their commerce. This they deny to us. Should their conduct continue the same, and I think there is not any prospect of an alteration, an attempt to perpetuate our connection with them, which at last too will be found ineffectual, will sacrafice everything to a meer chimera. Even the appearance of a union cannot in the way we now are long be preserved. It becomes us seriously to contemplate a substitute; for if we do not controul events we shall be miserably controuled by them. No other substitute can be devised than that of contracting the limits of the confederacy to such as are natural and  August 7, 1786  reasonable, and within those limits instead of a nominal to institute a real, and an efficient government. This language will appear to you I am affraid as evidence of pusalanimity, but I do not think that in politics I am timid. We have made another requisition which includes such part of the principal of the foreign debt as will become payable next year. To this measure I gave my assent not from any apprehension that it would produce any considerable effect, but because I wish congress may do her duty. Several of the States have never passed any acts in persuance of the requisition of 84, not half on that of last year and still less is to be expected from the present. It will be unnecessary to inform you that this letter is wrote with great haste and in that confidence of your friendship which I have long flattered myself I was so happy as to possess. Some matters of very great importance but with regard to which secrecy at present is enjoined will detain me here a little longer. As soon as these are completed which I hope will be the case in 8 or 10 days I shall again return to the vale of private life. There confiding in the wisdom of Doctor Holten that all things will be happily adjusted I will seek contentment. Compts. I pray you to Mrs. S.

 My dear Genl. New York 7h. August [17]86 I had the pleasure of hearing from you last week, and have complied with your wishes respecting the china.(1) No conveyance at present offers for Alexandria, but every day presents one to Norfolk, from which place the correspondence up your river is frequent. I intend unless I should meet with a vessel for potomac, to send the box to Col. Parker naval officer at Norfolk, and ask his special attention to forwarding it to Alexandria or Mount Vernon. At the same time I will send a small box put into my care for you by Mr. Gardoqui---;I have had it some time and waited to know your intention to the  August 7, 1786  china, that the same conveyance might take both. If you have an opportunity to convey my Young,(2) (as the books are useless to you) to Mr. R. H. Lee you will oblige me by doing it. The Mississippi business is very important and full of difficulty.(3) In the debilitated condition of the fOEderal government, it is unwise to risk the offence of any part of the empire, unless to attain great good. My mind has no doubt of the extensive good consequences that would result to the Union from a commercial connexion with Spain, & I am also clear, that in agreeing to the occlusion of the navigation of the Mississippi, we give in fact nothing, for the moment our western country become populous & capable, they will seize by force what may have be[en] yielded by treaty. Till that period, the river cannot be used but by permission of Spain, whose exclusive system of policy, never will grant such permission. Then to be sure, we only give, what we cannot use. But the source of all the evils which press those states is the inefficiency of the fOEderal government. This cannot be altered & remedied but by consent of the states. Already in every state the amplification of the powers of the Union have too many enemys. Should therefore a treaty take place between Congress & Spain occluding for a term the navigation of the Mississippi, in return for advantages very great, but not so great to the whole as to a part, I apprehend it would give such a tent for popular declaimers, that the great object viz bracing the fOEderal government may be thwarted, and thus in pursuing a lesser, we loose a greater good. I forwarded by the last post for public information some intelligence lately received from Mr. Jefferson & I have also sent an extract of a letter from Mr. Randall from Algiers.(4) These two papers comprehend all the news here. I transmit the Gazette of the day. Bills on tender at 60 days sight fluctuate in their value from six to seven per cent prOEmium. The cost [of] the china is 150 dollars besides the incidental charge of freight to Norfolk, which cannot be much. My best wishes for the health & happiness of Mount Vernon, in which Mrs. Lee unites. Most respectfully yours, H. Lee Junr.(5) ""

Who are talked of for Electors?, and who for Senators? what are the present politics of Baltimore? The only news we have here is the intire failure of our attempts to buy a peace with the Barbary pirate, Their demands are beyond our ability to pay. It is supposed They count much on our trade. They demand 1,200 dollars for each private captive, and in proportion for the Officers. The american slaves (for so they term their prisoners) are employed in building places of security for their Gun boats. I will endeavor to inclose you a list and description of the naval force of the Algerines as transmitted to Congress.(1) The money put into my hands for Captain Cole was conditionally to be laid out for Certificates, provided I should descover a great probability of their being received in payment for the land. They [The] money I never actually laid out, as I had certificates by me. When I received the money certificates could have been purchased at 3 for 1 excluding interest but before the question of their receipt was determined by the consolodating bill they had rose to 2 for 1. I therefore think Captn. Cole has ample Justice done him when I am charged at 3 for 1 including Interest to the passage of the aforesaid law.

Caleb Evans, the Principal of that Seminary. These are the Books we have been expecting. I have recd. no Letter respecting them, by the Ship that brought them, though I think it probable there may be Letters to me with the Invoices, which I suppose are included in the Boxes. Should you find any upon opening the Boxes, I will thank you to put them into Mrs. Manning's hands, that she may send them forward to me, should they contain Intelligence which I ought to know, before my return. Of this she will judge upon opening them. This Morning as I came to Congress, was the first Advice I recd. of this Business, & the Expence of Storage would have been incurred, had I not ordered them immediately to be sent on board the Packet; of course, I have not opened the Books, nor shall I have opportunity to do it. I have urged, as much as possible, an immediate Attention to the Settlement of the Accounts of the Marine Department. We are now going to the Treasury board to urge them to appoint Mr Manly to collect all the Papers of that Department to the Eastward, that they may be ready to be brought here & adjusted as soon as may be. We have since the above called there & the board informs us that they have ordered the papers & books to be sent for; & We have applied to the Commissioner to appoint Mr Manly as his Clerk in this Business, which he encouraged us to expect he wd. do.(2) Yesterday we passed an Ordinance for the departmt. of Indian Affairs.(3) To day we have passed a Resolve to establish a Coinage for the United States, and have ordered the Treasury board to draw up an Ordinance to carry it into effect.(4) A Dollar is made, by this resolve, the Money Unit of the United States.

 Dear Sir, New York 9th. August 1786 I flatter myself that I am so near the Pleasure of seeing you in Philadelphia, that I shall defer for the present the Answer I shd. have given to your Question \""What is it that Pennsa. has done\"" &c. You have gratified me much by the Information contained in your Favour of the 6th on various Subjects---;it is not only pleasing but useful. It brings one unpleasant Reflection, however, to my mind, viz. The Loss I have sustained by the Suspension of our Correspondence for some Months. What Excuses you find to quiet your Conscience on the Occation, I leave to yourself. I shall be the more [ready] to suppose them valid without too nice a Scrutiny, because I feel the want of a generous Allowance on that Score myself. Warm Weather increases my Disposition to Indolence. Many little Circumstances have contributed to the Indulgence of it---;even the Situation of my Room exposed to the Afternoon Sun (the Time I should have otherwise have employed in friendly Correspondences) has been a considerable Bar to Industry, and writing by Candlelight in the Summer, I consider like Working on the Sabbath---;to be done only on Occasions of Necessity. Calculation, Study & other preparation for the Business I have in charge have had their Demands upon me, & tho' I have spent very little Time in Amusements, I have constantly found myself rather Behind hand in the Business I wished to perform. On the whole I believe Indolence has been much the cause of it. To relieve myself from this Malady I have lately got a Shower Bath & have taken some Bark, by which I find myself somewhat enlivened, & save an hour or two before Breakfast, which otherwise would be droned away in Sleeping, or a slumbering kind of wakefulness little above torpidity. I am now writing before Breakfast, and you will excuse it if you find me a little flat. I am sorry that Council have ordered any publication on the Differences that have lately happened.(1) Controversial publications of this kind are generally attended with more Evil than Good. They are apt to turn into fixed & lasting Prejudices, those temporary Opinions founded in misconceptions, or fed by a temporary irritation of the Passions, which might otherwise be corrected by Explanations, & effaced from the Memory. I shall be the more concerned on this Occasion to see a publication of anything irritating, because I think I discern a Hope of getting Congress to reconsider their late Vote on the  August 9, 1786  Report of the Board of Treasury, which such Publication may prevent. The Accounts between the State & the Union, may however be published for the Information of the State & of the other States, yea of the World.(2) They will shew that at least one State in the Union is desirous of doing its Duty by enabling the United States to do Justice to their Creditors & support the federal Government. It may also shew to the Citizens of the State the good Effect of their Exertions, and the faithful Application of the Monies which have been extracted from them, and thereby encourage them to persist in the noble System they have established. Even our Enemies abroad begin to compliment our Measures or rather the Effects of them, and Men of Knowledge uncontaminated with Prejudice concerning them in various parts of the Continent, speak of them with high Approbation. To keep our own Citizens in good humour with themselves is of no small Importance. There is a kind of generous Pride in Men, call it Ambition or what you please, by which they are led to virtuous Actions. Let them perceive that their Efforts have the Effect they intended, and let them perceive that the World observe it, and they feel themselves pleasingly rewarded for their Labours. This in a free Government, like ours, is the strongest Ligament in the Band of Society, and the principal Means of combining their Efforts & giving them an uniform Direction to the proper Objects. But I must cease the pursuit of this Idea which has taken me by Surprize. I suggested to Mr. Nicholson that I thought our best mode of helping ourselves to Justice, under present Circumstances, would be to pay up the remaining 63,000 Dollars demanded by the Treasury, to square the Specie Requisitions, & then draw all the Facilities we can, which may be four or 500,000 Dollars---;out of which to pay the Balance of the Facility Account, & then we stand fair to pay in Facilities half of the whole Amount of the present year's Requisn. when, in my Apprehension, the other half may be divided into Specie & Facilities in the Proportions demanded. This however will demand an Act of Assembly; and my Opinion would be to pass such Act in this Session, & leave the Requisition of 1786 to the next Sitting, or at least till the other Operation is performed. This appears to me worthy of Attention, & I think the Proviso in the last Years Requisition warrants it. It was my View at the Time, & was so understood in Congress by those who understood it at all; without this we should be without Credit, other than in the Genl. Acct. for the Amount of one Years Intt. on our Quota of the Domestic Debt. At this Period my Watch reminded me that the Hour was at Hand when I ought to be at the City Hall (we meet now at 10) & I had yet to shave & Dress for the Purpose. On reading what I have written I find it strongly marked with my dulness of conceptions on wanting my mornings Dram of Coffee.  Genl. St Clair has assured me of his arrival here in the Course of this Week.(3) In the next I shall hope to embrace my Family. I have for some Time been impatient on this Score, & have felt myself rather injuriously treated by some Circumstances which have either occasioned or attended my Detention. Mortifications of this kind, however, not unfrequently happen to those who enter zealousy into the public Service. It has often been my Fate to bear an undue proportion of the Burthen when I have been associated with others in Public Employments; sometimes perhaps owing to my own forwardness. But I have supposed it a Duty to exceute faithfully a public Trust when once accepted. I am, with great Esteem, Dr Sir, Your most obedt Servt., Cha Pettit ""

13885,dg023400,1786,Charles Pinckney s Speech,"""Charles Pinckney's Speech
 [August 10, 1786](1) The Secretary for foreign Affairs has reported that in consequence of the commission and instructions he had received from Congress for the purpose of negotiating with Mr Gardoqui he has had several Conferences with him upon this subject---;That he had recd. an offer from Mr G[ardoqui] to enter into a commercial treaty upon certain principles but that he insisted as a part of the treaty that Spain & the US. should fix the boundaries of their respective territories & that the latter should relinquish all claim to the right of navigating the river Mississippi.(2) The Secy adds as his Opinion that a treaty may be formed with S[pain] upon principles which he then stated, upon the US forbearing to assert their right to navigate the river for 25 or 30 years & used  August 10, 1786  some arguments to prove the policy of our acceding to this arrangement with her. In investigating this subject it is proper to follow the Secy & examine  1. The reasons he has stated & which ought in his Opinion to induce us at this time to wish the formation of a commercial treaty wth. S. 2ly. The offers which S. has made & the terms upon which a treaty may be concluded with her; the benefits to be derived from it; & the manner in which they will operate upon the different parts of the Union. 3dly. The price that is to be paid for the treaty & the consequences that will probably attend the US stipulating to suspend the assertion of the right for a given term & 4thly. The policy of Congress concluding a treaty at all at this time. I will agree that an equal commercial treaty would be of more advantage with S. than with any other in Europe except Portugal, but I am not convinced that the relative situation of S & the U.S. is such as ought to render us at this time particularly anxious to conclude a treaty upon the principles proposed. It is thought if a difference should exist between us, that France will probably will be the friend of S. as her close connexion by Compact & the benefits she derives from her Alliance with S. are greater than any she can expect from America. If I understand the politics of F, or if we are to depend upon our communications from thence, we are to suppose that her present system is a system of perfect peace. She is labouring to repair the expences of the late war, to arrange her finances & by every possible exertion to augment her Marine. She is generally esteemed what politicians stile the \""Ruling power\"" at present in Europe and it is more to her interest & more gratifying to her Ambition to maintain this situation than by improperly interfering in Matters comparatively unimportant to risque a premature contest with the rival power. I call that a rival power, which not being equal to her upon the whole still comes nearer this equality than any other; & this is England. F. may mediate but as we are to presume she will always be governed by her interest she will never risque a contest if she can avoid it, that must involve her with Great Britain & this Country merely to support Sp. in the impolitic demand of shutting the Mississippi. Though the animosities of GB are still warm, yet there is sufficient wisdom in her councils to make them yield to her interest. Though she loves us not, she hates F & S and would avail herself of any opportunity even upon less than equal terms to strike a blow. With them she never can be in any other than a rival situation. With us, when the present differences shall have terminated, it will ever be her interest to be closely connected. Our language, governments, religion & policy point to this as an alliance that will here after be formed as most likely to be permanent & productive of good consequences. In a war with F & S   the contiguity of the US. & the convenience of their ports & supplies would render the aid of this country peculiarly important in any enterprize against their islands. We also know if any respect is to be paid to the intelligence & communications of Mr Adams your Minister at the Court of London that the Cabinet of GB are at this time turning a serious eye to South America. The divesting he says, S. of that country & opening to it a free trade is considered by them as of the first importance & if any event should take place, in which even a distant hope of accomplishing this object should offer, there can be no doubt of her availing herself of it. So far therefore from fearing the additional weight of G.B. we are to presume if she suffers her interest and her wishes to prevail, that she will importantly interfere in our favour.  The Connections of S. & her influence in Portugal even if they could ever be of much service, which is very doubtful, can be of no consequence at present, as our latest advices from thence warrant a belief that a treaty between Portugal & the US has long since been concluded.(3) It does not appear that any beneficial effects are to be expected from her influence in our favour with the states of Barbary. There is but one mode of obtaining a pacification with them. The price of peace must be paid. You are informed by Mr Jefferson that in a late conversation he had with the count de Vergennes upon the subject of a treaty with the Porte & the aid of his influence to procure a peace with them, the count informed him, that even in that case & notwithstanding they owe the Porte a distant tribute, his interference would not procure you a peace a moment sooner, nor a shilling cheaper:(4) In short that a pacification would be as difficult and their terms as extravagant as at present. If therefore the influence of Constantinople would be unsuccessful, how is it to be expected that the friendship of Spain would be useful? Of no more weight is another opinion which supposes the influence of S. will promote our interest with the Italian States. True it is that the king of Naples is the son of the king of Spain, but until a peace is made with the States of Barbary, the friendship of the king of Spain will be but of little protection to your Commerce in the Mediterranean. Effect this and the Italian states will all be ready to receive you upon the same liberal terms without treaty which one has already offered. Upon investigating the situation of Spain it will be found she has strong reason to be particularly anxious to treat with you at this time. Independant of the knowledge she must have of the intentions of GB, she views with a jealous eye the emancipation of these states & dreads their neighbourhood to her rich and extensive tho' feeble colonies of South America. She is desirous to prevent an intimacy between them, well knowing the danger of such an intercourse. Hence we find she holds the desarts of Florida as a barrier & wishes to deprive our citi-  zens of the use of the Mississippi hoping by these means to postpone an event which she dreads & fears is at no considerable distance. Being acquainted with your situation, the deranged state of your finances & the inefficacy of your government she thinks that this is the time to push her demands & supposes your distress will force you into a compliance. But I still trust our inconveniences when compared to hers are but temporary. A little firmness & perseverance on the part of Congress & of recollection on the part of the states may yet subdue all our difficulties. Whereas the Spanish Monarchy carries in its bosom the seeds of its dissolution. Our Situation though unpleasant is not yet sufficiently desperate to force us into measures derogatory to our national honor. Spain has more to risque & more to dread from a rupture than we can fear, and though it is undoubtedly her interest to treat at present, it can only be ours on very advantageous terms. As to the 2d point, Spain consents to treat with us upon what she terms principles of perfect reciprocity. Importation to be freely made in each others vessels. The duties to be paid by each in the ports of the other the same as those paid by the natives: Masts & spars to be purchased of the U.S. for the use of the navy of Spain & paid for in specie, provided they are as good & as cheap as those procured from the Baltic. Permission to go to the Canaries & M Gardoqui has no personal objection that we should have liberty to go to the Philippines, his instructions however do not reach this. Her ports in the West Indies & in South America to be shut & the article of tobacco to be prohibited in her European ports. In return we are to admit her subjects freely into all the ports we have without any exception of articles upon the footing of Natives & to stipulate the forbearance of our right to navigate the Mississippi for a given time. In examining this point it must be observed that though the treaty proposes a perfect reciprocity, this reciprocity will be the more or less advantageous as the commerce of the respective powers is the more or less free in their own ports. The U.S are a free & S. is an absolute government. It is the policy of the former to promote & encourage their Commerce, hence their duties are but triffling & easily paid. The impositions & fetters of the latter have almost ruined it; And though our merchants are to be on the footing of natives yet it is beyond a doubt they will pay four & in some instances six times as much as their merchants will in our ports. So that the reciprocity here mentioned does not or cannot exist. The Spanish productions will in most instances be imported here at 2Â½ & if the impost should operate at 5 per cent.(5) The American into their ports in the one case at four times & in the other at double this sum.  At present American produce is generally sold in the Spanish ports on board the vessel. The purchaser pays the customs & duties making the necessary deductions, so that though they are large & reduce the   value of the commodity they never appear on the account of Sales rendered by the consignee. The duty on eatables by which I suppose is meant all kind of provision of grain or otherwise is called Million & calculated generally at ten per Ct. at Cadiz but differs Materially in the several towns & provinces. The duty on merchandize imported may be generally estimated at 25 per ct. Ricard, in his traitÃ¨ du Commerce,(6) takes notice of an extra duty paid on exportation in foreign bottoms from Cadiz of 150 reals vellon per pipe on wine, equal to 34/. But the merchants there in making out their invoices charge the wine & brandy on board at certain prices including all duties & charges which leaves us unacquainted with the exact sum. The duties on vessels going to South America are extremely high, not less than 25 p ct. ever & in many cases much higher. The Articles with which Spain is now supplied from this country she receives upon terms equally beneficial with those proposed by the treaty & so advantageous is this trade to her that there cannot be the most distant danger of her ever shutting her ports against us. She does not produce them & they are necessary & essential to her. It is therefore her policy to open her posts to all that do. This creates a competition and she is always sure of being well & cheaply supplied. The object of the treaty is therefore unimportant, because it is only to secure that partial intercourse with Spain which now exists & which it will always be her interest to promote. The project goes farther & proposes to purchase your Masts & Spars provided they are as good & as cheap as she can procure them from the Baltic. This is a stipulation of no consequence. If you have masts & spars of equal size & fitness with those imported from the Baltic, you will always find purchasers. Spain is a maritime power. She has no territories producing timber of this kind. But masts and spars are & must be always wanted for her navy. Will it not therefore be her interest to encourage as many to bring them to her ports as she can? Most clearly it will. I am told by merchants of repute & connected in the Spanish trade that the common timber of this country cannot but rarely if ever be exported as good & as cheap as that from the Baltic. In proof of this they have appealed to all the shipments that have been made since the War, scarcely one of which has done more than pay the mere freight sinking the original cost of the timber.  Spain generally produces as much wheat as her inhabitants consume, except in those years when their crops are lost by drough[t], which is once in three or four years. The wheat to supply this and their islands & American colonies they generally procure from Sciclly & Poland & purchase the American wheat when it is as good & as cheap; but they by no means depend upon it. Their european Markets however are always open to it & to every other kind of provision, nor while they consult their interest will they prohibit it. So that it appears   as far as your articles are useful & necessary and it is their interest, so far will they open their ports to you, but in the lucrative and truly important trade of their islands & other dominions or wherever they are afraid of a rivalship, there you are to be prevented.  It is said however that Mr Gardoqui is not personally averse to our going to the Philippines & that from thence in all probability some kind of intercourse will be established with Acapulca. If we are to believe Mr Gardoqui, when he says it is an invariable maxim of Spanish politics to exclude all Mankind from trading with their colonies and islands it appears to me that we are rather to consider this as a ministerial finesse, than amounting to any thing like a certainty that permission will be obtained. But suppose it is. One rich ship sails every year from Acapulca to one of the Philippine islands and returns laden with the commodities of the East Indies. It is not to be supposed it will be very easy to elude the Spaniards whose duty it will be to prevent your interfering with the south American trade. But grant for a moment that they connive at it. What great advantages are to be expected from your citizens in this remote and expensive voyage being suffered to participate in the cargo of a single ship? An individual or two may make their fortunes, but surely no solid advantages are to be derived to the Union from this distant & precarious commerce. In short, Sir, as I have observed this appears to me no more than a ministerial finesse to which his instructions do not nor ever will reach. But in order to bring the objects of the proposed treaty more clearly before the view of the house, permit me to examine them as they may affect the different states in their Operation. The New England states (in which can scarcely be included Newhampshire & Connecticut, their european commerce being inconsiderable & Rhode island not extensive) enjoy at present a beneficial trade with Spain in the export of their fish, lumber and other articles, for which they receive valuable returns. Their peltry trade is of no consequence, nor except in the articles mentioned have they any considerable export, that will suit the Spanish European Markets. The Spanish have no fisheries of their own. They consume a great quantity of fish and are always in want of timber. They will therefore find it their policy to keep their ports open to all the nations that will bring them. Spain does not offer to give us exclusive privileges or preferences, but leaves herself at liberty to form treaties with whom she pleases. The French in virtue of the family compact are entitled to the privileges of the most favoured nation; and if we examine the treaties of commerce that have formerly existed between G Britain and Spain particularly that of 1667 which is the ground work of all their future treaties and those of 1713 & 1715 we shall find these nations have been in the habits of a commercial intercourse for a great number years. The policy of Europe at present seems to be peace and com-  merce. The English & French are pushing their fisheries with astonishing exertions & endeavouring to depress ours. While therefore Spain in her treaty proposes no advantages that we do not now enjoy & which it can never be her interest to curtail, and while she leaves herself open to trade with other nations who may attempt to rival them, I cannot see any particular benefits that will result even to the New England states under the present project. Newyork & Pensylvania have the power of exporting wheat and staves & some other articles. Their wheat is valuable in proportion to the scarcity and failure of crops & depends upon the contingencies I have already stated. Under the treaty nothing more is proposed to them. New Jersey not being an importing state cannot be materially interested. Maryland & Virginia may export as they do at present some wheat and lumber. Their great staple Tobacco is expressly prohibited and to remain under its present regulations. So that while the latter must be more injured than any state in the Union by the cession, she will be the least benefited under the treaty. The tobacco of N Carolina, S Carolina & Georgia is in the same situation, nor will the sale of their other productions be promoted. Indigo one of their staple commodities is the product of the spanish American islands & colonies in much greater quantities than they can consume & of a superior quality to that made in the southern states, so that there does not remain a probability of this ever becoming an article of commerce. Rice is always in such demand in Europe that it wants not the aid of a treaty, nor if it did would those states which produce it wish an advantage at the expence of the rights and possessions of any part of the confederacy. I trust that upon a candid & disinterested view of the proposed arrangement, the partial not to say ungenerous manner in which it is offered & the few advantages to be derived from its operation which we do not at present enjoy, that Congress will be induced to suppose it is not an offer of that liberal and extensive kind, which promises a lasting or mutually beneficial intercourse nor does it hold out such privileges as we might have expected from a power who wishes to tempt us to even the temporary surrender of an important national right. In my judgment she proposes nothing more than she will always be willing to grant you without a treaty and nothing which can be termed an equivalent for the forbearance she demands. The true mode to determine this is to examine the nature and consequences of the demand she makes, on our compliance with which alone a treaty may be formed with her. It is to forbear the assertion of the right of the U.S. to navigate the river Mississippi for the term of 25 or 30 years. It is said the treaty will not be concluded without this stipulation---;that the Navigation is unimportant and that a forbearance will be no sacrifice as Spain excludes us by force & will   continue to do so---;that it would be disgraceful to continue the claim without asserting it---;that war is inexpedient and that the best way would be to enter into a treaty with them & consent to suspend the claim for a certain time. The right of the U.S. to navigate the Mississippi has been so often asserted & so fully stated by Congress, that it is unnecessary to say anything upon this subject, particularly as the Secretary in his report appears to be in sentiment with Congress. But if the treaty proposed was of the most advantageous nature in other respects, while it insisted upon the forbearance, I should think the impolicy of consenting to it must be obvious for the following reasons. Because the sale and disposal of the lands ceded in the western territory has ever been considered by Congress as a sufficient fund under proper management for the discharge of the domestic debt: large sums of efficient money have already been expended in quieting the Indians, purchasing their rights of soil and in sending out persons to survey it. The offers which are to be made the purchasers and already established by your resolutions are the protection and support of the Union---;the establishment of republican governments and the equal enjoyment of all the privileges of citizens of the U.S. To those in the least acquainted with that country it is known that the value of their lands must altogether depend upon the right to navigate the Mississippi. This is the great outlet with which & with the rivers running into it nature washes their shores---;points to them the mode of exporting their productions & of establishing a commercial intercourse with the rest of the world. Inform them you have consented to relinquish it even for a time, you check, perhaps destroy the spirit of emigration & prevent the accomplishment of the object proposed by the sale. But it is said the Spaniards already oppose us in the navigation and that this will as effectually prevent emigration as our consenting to suspend it. To this it may be shortly replied that while the purchasers know that the US claim & insist upon the right and are negotiating for it---;that if the Spaniards refuse to admit us to a participation, the occlusion will be founded in injury, must be supported by force and will be resisted whenever circumstances shall authorise a reliance on the support and protection of their parent state, it will operate as a spur to emigration.(7) To me it appears most extraordinary, that a doctrine should be attempted to prove, that because we have not at present a government sufficiently energetic to assert a national right, it would be most honorable to relinquish it. The British government in violation of the late treaty hold by force & garrisoned posts within the territory of the U.S. These posts give them the entire [command] of the valuable fur trade. If they were in our possession as they ought to be, this important commerce would pursue its usual route & become an Article of considerable export to   these states. But we are unable to recover them by force at present, war being inexpedient, and are obliged to submit to the injury & disgrace of their being forcibly withheld. We are now attempting to negotiate with Britain. Suppose she was to offer certain commercial privileges advantageous to the whole but operating more particularly in favour of those exports which suit her market and to which she more anxiously applies her attention than to any other part of your Commerce. For to Britain Tobacco and rice are at least as important as Fish and Timber to Spain. Suppose, I say, she was to offer to form a treaty granting these privileges in lieu of your stipulating that she should hold these posts & enjoy the fur trade for a given number of years. I ask whether Congress would conceive themselves warranted in assenting to it or think the honor of the nation was not wounded by the attempt? Would gentlemen representing the States particularly interested suppose themselves at liberty to consent to it without consulting their constituents? I should apprehend, not. And yet the posts are held in defiance of the authority and remonstrances of this country. The claim to the Mississippi has been as strongly insisted upon as the claim to the posts, and the cases appear to me so similar that I should think the same policy that would dictate the yielding the one might with greater propriety consent to the surrender of the other. Another object more important than the sale & disposal of the western territory presents itself in objection to the suspension of the right. Nature has so placed this Country that she must either be the future friends or enemies of the Atlantic states. And this will altogether depend upon the policy they shall observe towards them. If they assist them in rearing their infant governments and by extending the gentle influence of their laws gradually cement their union with us upon equal principles, it is fair to suppose they may be an acquisition, rather than a disadvantage. In their first settlement exports cannot be much attended to but if these states encrease in the same proportion the US did and we are to presume they will exceed them, in the course of a few years they will turn their views to the best mode of exporting and disposing of their productions. The large navigable rivers which all terminate in the Mississippi point to them as has been mentioned this mode of export. Should the right remain unceded by Congress the consideration of the future force of the inhabitants and a number of eventual circumstances in our favour, which it is impossible at present to foresee but which are probable, may induce perhaps compel Spain to yield us a share in the Navigation. But should it be surrendered, you at once deprive the Citizens of the Atlantic states from navigating it or from having any intercourse with the settlements on its banks & within your territory. You immediately destroy all Connexion between them and the inhabitants of the Western Country. For after you have rendered them thus dependent   on Spain by using the first opportunity in your power to sacrifice their interest to those of the Atlantic states, can they be blamed for immediately throwing themselves into her arms for that protection and support which you have denied them for the enjoyment of that right which you have placed it out of your power to grant. Is it not clearly to be seen by those who will see, that the policy of Spain in thus inducing us to consent to a surrender of the Navigation for a time is, that by having a clear & unincumbered right she may use it for the purpose of separating the interests of the inhabitants of the western country entirely from us, and making it subservient to her own purposes? Will it not produce this? It will. Will it not give her influence the entire command of the numerous & extensive Indian tribes within this country? It will certainly have this Effect. When once this right is ceded no longer can the U.S. be viewed as the friend or parent of the new states, nor ought they to be considered in any other light than in that of their oppressors. There is one consideration & of some consequence, which ought to be recollected; that is the impropriety of the US ever acting under the influence of that kind of policy which is calculated to acquire benefits for one part of the Confederacy at the expence of the other. It is confessed our government is so feeble & unoperative that unless a new portion of strength is infused it must in all probability soon dissolve. Congress have it in Contemplation to apply to the states on this subject. The concurrence of the whole will be necessary to effect it. Is it to be supposed that if it is discovered a treaty is formed upon principles calculated to promote the interests of one part of the Union at the expence of the other, that the part conceiving itself injured will ever consent to invest additional powers? Will they not urge & with great reason the impropriety of vesting that body with further powers which has so recently abused those they already possess? I have no doubt they will. If therefore the entering into this treaty, which really does not in my opinion hold out any important benefits, and if any, only to a part of the Union, should interfere & prevent the states from assenting to invest Congress with proper power, throwing justice & equal attention to all the members of the confederacy out of view, Ought not policy to induce us to make the lesser yield to the more important consideration? If we are prudent it ought. It may be said it is extremely oppressive that the northern and eastern states should be deprived of a treaty, which they conceive an advantageous one merely to gratify the Southern in adhering to a claim to navigation, unimportant if in our possession, which we have not power to assert & must therefore submit to be deprived of. But it should be remembered that the cession is the price of the treaty. If you had not this right to grant why should Spain treat with you? Will she derive any other benefits from the treaty? No: All she can expect,   except the exclusive navigation she now enjoys, unfettered by stipulations.(8) It would therefore be extremely unwise & impolitic in her unnecessarily to restrict herself. I have stated the reasons which render her particularly anxious to treat with you, and those who are to pay the price have at least a right to an Opinion upon the subject. Besides the delegates of the different states stand here upon different grounds. The delegates of some of the states whose territories or whose claims to territory extend to the Mississippi or to the waters leading into it, and who consider these states as deriving a claim under the general title of the U.S. to navigate the river, view this as an important national right secured by treaty upon which they doubt their power to decide without a reference to their constituents. For if in time of War, under the exclusive rights of Congress and justifiable only by the law of necessity their right to divest their constituents of a national claim would be doubtful, how much more so is it in time of profound peace and when this necessity cannot justify it? Unless Spain would consent to treat with us upon terms which did not respect the Mississippi & which afforded us many more advantages than those proposed, I should very much doubt the policy of treating with her at all at this time. It does not appear to me honorable or politic that the U.S should at present form any treaties of commerce except upon such principles as would insure to us very considerable benefits and such as would execute themselves. It is not honorable because though Congress have nominally a right to enter into treaties, they do not possess the power of taking such measures as will ensure an attention to them. The right retained to the states under the confederation will create a dependence of Congress upon their conduct. This will be as different in the several states as their views and policy. They will each interfere with the other in their regulations & be incapable of carrying the stipulations into effect. Sensible of this defect Congress have already applied to the states for additional powers.(9) I would rather wait the issue of this Application, which may place us more upon an equality with Spain than treat under our present disadvantages. I have always been of Opinion that the true policy of the U.S. consisted in the endeavouring to obtain from their Constituents powers sufficient to enable them to establish such regulations as were suited to our situation, and would render our commerce more lucrative to our own citizens than to any others. All our policy should consist in the establishment of these regulations---;in the determination never to derogate from them in favour of foreigners and except in very particular cases in not attempting to form commercial treaties until we were in a situation to demand & expect privileges without purchasing them even with equivalents. This is the situation of Spain as it respects you, and therefore it is wise in her to push her negotiations as she expects an important cession without purchasing it with an equivalent; but I trust we shall have sufficient   prudence not to precipitate ourselves into a measure which we may hereafter repent, without first very maturely considering it. Upon the whole as the present treaty proposes no real advantages, that we do not at present enjoy, and it will always be the interest & policy of Spain to allow---;as our situation by no means presses us to the formation of new connections; and as the suspension demanded may involve us in uneasiness with each other, at a time, when harmony is so essential to our true interests---;As it may be the means of souring the states, and indispose them to grant us those additional powers of government, without which we cannot exist as a Nation and without which all the treaties you may form must be ineffectual, let me hope that upon this occasion, the general welfare of the U.S. will be suffered to prevail and that the house will on no occasion consent to alter Mr Jay's instructions or permit him to treat upon any other terms than those he has already proposed.

 [August 10, 1786](1) Mr. Pinckney reads his answer to Mr. Jays report. 1st. What advantage to be gained by a Treaty. Our relative situation with regard to Spain renders it unimportant. France will not probably interfere in the quarrel with Spain---; because her system is peace, to repair the wastes of war. G. Britain will probably take part with us. Mr. Adams says G.B. turns her eye to free S. Am. Spain can do us no good with Portugal. Nor any with the Barbary Powers, because this is only to be bot. Spain can do us no good in Italy---;though the K[ing] of Naples is Son in Law to the Sp. M[onarch]. Peace must first be made with the barb[ar]y powers. Spain wishes to be at peace with us---;she fears us---;our situation, though disagreable, Spains carry the Seeds of her dissolution. 2. The Public advantages of the proposed treaty. Reciprocity, no advantage because our commerce free, and theirs shackled---;the spanish duties 10 Per C. sometimes 20---;the duties on eatables 10 Per C---;on Merchdze 25 Per Ct---;the Duties on Vessels at 25 Per C. to S. America. No danger of restricting our Trade, which at present we enjoy. The purchase of Masts & Spars, no[t] important but she will buy them if as cheap as otherwise. Timber cannot be exported as cheap as from the Baltic. She raises wheat for her consumption, and if scarcity she buys in Sicily. As to the trade with the Phillipines---;not probable it will be granted---;but if it is, what is the advantage, as but one Ship sails from there. Examined as it respects the States. The N. Englands already enjoy a trade with Spain---;this will be enjoyed. The english & french encourage the fisheries, as they already enjoy the benifits of favd. nat[ion]s. NY, Pensy., & Georgia export wheat & Staves.  Maryland & Virginia prohibited. Indigo the spanish raise better. Rice always in demand. She proposes nothing but she will grant without it. The Le[. . .premi]um unimportant, because we cannot get it. Ought not to be agreed to 1. Because it will lower the price of the Lands. The posts held by force, would it be proper to suspend the exercise of the right? 2. It will seperate the western Country. The US should not exercise a power for the benifit of one part, at the expence of the other. It will prevent the states from investing Cong. with farther powers. The cession the price of the Treaty. August 10, 1786  The Deleg. stands upon different grounds---;the D. from the States extending westward. Doubt their power to yield the right. It is not the proper time to treat with Spain---;not honorable to make commercial treaties bec[aus]e congress Want powers.

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 12. 1786. I have wish'd to communicate for sometime since to you an account of a transaction here for your sentiments respecting it, but have declin'd from the want of a cypher, that of the delegation being we fear lost. The affr. however has come to such a crisis and is of such high importance to the U.S. & ours in particular that I shall risque the communication without that cover. Jay you know is intrusted with the negotiation with the Spn. Resident here for the free navigation of the Missisippi & the boundaries between Georgia & the Floridas---;his instructions altho' they authorize by implication the formation of a treaty of commerce, confine him expressly with respect to those points & prohibit his entering into any engagment whatever wh. shall not stipulate them in our favor. Upon my arrival here in Decr. last (having been previously well acquainted with Mr Jay) in conversation with him I found he had agreed with Gardoqui to postpone the subject of the Missisippi &ca in the first instance & to take up that of a commercl. treaty; that in this they had gone so far as that Mr. Jay was possess'd of the principles on wh. he wod. agree to make it upon condition, on our part, of a forbearance of the use of the Missisippi for 25 or 30 years; I soon found in short that Mr. Jay was desirous of occluding the Missisippi; and of making what he term'd advantageous terms in the treaty of Commerce the means of effecting it. Whether he suppos'd I was of his opinion or not or was endeavoring to prevail on me to be so I cannot tell, but as I express'd no sentiment on the subject he went further & obser'd \""that if the affr. was brought to the view of Congress they wod. most probably disagree to it, or if they shod. approve the project conduct themselves so indiscreetly as to suffer it to become known to the French & Englh. residents here & thus defeat it. To avoid this he said it occurr'd to him as expedient to propose to Congress that a Committee be appointed to controul him in the negotiation, to stand to him in the room of Congress, & he to negotiate under the Committee.\"" I then reminded him of the instructions from our state respecting the Missisippi to the delegation & of the impossibility of their concuring in any measures of the kind. Our communications on this subject ended from that time. Upon the arrival of Colo. Grayson I communicated to him all these circumstances with my opinions on them. From that time, and I had reason to believe he  August 12, 1786  had begun even before my arrival, we have known of his intriguing with the members to carry the point. On 27 of May he address'd a letter to Congress precisely in the sentiment above, stating difficulties in the negotiation & proposing that \""a Committee be appointed with full power to direct & instruct him on every point relative to the propos'd treaty with Spain.\""(1) As we knew the object was to extricate himself from the instruction respecting the Missisippi we of course oppos'd it. We found he had engag'd the eastern States in the intrigue especially Mass., that New York, Jersey & Pena. were in favor of it & either absolutely decided or so much so as to promise little prospect of change. The Committee propos'd by the Secretary was admitted generally to be without the powers of Congress since 9 States only can give an instruction for the formation of a treaty. To appoint a Committee with the powers of 9 States was agreed to be a subversition of the govt. & therefore improper. The letter however was referr'd to a Committee who ultimately agreed to report that the Committee be discharg'd & the subject referr'd to a Committee of the whole, & the secrey. ordered to attend. He did so and came forward fully with the plan of a commercl. treaty condition'd with the forbearance of the use of the Missisippi for 25 or 30 years, with a long written speech or report in favor of it.(2) The project is in a few words this \""1. That the merchts. of America & Spn. shall enjoy, the former in the ports of Spn. & the Canaries, the latter in those of the U.S. the rights of native merchts. reciprocally. 2. That the same tonage shall be paid on the ships of the two parties in the carriage of the productions & the Manufactures of the 2 countries. 3. That the bona fide manufactures & productions of the united States (to be only excepted which shall continue under its present regulations) may be imported in American or Spanish vessels into any of his Majesties ports aforesaid in like manner as if they were the productions of Spain. And on the other hand that the bona fide manufactures & productions of his Majesties dominions may be imported into the U.S. in Spn. or American vessels in like manner as if they were those of the said States. And further that all such duties and imposts as may mutually be thought necessary to lay on them by either party shall be ascertaind & regulated on principles of exact reciprocity, by a tariff to be form'd by a convention for the purpose to be negotiated & made within one year after the exchange of the ratification of this treaty and in the meantime that they shall severally pay in the ports of each other the duties of natives only. 4. Masts & timber shall be bought here for the royal navy provided that upon their carriage to Spain they shall cost no more than if they were bought elsewhere. 5. That in consideration of these advantages to the U.S. they agree to forbear the use of the Missisippi for 25 or 30 years. The term for wh. the treaty shall last.\"" This treaty independent of the sacrifice I consider as a very disadvantageous one & such as we shod. not accept since it in reality gains us nothing &   subjects to very high restrictions, such as exist in none of our other treaties altho' they are in effect bad enough. But they are to be justified especially those of France & Holland in the motives which led to them, to bring those powers into the war. The subject was referr'd to a Committee of the Whole on Thursday last who after debate rose & reported that they have come to no decision & require leave to sit agn.(3) The delegation of Mass. mov'd in Committee that the ultimatum in his instructions respecting the Missisippi be repeal'd, in wh. event he wod have unlimited powers to act at pleasure.(4) This they sd. might be carried by 7 States. We observ'd that without the U[l]timatum the instruction wod. be a new one, and of course 9 States necessary to it. The subject will agn. be taken up in a few days. It appears Manifest they have 7 States & we 5. Maryld. inclusive with the southern States. Delaware is absent. It also appears that they will go on under 7 States in the business & risque the preservation of the confideracy on it. We have & shall throw every possible obstacle in the way of the measure, protest agnst. the right of 7 either to instruct or ratify, give information of to this Mr. Jay & the Spn. Resident so that neither may be deceiv'd in the business. This is one of the most extraordinary transactions I have ever known, a minister negotiating expressly for the purpose of defeating the object of his instructions, and by a long train of intrigue & managment seducing the representatives of the States to concur in it. It is possible some, or perhaps one, (in wh. case it will be ever) member may change his sentiments; but as he risqued his reputation upon carrying it, it is to be presum'd he had engag'd them too firmly in the business to have a possibility of their forsaking him. This however is not the only subject of consequence I have to engage yr. attention to. Certain it is that Committees are held in this town of Eastern men and others of this State upon the subject of a dismemberment of the States East the Hudson from the Union & the erection of them into a seperate govt. To what lengths they have gone I know not, but have assurances to the truth of the above position, with this addition to it that the measure is talk'd of in Mass. familiarly & is suppos'd to have originated there. The plan of the govt in all its modifications has even been contemplated by them. I am persuaded these people who are in Congress from that State(5) (at the head of the other business) mean that as a step toward the carriage of this, as it will so displease some of them as to prepare the States for this event. I am thoroughly persuaded the govt. is practicable & with a few alterations, the best that can be devis'd. To manage our affrs. to advantage under it & remedy these defects, in my opinion, nothing is wanting but common sense & common honesty, in both of wh. necessary qualifications we are, it is to be lamented, very defective. I wish much your sentiments upon these important subjects. You will necessarily consider this as under an injunction of secrecy & confide it to none in whom the most   perfect confidence may not be repos'd. If any benefit may result from it I shod. have no objection to yr. presenting it to the view of Council---;of this you will judge. Clearly I am of opinion it will be held connected with other objects---;& perhaps with that upon which the Convention will sit at Annapolis. On the part of the Delegation we can give you similar information except as to what passd between Mr. Jay & myself---;will it be necessary. Of one point I have a perfect conviction & upon this the rest of the Delegation will perhaps not write you so freely as myself, wh. is this that the Legislature shod. be conven'd at a time sufficiently early to elect members to take their seats precisely on the day that those of the present delegation expire. Affrs. are in too critical a situation for the State to be unrepresented a day---;eminent disadvantage may result from it---;they did from this circumstance during the last year. Let me hear from you upon these subjects as soon as possible & believe me with great respect & esteem your friend & servant, Jas. Monroe  PS. The object in the occlusion of the Missisippi on the part of these people so far as it is extended to the interests of their States (for those of a private kind gave birth to it) is to break up so far as this will do it, the settlements on the western waters, prevent any in future, and thereby keep the States southwd. as they now are---;or if settlements will take place, that they shall be on such principles as to make it the interest of the people to seperate from the confederacy, so as effectually to exclude any new state from it, to throw the weight of population eastward & keep it there, to appreciate the vacant lands of New York & Massachusetts. In short it is a system of policy which has for its object the keeping the weight of govt. & population in this quarter, & is purssued by a sett of men so flagitious, unprincipled & determind in their pursuits, as to satisfy me beyond a doubt they have extended their views to the dismemberment of the govt. & resolv'd either, that sooner than fail it shall be the case, or being only desirous of that event have adopted this as the necessary means of effecting it. In conversations at which I have been present, the Eastern people talk of a dismemberment so as to include Pena. (in favor of wh. I believe the present Delegation Petit & Bayard who are under the influence of Eastern politicks wod. be) & sometimes all the states south to the Potowmack. Altho' a dismembermt. shod. be avoided by all the States and the conduct of wise & temperate men shod. have in view to prevent it, yet I do consider it as necessary on our part to contemplate it as an event which may possibly happen & for which we shod. be guarded---;a dismembt. wh. wod. throw too much strength into the Eastern division shod. be prevented. It shod. be so manag'd, (if it takes place), either that it shod. be formd into three divisions, or if into two, that Pena. if not Jersey shod. be included in ours. Be assur'd as to all the subjects upon wh.   I have given you information above, it hath been founded on authentic documents. I trust these intrigues are confin'd to a few only, but by these men I am assurd they are not; whatever anxiety they may give you I am persuaded it cannot be greater than that wh. I have felt. ""

 Sir New York August 12th. 1786 I received your favour of the 8th Instant by Mr. Turnbull. I cannot find that I have received any Letter from you on the subject of Daniel Parkers & Cos. affairs which I have not answered: nor do I find or recollect that I have received any since I saw you and Mr. Holker in this Town. You may be assured that I am perfectly disposed to meet Mr. Holker on terms of perfect justice and equality in the adjustment of my concerns with Daniel Parker & Co. You must be sensible that more than a Year ago, I furnished you with a statement of my Account with that company, and I have never yet been informed whether it has been examined and approved. When Mr. Holker and yourself were here, I proposed surrendering into your hands all their proportion of the property under my controul, upon your advancing their proportion for payment of the Debts. I am still willing to do this, or to comply with any other reasonable terms to bring the business to a final close. You seem to hold out an Idea that I have had the use of a very considerable property belonging to the Company. If you will please to inspect the Accounts you had from me you will see that the contrary is the case. I am as anxious as you can be to come to a final adjustment of this business, and if the terms proposed by me are not agreable, I wish you to propose any other and if they are just and equal, I shall be ready to accede to them. Mr. John Murray, assignee to Taylor & Rogers has called upon me, several times lately for the ballance due them from Melancton Smith & Co., I have informed him, that you had forbid me paying it, he  August 12, 1786  threatnes me with a suit. I am extremely loth to be involved in disputes at Law, as I certainly shall be, unless this business can be settled, he has agreed to wait before he proceeds, until I can get an answer from you.

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 14. 1786.

Orleans, to pay there a toll to Spn. of abt. 3 pr. centm. ad valorem & to be carried thence under the regulations of Congress. 2. that imports shall pass into the western country thro the ports of the U.S. only. 3. that this sacrifice be given up to obtain in other respects a beneficial treaty.(2) I beg of you to give me yr. opinion on it.(3) It is manifest here that Jay & his party in Congress are determin'd to pursue this business as far as possible, either as the means of throwing the western people & territory without the govt. of the U.S. and keeping the weight of population & govt. here, or of dismembering the govt. itself, for the purpose of a seperate confederacy. There can be no other object than one of these, & I am from such evidence as I have, doubtful which hath the influence.

A Reconsideration of the Question on the Rept. of the Bd. of Treasury was moved this Morning as a preparatory Step to the sending a Commee. to court the Assembly of Pennsa. to permit the Impost to go into operation separately---;An Idea that some are very fond of. I have constantly opposed it as a vain Attempt with Pennsa. unless some other Security is provided for the domestic Debt. Seven States  August 14, 1786  however have carried the sending a Commee. Mr King & Mr. Monroe are chosen.(1) The Report I mentioned was referred to a Commee.---;they have agreed (but not yet reported) to authorize the Bd. of Treasury to continue the Issue of Indents in Pennsa---;But to declare solemnly in favr. of their Construction respecting the 86,000 Dollars.(2) Another Commee., of which I am one, have agreed to report a strong Recommendation to the States who have neglected to grant the Suppl[ementar]y Funds, to do it immediatly.(3) This being on a Motion to this Effect, nothing more could be done under it. I merely assented because the Thing is not wrong in itself, but not enough. I proposed a Requisition on the States to pay in their respective Quotas of 27 Millions in Certificates of the domestic Debt within a reasonable Time---;each State to be exonerated from the Call for supplementary Funds in proportion to the principal from Time to Time paid, with some other necessary Modifications. I have put Notes of this proposition into several Hands, & it seems to work well, but must take a little Root before I venture a Motion on it. I have told them that without this or some other adequate security for the domestic Debt Pennsa. will never consent to the Impost separately, as she considers it as giving up the Domestic Debt to Destruction. I hope the Parties in Phila. will not divide on this great Question. My Time will not let me say more than, Your huml Servt.,  Chas. Pettit P.S.

The Subject of Acquiring more powers to the Confederation, is in the Order of the day, when finished they will be forwarded to you.(5) We have at this time twelve states on the floor of Congress, but I expect they will withdraw as soon as this Grand Subject is fully decided. I am exceedingly anxious to hear of Coll. Blount and Family coming forward, necessity will press me to return as soon as conveniency will admit. The deligates of North Carolina is in a disagreeable Situation for want of Suitable provision. Mr. White has not received any thing from the state, my Naval Stores Yet remains unsold. I am very desireous to be relieved in time, and hope to provide better for the Nixt Tower [Tour]. We are assured of the Friendly disposition of the foreign Courts, except the barbary powers with whom we cannot Negociate for want of Money, this Treaty will cost at least One Million, what measures will be pursued on this Occasion is yet unknown, the subject is at present under committment.(6) Congress has fixed the alloy of  August 16, 1786  Coin, the Standerd is one eleventh part(7) fine gold or silver, and one part alloy, the Dollar is made the money Unit by which the Decimal Ratio is fixed in the following manner Viz Mills the lowest money of account 1000 equal to the Money Unit or Dollar, Cents the highest Copper piece 100 equal to a dollar, Dimes the lowest silver Coin 10 equal to a dollar.

Our delegation were in sentiment ag'nst rejecting the act of New York when the report of the Committee was before them to that effect, from an opinion it wo'd unnecessarily irritate the state, that the best plan was to draft an ordinance which sho'd shew to the legislature it was not a system of oppression, but in conformity with the laws & constitution of the state itself, and thereby be an inducm't with it to grant powers in such conformity with the acts of other states as to enable them to carry it into effect---;to proceed with temper in this business & rather to conciliate & gain the confidence  August 16, 1786  of the state & all its citizens hath been my earnest wish throughout and by all means to avoid irritation. In the recommendation of Friday last I consider'd there was a substantial departure from the system, for it was that the state of N. Y'k grant the powers, (not in conformity with the system) but in such conformity with the grants of the other States as to enable the U.S. to carry it or rather to carry a system of impost into effect. I was therefore of opinion that the immediate assembly of the legislature might be the means of a compromise of this difficulty. What will now be done I cannot say; yr. letter of today is referr'd to a committee.(3) Some gentlemen suppose the rejecting of the grant of New York will be adviseable and that the Committee sho'd report so. Certain it is an ordinance cannot be form'd on the present act, yet in making this known to the state or in proposing any alteration of it I co'd wish it might be in a manner that might give offence to none, especially to those who contributed most to bring it about and are the best friends of the revolution.

 [August 16-18, 1786](1) It is a commercial Treaty not an Alliance that is proposed by the S[ecretary] for F.A.(2) Spain is not considered at all in the light of an Ally whether the most potent or otherwise. The most important however in a commercial View because greater benefits are to be derived from Intercourse with her than any other Nation---;she will pay in the precious Metals for all we send---;and offers the best market.  Secys. Reasoning on the part France would probably take in case of a rupture between Spain and America conclusive---;so also as to her Influence but what I may are the Councils of France. It is the interest of great Britain as well as most European Nations to take the commercial consignments of the U.S. and to deprive them of the means of becoming an important Maritime Power---;but maritime Power depends almost altogether on Commerce---;from a fortunate concurrance of Circumstances Spain wishes to be upon good Terms with America because she has reason to dread the Machinations of Britain, and to induce her to be upon those good Terms proposes a Treaty of Commerce that would be highly advantageous. If this [is] rejected, and a Rupture ensues, America is thrown into the Arms of GB who to humble the House of Bourbon and recover the Assendancy she has lost and is daily losing more, will readily embrace us and when her purposes are affected turn her Arms agt. Us and effectually prevent the possibility of her ever becomming her Rival in any Shape whatever. The first proposition of the Court of Spain seems to be misunderstood. They shall be founded on perfect reciprocity, and they are well explained by what follows. If duties imposed upon importations are higher in Spain than America---;America receives no injury, her Merchants are on the footing of Native Merchants and that secured by treaty the duty paid enters into the price of the commodity and is paid by the Consumer and so with the respect to the Spaniard here it is an indirect Tax by which the Spanish Monarch draws Money from the pockets of his Subjects into his Treasury. The Dutys we impose have the same Effect & the right to increase them to any extent remains as it now is in both Nations but neither can be subjected to an alien duty. But say Gentn. the Advantages the US. may derive from this Treaty may be rendered uncertain by Spains entering into a similar Treaty with other Nations. Certainly she means to preserve that right as America certainly does also. The provision in favr. of Masts & Timber is an advantageous one. The price is to be paid in Specie in America if they are as good & as  August 16, 1786  cheap as they can be got elsewhere. The purchase will continue---;if they are not we ought not to expect it.

 [August 16, 1786](1) Grayson. Spain the most potent Ally---;not most potent but most useful. The Secretarys Reasoning conclusive.(2) That in case of War France will most probably take part of Spain rather than America.  Barbary Powers Commercial Nations mind their own Business. What is France to accquire from Shutting up the Missippi? Cementing the Friendship with Spain. Assistance from Britain An excellent Reason for quarreling with Spain---;she would willingly assist as lesning the power of the Bourbons and in case of Success turning her Arms agt. America. PrÃ¦miums---;consider their Influence and Effects. Southern States irritated Exclusion from navigating the Missippi in favr. of these States. Conveniences to one part of the Union are so to the whole and scarcely in any Instance can she derive Advantages in commerce in any other way. Southern States will repeal the Impost because Individuals will be disapointed in a profit they had looked forward to. Will Spain use her influence with Barbary supposing she has it? Yes, She has no Share in the carrying Trade of her own Country, it is in the hands of France---;by deciding with America it will be done more advantageously for her. August 16, 1786  No Argument can be drawn from what passed when Colonies. All that was profitable was confined to great Britain from the obligation to land and reship in that Island. Suppose we had the Advantages of the spanish Trade when british Subjects which we had not, we lost them by the Revolution. The regaining them as an independent People is an Object of the proposed Treaty. Canaries. Without a Treaty we may be excluded. Preferential Differences in favr. of U.S. No Nation on earth will treat with us terms of equality---;unless we can be give them some thing for it. Commodities of every kind can find no preference but from being cheaper or better. If a Stipulation for equal duties is inserted in a Treaty and one party evades it the Treaty is void. 4 Article wants explanation.(3) The obvious meaning is that of Masts &ca be furnished on equal Terms with Others. America will have a preference. ""

 [August 16, 1786](1) Grayson Spain a contemptible friend or foe, and therefore a treaty unimportant. The family compact does not extend to a guarenty of the dominions claimed by Spain in America, as it comprehends only such territory as the two powers shall mutually possess at the conclusion of the then war. Nothing can be inferred from the conduct of France dur[in]g the War, as she was then deeply interested in bringing the whole house of Bourbon under engagements to support the independence of the US.

 Thursday Aug 16. 1786 Congress went into a comee. of the whole. Mr Grayson opened the debate with an extemporary speech. He followed the train of Mr P.(1) laboured to depreciate the advantages to be derived from a commercial treaty with Spain, & argued, That Nothing was offered by the treaty but what might be enjoyed without it, That the sacrifice to be made to obtain this treaty was great & far more than an equivalent---;that the occlusion of the river would destroy the hopes of the principal men in the S. States in establishing the future fortunes of their families---;that it would render the western country of no value & thereby deprive the US of the fund on which they depended to discharge the domestic debt---;that it would separate the interest of the western Inhabitants from that of the rest of the Union & render them hostile to it---;that it would weaken if not destroy the union by disaffecting the S States when they saw their dearest interests sacrificed & given up to obtain a trivial commercial advantage for their brethren in the East---;That Spain knew her own weakness & would not dare to go to war to secure her unreasonable demands---;That if she did, she would not be supported by any of the commercial Nations in Europe---;That it was their interest & wish that the trade of S Am. should be open---;that although France was connected with Sp. by the family compact & policy, yet in case of a rupture bet. The US & S. she would only mediate between them but not join the latter---;But in case she did G.B would join the U.S. That she in particular wished to see Sp divested of her S. Am. colonies & to participate in that trade. The interest & policy of the dutch would lead them to the same measures---;That the US had nothing to fear from a war with Sp. That Morgan with 1000 men could penetrate into the heart of Mexico & emancipate the Sp. provinces---;that  August 16, 1786  the inhabitants there were ripe for a revolt & only waited for such an event to shake off the yoke of Spain. That the true policy of the US was to stand firm to cement & strengthen the Union among themselves & to assert their right to the navigation of the Mississippi & he had no doubt but that Sp. would finally agree to it.(2) Mr King spoke next. Having in behalf of the delegates for Massa. moved new Instructions to Mr J. & observed that this subject was forced upon us, & not to be put off at our pleasure. He proceeded to point out the distressed state of the Eastern States---;that they had an ungrateful soil & no staple but what they drew from the sea---;that the fishery depended on a market, the best market was Sp & this could not be secured but by treaty. That therefore a treaty with Sp was of the utmost consequence to the E States in particular, but the terms which were mentioned were beneficial to all the states. That the equivalent to be offered was of no great consequence. It was only an Agreement to forbear the use of that which we could not at present enjoy. That the Mouth of the river was in the possession of Sp. That she now excluded us from the use of the Navigation & would continue to exclude us until we were able to assert our right by arms. That if the value of the western lands depended upon the free navigation of the river Miss. the forcible occlusion by Spain operated as strongly to that effect as a voluntary forbearance for a term of years. That however some gentlemen might depreciate the power of Sp. she was by no means a contemptible enemy. That F must favour if not join her---;that her hopes of Assistance from any of the Maritime powers of Europe were visionary & ill founded---;that they all considered us as rivals & looked upon us with a jealous eye & though they wished us to be independent they never wished us to be powerful. That refusing to treat on the terms proposed is sacrificing the interest & happiness of a Million to promote the views of speculating land jobbers. That entering into a treaty on condition to forbear the use of the Navigation will give time to the U.S. to acquire strength, arrange their affairs, & strengthen the Union, so that at the end of the term they may be prepared to assert their right, whereas by breaking off the treaty, Sp. will be disgusted & will strengthen her posts to exclude us from the use of the river, the settlers in the W. Country buoyed up with the hopes of assistance will attempt to force a passage & the US will be precipitated into a war before they are prepared. That in case of such an event the existence of the Confederation will be endangered. For the States whose interests are now neglected if not sacrificed will not be willing to incur the expence & danger of a war brought upon them as they will think unnecessarily & prematurely, more especially when they considered that by this precipitate step they are deprived of the only advantages which they could expect from the Union. In such a case would there be found a man east of---;where to draw the line he did not know---;but would say east of Delaware who wd. give his vote for war.   ""

13913,dg023430,1786,Arthur St Clair s Speech,"""Arthur St. Clair's Speech
 [August 18, 1786](1) Having been absent when this Business was formerly under the consideration of the Committee I want much Information I should have derived from the discussion it has already undergone <<but it presents itself to me> in a very simple <<State. Will the> proposed Treaty be Advantageous <<to the United> States. It seems however to resolve itself into these two Questions. First Would the united States derive Advantages from such a Commercial Treaty as has been proposed on the part of his Catholic Majesty by his Minister?  2d. If they would derive Advantages are not the Stipulations and Concessions expected from them more than equivalent(2) ---;on the right Solution of these Questions the whole Business in my Opinion depends. That the U. S. would derive Advantages I think cannot be disputed. The treaty would secure them an Advantageous Trade from which without it they might be excluded, and from which in all probability they will be excluded in case no Treaty takes place. A Trade where the  August 18, 1786  Ballance is sure to be in our favour and that Ballance sure to be returned in Gold and Silver. A Trade in which they will not only be their own carriers but the carriers for Spain also. A Trade Sir that at once tends to encrease the Staple of a considerable part of the confederacy, to encourage the Art of ship Building, and to nourish an encreased number of hardy and experienced Seamen. In this View the Advantages can Scarce be estimated for they go much farther than the mere commercial profit they embrace the political Interests of the Nation and her future consequence with respect to other Nations. Treaties of Amity and Commerce Sir have a most happy Effect upon Mankind. They greatly tend to remove by the intercourse that follows from them that Distrust and Jealousy that distant Nations whose manners & Customs are different, who live under different Laws & Governments, and speak different Languages are apt to entertain of each other the interchange of commodities that One has and the other wants begets a friendly disposition disposes them to peace and literaly as the poet has beautifully expressed it binds the round of Nations in a golden Chain. But Sir the proposed Treaty does not offer to America mere commercial Profit only. It will have and must have political Consequences. The House of Bourbon is closely united by Blood, by Treaty and by Interest. The Pride, the Arrogance and Folly of great Britain has wrought a great Change in the Sentiments of European Powers. They have seen with pleasure the Union of that House and have been cordially acquiesced in it as the only Security they could have against the boundless Ambition and Rapacity of those haughty islands. We are not only in Friendship but in strict Alliance with one branch of that House---;another holds out His hand to Us, if we accept a closer connection will probably follow---;if we reject it may not our Ally suspect it arises from a disposition not very friendly to her? When the seeds of Distrust are once sown they seldom fail to ripen into enmity. Should that happen Is there another power on Earth to which we could look up for that protection we shall yet a long time Want. Yes say Gentn. Great Britain would readily take us by the Hand. Sir I readily believe it would. I believe Sir they would move Heaven & Earth to recover that Asscendancy in the Affairs of Europe which they have lost for ever, and a connection with it whilst it would consign us to probable ruin, would mark us as the basest and the meanest of Nations that ever inhabited the Earth. But suppose that, with her protection we escaped the Evils we should be justly exposed to, and that with our Assistance she regained that Ascendancy she has lost, would be then safe? No Sir---;She would then remember that we were once her Subjects. Her Arms would be turned against us, and with the Detestation of all Mankind we should left suffer the just punishment of perfidy and ingratitude. It follows I think Sir that from such a Treaty the united States would derive profit and they would derive consequence.  Let us now enquire whether the Concess[ions] expected from Us are more than equivalent for if they are the proposal should certainly be rejected. The Proposal Sir is a relinquishment of the right to navigate the M. below the southern Boundary of U.S. This Sir has been solemnly and I think properly refused and if the Negotiation cannot go on but on that Ground it is at an End. Permit me howevr Sir to lament that at so early period and in my Judgment so unnecessarily that matter has been made Object. The united States thought it secured to them by the definitive Treaty---;had it been suffered to sleep until it became necessary to us it is more than probable there would no difficulty have occurred in the Exercise of it. At present I presume it will not be contended that the Exercise of that Right is of much consequence---;none that can in any degree be placed in the Ballance with the Trade to Spain. An Expedient however is suggested by the Sey. of U.S. by which for a limited time the Benefit of that Trade may be secured, to wit by consenting not to use that Navigation for the same limited time. What Injury will US receive thereby, I say none. The only Injuries that I heard suggested are that Emigration to the western Country would cease and consequently the value of the Lands which are depended upon for discharging the domestic Debt be lessened. If it would stop the Emigration to the westward it is an Event devoutly to be wished. That Emigration Sir has injured us much already, most sensibly Sir during the War by rendering the levies more difficult and the means of supporting it fewer. Sir I have been told & I believe it is true that in the Kentucky Settlement there are at this time 6 or 7000 Men able to bear Arms. Will the Gentn. of Virginia please tell what Advantage that State has derived from that great Body of People---;has one Shilling ever come into their Treasury from them? I believe not Sir and farther I believe their never will. In one point of View they are absolutely lost both to the States from which they removed and to the Union. In another point of View they may be considered as very dangerous to it---; collected together from every part of America with various views and from different causes they find themselves a distinct People that has little connection with and no defence upon any of the Atlantic States. They are fit instruments ready to be laid hold of by their Ennemies. Are the States bordering upon the Atlantic so overstocked with People, that it [is] necessary to encourage a Spirit of emigration? No Man of Observation that travels thro this Country but answer in the negative. He will tell you Sir that the most populous States still want more hands for that Agriculture is still in its Infancy. He will tell you Sir that it cannot be much improved without an accession of Hands. He must have seen Sir that there is scarce a hand can be spared for Manufactures and the Arts, nor can these ever arive at much perfection until there are many more People in a Country than   are necessary merely for cultivation. I have been informed by very intelligent Gentn. from Virga. that the Emigration from that Country has been felt so sensibly that they will soon be obliged to repeal their Laws agt. the Importation of Africans. Can it be advantageous to any Country to send out industrious freemen to make room for Slaves? It is unnecessary to state the Effects because I think it will not be said the preventing Emigration by concentrating our People by accustoming them to the wholesome restraint of Laws and requiring from them a more active and well directed Industry would place us in a better Situation for all Events whilst encreased the means of Subsistance & the Articles of Comm[er]ce and improved our Manners. Sir I am well acquainted with the Manners of our Frontier People and it was the employment of a great part of my Life to improve and civilize them---;from the Sparse manner of their Settlement, from the distance they generally are from the Center of Power which is weak in proportion, from their Indigence and from the Injuries they are constantly giving and receiving to and from the neighbouring Indians they accquire a turbulence and ferocity of Disposition that renders them but indifferent Citizens at the best, and the progress of Society may be traced in almost every American State thro all its different degrees---;but most unhappily it is a retrograde progression, & Care then Sir should be taken to check this Spirit and if it cannot be checked Government should go hand in hand with it---; for want of this necessary precaution the united States I have good Reason to believe are at this Moment involved in an Indian War. But the value of the Lands will be lessned and the public Credit shaken. I have several times had occasion to mention my Sentiments on this Subject. The Redemption of the Debt by the Sale of those Lands has always appeared to me a Chimera. I believe Sir it will be worse that the Debt will be actually encreased by them. If the public Credit has no better foundation it rests upon the baseless Fabric of a Vision. I have held an opinion however that the public Debt with proper Managers, might be made a public Benefit. I think it might still be made so. All that is necessary is to be honest and provide for the regular payt. of the Interest which is easily within the Compass of the States. In a very little time Sir foregners would invest their Money in our Funds. They would become friendly to Us from a very powerful Motive and the Union itself would be bound more strongly together. There was a time when this might assuredly have been done. I will not say if it is not passed but I believe it might yet be done. Mr. Chairman There are yet some other and powerful Reasons on my Mind, suggest themselves why we should agree to the forbearing to navigate the M---;---; for a limited time. One is that at present we shall be prevented from it and it is not very necessary to us. There appears   to me to be more dignity, more policy certainly in waving the Exercise of a Right we cannot maintain, & obtaining something for the Waiver, than by pertinaciously insisting upon it, lose the Advantage and endanger the Right itself. This I take it is exactly what we should do were the Sentiments of some Gentn. here to prevail. The Spaniards will certainly throw more force into the Countrys they possess on the Mi---;i, our Strength will gradually encrease in the adjacent Country, and at last a War in which the Right must be committed must be the Consequence. Whereas should the Disuse proposed be agreed to the Right is established, and tho a War may still be the ultimate consequence, it is not so likely to happen when Spain has made a Concession by accepting the Disuser that the Right is in Us, at any rate we put off to a time in which it is to be hoped we shall be better prepared.

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 19. 1786. My last(1) advis'd you of the {progress of Spanish negotiation. Until that time the reference of Jay's letter to a committee was}(2) I believe the point at wh. {it rested}; but to enable you to form a satisfactory opinion {of the object of that letter I transcribe you only} operative {paragraph} in it. \""{I take the liberty therefore of} submitting to the {consideration} of {Congress whether it might not be adviseable to appoint a committee with power to instruct and direct me on every point and subject relative to the proposed treaty with Spain}.\"" You are to observe {his only ultimata were} respecting {the Mississippi and the boundaries; the committee}, consisting of {a member from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania}, & {myself, kept it about two months} and at length two of them {reported that they be discharged, the letter referred to a committee of the whole and himself ordered to attend}.(3) It was agreed to with this alteration that {he attend Congress} to explain {the difficulties stated in his letter} & to lay {before them a state of the negotiation. He accordingly came and being aware objections would be made to his entering into debate, produced a long written speech which he read by virtue of his office} and which was {in substance as follows.(4) France against our right of the navigation of the Mississippi and, in case of a variance with Spain upon that point, against us}. Well to be on good terms with {Spain}. Therefore on that acct., as well as to avail ourselves of her {influence in the councils} of {Portugal, the Italian States} & {the Barbary Powers, as also} in {those} of {France herself}. That {Great Britain would rejoice} to see {us at variance} with {Spain}, and therefore wd. {foment dissentions} bet[ween] us, that in case {this treaty failed, Spain, mortified and disappointed} in the eyes of {all Europe} wd. enter into engagements with {Britain} (or in resentment) {so as to exclude us from her ports}. For {these reasons} and fully to obtain the confidence & good wishes of {that power}, as also {her} good services in the lines aforesaid, he {thought it wise to forebear the use} of {the navigation of Mississippi} for {twenty-five years} or {thirty}, if necessary, as a condition to obtain at the same time the following {liberal articles} as the {basis} of a {commercial treaty}. 1. {All  August 19, 1786  commercial regulations shall be reciprocal, Spanish merchants} in the {ports of} [America] and {American merchants} in those of {Spain} & {the Canaries} to have the {rights of native merchants} of {the} two {countries}. 2. To establish {consuls} in {their respective countries}. 3. {The bona fide manufactures and productions} of both parties, {tobacco excepted}, to {be admitted} into {the ports aforesaid} in {the vessels} of both parties upon the {same footing} as if they were their {own manufactures} & {productions}; and further that all {such duties} & {imposts} as {may mutually} be thought necessary to {lay} on them {by either party} shall be regulated on {principles of exact reciprocity} by a {tariff} to be form'd within one {year from the ratification of this treaty}, and in the mean time they shall severally {pay in the ports of each other those of natives only}. 4. {Masts} & {timber for the navy} to be {bought, provided} they be as {cheap} as in {other countries}. This was the am[ount] of his communications as to {the project} which {he urged} our adopting by {all the arguments he could think of}, such as, we {cant obtain the use}, & therefore of no consequence---;{we must now decide}; must terminate in accomodation, {war, or disgrace, the last the worst, the second unprepar'd for, the first the preferable course}---;That we shd. avail ourselves of {the moment or Britain would}---;therefore no {time to lose} with others of the same kind. This {subject} hath since the above {communication, engaged the attention of Congress} for {ten days past}. The {delegates of Massachusetts} who {are his instruments on the floor} mov'd {in committee} to {repeal his ultimata} with a view of suffring {him to proceed at pleasure} and upon this point hath {the debate turn'd}.(5) It hath been manifest {they have had throughout seven states and we five. They, to Pennsylvania inclusive}, and {Delaware} being {absent}, the {rest against him}; we deny {the right} in {seven states} to {alter} an {instruction} so as to make it {a new one}(6) but they will proceed, {be that} as it may, {the treaty} in that event be form'd & soon {presented for ratification}. To prevent this we {have told them we would} give notice to {the secretary} of the incompetency of his {powers} as also {to the resident} of {Spain} to {justify Congress in refusing} to {ratify}, if they shod. chuse it.(7) In this state it {remain'd} without any new {proposition} untill yesterday, being Friday.(8) {We stated however in the close of the day} that {we} would agree that {a treaty} be {form'd upon the following conditions. That exports be admitted thro the Mississippi, paying at New Orleans a duty} of {two} & {half per cent ad valorem to Spain}---;to be carried thence in {Spanish, American} & {French bottoms}. That {imports} be {prohibited} in that line.(9) If this should be adopted {we propose} to {change the scene of negotiation} & to carry it to {Madrid}, to take it out of the present & put it into {yours} & {Adams's hands}.(10) We fear however & with too much reason that this will fail. Nothing {could have been more unfortunate than even the} agitation of this subject. {It hath lessen'd the} ground on which we stood & {given Spain} hopes {she  August 20, 1786  had no} reason to calculate on. What prospects to {the general interest} might be calculated on as resulting from the {deliberations of the convention} at {Annapolis} must be {diminished}. In short {the measure} strikes me as every way {highly injurious}. I am {sorry} to {inform you} that {our affairs} are {daily falling into a worse situation}, arising more from {the intrigues of designing men than any real defect in our system or distress of} our {affairs}. The same {party} who {advocate} this business have certainly {held} in this {city committees} for {dismembering the confederacy} & throwing {the states eastward the Hudson into} one {government}. As yet this business hath {not gone far} but that there shod. be a {party in its} favor, & {a man}(11) heretofore {so well respected} but in my opinion so little known, engag'd in it, {is to me very alarming}. Congress have agn. requir'd money for the insuing year, including that part of the principal of the foreign loans that becomes due in that time.(12) All the States except New York & Pena. have acceded to the impost to the acceptation of Congress, the former hath granted the revenues accruing from it but hath not made the collectors so amenable to Congress as the system requires & the other states have done, and Pena. hath granted the impost but suspended its operation untill all the States shall have granted the supplemental funds; a committee is appointed to attend the legislature of Pena. on this subject, & recommendation pass'd to the Executive of New York to convene the legislature to take the sd. system agn. into consideration.(13) They meet in the usual term in the fall or commencement of the winter.

 Dear General New York Augt. 20. 1786 May I take the liberty of our former acquaintance to confer with you freely upon the following propositions. You seem'd satisfied with those presented to the view of Congress on Friday by Colo. Grayson(1) viz. that exports be admitted down the Missisippi to N. Orleans as an entrepot---;to pay there a duty of 2Â½ per centm. or more if necessary to the crown of Spain ad valorem---;to be carried thence in Spn., American & french vessels to other countries---;that imports be prohibited---;in short that any arrangments on this subject be made wh. shall hold up the U.S. to those people, our ultra-montane brethern, as the patrons of their interest, and not give the sanxtion of Congress to a measure which suspends for a day expressly their just rights---;with these objects in view we will go as far as those who are the most anxious to obtain a Spanish treaty & cultivate the good wishes of that branch of the house of Bourbon. The point then upon which I wish particularly to consult you is simply this---;the puting the negotiation of this treaty in the hands of Mr. Jefferson & Mr. Adams, that the former be instructed to repair to Madrid under the mediation of France for that purpose in character of Envoy extraordinary.(2) This I presume may be done without giving offence to the gentn. here, either Mr. Jay or Gardoqui, since it is in difficulties of this kind the usage of courts to proceed thus & this line of negotiation must be particularly respectful to the court of Spain as it will be the highest evidence of our disposition of it as well from the manner as the terms upon which we are willing to make the treaty. Without this believe me I have the most satisfactory evidence nothing will be done. Mr. Jay has within my knowledge since Decr. last been negotiating with Congress to repeal his instructions (or rather with particular members) so as to occlude the Missisippi, & not with Spain to open it. I trust you have sufficient knowledge of me to be satisfied I wod. not make this allegation if I had not the most satisfactory evi August 20, 1786  dence in my my own mind of what I say. This evidence you shall possess whenever you please. I therefore calculate with certainty upon losing every thing whilst the business is in his hands. If in this free communication, I deviate from any of those rules of friendship & respect I have always entertain'd for you, & which I mean this as an evidence, you will attribute it to no motive of that kind since I am not influenced by it.  I am Dear Sir with real esteem & regard yr. very humble servt,  Jas. Monroe ""

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 20th. 1786 I have been favoured with your Letter of Yesterday(1) and thank you for the Communications it contains upon which I will freely give you my Sentiments. A treaty with Spain I consider as very important to America, at the same time it is certainly our Duty to endeavour to obtain it upon the best terms possible---;indeed, if it was possible, to give up nothing to procure it, but I believe that cannot be done, for, it seems, as I have been informed, that Spain, notwithstanding she is desirous of being in Amity with Us, has directed her Minister to stipulate as the price of her Freindship, an acknowledgment on our part of her right to navigate, exclusively, the Missisippi River. The Minister of the united States is directed to insist on their parts on the right of Navigating that River freely with Spain. It is obvious that without one or other partys receding in part---;the Business is at an End. The Question then is is the freindship of Spain worth any concession with respect to that River. I think it is. Mr. Jay suggested that forbearing to Use for a limited time, the Right we pretend to have on that Navigation---;which would be a concession on our parts, might enable him to proceed on the Business which he could not advance in one Step under present Circumstances. In this View I am clearly of opinion that the restrictive Clause of his Instructions ought to be repealed---;but as Mr. Graysons proposition is more favourable to the Union than the absolute forbearing to navigate for any given time, how short soever, I think it aught to have a Trial, and therefore I wish to make it an Instruction to Mr. Jay but by no means an ultimatum. As to taking the Negotation  August 20, 1786  out of the Hands of Mr Jay and comitting it to our Ministers in Europe I cannot think it adviseable(2)---;so far from being acceptable to the Court of Madrid, it strikes me that it would be more offensive, and if it would be at all necessary that Mr. Gardoqui should be attended to, it would be impossible---;for, the investing Mr. Jefferson or any other Person with the Caracter of Envoy extraordinary would on sending him to Madrid supersede Gardoqui. It appears to me we could not possibly take a more effectual Step to defeat the Measure which in the Light in which it presents itself to my Mind, I think would be a real misfortune to my Country---;indeed I do not think there is another commercial Nation in the World but would feel themselves happy in having Spain come forward to them in the manner she has done to Us, nor One that would not be pleased at seeing the Opportunity slip thru our fingers. Consider, my Dear Sir that Spain has on some Measure committed herSelf---;without waiting until we should desire her Freindship she has offered it---;without requesting that we might send to Madrid to negotiate the Terms, and all Nations consider it as important to have negotiations carried on under their own Eyes, as it gives them an influence upon them and the opportunity of improving every Circumstance that turns up. She has sent her Minister to negotiate them here, it is evident the Freindship of the United States is estimated highly or a Step as uncommon and from so haughty a Court would not have been taken---;And what reason can we suggest for desiring to put the Negotiations in a Train, that other Nations would studiously avoid. I can see no good Ones, but I can see two that will very readily present themselves to the Spanish Ministry. One th[at] Mr. Gardoqui is not acceptable and we will not do Business with him, the other that Delay is all we have in View until we can feel pulses of other Courts and put ourselves in a Situation to assert by force that which we claim and they dispute. The first, certainly, makes an Ennemy of Gardoqui and all his Interest with Spanish Ministry, be it much or little will be exerted unfavorably to America. The second as certainly determines the Ministry and the Nation against Us. That Mr. Jay may have been endeavouring to get his Instructions repealed I neither doubt nor wonder at, because I think they were in the highest degree improper. It seems to me that if it had been the Design to give Mr Gardoqui the Ascendant in the Negotiation---;to put it in his power to know the utm[ost] lattitude of Mr. Jays Power while he could conceal his own nothing would have been contrived better to answer the purpose. But if Mr. Jay is deemed an unfit Person---;or if he has not hitherto managed the Business in a manner satisfactory to Congress take it out of his hands and commit to some other---;but let the Negotiation go on here. Your communications with your minister may be as  August 21, 1786  frequent and easy as we please---;and if it should at any time be necessary to throw Obstacles in the way of its progress it can be done with more Ease than at Madrid. I am an entire stranger to the Circumstances you allude to relating to Mr Jay. I shall always be happy my Dear Sir to receive any Communication you may please to make. I have replied with the same freedom and with the utmost Candor which, as intended, I trust you will accept as a testimony of the Esteem & regard with which I am &c. ""

 [August 21 ? 1786. ](1) Not going into Arg[umen]t-well Discussed. Talint & Tempr.-Impart[ial] .  A Barg[ai]n or Cont[rac]t. Sp[ain] is sup[pose]d to Offr. Trade for Mass[issippi]. Is it a good Barg[ai]n.  The Trade admit Beneficial. It is all we have-all we can Hope? Trade benef[icia]l to one part of the Union benef[icia]l to all, for we are one Body. The Wealth of Georg[i]a is mine as a Mem[be]r of the Confed[erac]y. It has been shewn how Benef[icia]l This Posit[io]n Clear the Trade of Sp[ai]n benef[icia]l to this Union & ev[ery] Individ[ua]l of it. But the obj[ectio]n here is you will have it with[ou]t a Treaty. It is the Int[eres]t of Sp[ain]. Perhaps we shall. But is it not better to have it of Right than at Will-as found[e]d on Cont[rac]t than dependg on Caprice. Surely it is! Thus far then the Adv[ocate]s for the Treat[y] seem conclusively to have the argum[en]t-and if it was simply proposed no Man here would refuse it so far from it he would think it a great bless[in]g to this Country.  But you may buy Gold too Dear. This the stress of the Arg[umen]t. We must make too great a Sacrif[ic]e to obt[ai]n this Boon. We must give up the Mass[issipp]i for 20 Yrs. But is it so? Is it y[ou]rs to Give? That is mine absolutely wh[ic]h I have a right to Use & can Use. Can you say this of the Massi? This has been ably stated at first, and I wish I co'd say it has been Answd. But I think it has not. I fear it cannot be answd. or If it cannot it concludes the Argt. If you can't Use the Mass[issipp]i for 20 y[ea]rs, It is not yrs to give. When you agree to not to use it you sacrif[ic]e noth[in]g. This too ansd as was observd. Every argt. Depr[eciatio]n of West[er]n Land-Injury to Virg[ini]a &c &c. They all fall before it. You give up then only a Right to go to War for 20 Yr. This is a benefit not a loss. The only seem[in]g Ansr. is that Brit[ai]n will Aid us to open it. But this has been fully Ansd. by Pen[nsylvani]a.2 But with whatever Aid we ought not to go into a War for 20 Ys. at least. It will ruin us. But there is anothr. Branch of this Argt. upon the Right which has been ment[ione]d by the Ad[vocate]s for the Treaty but may be carr[ie]d farther than they have pushed it- And has not been Ansd. by their Opponents. What part of Right is it. The Genl. Right in these Cases is the Ownership of the Land on both sides the River. This belongs to Sp. But we have a Right under the Treaty with Britn. This all our Tit[le]. But Sp. says Brit. could not Grant it for 2 Reas [on] s. 1st. It was a partic [ula] r Grant to her in nat[ur] e of a personal Grant which she co'd not transfer. It was not to her & her Assigns. If so we could take nothing by the Brit[is] h Grant. But August 21, 1786  21y. Supp[os]e, they will say, That Brittn once had such a Right as was capab[l]e of being Grantd. Yet we took it from her before the end of the War. The Floridas were Conq[uere]d & all the Rights of Brittn. in the Quartr. fin[al]ly revested in Spain. This reasoning is at least plausible. I do not say it is Conclusive. On the Cont[rar]y I think the right of the U.S. may be established in oppositn. to it. But at best it admits of much Dispute. Thus Circumstancd. is it not a very desirable Obj[ec]t to obtain a Confirmation of this Right. Surely it must! as it must put an End to all fut[ure] Altercat[io]n. This the prop[ose]d Treaty will effect. For as has been obs[erve]d the Accep[tanc]e of Sp. will admit the Right & in the fut[ur]e Estoops her from saying U.S. have none. Pensa. then had good right to say you do not give up a Right you rather acquire one.  But Ind[ependen]t of all that has been said, As the Argt. is rested chiefly upon the Injury it will do Virga. & the S[outher]n States-This point sho'd be clearly established, which I have not yet seen done. If Gent. speak farther upon the subject they will apply themselvs. to do this. At present I think for 20 Years there will be little Use for the Missi., & I rely upon this that whenever it shall be really essential to the well-being of that Peop[l]e wheth[e]r bef[or]e or after 20 Yrs, Treaty or no Treaty, it will be opened. Neith[e]r Sp nor U.S. can prevent it. The Peop[l]e will no more be restrained, than those Migh[t]y Waters can be confin'd by a Dam. I do not theref[or]e see the Dang[e]r of the Treaty. We secure a present & immed[iat]e Good of no small Amount, at most at the exp[ens]e of remote & possible Evils which may never be realized. In such Cases all sound Politicians decide in favr. of the meas[ur]e.  This can never shake the Union. I rely upon the good sense & jus[tic]e of our Southn. Brethern. Let the matter be fairly stated to them as it is here, they will decide as we do, that it is best for the Whole, & theref[or]e in a polit[ic]al sense best for every Individ[ua]l. Gen[era]l Good must be attendd. w[it]h part[ia]l Evil and Inconvenience. It is so in the Govt. of the Univ[ers]e-a frat[ern]i[ty]. If I verily thot it would Depreciate in a Degree the Conn[ecticut] Lands yet I sho[u]]d conceive we ought to sacrif[ic]e the add[itiona]l Profit we might make to so Benef[icia]l a Treaty, & to the gen[era]l good. I hope othr. Gentn. will entertain the same Ideas & Act upon them.  The Ramificat[ion]s of the Argt. unnecessy to be pursued. These the great Points. On them we shall, I hope We shall Decide, with that Candor Imp[artialit]y & Firm[nes]s of sound Polit[ic]s & good Patriots.  ""

By the Canaries Flour will find its way to Spanish America. August 22, 1786  Minister not instructed on that point-but there are hopes of its being obtained.  Obstacles are the M [ississippi] & Territorial Limits.  A. Minister opposed to every Idea of relinquishing it, and fully sensible of the Importance of it.  Relinquishment strongly insisted on.  Spain will never yield that point. Their Maxim to exclude all Mankind from their american Shores.  Reminded that the adjacent Country was filling with People and the time must come when they would not be contested to abstain from using it as a high way to the Ocean.  S. Minister thinks the time far distant-treaties provide not for such distant contingencies. The rapid Settlement prejudicial to U.S. and they will be obliged to seek it-tho necessary in Treaties to leave neither party any thing to complain of, yet Misi must be shut agt. Us.  If the right to navigate was the clearest possible, the enjoyment can be provided for only by being able to repel Force by Force.  Expedient to limit the Treaty to 25 or 30 under present Circumstances, and to stipulate a forbearance to use the Navigation below S. Territories to the Ocean. Duration of the Treaty & forbearance would be equal.  Uncertain if S. M. would be content. Instructions prevent even sounding. Worth trying because, unless it can be settled in some way their can be no Treaty however advantageous.  Navigation at present not important, nor probably become so in a less time than that proposed. A forbearance to use while we do not want it no great Sacrifice.  S. now excludes us, and holds it agt. us with a strong hand. She will not yield it peaceably and therefore we can only acquire it by War. Not prepared for War and many of the States would be little inclined to a War for that Object.  For various Reasons such a War inexpedient. S. will for a long Space will exclude us. Should we not (for a valuable consideration) consent to forbear to use what is not in our power to use.  If S. & U.S. part on this point what are the latter to do?  Will it be consistent with their Dignity to permit S. forceably to exclude us a right which at the expence of a beneficial Treaty they have asserted. We must do this & be humiliated or attack Spain-are they ripe for this?  Such an Article might be supposed to lessen the value of western Lands. So would the forceable exclusion if there is any thing in the Argument-but America in one Case would lose some of its Dignity- which of the Cases is least desirable.  We lose nothing by attempting the Compromise. They who take a Lease admit the right of the Lessor.   A probability that it would succeed-other Articles in the Treaty inducing it now-like Articles would again tempt to a prolongation.  Little territorial Limits by impartial Commissioners not sovereign. This made desirable because not prepared for War. We should place ourselves in a Situation as that by forbearing Hostilities we may be exposed to Indignities. Better had these matters lain dormant, but they press themselves and must be determined by accommodation, War, or Disgrace. The last the worst that can happen. The second unprepared for the first our Attention should be bent to.  The best Season because the Disposition of S. at present friendly.  Commercial Arrangements to form particularly with Britain. Now able and Willing to grant U S favours, other Treaties may render her in future both unable and unwilling.  S. giving U.S. marks of Respect and even courting our favour by offers and Attentions not very common for her to bestow when other Nations discover a very different temper-and the Advantages to be reaped from a Treaty with her greater than can be obtained from any other Nation.  If her endeavours to take Us by the hand are rejected, contrary Dispositions & Passions will take place and influence her conduct, and operate greatly to the Disadvantage of U.S.  France would tell us our claim ill founded. Spanish Ports on its Banks & within our Country in Florida would be strengthned and there they would bid us defiance.  ""

 My dear Sir, New York 23d August. [17] 86 Your mortifying favour of the 20th Inst. just now came to hand. On Thirsday last I was attacked with a Vomiting and purging which forbid my attempting to leave home. Besides a great national Question was pending before Congress, from which I could not have been absent, if able to set in the house, which I could scarcely do, without incurring the displeasure of more than half this Confederacy; but to close the rear I had totally mistaken the time of my appointment, for Friday Eveng. which, indisposed as I was, without regarding my dinner, I returned from the City Hall to Elizabeth Town with the impetuos[ity] of a lover to the wished for Interview. I need not tell you how great was my disappointmt. to find I had missed you.(1) Long before the Sun arose I set out on foot for the Point, stept onto the first Boat, presuming that you would wait the arrival of that, at least, before you left N. York, as there would be another in the Afternoon, if you returned at all that day. To guard, however, against this, in my estimation, only probable chance of missing you, I persuaded the Boatman to go out of his way to speak every Elisabeth town Boat, on their way up, & when we haled the last, & found you not on board, I felicitated myself that I had compassed my object; for I could not dream that you would go in a Stratten Island Boat; but what was my disappointmt. when I arrived at 12 to find that you had left the City at 11 OClock. Fatigued, disappointed & very unwell I was constrained to yield the pursuit. What a strange futilty has attended this business? I am at a loss to account for it, but upon a providential interposition. Till I was informed by your Letter I never heard that you would stay at Sisters with a view of waiting for my return should that be necessary. But enough of this. By the bye, I dont think I have used you so ill as you suggest.  I shall attend to your request respecting Mr Edwards, if I am permitted to be at Providence at Commencement, which I hope to be, though' it will be somewhat uncertain.  His Letter to Govr. Hancock, with its enclosures I shall attend to also. A Tutor from Providence who can be recommended you could doubtless have, if a Support in any wise adequate, could be given him. What my Ideas, after returning to Providence, may be of the Kentucky business, I cannot now say. Had I seen and conversed with you I could have better decided. My Expectations of any person for that Office from N England, are not very sanguine. I wish you had mentioned August 23, 1786  what Salary a Tutor may expect. This, however, you can state before the Graduates disperse, after Commencement, & when he will be wanted to enter on the Business. Also when the principal, whoever he may be, must be on the spot. This must depend on the Arrangements made by you. Probably I shall leave this City by this day week & not before. My state of health is somewhat recovered.

Besides the usual inability (Difficulty) which you are sensible I labor under & which render writing extremely difficult to me, I have in fact ever since my last return here been so uncommonly (constantly) engag'd that it was impossible for me to find time for it. On the one hand Congress has sat more Hours & more constantly than usual to  August 25, 1786  avail themselves of the advante. of havg 12 States upon the Floor: on the other Mrs. J has been for some time in Town in atte. on our Daughr.

Had I conceiv'd as you politely insist that an immede. applicatn. from me might have had that effect I certainly shou'd have made it with all possible energy as I really believe a short excursion here wd. have been beneficial not only for the public but to you personaly, while it gave me a short relaxatn. from the perplexing load of Politicks. I now despair of seeing you before Octr. if indeed I may even then have that pleasure. In the mean time Mr. S.(3) & I are labouring in the Politl. Vynd. as well as we can. Most that we do I pres[um]e you see detailed in the Paper. With respect to the Imp[os]t A comee.

We have finsh'd an Ord[inanc]e for Indn. affairs, & are at work upon one for the Govt. of the Westn. Country. You know how slowly everything important must commonly proceed. Other matters of high Conseqe. are in Agitation. You know as fully as I can explain to you that the Crisis of our Fate is rapidly approaching. We may esscape Perdition perhaps. If we do we shod impute it to that all gracious Providence which has so often & so signally interposed in our favr. Not that there are not those here who will do all that belongs to them to do to prevent it, but all they can do must be ineffectl. unless Provde. do's more than we have any even enthusiasticke grQunds (rzght) to expect will be done for us. I know not how those Polits. & Philos. who look only to s[. . .]d Censor find [reposes?] to their Souls. For my part, I confess if I did not firmly believe that Providence raises all & Levells all with a steady, impartial & unerring hand which continually aduces Good from Ill I shoud be in absolute Dispair, throw up the hands, & abandon not only political existence but life itself. But there is, there must be an author for us to adhear to sure & steadfast. My chief concern is therefore that come what may (& what probably will) no just blame may be imputable to the State of  Connectt. or the Delegs. of that State.

But I had concluded the distance of the Day of the next meeting of the General Court, as a very fortunate event in the present disposition of the people.  The paper money of Rhode Island will have destroyed itself, and left an useful Lesson to the neighbouring States, before the first of February-the sober part of the community will prevail over those turbulent Characters who are now moving the people for conventions, Reforms &c, &c.

 Dear Sir, New York 26th August 1786. In answer to yours of the 14th instant (1) I would first observe that there have been for sometime past 12 States in congress the whole Union except Delaware State.  Their attention is taken up partly by hearing and answering petitions which in our General Court are pretty numerous-but necessary to administer publick justice. Partly by makeing acts or ordinances for the publick good. It is not easy for you to conceive the length of time and debate ocupied in making an ordinance for Indian affairs. Publick treaty's with foreign powers and debates on certain points contained in them take up much time-every thing under this head is under the injunction of secrecy, until concluded.  Requisition-mode of taxation-imports [imposts], additional articles to the consideration [confederation] to be recommended to the States for adoption, present powers of congress in respect to certain objects, have taken up much time.  Western Territory-Indian war, Indian treaty's, coinage-commerce &c &c.  Our foreign debt or the intrest of it must doubtless be paid in solid coin. But that coin will not be sent from this country as I suppose. But our produce being sold in foreign countries must raise the cash and that cash be negotiated to discharge our debt. Our cash being collected in this country may be applied to purchase bills of credit from such American merchants as have sent cargoes to Holland, France and Spain. Spain is doubtless the market for the northern States to get cash and a treaty-but I must be silent. No doubt you easily see an answer to your question abt NH or any other State paying their quota in produce. Let the produce be sent to market in Holland, France or Spain especially the latter it will raise the cash: that cash will pay the quota.  You will ask then, shall a state turn merchant? Perhaps they must in some sort. August 26, 1786  As to the plenty of money in this and other States-Wheat brings cash, so does any article for exportation.  Cash is plenty enough for these things. Paper and silver go alike here owing as it is said to the smallness of the quantity of paper compared to the quantity of silver, the goodness of its fund-double mortgage-its being receivable in all publick payments here &c. Concerning paper in other States you know as much as [I]. I am urged by the northern States to remain here until certain points are obtained in Congress even although it should defeat my attending our Superior court. I am therefore in a very delicate situation between two important points of duty but still not without hopes of effecting both. Of these anxieties however I perceive the publick intend soon to relieve me as they have very politely turned me out of the delegation and I suppose intend to starve me out of the office of Ch. J. But please to excuse my troubling you with wrongs that only touch myself.  Your depreciation affairs has been decided against you-but it shall be tried once more-I have some hopes yet. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to effect a point in my estimation so just.(2)  Charles de la Valley's petition I have not yet presented-I intend to offer it but nothing can be more hopeless of success.  I have a plan for a post rider to be established from Boston to Concord, Exeter, Portsmouth and Bath the same rout once a week which I think would be of great publick use-and I hope it will be effected.

 Dear Sir New York 27th. Augt. [17]86 I send you inclosed the receipt filled up agreeably to my former letter. The paper money of this State has as yet no fixed or publickly avowed depriciation on it but no other kind of money is paid to any person who will receive it and I find by experience that since it has got into circulation every article which I purchase at market is raised in price. But the advocates for the money attribute this rise to other causes. The paper of Pensylvania is publickly and generally sold at a discount of from 10 to 12 per Cent. The Rhode Island paper is totally damned.  I am informed that the rage for a paper currency in Maryland still prevails. I apprehend that it will [be] necessary to gratify the populace with a small sum this fall to prevent a greater evil. You tell me that McHenry is to be the Elector are there any new Candidates for representatives in the Town or County besides Mr. Lux. There are most wicked lies propagated against me in Cecil and my election will be considerably opposed but I am determined to give myself no trouble about it not even to go down to it.(1) I am perfectly agreed to live retired at home and never leave it except once in a while to pay a visit to my friends at Baltimore and Philadelphia.  The price of public securities here are very variant. They took a start some time ago from an opinion that the system of public impost would be Immediately carried into execution but that prospect having failed owing to the defective law passed by the State of New-York they are now low and a dull sale-finals that have not had facilities issued for their interest are from 2/9 to 3/ in the pound those on which facilities have Issued are from 2/ to 2/6. By facilties you are to understand the certificates which are Issued for the Interest due and are received for 2/3ds of the continental tax from those States who have complyed with the requisitions of Congress. And they sell from 5/6 to 6/6 in the pound. I believe I could here purchase one or two thousand dollars of black and State Continental Money at the specified valued that is have the interest givn up what could be made by such a speculation? and who can help me to make it? a good bill on Philadelphia would answer the end of cash and the paper money could be transmitted by the post.

 Dear Sir New-York Augst. 30. 1786 Your Excellency will perceive from the enclosed report that an apportionment of the domestic debt is in contemplation. The subject as yet has never been under Debate so that it is difficult to determine August 30, 1786  what will be the opinion of Congress. From the Sentiments of some Gentlemen out of doors, the measure if not acceded to, will be at least countenanced. (1)  The operation of this system will raise the price of all public securities, which will in some measure defeat the object of our legislature. If it is possible by any means, to procure a Sum of Money, it appears to me, that there is no mode in which it could be so advantageously laid out, as in purchasing our quota of the domestic debt. The State of Pennsylvania has already in her own hands more than her proportion, some other States are nearly in the same condition, all will aim at the same thing, and thereby produce an instantaneous rise on the value of the debt, such a one as will probably require double the Sum that is now requisite to secure the whole of our share of the debt. This is a subject of serious concern to us. I will therefore take the liberty of suggesting an Idea that has occurred to me, and upon which I have spoke confidentially to a Gentleman in this City. It is his opinion and also my own that by Contract, the greater part if not the whole of our debt, may be obtained at this Time at a very moderate rate. The Credit of the state is good, and if authority was given and confidence reposed in some individual for this purpose the most beneficial effects would be derived from it. Tobacco would be received instead of Money which would greatly ease our people. I expect the full plan from the Gentleman to whom I allude which when received shall be laid before your Excellency.  Be so obliging as to let me hear from you upon this subject. I am, Sir, with Sentiments of the most perfect respect & Esteem, Yrs.  J Henry ""

 Dr Sir,(1) New York Sept. 1. 1786 I have had the pleasure to receive your favors of the 26th June and 25th August, together with the certificates which were the Subjects of them and should have returned you an Answer immediately on receiving the first, had it not been for a painful indisposition from which I have since recovered. I will with great pleasure have them adjusted in whatever Offices they may respectively be admissible, as soon as I am sufficiently at leisure to act upon them, with a great number of others sent to my hands by my friends. You may be assured that every thing needful for the proprietors shall be attended to. It is proper that two men who have equally the public good at heart and differed so widely as you and I have done upon a point of policy remaining as yet in speculation, should communicate to each other the reciprocal effects of enquiry and reflection upon it. I mean the emission of paper money, which it seems but too much occupies the views of Virga. I assure you, Sir, I have devoted much of my attention to the effects of the experiment in the other States, most of whom have gone into it, and thus stands my information. In Rhode Island, almost in the instant of its birth, it ceased to circulate, except in the payment of debts, for which it was made a Tender, and has convulsed the State nearly to a civil War. In N. York it has but just made its appearance but is not a tender provided the Creditor will not bring Suit, or in other words, it gives a letter of licence until the Debtor can dispose of his property, and run away. There is at present no marks of depretiation; but in the decline of Commerce & distress of Merchants, who Dare do no business upon Credit, symtoms of bad consequences are plain. In Jersey, its age is about the same as that of New York, and its operation the same also---;its effects must of Consequence be in concord. In So. Carolina it is in age much older than any of these before mentioned, its operation and effects the same, and is depretiated to the degree of 25 per Cent notwithstanding the most oppressive associations for the support of it, such as no Government, much less a free one, should afford occasion for. In No. Carolina, where it had existed for three years a tender, to the banishment of Commerce into Virga., Goverment has past an Act which eventually acknowledges a depretiation of near 100 per Cent---; That is to say in directing a quantity of Tobo. to be purchased the price of 50/ per Ct. is allowed, when the specie price is but 25 or 30/. In Pensylvania it has been in circulation near two years, and although it is in no sense made a tender, as well as managed with tolerable attention  September 1, 1786  to the principles of finance in respect to a limitation of quantity and seasonable and certain redemption, it is now as low as 10 per Cent under the Value of specie. You will understand me as not denying the practicability of emitting paper money to the advantage of the State and so managing it as to preserve its Value---;but I say none of the American States can now do it---;our people are not in habits to afford a scheme of that sort fair play---;from the instances of the five States first named, it is evinced that paper money, once emitted, our legislatures will prevent it from its proper use, and carry it to the aid, of fraud and injustice, losing Sight of every principle of Management upon which it can promote the convenience of honest Men---;from the instance of the latter, it stands evinced that the people have not Sufficiently got clear of the Smarts of the injuries which the old emissions, during the War inflicted, to place a confidence in any thing carrying the same external features. A few words now as to the true policy of Virga. under the whole State of American politics in this business of paper money. Whatever might have appeared proper formerly, it certainly would now be highly impolitic for her to come into the measures. I observe that wherever paper is thrown into circulation, and has in any degree the force of a tender, unless it is the legitimate offspring of specie, it will for ever banis[h] the latter, and with it commerce. Now in case of such an abandonment of the other States, where will they go so naturally as to Virga. Where is the great Staple demanded by all the markets in Europe. I am convinced that if Virga will but have reflection and fortitude enough to act for herself, and keep out of the Current of Madness which has seized upon the other States, she will in the course of next year experience a happy return of a flourishing Commerce and plenty of hard Cash. Indeed Sir, I think it is in her power from her pre-eminence and weight in the Union to set an example which may yet restore the empire to the fair persuits of justice, economy, and industry. It is really to be regretted that the different legislatures seem rather solicitous to fabricate schemes of fraud and indle [idle] speculations amongst the people, than to establish the good of the Country upon Wholesome and just Laws: could our attention be once turned upon this object those resources in which we abound for an advantageous commerce would be brought forth by industry & their product nourished by OEconomy---;but so long as the prospects of our people are flattered by the idle speculations which all paper systems hold up---;and so long as there is a forebearance of Laws to make them just. We shall remain the contempt of the World. Should you find as much leisure as to favor me with a line upon this or any other subject you may be assured it will afford me much pleasure to receive it. I am dr Sir, with great regard, Your Afft Hl St, Ed. Carrington(2)  ""

 Dear Sir New York Sepr. 1. 1786. Sometime since I was appointed of the Committee to attend the Pena. Assembly, contrary to my wishes, & not being able to extricate myself (having apologiz'd in the first instance upon Mrs. Monroe's indisposition which was not admitted in expectation of her better health) am now under the necessity of attending.(1) The question was not I suppos'd taken upon the whole report of the Committee of the Whole---;but upon the subsequent instruction as to the boundaries only. The President Stated it from the chair to be upon the whole, but the next day qualified it as meaning the whole then before the house, the other part being (as to the repeal) decided the day before. We suppos'd the question, having been taken upon the several amendments, had been, as stated above, afterwards taken on the whole.(2) It is enter'd in the journals as carried in the affirmative as to the repeal. A motion was made is the question carried? & laid aside by the previous question. It has since been made an order that we shall not move in form or substance any proposition which has been set aside by the previous question, unless the same number of States are present---;the State of R. Island, being abt. to leave the floor which their delegation accordingly did immediately.(3) I shall sit out for Phila. on Monday next---;will you be there on my arrival? Sincerely yrs. Jas.

 Dear Sir, New York 3. Sep. 1786 Mr. Cabots information relative to the Spanish commercial regulations is very satisfactory; I find it corresponds with the best accounts I have been able to collect on the Subject, & Mr. Gardoqui himself confirms it.  A Treaty with Spain is at this Time a desirable Event; If the present situation is preferable to a rupture with Spain a Treaty between us must not be long delayed---;the boundaries of their and our Territories, remain to be ascertained; they claim extensive Tracts of country within the Limits of the united States as fixed by the Treaty of Peace & Freindship with Great Britain; we insist on the right of freely navigating the Missisippi from its source to the Ocean. They deny this right and refuse us the navigation where both banks are in the possession  September 3, 1786  of Spain---;the Rapid Settlement of the western country, more particularly on the Ohio and that Part of Georgia, which is adjacent to the Missisippi, urges a decision of these interfering claims and Pretensions. As Time is more favorable to young than old nations, policy would warrant Delay---;but these western adventurers will not suffer it---;they at this time hold a bold language, are yearly making almost incredible accessions of Strength, and their own particular interest is to them as to all others the active principle of their Conduct. If therefore our Disputes with Spain are not settled, we shall be obliged either wholly to give up the western Settlers or join them in an issue of Force with the Catholic King: the latter we are in no condition to think of, the former would be impolitic for many Reasons, and cannot with Safety be now admitted, although very few men who have examined the subject will refuse their assent to the Opinion that every Citizen of the Atlantic States, who emigrates to the westward of the Allegany is a total Loss to our confederacy. Nature has severed the two countries by a vast and extensive chain of mountains, interest and convenience will keep them separate, and the feeble policy of our disjointed Government will not be able to unite them. For these reasons I have ever been opposed to encouragements of western emigrants---;the States situated on the Atlantic are not sufficiently populous, and loosing our men, is loosing our greatest Source of Wealth. But what is wealth in Governments imperfect as ours are? indeed my Dr. Sir, your opinions on this subject are but too well founded---;and you may be assured that the ablest and most discerning men in these States, are anxiously affected with the Difficulties which you so feelingly & properly describe. What can be done is the Question---;the answer is various. Some say, and the opinion is extensive, infuse a new portion of Strength into the confederation and all will be well. But it should be remembered that the pressure of a common Calamity which induced the present confederation is now removed, that the individual States are governed by their particular Interests; these stand, or are supposed to stand, in Opposition to each other, and, so long as the Idea obtains, will prevent Unanimity in any Opinion concerning the Corroboration of the Federal Constitution. Others, and by no means the least respectable, answer, that nothing can be done in our present Form; that the Error lies in the original plan. Diminish say they the Number of States---;let those which are to be Established be nearly equal. Reform their Constitutions, give their Governments more Energy---;the Laws more Stability, the Magistrates greater Authority and Responsibility---;Let the State Governments be confined to concerns merely internal: and let there be a federal Government with a vigourous Executive, wise Legislative, and independent Judicial---;they tell you that a League or confederation between   so many small, and unequal, Sovereignties never did, or can, answer the views of its Patrons---;they illustrate, by affirming that the Greek Republics were finally melted down, and united, under one Head---; that in France and Spain, which were formerly each divided into as many independent States or Sovereignties, as they now contain Provinces, the People did not find their Happiness in these small Divisions, but sought it under their present form---;that the Heptarchy, or seven Saxon Kingdoms, of England were finally united by Egbert, and that peace & Happiness then succeeded to Treasons, insurrections, & Wars, which made up the History of that famed Confederacy. It must not be understood that these Remarks authorize an Opinion that a monarchy would promote the Happiness of the people of America(1) ---;far, very far, from it. But they show this; if wise & prudent men discerning the Imperfections of the present Governments, do not in Season and without Fear, propose suitable Remedies, the causes which changed the Governments alluded to may, and probably will, change those of America. Since a convention must assemble at Annapolis I am glad that Delegates will attend from Massachusetts. I hope extraordinary as the measure is, that it may issue more favorably than I have ever expected. Neither Chancellor Livingston nor Mr. Duane will attend; they are very little concerned in the politicks of the present Times. Mr. Madison of Virginia has been here for some Time past, he will attend the convention. He does not discover or propose any other Plan than that of investing congress with full powers for the Regulation of commerce Foreign, & domestic.(2) But this power will run deep into the Authorities of the individual States, and can never be well exercised without a federal Judicial---;the reform must necessarily be extensive. I will not add on these subjects. We must wait Events. I hoped long before this to have been in Boston with Mrs. King. But we are yet to be delayed. Mr. Sedgwick left us a few days since on account of his Health. I cannot break up the Representation of the State, which would be the case in my Absence. I wait the Return of Mr. Dane.(3) Be pleased to present my respectful compliments to Mrs. Jackson, & be assured that I am with high Respect, Dr. Sir your obt. and very humble Servt., Rufus King ""

 Dear Sir New York Sepr. 3. 1786. In my last I advis'd you of the point to wh. seven States had brought the business. After repealing the instruction in part, entering the repeal affirmatively, setting aside a motion requiring the sense of Congress whether the repeal was valid so as to give a new instruction by 7 States, by the previous question, & passing an order to prevent our moving it again untill they shod. have the same number of States on the floor, on their part the thing was complete. I inform'd you also of our propositions & the number of States for them---;it was on Friday last that they clos'd the business.(1) It has been propos'd by some of the gentn. on ours to notify Mr. Jay of the opinion of the 5 States but I  September 3, 1786  think we shall not do this.(2) He is possess'd of course of our sentiments in the official way; to communicate them otherwise than thro the journals might have an intemperate & factious appearance. We have as yet done nothing but under the constitution & almost in all cases the rules of the house, nor shall we I apprehend. Some gentn. on their side hinted their determination to withdraw if the question shod. be brought on as to the validity of the repeal. Whether we shall take any other step is undecided. I doubt the propriety of so doing further than moving for permission to transmit copies of the journals to the States for their information & to obtn. instructions to their delegations.(3) I shod. suppose the Secry. wod. not proceed untill he finds himself supported by the States to whom the 7 delegations belong. Upon Jersey & Pena. then it rests. To engage their leading men is now the object.(4) Most probably he has already consulted them but his consultations & those of his party I doubt not have been founded on partial representations. To remove their impression a view of the journals may be necessary. I consider the party especially Jay & the principal advocates as having gone too far to retreat. They must either carry the measure or be disgrac'd (as the principal already hath been by the vote of 5 States), & sooner than suffer this they will labour to break the Union. I therefore suspect they have been already (and indeed have too much reason for my suspicions) intriguing with the principal men in these States to effect that end in the last resort. They have even sought a dismembermt. to the Potowmack & those of the party here have been sounding those in office thus far.(5) To defeat the measure therefore completely we must follow their mov'ments & counteract them every where, advise the leading men of their designs, the purposes they are meant to serve &c, and in event of the worst extremity prepare them for an union with the southern States. I fear some of those in Pena. will have a contrary affection---;but it must be remov'd if possible. A knowledge that she was on our side wod. blow this whole intrigue in the air. To bring this abt. therefore is an important object to the Southern interest. If a dismembermt. takes place that State must not be added to the eastern scale. It were as well to use force to prevent it as to defend ourselves afterwards.(6) I consider the convention of Annapolis as a most important Ã¦ra in our affrs. The Eastern men be assur'd mean it as leading further than the object originally comprehended. If they do not obtain that things shall be arrang'd to suit them in every respect, their intrigues will extend to the objects I have suggested above. Pena. is their object. Upon succeeding or failing with her will they gain or lose confidence. I doubt not the emissaries of foreign countries will be on the ground. In short I do consider this convention as requiring your utmost exertions, in the change things will infallibly take, as well to obtain good as to prevent mischief. Mr. Randolph will I hope devote himself to the publick   upon this occasion & not suffer himself to be taken off by his professional pursuits before the convention dissolves. I write you freely without the cover of a cypher knowing you have not yours with you. Indeed I fear nothing to the publick or myself from a publication, for I am satisfied if the publick were acquainted with the conduct of these unworthy servants their consequence wod. be of but short duration. Prevail I beg of you on Colo. Mason to attend the convention. It will give him data to act on afterwards in the State.  Very sincerely I am yr. friend & servt., Jas. Monroe [P.S.] I have always consider'd the regulation of trade in the hands of the US as necessary to preserve the union---;without it, it will infallibly tumble to pieces---;but I earnestly wish the admission of a few additional States into the confederacy in the southern scale.

 Sir, New-York [September 3?] 1786(1) We are to inform you that we consider the resolutions of the 20 July & 25 August 1785 as still in full force & that you are bound to adhere to the restrictions and limitations therein contained as the partial repeal of the restraining clause being carried by only seven states, we do not concieve the Question ought to have been considered in any other light than that of having been lost. Nine states being necessary under the confederation to authorize the entering into treaties, the same are certainly necessary to alter, amend or enlarge the powers of the negociator, and as the repeal of the restraining clause in your instructions had a tendency to enlarge and alter your powers, so we suppose your own good sense will dictate to you the impropriety as well as danger of proceeding upon any other principles than those of stipulating, the free navigation of the Mississipi and the fixing the territorial limits agreeable to the treaty with Great Britain. As the repeal however may be transmitted you without intelligence of the manner & Authority by which it was carried we concieve it our duty to give you  September 4, 1786  this information and to say that if you proceed we shall consider you as proceeding upon powers incompetent and unconstitutional and that we shall not hold the states we represent, bound to ratify or attend to any treaty you may form upon the supposed Opinion of having been released from the restrictions abovementioned by the partial repeal of seven states.

 Dear Sir. New York, September 4th. 1786. The public business make slow advances owing principally to an unhappy division between the Eastern and southern delegates on a treaty with Spain the particulars is Confined to the Cabinet. I am exceeding Anxious to have your Opinion on the subject and shall endeavour to obtain leave for that purpose, the opposition is like to become serious, both appear firm and immoveable and seven States seem determined to carry on the business whilst the five Southern States oppose with a Uniform exertion, how the Matter will terminate is quite uncertain, two states have left Congress Rhode Island and Newhampshire, all Other Business Seems to be out of View at present. Prior to this unhappy dispute the additional powers to the Confederation was reported by the Grand committee, which now appear out of View and Some Gentlemen urge the measure will be useless. If the present plan is carried into execution, as it will introduce a necessity for a different Government if Seven States can carry on a treaty or in other words will persist in the Measure, it follows of Course, that the Confiderated compact is no more than a rope of Sand and if a more efficient Government is not obtained, desolution of the Union must take place. We have also had under consideration a Colonial Government for the Western Country which remains unfinished, the Particulars if I mistake not was mentioned in A former letter.(1) I am sorry to hear our paper Money has depreciated, the Currency of New York is yet equal to silver, how long it will Continue in that  September 4, 1786  State is uncertain, the Jersey currency is also good within the limits of the state but in this City they make a discount of 15 per cent for that Currency. Rhode Island yet remains in the utmost Confusion about their paper Money, the Mercantile Interest will not suffer it to pass notwithstanding the heavy penalties inflicted by the Acts. We have had a very Moderate Summer, & the people in general are healthy. It gives me pain to mention to your Excellency my personal disadvantages. The Naval Stores which I brought with me remain unsold, nor do I see the least probability of disposing of it for money, a Method here prevails of bartering for that Article; which does not answer my purpose.

How wise would it be, how happy for us all, if this change could be made in friendship, and conducted by reason. But such is the tardiness of the virtuous and worthy part of society in matters of this importance, and such the concert & zeal of the vicious, that it is to be apprehended that wickedness and audacity will triumph over honor & honesty. The enclosed proclamation just come to hand will shew you the temper of the eastern people(2)---;it is not confined to one state or to one part of a state, but pervades the whole. The decay of their commerce leaves the lower order unemployed, idleness in this body, and the intriguing exe[r]tions of another class whose desperate fortunes are remedeable only by the ruin of society produce schemes portending the dissolution of order & good government. Weak and feeble government are not adequate to resist such high handed offences. Is it not then strange that the sober part of mankind will continue to prefer this incertitude & precariousness, because their jealousys are alarmed and their envy excited when they see the officers of the nation possessing that power which is indispensably necessary to chastise vice and reward virtue. But thus it is, and thus it has been, and from hence it follows that almost every nation we read off, have drank deep of the miserys which flow from despotism or licentiousness---;the happy medium is difficult in practice. I am very unhappy to hear by Mr Shaw that your health declines; I must hope he is mistaken and cannot help thinking so, as Col.  September 8, 1786  Humphreys tells me that you look very hearty, and use vigorous exercise.

I have the most satisfactory evidence they will reject the proposition. We proceed therefore further merely to discharge our duty---;both parties are united in opposition to it. To morrow we shall be recd. by the legislature.(1) I am sorry I came on the business. Before this you have recd. my letters informing of the subsequent progress & final close of the business which lately engagd us in Congress;(2) or rather so far as it depended on their direction. By agreement nothing was to be done in it untill our return. I expect to sit out back in a day or two. It will depend much on the opinion of Jersey & Pena. as to the mov'ments of Jay, and that of Jersey much on that of Mr. Clark now with you at Annapolis. He put Hornblower in Congress & may turn him out agn., for he has no positive weight of his own. Clark has always been anxious for taking the western lands from us. I shod. suppose him inclin'd to turn it to the best acct. I conclude therefore that if he knows the delegation, especially his part of it, pursue a system of policy so contrary to his own, & to what is in effect the interest of his country, he wod. dismiss Mr. Hornblower. Perhaps you may be able to hint to Mr. Clark that Jersey except Symes was with the eastern States upon this occasion.(3) Mr. Henry of the Maryld. delegation has referr'd Mr. Stone(4) to you for information upon this subject by my request. Mr. Stone is my friend and a very upright sensible man. You will shew him what part of my letters you find necessary. The ablest men here believe & act on it, in the rejection of the proposi September 13, 1786  tion, that the refusal to seperate the 2 parts of the system(5) endangers the govt.---;and that it will most probably induce a change of some kind or other. It is well for the southern States to act with great circumspection & to be prepard for every possible event---;to stand well with the middle states especially. I sincerely wish you to suffer no anxiety and to put yourself to no inconvenience upon our private affair. I have no occasion for the money untill abt. the 5 or 10th of Octr. to help to remove me to Virga.---;and even then it will be in my power to do without it, with tolerable convenience, if you shod. find it inconvenient to command it. Believe me it will put me to no inconvenience. My engagments are but few & those within my controul. Let me hear from you as often as possible. Remember me to Colo.

  [September 13, 1786](1) Monroe and I were sent to the Legislature at Phila. The requisition of supplies for the general Treasury were ill complied with, and owing  September 13, 1786  to their insufficiency, the numerous Claimants often went empty away; but such of them as belonged to the States, which were the most punctual in paying into the Treasury their quotas, complained that strangers were paid, when they were dismissed unpaid. In this disorder of the finances, Pennsylvania, which had paid her quota more freely than many others, adopted certain regulations, according to wh. instead of paying her quota into the general Treasury, she assumed to distribute it among her own citizens, holding claims on the general Treasury.(2) This assumption increased the financial embarrassment of Congress, and, if followed, would have put an end to all the contributions from the other States. To remonstrate against this course of proceeding by Penna. M. and myself were deputed to her Legislature. Genl. Mifflin was the Speaker of the House, it being before their present Constn., their Legislature consisted only of a single body---;Being first named in the mission, it was in course that I should deliver the remonstrance. I had taken a good deal of pains to examine and arrange the matter of my discourse, and having acquired some reputation, felt unusual Solicitude that my performance should not disappoint any expectations that might have existed. The doors of the Legislature were open and the House very full---;I had scarcely risen from my chair and addressed the Speaker, before all my thoughts were scattered and my power to recall them wholly gone. Confused and mortified, I had nothing left but to turn to my Colleague, who was sitting by me, and to ask him to take my place wh. he did and I sat down. Monroe went on and presented the views wh. he entertained on the subject. During his Speaking I rallied and recalled my scattered thoughts, became composed, and when Monroe finished, I again presented myself and went thro' my discourse without trepidation and to my own satisfaction.(3) Reprinted from King, Correspondence (King), 1:127. 1 King's memorandum concerns his appearance this day with James Monroe before the Pennsylvania Assembly, but internal evidence clearly indicates that it was written at a later date, certainly after the adoption of \""their present Const[itutio]n\"" (of 1790) which he mentions, and perhaps much later, as his expression of the purpose of the mission is somewhat confused. During his mission to Philadelphia with Monroe, King also wrote the following note, dated \""Saturday 9 Sept. 1786, City Tavern,\"" to Pennsylvania Council President Benjamin Franklin. \""Mr. King presents his respectful compliments to his Excellency B. Franklin Esq. and is extremely sorry that an engagement of Mrs. King's, not known to him yesterday, will deny him the Pleasure & Honor of complying with his engagement to dine with his Excellency on Thursday next.\"" Franklin Papers, PPAmP. 2 On July 27, 1786, Congress resolved to appoint a committee to draft an ordinance \""to carry into effect the system of impost recommended to the several states for their adoption,\"" which would be implemented as soon as New York approved the impost and Pennsylvania and Delaware made crucial revisions in their authorizing acts. And on August 11 Congress adopted the committee's recommendation to send a committee to confer with the Pennsylvania legislature---;\""to explain. . .the embarrassed state of the public finances, and to recommend. . .repeal [of] the clause in her Act granting the   impost, which suspends its operation until all the states shall have granted the supplementary funds.\"" King and Monroe were named to this committee on August 14. See JCC, 30:443--;44, 31:505n, 508, 511--;13, 515. The two apparently left New York for Philadelphia on September 6, the day Secretary Thomson recorded in his journal that Massachusetts was represented only by King's colleague Nathaniel Gorham (JCC, 31:638). A letter from King and Monroe (not found), enclosing a copy of the congressional resolution explaining their charge, was read to the Pennsylvania Assembly on September 11 and referred to a committee appointed to confer with them, and on the following day the assembly ordered that the two be received \""tomorrow.\"" The assembly journal for September 13 reports simply that King and Monroe \""made the communication with which they were charged from the Honorable the United States in Congress assembled,\"" but the following day a committee consisting of George Clymer, William Findley, Thomas FitzSimons, Robert Morris, John Smiley, Robert Whitehill, and Joseph Work, was appointed \""on the several papers relative to the mission of the committee of Congress.\"" The matter was concluded when the assembly adopted the following committee report and proposed resolution on September 21. \""That your committee have paid serious attention to the important facts which have been stated by the Honorable Delegates, and to the reasons and arguments which they have advanced, as well as to the measure recommended by the United States, and after mature consideration they are unanimously of opinion, that it is necessary to the welfare of these states, that speedy and effectual measures be taken for enabling the fOEderal government to perform their engagements. \""That an immediate compliance with the recommendation abovementioned would involve a breach of the faith of this state, pledged to the public creditors, citizens thereof, unless at the same time some further and other funds were provided for the payment of the interest due, and which shall become due to them. \""That it is impracticable for this House, now so near the period of its dissolution, to provide funds, or make any arrangements which may be necessary in order to comply with the recommendation of Congress. \""Your committee therefore propose the following resolution: \""Resolved, That it be, and it hereby is warmly and earnestly recommended to the next House of Assembly, to pay an early attention to the abovementioned resolution of Congress, and to take such measures as shall to them in their wisdom seem most expedient for supporting the faith of this commonwealth, and enabling the United States in Congress to perform their engagements.\"" See Minutes of the Third Session of the Tenth General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, DLC(ESR), pp. 300, 304, 306, 313, 315--;16; and PCC, item 69, 2:557--;60. 3 One eye witness of this day's proceedings, Philadelphia County assemblyman Henry Hill, later recorded the following observations on King's performance before the assembly. \""I lately had the pleasure of hearing Mr. King's harangue to our Assembly, on the Subject of the Commission with which he & Mr. Monro were charged by Congress. It was truely, to the best of my judgment adapted to insure applause even from an Attic Audience. \""Virginia appeared in the most advantageous light. Should her liberal support of the Union be Withdrawn, & Pennsylva. refuse her's---;he represented wth wonderful effect what would become of our State regulations---;of the renown of our heroes & patriots---;they wou'd all be swept away---;and utterly lost! \""The impression made on the House in favor of the point `supplicated' was remarkably tho' tacitly confess'd and had the Members individually been question'd on the Spot whether the impost should be granted without reserve no one doubts it would have succeeded. They chose however on cool deliberation to refer the important business to the next Assembly. Whether or not such a measure is practicable appears very doubtful.\"" Hill to George Washington, October 1, 1786, Washington Papers, DLC. September 15, 1786

 Sir, Duplicate New York Sepr. 15th. 1786. Your Excelly. will herewith receive the proceedings of Congress relative to the appointment & meeting of the federal court to terminate the territorial dispute between us and the State of Georgia which is fixed to be holden in this City on the third Monday in June next(1) ---;the reasons which have induced the determination of Congress to so distant a day and our conduct in this business we beg leave to detail. When the second Monday in May arrived, which was the day appointed for the agents to meet,(2) we had received no other information than our appointment as agents, and the act of the State under which the agents were appointed; which law also appointed commissioners for an amicable adjustment of the difference. The agents for Georgia did not arrive until the very morning of the day on which we were to appear.(3) From them we learned, that their legislature had adjourned a few days before the intention of our State for an amicable adjustment was known; but they had no doubt but their State would chearfully adopt the measure. Believing from the law of our State that it would be most agreable to our constituents, we agreed to postpone the business for one week, in hope of receiving further information on the subject, but none arriving & still holding the opinion that it would be most consonant to the wishes of our Legislature to have the matter amicably settled---;the Legislature of Georgia being also to meet in July, and having no doubt at that time that they would have coincided in opinion with our Legislature in having the matter determined by mutual agreement we consented to a further postponement until the first Monday in September. From this time we have exerted ourselves by every possible means to bring the matter to a speedy decision, by offering the agents of Georgia (first consulting the Council of our State on these points) to appoint the Judges in this City or its vicinity so that they might the sooner be convened, and of entering into an agreement with them relative to the admission of evidence & further offering them, as we could not agree on the day for holding the court, to leave that matter to Congress, as your Excelly. will perceive in the papers No. 1 & 2(4)---; but their State having made no arrangement for coming to trial by providing funds, delay became their duty & by not concurring with us in a day & proposing none earlier than May we were obliged having received no instructions on this head to adopt the only mode left us, that of an application to Congress. The reasons which appeared to us to operate with that body to determine as they have done were---; 1st. The act of our State appointing Commissioners for an amicable adjustment of the dispute and no official information that Georgia had not agreed to such mode. September 15, 1786  2d. The unprepared situation of Georgia---;for holding this court to be one of the greatest refinements of national policy, they conceived it necessary to give no cause to that State for complaint, as by hurrying them into a premature defence they might do, and thereby bring into dispute the decision of the court. 3d. The little hope there was of conveying information to & receiving acceptances from the gentlemen appointed, by so early a day as that we contended for.  Finding we could not obtain the day we so earnestly contended for we thought it best to get the time now mentioned, because that not only our own courts, but those of Pensylvania and Maryland will be over and as judges of both these States are on the court, there will be a greater prospect of their accepting & by that means bringing the matter to a decision. In prosecuting this business we take the liberty to mention to your Excellency we have not only found it very troublesome & fatiguing but entirely out of that line which our duty as delegates calls upon us to transact---;besides we are informed that those persons who have heretofore been appointed by States having territorial disputes, have always had an allowance made them adequate to their trouble---; added to which and it is with sorrow we mention it, the great loss in exchanging the paper of our State into money that will subsist us here has reduced our salarys as delegates so as to render it wholly inadequate to our maintenance---;the least loss that we have suffered being 25 pr Cent. Trusting that your Excellency will do whatever is right & proper and that you will be convinced that not only every exertion on our part has been but shall be made in the further prosecuting this matter, We have the honor to be, Your Excellencies Most Obt. hum.

 Sir Philadelphia 17 Sep. 1786 I am here on a committee from congress, soliciting the legislature on the subject of Revenue,(1) the Temper of the Times, and the systems of many of the States, are very unfavorable to the honest & just views of the United States. The Delegates from New York to the Annapolis convention passed through this place this morning on their return home---;from them I learn that Delegates from only Five States assembled at Annapolis, that the powers of even these Five were materially different; and that from a consideration of the small number of States which had sent Delegates, but more especially since the Authorities of the Delegates assembled were so essentially different, and the original proposition made by Virginia so far short of the Reform which is necessary, they had agreed in a recommendation to the states that a convention of Delegates should be held at Philadelphia in May next for the purpose of a general Revision of the confederation, and a Report to Congress, and also to the several Legislatures.(2) September 17, 1786  As the post leaves this city this Evening, I could not excuse myself in not communicating this information; probably however the Gentlemen from Massachusetts will by this post possess you of a more particular & circumstantial account, than it is in my power to transmit. Foreign nations had been notified of this convention, the Freinds to a good federal Government through these states looked to it with anxiety & Hope; the History of it, will not be more agreeable to the former, than it must be seriously painful to the latter.

The removal of his family to the southward, & his other necessary avocations having prevented his executing this business, and he being now unfortunately dead, it rests with his Executors to carry into effect, what he intended & wished to have done. I have conversed with Mr Rutledge on the subject, and he refers me to You. I am anxious that this work should be compleated, and that speedily, because I find, as the General intimated in his letter to Congress, that Officers who served under him have occasion to refer to his letters & papers, and for this purpose sundry applications have been made to this Office. But there is another motive which operates still more strongly. The regard I have for the memory of a Man who has performed such essential services to his country makes me most earnestly wish to preserve those documents which alone will enable some future historian to do justice to his merit, and transmit his fame to posterity. If You will think proper to send the papers to me, I will immediately arrange them, and employ a clerk to copy into books such as relate to the southern operations and You may rely that whatever may be found among them touching his own particular affairs shall be carefully preserved and returned.

 Sir, New York 28th Septr. [17]86 Permit your Delegates to address your Excellency in your official Character, and give you a short detail of the Business now before Congress, with some observations upon the present state of the Federal Government &ca., &ca. September 28, 1786  An important national matter which has for some time past engaged the attention of Congress will, probably soon come into public view. That body have now before them a report of a grand Committee for granting to your federal Government additional powers necessary to render it efficient, this, after the subject has undergone the necessary investigations, will be laid before the respective Legislatures.(1) An ordinance for the establishing a Colonial Government in the western territory is also nearly compleated;(2) as also for the establishment of a Mint for the United States,(3) with many other matters of less magnitude. Your Delegates wish to be informed whether the Accounts of the State against the U.S. are ready for adjustment, Mr Chinn having informed the Treasury board that they are not ready; nor can they be got ready for a long time.(4) As that Gentleman's Salary still goes on, your Delegates wish to be possessed of such official documents as may set that subject in its true point of view. It is highly necessary that all payments made by the State, to the federal Government, whether on Requisitions or otherwise, should be carried to its Credit on the books of the Treasury, therefore all these accomps ought, without loss of time, to be sent forward. Your Excellency will be made acquainted, by Congress, that no paper, emitted by the States, will answer federal purposes. Will not this evince it to be mistaken policy, in our Legislature, to order payments, for the late requisition, in their own paper currency?(5) When Gentlemen reflect, but for a moment, on the exhausted state of the federal treasury; that no monies are expected but what come in from requisitions on the different States; that these are either all stopped, or so slow in their operations, that nothing can be calculated upon with certainty; that the moment is arrived that our Credit with foreign powers is lost; that an enemy on our frontiers stands prepared to take every advantage of our prostrate situation; that an enemy more despicable is embarrassing our most beneficial commerce, and carrying our fellow cittizens into Slavery for life (about thirty at present being in that unhappy Situation)(6) does it require the spirit of prophecy to predict what will, & must inevitably be the consequence? Or will arguments be necessary to draw forth the most vigorous exertions of every friend to American Liberty, to arrest the sacred Palladium, & prevent our total ruin as a Nation? Amidst, however, these gloomy scenes, we have the pleasure to inform you that her Majesty of Portugal, has ordered a squadron of 5 Sail of Men of War to cruise at the mouth of the Straits for the protection of her trade; & that she has ordered her officers to give the same protection to the American flagg, as to her own; of this her Minister has given official information to Mr Adams at the Court of London.(7) An instance of Magnanimity this, which is worthy of imitation, & demands our grateful acknowledgemts., as we have nothing better to offer her in payment.  While foreign potentates take such an interested part in our favour, does it not call for unanimity & exertions at home, amongst every class of our Citizens to rescue the commonwealth from impending ruin? Should not these considerations reconcile the Mercantile and landed Interests in the State of Rhode-Island & produce a repeal of those penal Laws, which have already convulsed, & still threaten ruin to the State? It is now agreed by all that our federal Government is but a name; a meer shadow without any substance; and we think it our duty to inform the State that it is totally inefficient for the purposes of the Union; and that Congress, without being invested with more extensive powers, must prove totally nugatory. Should it be imagined that your Delegates, as individuals, wish for an increment of power, be assured that we hold ourselves servants of the State of Rhode Island, and in readiness to relinquish the exalted station in which you have placed us, & return with pleasure to the shade of retirement, provided we can see such a degree of energy infused into your federal Governmt. as may render it adequate to the great ends of its original Institution. We need not, Sir, inform you how it wounds our feelings, in every company, as well as in the Gazette's to hear & see the proceedings of our Legislature burlesqued and ridiculed; and to find that Congress and all men of sober reflection reprobate, in the strongest terms, the principles which actuate our administration of Governmt. We are Citizens of Rhode Island & are most sensibly affected with every thing which militates to the dishonour of the State. Your Delegates further beg leave to observe that if those measures are continued, which have, for the last six months been pursued, in their opinion they will infallibly terminate in the ruin of the State; & have no inconsiderable share in the subversion of the Union. We conclude, by observing that the necessary supplies for our support are expected, & will be provided by the Legislature, as we greatly need them, while we have The Honour to be, Your Excellency's Most obedient and Most humble Servts., James Manning Nathan Miller ""

The instr[uc]tion for a negociation with Spain has employd oure time principally ever since the 10th of August Last. The perticulars is confinde to secresy, which gives me great uneasiness, we have (that is the minority) endeavour'd to have the injunction of secresy taken of, so far, as to communicate the perticulars to the Executives of oure States, but could not obtain Leave,(2) & I was oblig'd to suppress a letter which I had wrote on the subject, in confidence of obtaining Leave to communicate the perticulars to Youre Excellency. This being the situation of affairs & not willing to forfiet my honour in Violating the rules of the house, have Long omitted writing any thing. The utmost warmth has appeard on this occation from each party, the Divition are seven states for the measure, & five against, & the Majority appears Determined to carry on the treaty at all events, & the minority as firmly fixt to oppose it in all its Stages, except Instructed to the contrary by their Different States. For my own part I think the president [precedent] Dangerous to the Liberties of the southern States. If seven states can barter any part of the Priveledges of the Different States, for any advantage whatsoever, there remains no security for any possession. It is wel known that the ballance of Power is now in the Eastern States, & they appear determined to keep it in that Direction.

 [September ? 1786](1) There is indeed a considerable degree of resemblance between epidemical Diseases and popular Opinions---;both appear from time to time to prevail for a while and gradually wear out. The prejudice against Lawyers is one of those Opinions which rages in America(2) ---;it formerly raged in England also, so much so that on one occasion they were excluded from Parliament, but the People thence as they will also do here returned to their Senses, and that Parliament has ever since been branded with the Epithet of the lacks learning Parliament, and Lord Coke who was certainly a very good Judge observes that in this Parliament not one good Law was made. It is to be observed that in free Countries where property is protected the Laws regulating property must necessarily be numerous and intricate as to render the profession necessary---;it is a consequence of freedom and a price paid for that enviable situation and who would not pay it chearfully? In despotic Countries indeed, as there is no property there is no need for them, as a knowledge of the principles upon which Laws ought to be founded might be troublesome to the Prince who has reduced everything to the measure of his Will they are not suffered. It has been said, that in Prussia under the great Frederic who tho a most despotic Prince certainly loved his People and did much for the happiness of his Kingdom, there was but one Lawyer. It was his natural disposition to which the People were indebted for all the good he did them, and not to the Laws. The Controul they must have established over himself  October 1, 1786  was sufficient to prevent the Study of them. What has not France [. . .] of one owed to her Parliaments which were composed entirely of Lawyers. How much has the World been indebted to her Montesquieu, and will Americans forget that to the [advice?] given by her illustrious law Characters when the insidious designs of Britain found other Subjects enow to Countenance and assist in fastning the Chains they had prepared, the Liberty we now enjoy and a place among the Nations of the Earth was principally owing(3) ""

 Dear Genl. [October 1? 1786](1) I have not written to you for a long time having nothing important or agreable to communicate. Nor have I now any thing agreable, but alas the reverse. The commotions which have for some time past distracted the two eastern states, have risen in Massachusetts to an alarming height. In New Hampshire the firmness of their President the late General Sullivan has dissipated the troubles in that state.(2) I enclose a full narration of his decided conduct, and the effects which it produced.(3) But affairs are in a very different situation in Massachusetts. After various insults to government, by stopping the courts of Sussex &c, the insurgents have in a very formidable shape taken possession of the town of Springfield, at which place the supreme court was sitting. The friends to government arrayed under the Militia general of the district Shephard in support [of] the court, but their exertions were not effectual. The court removed and broke up, the insurgents continue possessed, of the town & General Shepherd has retired to the United states Arsenal one mile from Springfield. This Arsenal contains a very important share of our munitions of war. Congress have sent their secretary of this department, General Knox, to take the best measures in his power in concert with government for the safety of the Arsenal. What renders the conduct of the insurgents more alarming is, that they behave with decency & manage with system, they are encamped and reg- October 1, 1786  ularly supplied with provisions by their friends & have lately given orders to the delegates in Assembly from their particular towns, not to attend the meeting of the Legislature. It must give you pleasure to hear in this very distressing scene, the late officers & soldiers are on the side of government unanimously. The Insurgents it is said are conducted by a Captain of the late army, who continued but a small period in service & possessed a very reputable character.(4) This event produces much suggestion as to its causes. Some attribute it to the weight of taxes and the decay of commerce, which has produced universal idleness. Others, to British Councils the vicinity of Vermont & the fondness for novelty which always has & ever will possess more or less influence on man. The next accounts will I hope produce favorable intelligence, but present appearances do not justify this hope. Has your china arrived, & does it please Mrs Washington. Be pleased to present my best respects to her & accept the repitition of my unceasing regard with which, I have the honor to be most sincerely, Your ob ser,  Henry Lee Junr. ""

 Dear Sir, New York 2. Oct. 1786 The convention proposed to have been held at Annapolis in the last month on the subject of commerce has terminated without credit, or prospect of having done much good. I inclose you the report which they addressed to their constituents(1) ---;they were founded in the Opinion that an adjustment of the commercial powers of the several States is intimately connected with the other Authorities of the Confederacy and of the respective states. Whether the States will acceed to the proposition of a convention at Philadelphia in May is yet uncertain. Congress I think will not interfere in such manner as to patronize the project; I am fully convinced  October 2, 1786  that Your Opinion is a just and political one, that congress can do all that a convention can, and certainly with more safety to original principles.(2) But we are now separating, the federal year will expire in a few weeks, and little public business will receive an examination before the assembling of the next congress.

I have it in contemplation to move to day that the report from Annapolis be referr'd to a Committee.(1) I am persuaded the Eastern States will not grant an unlimited commission, but wod. accede to it if its objects were defind, or rather this is the language of those whom they have here.(2) We mov'd that the injunction of secrecy be taken off & that each delegation be at liberty to communicate the proceedings on a certain subject to their legislature, which was negativ'd.

 Dr Sir, New York 3 Oct. 1786 You will undoubtedly hear much of the tumultuous and irregular conduct of a considerably numerous class of people in the western counties of Massachusetts. The same temper which appears to have collected these illegal Assemblies in Massachusetts, has shewn itself in New Hampshire, but General Sullivan, who is now President of that State, by very proper and decisive Measures has put an End to these unjustifiable proceedings in that country.(1) Perhaps in Massachusetts, considering the prostrate situation of our commerce, the Government have pressed the subject of Taxes, of the direct Kind, beyound what prudence would authorise; the amount of Taxes laid on the Citizens of that State, in one form and another, and for the purposes of the Union, the State, the counties, & towns, including the support of the  October 4-13, 1786  Clergy & the town schools, in the course of the year 1786, will not be less than the sum of One Million & a Half of Dollars; the whole of this Sum, excepting about 250, or, 300 Thousand Dollars which are raised by Imposts & Excises, must be raised from the People by an immediate and direct apportionment upon the Polls & Estates of the Inhabitants. Perhaps this Apportionment may be nearly equal to One third part of the Rents or income of the Estates of all the Inhabitants.(2) The operation of these heavy Taxes, in connection with the pressure of the Creditors upon their Debtors for their private Demands has occasioned an Opposition to the judicial Courts in the Counties of, Middlesex, Bristol, Worcester, Hampshire & Berkshire; and the Opposition has been so considerable that in some of these counties, the lower court has been obliged to adjourn without doing any Business. The General Court are now sitting, and without Doubt they will pursue such Measures as shall redress all the real Greivances of the People, and establish the honor and Energy of our Government. You will see this business greatly magnified, and Tories may rejoice. But all will be well.  With sincere Respect, Dr. Sir, Your Ob. & very Hbl. Servt., Rufus King  ""

 [October 11, 1786](1) Mr. King stated, That though our Delegates had been unsuccessful in their efforts to procure a redemption of the old continental bills of credit, as instructed,(2) yet their exertions had been productive of such measures as, by pressing the other States to pay in their quotas, had procured a market for a part of the surplus of those bills, which had rested on the good people of this Commonwealth. That the expences of the Penobscot expedition had not yet been allowed by Congress from the following causes---;the demands from the southern part of the Continent against the Union, were chiefly by individuals. The governments there, during the ravages of the enemy, were more deranged than those at the northward, and for that reason, greater exertions had been made by particular citizens. These demands not being supported by vouchers, and being thought exorbitant, had been held in some measure inadmissible. And it had now become a condition by their Representatives in Congress, that the expences of the Penobscot expedition should be allowed or not, as those demands were admitted or rejected. But that there was nevertheless a great prospect of those expences being allowed, as the southern States had taken the debts of their own citizens upon themselves, and though this had been an embarrassing circumstance in making requisitions, yet the States would probably agree, and then our expences would be more advantageously adjusted than they could have been at any past time, or in any other mode. October 11, 1786  That the delays in settling the accounts between the several States and the United States had been retarded by the same causes, but would now probably issue equally favourable to Massachusetts. This, it was to be hoped, would ease the minds of those citizens, who supposed that their burthen from unequal exertions was neglected by Congress. That the alloy and value of coins having been established by Congress, a mint would probably be soon erected,(3) and a coin with an American impression relieve the citizens under their distresses arising from the want of money. That the demands of sundry individuals for property taken by British Commanders,(4) the subject of the eastern boundary of Massachusetts,(5) and the insolent conduct of a late navy Officer to our Chief Magistrate, had been before the British Ministry.(6) The latter business had been noticed in a manner suitable to the dignity of this State. As to the matter of interest due to British subjects, Mr. King observed, that nothing final had been accomplished, but much attention had been paid in England to American acts which were said (and of them which postponed the payments of British debts were justly said) to be breaches of this part of the treaty. But the treaty was the law of the land, and there could not be a question that the peculiarity of the situation of the two countries justified the wishes of Americans, as to witholding interest during the war. Juries had a right to determine the question, and this would render legislative interference unnecessary. That the report of the Commercial Convention was before Congress.(7) The Hon. Gentleman observed, that doubts had arisen as to the mode of agreeing upon commercial regulations. The Confederation was the act of the people. No part could be altered but by consent of Congress and confirmation of the several Legislatures. Congress therefore ought to make the examination first, because if it was done by a convention, no Legislature could have a right to confirm it. Did any Legislature sit for such purpose? No. It must be referred to the people, and then what degree of assent was necessary to make it an article of the confederation? whereas if it was conducted agreeably to the confederation, no such difficulty would exist. Besides, if Congress should not agree upon a report of a convention, the most fatal consequences might follow. Congress therefore were the proper body to propose alterations. That the federal Treasury afforded a most melancholly prospect. Decency forbid his making any observations upon the supplies from this Commonwealth, but as to the other States it was a fact, that South-Carolina had paid no monies for three years. Virginia and Maryland indeed had supplied liberally, and Pennsylvania with exactitude, but New Jersey had done little and New-York   had exerted herself but lately. The last two years not 500,000 dollars had been received, a sum scarcely more than adequate to the ordinary charge of government. It has become a subject of admiration how Government existed. From foreign loans nothing was to be expected; the gleanings of these had hitherto kept things along. But what were to become of our demands from foreigners? the French Crown no doubt would be, as it had been, magnanimous; the Spanish debt was small; but our creditors in Holland were not to be put off. Educated in the science of money matters, they held every man as much bound as though he had sealed his obligation, and all property would alike be exposed to their reprisals. So melancholly was the state of the federal treasury, that all men seemed to turn away from it, as an evil which admitted of no remedy. If all the States could be brought into the Continental Impost, this resource indeed might be anticipated, and the national credit strengthened in that way, but there remained two States which had not acceded to it, Pennsylvania and New-York. The situation of the former was known, and should that State be brought over, New- York would not dare longer to oppose the Union. That as to the domestick debt, it had been urged that the people were not able to pay it; but there were not wanting means of reducing it in a short time. At any rate the great Representative Body of the States would never disgrace themselves by any dishonest measures relative to the securities. There were good grounds for the creditors to entertain a confidence of this. The State of New-York had already collected their proportion into their treasury; and Pennsylvania had done more. They had assumed the debt due to individuals, by the sale of their lands, and otherwise, and they would not fail, therefore, to enforce an honourable payment of this debt---; The means which Congress possessed to extinguish it, were not trifling. Their lands were now almost ready to be sold; near 3,000,000 of acres would be surveyed by November next, and purchases were eagerly sought after. That, in short, if America had any virtue left, she might yet be happy. Her resources from the impost duty, and her lands, would very soon relieve her from her burthens. Near half a million of dollars might in a short time be applied from the duty, to sinking the domestick debt, and this fund would in a few years be nearly adequate to extinguishing the whole. But the honourable Gentleman observed, that there was an evil in publick affairs, infinitely greater than any he had mentioned. It was not, perhaps, immediately within the order, under which he had the honour to stand before that house; but so serious were the effects which it seemed to him must follow, that considerations of duty to the Legislature, and to his country, had emboldened him to mention it. The house, to be sure, would anticipate, that he spoke of the commo  tions now existing in Massachusetts. This was viewed by Congress, as the most important subject that ever came before that respectable assembly. Every member considered himself as personally interested in it. He realized his life, liberty and property, as involved in the issue of their decisions. There was a league subsisting between the States of America, to oppose every force that should arise against either of them. The United States would not be inactive on such an occasion. They were concerned---;deeply concerned, in the result. If such a barrier was removed, every other government would eventually be swept away. Let numbers be compared; if government had only a minority, let it be remembered, that they had a majority of every State in the Union, to join them. It ought not to be concealed, that the British Packet had been dispatched a day earlier, merely in consequence of the commotions which had happened with us. Advantages might be taken of the divided state of the people, to bring about measures which otherwise could never be effected by the enemies of our country. When Congress should know this; when they should see government prostrated in the dust, what would be their feelings? They were not authorized to see any government subverted. If the Speaker had been too earnest on this subject, he requested the pardon of the house, as he spoke from a fear least palliatives might be adopted where vigour was required. The Honourable Gentleman then read several private letters from a gentleman in office, at a foreign Court,(8) to confirm the sentiments which he had advanced.

 My dear Genl Newyork 11h. Ocr. [17]86 In the full confidence you receive my letters as testimonials of my unceasing respect, and from a solicitude to acquaint you with all mate- October 11, 1786  rial contingencys in the administration of our national affairs, that you may be able to form your judgement on authentic documents, and consequently that your opinions being bottomed on truth may not fail to produce the most beneficial effects to our country, I again address you, and mean to confine myself to one subject, which will I apprehend soon become the topic of public debate. Among the defects which degrade the constitution of the fOEderal gOEvernment is the physical impossibility of secrecy in the sovereignty, therefore it is often necessary to make confidential communications, when they serve to correct the circulation of erroneous informations on subjects of national concern which in their nature is secret, but from the cause just mentioned become public. Considering myself therefore at full liberty to give you a history of this business, I will do it with brevity. We are told here that the decided difference which prevailed in Congress on the proposed treaty with Spain is generally understood in every part of the Union, and it is suggested that the project of the treaty will become the subject of deliberation in the Assembly of Virga. True it is that this affair unfortunately produced an intemperance common in democratic bodys & always impervious to the interest of the public; for to judge wisely on systems & measures, the mind ought to be free from prejudice & warmth, and influenced by a full deliberate view of the general effects of such system & measures. The eastern states consider a commercial connexion with Spain, as the only remedy for the distresses which oppress their citizens, most of which they say flow from the decay of their commerce. Their delegates have consequently zealously pressed the formation of this connexion, as the only effectual mode to revive the trade of their country. In this opinion they have been joined by two of the middle states. On the other hand, Virginia has with equal zeal opposed the connection, because the project involves expressly the disuse of the navigation of the Mississippi for a given time, & eventually they think will sacrifice our right to it. The delegation is under instructions from the state on this subject. They have acted in obedience to their instructions & myself excepted in conformity to their private sentiments. I confess that I am by no means convinced of the justice or policy of our instructions & very much apprehend, unless they are repealed by the present Assembly the fatal effects of discord in council will be experienced by the U. States in a very high degree. The project submitted by the secretary for foreign affairs was founded as well as I can recollect on the following principles---; 1st. The commerce between the U.S. & the King of Spain to be founded on the principles of perfect reciprocity, which reciprocity to be diffused in all the sub-regulations. 2d. The trade to be confined to his Catholic Majestys European dominions.  3d. The bona fide manufactures & produce of the respective countrys imported into either, to be subject to the same dutys as are paid by the citizens and subjects of the two Nations. 4h. A Tariff to be established by convention within one year after the ratification of the treaty ascertaining the necessary dutys, to be imposed. 5th. Mast & timber annually requisite for the Navy of Spain to be bought from the Merchants of the U. States in preference, provided they are equal in price and quality.  There are some other matters which I forget. In consideration of the advantages of this treaty the US stipulate to forbear for the term of the treaty the use of the river M. The boundarys will be (in case of treaty) established as fixed in the definitive treaty of peace between the U States and G. Britain. The article of tobacco is excepted in the project being the produce of Spanish colonies & is to continue on the present footing, which is favorable.  Thus have I delineated to You the outlines of the proposed plan. Among the many arguments used by the advocates for the treaty I will mention only one which I think ought to be known. They say that the right of the navigation of the M, is disputed, that the use of that right is now suspended & cannot be possessed, but by force, or by treaty; and that a forbearance of the use on our part, is a confirmation of our right, the use of which right will be in due time possessed in consequence of the present project without putting our claim to the issue of war, which is always precarious, & for which we are totally unprepared. Should this matter come before our Assembly, much will depend on Mr. Masons sentiments.  So many reasons founded on true policy will arise in a full investigation of this subject, that I cannot but hope that the state of Virginia will consider a treaty with Spain on the principles of the project, essentially necessary to her political happiness, and to her commercial aggrandizement. The sedition in Massachusetts is in some degree subsided, but is not I fear extinguished. Col. Monroe who was an aid in Lord Stirlings family, a delegate from Virginia in Congress will in a few days return home with his lady. He means to do himself the honor to pay his respects to Mount-Vernon in his way. My best respects to Mrs. Washington: with the most affectionate attachment I have the honor to be your h. ser., Henry Lee Junr. ""

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 12. 1786. Since my last I have receiv'd yours of the 9 of July.(1) I advis'd you therein of the progress that had been made by {Mister Jay}(2) in the {Spanish negociation}, that he had brought {a project before Congress for shutting the Mississippi} and {not} for {opening it} for the term of {twenty five} or {thirty years} combin'd with some {commercial stipulations}, the latter to be the price of the former; although admitted they {opened} no new {port} nor admitted us {into} those now {open upon better terms than} those we {now enjoyed}. Since this {project} was presented, the {negociation} has been more {with Congress} to {repeal the ultimata} than {with Spain} to carry {the instructions} into effect. I inform'd you of the proposition from {Massachusetts} for the repeal in  October 12, 1786  Committee of the Whole. This was carried by {Pennsylvania} inclusive {eastward, Maryland} inclusive {southward} being agnst it. {Delaware} was {absent}. In the house we mov'd to postpone the report of the Committee in order to take up propositions to the following effect. {That the negotiation} as to the {Mississippi} & {the boundaries} be taken out of the hands of the {Secretary and committed} to {Carmichael}. The following points to be agreed on there & afterwards concluded here. 1st that {New Orleans} be made {an entrepot} for {exports}---;that they be shipp'd thence {in the bottoms of America, Spain} & {France} under the regulations of each party. 2d. that they pay at sd. port a duty of 2Â½ pr. centm. ad valorem to {the crown} of {Spain} as a compensation for port duties. 3d. That {imports} be {prohibited}. 4th. that the instructions of Annapolis be reviv'd as {the basis of a treaty} of {commerce}. 5th. that two additional {commissioners} be {appointed} with equal {powers} with {the secretary} to conclude the same. Upon this there was precisely the same division. The question was then taken on the report & carried by 7 states. Upon this the following proposition was mov'd, \""is the repeal constitutionally carried by 7 states so as to give a new instruction materially different from the former\"" & set aside by the previous question. We are told he will proceed, but of this have no certain information. It is extraordinary he {should have taken} up {the} subject of {trade} as powers upon principles that applied to all {nations alike} had already been given under a commission which had at the time his were, near one year to run to {form a treaty with Spain}, wh. were not repeal'd by these nor the subject mention'd except by a distant implication. I do suspect the business rests for the present untill the new {Delegates} take their seats, in which case {he} will be govern'd by circumstances. I suspect the point will ultimately be carried, but this is yet doubtful. I forgot above to mention the {negotiation was} to have been carried on in our propositions under {the mediation} of {France}. I sit out tomorrow for Virginia(3) with Mrs. Monroe by land. My residence will be for the present in Fredericksburg. My attention is turn'd to Albemarle for my ultimate abode. The sooner I fix there the more agreeable it will be to me. I shod. be happy to keep clear of the bar if possible & at present I am wearied with the business in wh. I have been engag'd. It has been a year of excessive labor & fatigue & unprofitably so. What you find in the journals, especially the regulation of the coin, pass'd upon the report of the Bd. of treasury without examination, or with very little.(4) Our minds were generally at the time otherwise engag'd. Mr. Madison and myself have been desirous if possible of forming an engagment for land in this State {which would hereafter put us at ease}. He promis'd me {to advise you} of it, {and to} tell you of our little plan. If {it were an object with you(5) to your property} in my estimation a better opportunity cannot present itself.

 Sir New York 14th of October 1786. In compliance with the request of the Honourable the Corporation of the College at Providence in the State of Rhode Island, transmitted in their vote of the 7th of September last, we take the liberty to inform your Excellency that the College under their direction was founded in the year 1764, and received the small endowments of which it is now possessed, solely, from the beneficence & contributions of individuals, the Government not being sufficiently impressed with an idea of the importance of Literature to afford its Patronage, or lend it any further assistance than that of granting it a Charter. With these small beginnings, however, at the commencement of the late war, the Corpora October 14, 1786  tion had the pleasure to see that beautiful Edifice, erected on the hill at Providence, and upwards of forty students matriculated, together with a large Latin School, as a necessary to supply it with Scholars. The whole of the College endowments consisted of one Thousand Pounds Lawful money as a fund, with six Acres of Land adjoining it. At that period the young Institution was rapidly growing in reputation, as well as in number of Scholars, but on the arrival of the enemy in that State, in the year 1776 it was seized by the public for the use of Barracks and an Hospital for the American Army, and continued to be so occupied until a little before the arrival of the Armaments of his Most Christian Majesty at Rhode Island when it was again taken out of the hands of the Corporation by an order of government, and delivered up to our Allies for the same uses to which it had been applied by the American Army; and they held it till their Army marched for the Chesepeak. To accommodate the Building to their wishes they made great alterations, highly injurious to the designs of its founders: this with the damages done to it by the Armies of both nations, while so occupied, subjected the Corporation to great expence to repair it; and that when the deranged state of our finances prevented us from making scarcely any advantage of the Interest of our little fund, in the State Treasury. Having, at their own expence made these repairs they applied first to the Legislature of the State, and afterwards repeatedly to Congress for some compensation, but have not been able to obtain the least. Thus circumstanced they think it their duty to solicit the patronage of his Most Christian Majesty, in the manner they have done in the memorial which accompanies this letter.(1) We have the pleasure to inform your Excellency that there are now upwards of fifty students belonging to the College, with flattering prospects of an increase. The aforegoing is a brief account of the origin and present state of the College at Providence. We only beg leave to add, that this Institution embraces in its bosom, and holds out equal priviledges to all denominations of Protestants. And its Corporation, agreeably to Charter, is, and must forever be composed of some of all Denominations of Christians.

 Sir New-York October 16. 1786 Since the delegation wrote you Congress have passed an Ordinance for organizing the Indian Department and taken such measures as will in their opinion extend to the frontiers regular and certain security against the future designs of the indians. Mr. White appointed Superintendant for the southern district left this on Saturday under their directions to proceed immediately to Georgia in the execution of the duties of his office. The Georgia legislature have laid their proceedings respecting indian affairs before Congress, and should They seriously enter into a war with the Creek nation we are to hope none of our citizens will be subject to the effect of their hostility. The Ordinance has been already transmitted by the Secretary.(1) On the 2d of August Congress passed a requisition for the supplies of the present year in which our state is called upon for 103,015 dollars in indents and 139,017 in specie---;a proviso is made in favour of the state so far as to allow her a partial credit in consequence of her supplies in 1782 & 1783 it is in these words---; \""provided that so far as relates to the State of South Carolina, this Requisition be considered as including one million of dollars, being that part of the Requisition of the 30 October 1781 which hath heretofore remained uncalled for, so far as to entitle the said state to the benefit of paying the same in such manner as she was entitled to pay her quota of the said requisition.\""(2) This will give us a partial, but not compleat credit on the amount of our supplies. Congress contend that the agreement with the Superintendant extended only to our quota of the Requisition of the 30 October 1781 for 8 Millions and that the excess of supplies beyond that proportion, must be carried to our general account. We asserted and endeavoured to establish the whole, but without effect and its settlement must be left to be adjusted between them and our legislature. We think the claim founded in justice and that an application to have credit on the requisition might be proper on this occasion. On the 9th of August Congress passed a resolution recommending to the states of North Carolina, South Carolina & Georgia to cede their claims to western territory for the use of the US(3)---;if this is done both on the parts of Georgia and South Carolina it will supercede the necessity of a federal court should the present amicable intentions of the two states in accommodating the same by commissioners not succeed---;the federal court is appointed to meet on the third Monday in June and several of the judges have accepted and agreed to attend at that time.(4) Should an accommodation in the interim take place, your Excellency will be so obliging as to give us the earliest information upon the subject. The agents on the part of our state have already  October 16, 1786  detailed their proceedings so fully respecting this business that it is only necessary for us to refer you to their letter of the 14 ultimo. The mode of settling the accounts between the US & individual states being found ineffectual by keeping commissioners in each state at the present expensive establishment, on Thursday last Congress passed an Ordinance erecting a board of three commissioners for this purpose to commence on the first of April next, at which time the power of the present commissioners expires.(5) The authorities of this board will exceed theirs, but are not in our opinion sufficiently equitable and extensive to cover the claims of the southern states arising from their assumptions---;but as there seems a disposition to bring these long and complicated accounts to a settlement as soon as their situation will admit, we trust that by the time our accounts are brought before them their powers will be so enlarged as to include such an authority as we concieve alone competent to this end. A copy of this Ordinance is sent by this Opportunity as also of one for establishing a Mint for the US passed yesterday and which will commence it's Operation as soon as the necessary Apparatus can be prepared.(6) This will be done as soon as it conveniently can. A report has just been made to the house by the Secretary for the department of foreign affairs on the subject of Lord Carmarthen's answer to Mr. Adams's memorial demanding the posts & complaining of an infraction of the treaty by Great-Britain.(7) This report recapitulates the infractions on our part by the acts of the different legislatures respecting debt & recommends such measures as are proper upon the subject in his opinion. This and the treaty with Spain will probably be the subject of much discussion in the new Congress to commence in November, the present being too nearly expired to admit their being discussed at this time. We shall always be glad to hear from you and remain with respect Your Excellency's obedient servants. John Kean D. Huger John Bull John Parker Charles Pinckney [P.S.] The Secretary will always transmit the journals & other proper communications ex officio. Major Pinckney will deliver you the recommendation respecting the paying our officers some months pay in 1782 and 1783 which please to lay before the legislature.(8) ""

 Sir, New York 18th. October 1786 I have to acknowledge the Receipt of your Excellency's Letter of the 10th Instant. Time will not at present permit me to make any Observations on the Subjects therein mentioned. The immediate Object of giving you the Trouble of this is a fresh Communication from the Eastward which represents the State of Massachusets as in a most dangerous & critical Situation;(1) the Danger indeed extends immediatly to all the Eastern States and the Consequences cannot be unimportant to the other States in the Union. Till very lately the Insurrections in Massachusets were considered as the ebulitions of Discontent arising from the transient Inconveniences they suffer from the Stagnation of Commerce & the other usual Effects of changing from the diffusive  October 18, 1786  circulation of Money in War to the Habits of Frugality and Oeconnomy adapted to Peace. But the Discontents now assume a more alarming Aspect, and take Root in a variety of Causes which were hardly supposed to have Existence in America. A total Abolition of all Debts both public and Private, and even a general Distribution of Property, are not without Advocates. Men who have respectable Standings & Characters & possessed of decent Shares of Property are said to countenance the general Insurgency tho' they avowedly claim less Reform (as they call it) than the others, but even they propose to reliquidate the public Debts & then pay them off in a Paper Money to be created without Funds & to make it a legal Tender. Strange as it may appear, it is said that five Counties containing more than half the Free men of the State have large Majorities, & some are almost unanimous in the Measures of Insurgency. It is conjectured, & the Conjecture is founded in at least plausible Circumstances, that foreign Influence has no little weight in their Councils---;that they have a great Degree of Systematic Order in their Measures, and are ready on an Alarm to come forth an organized Army of not less than 10,000 Men armed & Officered. Whether these alarming Circumstances are magnified or not Time must discover, but these Communications are from high Authority. Prudence however requires that they be made a discreet use of. Your Excellency's known Prudence & Judgment can only justify me in the Communication I am now making, & at present I trust you will not extend it as it is under a Seal of Secrecy in Congress. Some Resolutions will probably issue for an Augmentation of Troops, the Reasons assigned for which may be our Intelligence respecting the Western Indians; but in Fact this Augmentation seems to be necessary to the preservation of interior Government. I write in too much Haste to be accurate or correct but on such an Occasion your Excellency will excuse Blemishes of this Kind. The Wisdom of the most experienced is not too much for a Crisis of this Kind, I shall therefore hope for some Observations on the subject from Your Excellency. The last Minute of the Post hour is arrived. I must therefore only say that with perfect Respect I am, Your Excellency's most obt. Servt., Cha. Pettit ""

 My dear sir. New York 19th. Ocr. [17]86 In our letter of this date to the Assembly(1) you will know our sentiments on the interesting subject of finance. I am persuaded if the suggestions meet the approbation of the Legislature and any plans calculated on the principles of our letter, should be properly executed much good will accrue to the state. We omitted one subject which involves the respectability of our country viz that of a well disciplined & well appointed militia. This matter having been under consideration very often & meeting with different issues, we have declined renewing it now, presuming that the difficultys which did obstruct the formation of a proper system are still alive, & will continue to operate with similar effect. But really when we look around us here, & observe the exertions in these countrys to acquire this national defence, we lament the indifference which pervades our country on this important subject. I transmit for the perusal of those who wish information on military arrangements the report of the secretary of war relative to the organization of Militia.(2) This performance does honor to the genius of the secretary, but its utility depends entirely on the execution, which in the situation of American affairs we apprehend will be subject to much difficulty. The eastern commotions are becoming very serious, Massachusetts contains 75,000 men from 16 to 60, the five seditious countys possess 40,000 of this number, upon a fair calculation I beleive we may reckon that state divided for & against Government.(3) The legislature is now in session but have taken no measures yet to reconcile or to subdue. Indeed their difficultys are so numerous and pressing and their ways & means so disproportionate that I imagine they know not what to do, & will be obliged to trust too much to the chapter of accidents, for the U.S. who ought to be able to aid the governments of particular states in distresses like these are scar[c]ely able to maintain themselves. The insurgents are taking all the necessary arrangements to prepare for the last appeal, their ostensible object is the revision of the constitution, but they certainly mean the abolition of debts public & private, a division of property & a new government founded on principles of fraud & inequity, or re-connexion with G.B. Congress have received authentic information touching these points and are October 19, 1786  now in consultation how to ward off the blow. The enclosed papers will inform of many particulars relative to this unhappy affair. You continued a long time in Philada. we hear, this unexpected movement gives lye to various suggestions all tending to prove that you are in full gallop to the blessed yoke.

 Sir New York 19 [i.e., 20] Oct. 1786(1) On my arrival here I found congress deeply impressed with the Danger arising from a very extensive combination of savages from Georgia to the Frontiers of Pensylvania. The States bordering upon the Ohio & the Mississippi will exert themselves for the safety of their Citizens; but these exertions may not be so efficient as the welfare of so many citizens as will be exposed to the Cruelties of an indian war may demand; Congress therefore this day resolved to augment the federal forces to a legionary Corps consisting of two thousand men including artillery and cavalry.(2) As the legislature on a former Occasion expressed their desire of furnishing their Quota of any future demand for Troops, we willingly acceeded to the wishes of congress on this occasion, and consented that a large proportion of the men proposed to be raised should be recruited in Massachusetts. The Infantry and artillery are quotaed upon the four Eastern States viz New Hampshire 260 Massachusetts 660 Rh. Island 120 Connecticut 180 1220 The Cavalry amounting to 120, or two troops, are equally quotaed upon Maryland & Virginia---;As the survey, sale, and actual settlement of the federal lands west of the Ohio are objects of the highest consideration, more especially as they stand connected with the payment of the domestic Debt, the Troops intended to be raised must necessarily remain some Time in Service. Congress have therefore proposed the  October 20, 1786  Term of three years unless sooner discharged. This period corresponds with the Time of service of the troops now on the Ohio---; some detail arrangements are wanting to complete this act; I hope they will be executed tomorrow, and immediately forwarded to your Excellency---;With perfect Respect I have the Honor to be Sir, yr.

 Dear Gerry New York 19 [i.e., 20] Oct. 1786(1) I mentioned to you my apprehensions of a very dangerous and extensive indian war---;on my return here(2) I found my fears but too well founded, Georgia & Virginia are in arms. The protection of the Citizens of the states bordering upon the Ohio is required of congress. You know that we have entertained well founded expectations of discharging a large portion of the federal domestic Debt by the sales of the western Lands; the Indians now appear to have united to oppose the survey and Settlement of that country; this combination is most unjust, since we have fairly and bona fide extinguished their claims. The monies expended in Treaties with, and presents to, these very indians, since the year 1775 will exceed a hundred Thousand specie Dollars. This is too much to lose. To do ourselves justice and protect the Frontiers together with the surveys of the indian Cessions, congress this day resolved to augment the federal Troops to a legionary Corps to consist of two thousand Men. The cavalry amounting to one hundred and twenty men are quotaed on Maryland and Virginia, the infantry & Artillery are quotaed upon the four Eastern states. viz New Hamp 260 Massa 660 R Island 120 Cont 180 1280(3) The Troops now in service are from Pensylvania, N. Jersey, New York & Connecticut; when these men were raised our Legislature, not being called on for any part of them, passed an instruction to their Delegates that in case any more men should be required, that the Legislature would choose to furnish their quota. We therefore met the wishes of congress in agreeing that our quota of the Troops now  October 20, 1786  required should stand so large a proportion of the whole number. The Act is not quite completed; I hope it will be forwarded on Saturday or Monday. But you must impress upon the minds of our monied friends the indispensable necessity of a Loan of monies upon an engagement of congress of a reimbursement from existing Requisitions or some other Funds.(4) Adieu, R King ""

 Dear sir Ocr. 20h. N. York [17]86 I have the pleasure of your ler. from Baltimore on your return from Annapolis. Your polite communication of my instrumentality to your & your ladys happiness by introducing you to my old friend Smallwood was highly satisfactory. Your narrative of the proceedings of the convention at Annapolis was followed in a few days by a letter from the chairman to the president of Congress.(1) With difficulty the friend[s] to the system adopted by the convention induced Congress to commit your report, altho all were truely sensible of the respect manifested by the convention to this body, and all zealous to accomplish the objects proposed by the authors of the commercial convention. Indeed their conviction of the inadequacy of the present fOEderal government render them particularly zealous to amend & strengthen it. But different opinions prevail as to the mode; some think with the Annapolis meeting, others consider Congress not only the constitutional but the most eligible body to originate & propose necessary amendments to the confederation, and others prefer state conventions for the express purpose, and a congress of deputys appointed by these conventions with plenipotentiary powers. October 21, 1786  For my own part I am only solicitous to see an accomplishment of the salutary work and very regardless of the particular mode, so that the end is answered effectually & quickly. Since you left us(2) a political cloud has risen in the east & portends much calamity to our infant empire. Present appearances justify apprehensions of an appeal to the ultima ratio requm in Massachusetts, or submission to the mob. The Insurgents are very numerous, inhabitants of a rugged country well united, and firmly decided in their objects---;Abolition of debt & division of lands are the cardinal points in view, these are masqued by some ostensible complaints, the redress of which are attainable with ease & certainty in a constitutional manner, but having very different intentions they prefer illegal measures. Back of the Malcontents lyes Vermont---;these people are in commercial connexion with Canada, & are leagued with the insurgents. Thus you see there is a plain road to British Magazines & munitions of war, & I beleive no American can entertain any doubt of the conduct which the British King would pursue, was a civil war to take place among us. Mrs. Lee & Mr A Lee unite with me in most affectionate respects to my cousin & best wishes for Your health & happiness. Adieu, H. Lee Junr. ""

Major North is a Citizen of Massachusetts, a Soldier, and my friend; I have mentioned to him the act of congress for an augmentation of the federal troops, and that a respectable Quota of the new Levies will be raised in Massachusetts. He wishes promotion in this corps.(1) If a constant service during the late war will found a claim to future employment, the major has unequivocal pretensions; if a continuation in the military Department, from the commencement of Peace till this Time, strengthens these pretensions, he may very properly urge the distinction.

 New York 22 Oct. 1786 All good and virtuous men must feel the utmost indignation towards that unworthy magistrate the first Justice of Berkshire.(1) I was in Boston when I heard of the Tumults in your county, and confess that I was not a little anxious for your safety---;thank God you escaped their fury. What the Legislature will do I think is very uncertain; indeed their situation is somewhat embarrassing. I have no Doubts in my own mind what the line of their Duty is, yet it is by no means clear that they will view the Subject as it appears to me. What the consequences of these commotions will be time alone can discover. I myself have been an Advocate for a Government free as air; my Opinions have been established upon the belief, that my country men were virtuous, enlightened, and governed by a sense of Right & Wrong. I have ever feared that if our Republican Governments were subverted, it would be by the influence of commer[c]e and the progress of Luxury. But if in opposition to these Sentiments, the great Body of the people are, without Virtue, and not governed by any internal Restraints of Conscience, there is but too much reason to fear, that the Framers of our constitutions, & Laws, have proceeded on principles that do not exist, and that America, which the Freinds of Freedom, have looked to as an Asylum when persecuted, will not Afford that Refuge, which their hopes & wishes have suggested.

 Sir, New York 23d. October 1786 I did myself the Honour to write to your Excellency some Days ago on the Subject of the Disorders in Massachusetts.(1) At that Time the Intelligence from that Country, and of the hostile Movements of the Indians to the Westward were under Reference to a Committee of which it was my burthensome Lot to be Chairman; and the Business has engrossed much of my Time since. The Acts of Congress on this Occasion will be communicated to your Excellency by the Secretary;(2) but as the most energetic Motives which called on Congress for Expedition & which would probably urge the States to Exertion, could not with Propriety be publickly declared, these Acts may require some Explanation. I am not at Liberty, however, to give this Explanation without an Injunction that, while the Reasons for Secrecy continue, it be not published. Your Excellency will, I trust make the proper Use of it for the Purposes intended without hazarding the Consequences intended to be guarded against by the Caution which Congress have thought proper to use. For the Purpose of giving this Explanation I shall inclose a Copy of a separate Report of the Committee, which has been agreed to and ordered to be entered in the secret Journals.(3) This Copy however is taken from the rough Draught and corrected from Memory according to the Alterations made in the House; it may not therefore be an exact Copy, but it is nearly so.  In the present impoverished State of the Treasury we could think of no Method so likely to raise the Money speedily as by a Loan; and we could not ask a Loan without pledging more than a Promise on worn out public Faith for the Repayment. The existing Requisitions were already appropriated. We therefore deemed it necessary to make a new Requisition expressly for this Purpose. The Goodness of this Fund will depend on the Exertions of the States.(4) Congress are so deeply impressed with the Urgency of the Occasion that they have been unanimous in the Measures they have taken. The States however, not being possessed of equal Information may not feel an equal Call to speedy Exertion; hence a kind of Necessity arises of some Confidential Communications which is now submitted to your Excellency's Discretion. With great Esteem & Respect, I have the Honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedient & most humble Servant, Cha. Pettit October 23, 1786  [P.S.] Since writing the foregoing a Motion has been made to take off the Injunction of Secrecy so far as to admit of the making such confidential Communications as I am making to your Excellency.(5) There being diversity of Sentiments among the Members, the Motion went off without a Decision. Your Excellency will therefore perceive how far I commit myself in forwarding this Letter, but conceiving it to be for the public Benefit, & having perfect Confidence in your Excellency, I conceive the Doing of it as the performance of a Duty.

 Dear Sir Octr. 28h. N York [17]86 I have your letr. of the 19h by which I learn that Mr Henry means to abdicate the high office he holds for the honor and glory of haranguing your house. Surely you will put in his place(1) R H L or Mr. Charles Carter of Currotoman. My conduct in the affair you mention(2) has been uniformly in conformity with my colleagu[e]s, because we are under instructions & because any opposition would have been idle, therefore as far as can be known, I have been with Mr. Henry in this matter.  Had I not been fettered with instructions, I certainly between you & me, should have taken a different part. These instructions ought to be repealed. I am so convicted of the policy of the proposed Treaty that I am clearly of opinion on a fair statement of facts two thirds of your house would coincide with me in sentiment, at the same time I well know that such communications will be made & insinuations whispered as to forbid any attempt to espouse the true interest of our country on this subject. Not only the interest of the cisalpine Virginia and indeed their existence as a people is involved in the politics of this question, but the true interest of the transalpine country also. For it is  October 28, 1786  unquestionably true that the western settlements prosperity depends & ought to depend on the prosperity of the Atlantic country & grow in proportion thereto. To push forward the infant at the expence of the parent is wrong. Would not our tobacco the staple of Virga fall to mere nothing, if the western country could export that article. What would become of us if we were suddenly deprived of this only advantage we possess. Would not also in this event the western settlers be employed in the culture of tobacco and thereby the crops of grain fall short, from which the emigration would be checked, as subsistence to emigrants would be high & precarious. Would not the interest of our colonys be instantly seperated from our interest, & in some commercial points in direct opposition. These & many other reasons would decide me, had America the power to use the Mississippi. She claims that navigation as her right, Spain denys it. An appeal to the sword or treaty must settle the difference. We are inadequate to the first: by the last we shall in a few years obtain in my opinion what may be necessary to our western friends---;and at a time & in a manner which will not destroy ourselves, while it assists them. But view this subject as it effects the U. States and you will find it pregnant with reasons in support of the conduct of the majority in Congress. The eastern fishery for want of this very treaty is nearly destroyed, by this commercial connexion certain advantages would be secured to the fisherys which would revive the eastern trade. The surplus money arising from that trade would circulate among the middle & southern states in purchase of grain, tobacco &c. Thus we should all participate in the advantage which is branded with the name of partial. But there are many other emoluments secured to our commerce arising from the reciprocity on which the connexion is founded. All these procured for our forbearance for a given term from the use of a river, which we have not the power to use. This is meant for your own special information. H. Lee Junr. ""

 Sir, New York 28 Oct. 1786 In obedience to the Resolve of the general Court transmitted to us by your Excellency, we have requested of Congress a prolongation of  October 28, 1786  the Time limited for the Receit of Indents of Interest on the Requisition of the 27th of Sep. 1785; this proposition, according to the usual practice in like Cases, has been referred to the Board of Treasury for their Report.(1) Some Time has in this way been consumed, the report however is now before congress; but as the Dissolution of this Assembly will take place in a few days, so few of the States are now represented that no Business of importance can receive a decision. Our request therefore must be postponed till the meeting of the next congress. Although we have exerted ourselves to obtain an act, at this Time, authorising the Measure we proposed, yet from the condition of this business in most of the States, we can discover no certain inconvenience, which will flow from the want of a present Decision. In Connecticut, New Jersey & North Carolina, the Requisition of Sep. 1785 has not been complied with even by a legislative Act for levying their respective Quotas upon their Citizens. In most of the other states, which have passed legislative Acts for such Levies, the collection is equally in Arrear with Massachusetts; connecting therefore the views & interest of such states, with those of Connecticut, New Jersey, & North Carolina, there is the highest probability that a large majority of the states must advocate the propriety, and contend for the establishment, of a Resolution of congress, extending the Time within which Indents upon the Requisition of 1785 may be received. We submit it to your Excellency, to recommend to the General Court to pass a Resolve prolonging the Time within which the several Collectors & the Treasurer of the Commonwealth may receive the Indents payable in discharge of the Requisition of the 27th of Sep. 1785; confiding that the Indents thus collected & received, will by a proper Act of congress be admitted to the Credit of the Commonwealth upon their Quota of that Requisition.

 Dear Sir New York 29. Oct. 1786 Two posts have arrived and I heard not a word from any member of the General court. You must be impressed with the sentiment that we are extremely anxious to be informed of every step taken by the Legislature at this critical juncture of the Government. What measures you will pursue to preserve the commonwealth, it is your Duty diligently to Enquire. Wisdom & Fortitude ought most highly to distinguish the present Assembly. Upon what they do, or omit, in an eminent Degree must depend the national safety. The evil is of great magnitude, and the Remedy must be equally extensive or wholly inefficacious. I confess that I was greatly surprized when in Boston to find such an apathy among the People when the Government was convulsed, and the existence of the commonwealth in Danger---;very few men appear to be informed (or if informed continue silent) of the Dangerous principles avowed by the Leaders of the Insurgents. These men publicly avow the Opinion---;that all America, which was formerly under the British Government, and now within the United States, was acquired by the People of the United States & by their joint exertions; that all men being by nature equal, the Property ought to be equally divided among all the Citizens of the United States; and that upon the principles of this acquisition, and the Dissolution of the Government existing before the Revolution, all Debts contracted before that period are annihilated, and any attempts to inforce their payment are attempts for Plunder and Robbery. I have the best authority for affirming that these pernicious principles are cherished and industriously propagated by the leaders of the Insurgents. If when opinions so fatal to the Commonwealth are openly taught and justified, they who by their office are bound to watch for the safety of the Government, content themselves with limited Applications, and detail reforms, when the Evil is general, and the Dissease has possessed itself of the Vitals---;there is good reason to despair of the Commonwealth and to give all up to wild Anarchy & confusion.

 Dear Sir New York Novr. 4, 1786 I have received your letter of the 25 of Sept. by Mr Smith(1) with six numbers of the manuscript copy of your history(2) which I have read over with as much attention as my other engagements & frequent avocations would permit. They are now in the hands of Mr King to whom I communicated your request that he would favour you with his remarks thereon, at least in point of facts. For as to language that must be left to yourself when you come to revise it. As soon as he has done with it I shall commit it to your other friends as you desire, and shall now proceed to give you the thoughts which occurred to me in the cursory perusal I gave it.(3) With respect to language there were some words which did not please such as merged in the Ocean &c and some phrases which seemed too common to comport with the dignity of history, such as feeling the pulse of the people &c. But these are trifles which I dare say you will correct when you come to revise your work. For I perceive this is the first draught. As to matters of fact, the proclamation, which you ascribe to Genl Washington upon his first taking the command of the army, was drawn up by Congress. The consideration of it proceeded pari passu with the petition to the king, and was passed by Congress while the petition was engrossing. The truth is there was a considerable opposition to the sending another petition considering the manner in which the former had been treated. But several members were warm in favour of it, the matter compromised & the petition & declaration were both ordered and passed in a manner together. Your description of the works on Bunkers hill are in my opinion too much exaggerated and the firing upon the british from the houses in Charleston is a circumstance which is denied. The account you have given corresponds with that of the enemy. To save their honor it was necessary to make the works as formidable as possible and to take off from the Odium of burning towns at that early stage of the war it was thought necessary to represent that the Americans fired from the houses. I have conversed with Mr Gorham on the subject and he informs me that soon after the Americans sat down before Boston Genl Gage sent for him and informed him as an Inhabitant of Charl[es]town that in case the Americans approached Boston on that side he would be under the necessity of ordering that town to be burned; and that he could not be justifi[ed] by the laws of war to suffer it to stand to cover the approach of the Enemy. This Information Mr Gorham communicated to Genl Ward who then commanded the American forces; and as it was made known to the inhabitants of the town, as soon as our troops took possession of the hill, all the inhabitants of the town instantly fled & left their houses empty & he did not believe there was a single gun fired  November 4, 1786  from any of the houses. From this you see it was a premeditated act, justified by the rules of war and not depending on the firing from the houses. As to the works on Bunkers hill, how was it possible such as are described could be erected in the space of three or four hours? The truth is our people marched over the Causeway & took possession of the hill late at night instantly broke ground & threw up some slight redoubts of earth. They were discovered at day break and a detachment was immediately sent to dislodge them. This detachment landed at a point on the bay at a considerable distance from the town. Upon seeing the number of our troops on the heights they halted & sent back for reinforcements. Upon this our troops immediately pulled up the post & rail fences which enclosed the lots between the town & the bay & set them down again in two parallel rows at a small distance from each other, extending from the earthen redoubt on the right to the town & on the left to the bay, the space between the two lines they filled with hay which had been lately mowed & remained on the lots in cocks. These were the formidable works behind which they sheltered themselves & waited the assault of the Enemy. There are I apprehend other facts mentioned which will deserve examination and as truth & precision will be expected from an American and especially from you who have had so many opportunities of Information I think it would be proper to travel through the several states, to view the scenes of actions & converse with the people who were near them in order to obtain the fullest information & to form a right judgmt. With regard to the account you have given of the manner in which Pensylvania was engaged to unite in the Opposition I dislike it altogether. The mentioning names is invidious as you have dealt in general with regard to the measures adopted in other states. I have therefore cut them out before I let the manuscript go out of my hands. The story of the German is flat & too low for history & the whole account defective & unsatisfactory. I shall therefore give you a short narrative of what passed without descending to particulars & leave it with you to mould it in any form you think proper at the same time I must earnestly entreat you either to alter that part of your history or to leave it wholly out passing over Pensylvania as you have Delaware & Maryland. Before I proceed to this I would just observe that there are sundry material circumstances omitted such as Gages perfidy in disarming the inhabitants of Boston---;And also the manner in which our Army was furnished in the latter end of 1775 with powder, arms, mortars and other military apparatus by the fortunate capture of the two stores ships. There is also another Circumstance which I think ought to be mentioned in order to explain the mode & account for the rapidity of the news spreading throughout this country. You must recollect the news of the Boston port bill reached Boston the 10 of May.  November 1786  And in a little more than a month it was not only communicated from state to state but a flame was kindled in almost every breast throughout this widely extended though but thinly inhabited Country. This must appear fabulous to a foreigner who is unacquainted with the situation of our affairs at that time. Would it not therefore be proper where you are giving an account of this matter to insert a clause to the following effect. \""In order to explain the mode by which the flame was so rapidly spread through this extended & thinly inhabited Country it is necessary to observe that the several Colonies & provinces are divided into counties & these again sub-divided into districts distinguished by the names of towns, townships, precincts, hundreds or parishes. In the New England Colonies the sub-divisions which are called towns were by the law & constitution of the governments corporate bodies, had their regular meetings & might be occasionally convened by their proper Officers. The advantages derived from these meetings by uniting the whole body of the people in the measures taken to oppose the Stamp Act induced other provinces to imitate the example. Accordingly under the Association which was formed in opposition to the revenue laws of 1767 & which lasted for upwards of two years, Committees were established not only in the Capitals of every Province but also in most of the County towns & subordinate districts. In the commencement of the present opposition these committees had been revived, extended and reduced to system; so that when any intelligence of importance which it was necessary the people at large should be informed of, reached the capitals, it was immediately dispatched to the county committees & by them forwarded to the committees of the districts who disseminated it to the whole body of the people. The expence of expresses when necessary was defrayed by private contributions. And as the persons employed in this service were animated in the cause their Zeal was a spur to their industry and the news was spread with incredible dispatch.\"" I shall now proceed to my narrative.(4) The comtt of Philadelphia to whom the public letter from Boston was sent were fully sensible of the state of parties & disposition of the people of the Province. They saw the dispute with G B brought to a crisis and a new scene opening which required exertions different from those heretofore made. The success of these exertions, they well knew, depended on the wisdom with which they were planned & the Union of the whole people in carrying them into execution. They resolved therefore to proceed with the utmost caution & circumspection. The letter was publickly read(5) at the coffee house and notice was given that it would be read the evening following at the city tavern in which there was a large room capable of receiving several hundred persons, and it was expected that the citizens would come prepared to give their opinion on the measures necessary to be taken on the pre  sent alarming situation of affairs. At this meeting(6) which was numerous & composed of leading men of different religious as well as political sentiments, the letter was ag[ai]n read & the subject of the act for shutting up the Port of Boston & the plans of the B. Administration were discussed. Agreeably to a plan previously concerted the debate was conducted so as to sound the sentiments of the people but not to cause divisions or create parties. It seemed to be admitted by all that every Colony as well as Massachusetts was affected by the Act of Parliament & that the people of Boston should be considered as suffering in the common cause of America; As to the means of relief the opinions were various. When the debate began to be warm it was prudently stopped by simply proposing that an Answer be returned to the people of Boston. This was unanimously agreed to. A Committee was then to be chosen to draft the answer, and two lists of persons were framed one containing such as were averse from, the other such as were in favour of active measures. To prevent disp[utes i]t was agreed that both should stand and thus by prudent management unanimity in appearance at least was preserved and a committee appointed with the Concurrence of all. This had a happy effect in tempering immoderate zeal, giving time to prepare the public Mind and suffering matters to ripen gradually. Next day the Comtt met & dispatched an answer to the people of Boston. The letter was firm but temperate. They acknowledged the difficulty of offering advice on the present occasion; sympathized with them in their distress, and observed that all lenient measures for obtaining redress should be first tried---;That if the making restitution for the tea destroyed would put an end to this unhappy controversy & leave the people of Boston upon their ancient footing of constitutional liberty it could not admit of a doubt what part they should act---;But that it was not the value of the tea, it was the indefeasible right of giving and granting their own money which was now the matter in consideration---;that it was the common cause of America & therefore necessary in their opinion that a Congress of deputies from the several Colonies should be convened to devise the means for restoring harmony between Great Britain and the Colonies and preventing matters from coming to extremities. Till this could be brought about they recommended firmness, prudence & moderation to the immediate sufferers, assuring them that the people of Pensylvania will continue to evince a firm adherence \""to the cause of American liberty.\"" The committee also dispatched the news express to the Provinces southward of them with a letter suggesting the necessity of a general Congress of deputies from all the provinces. In order to awaken the attention of the people a series of letters were published well calculated to rouse them to a sense of their danger and point out the fatal effects & consequences of the late acts of Parliament & the plan of the british administration. Every news paper was filled with these & other pieces on the subject & with the   debates of the members of Parliament on the bill & the protests of the dissenting Lords. The first of June, the day when the Act began to operate, was solemnized with every manifestation of public calamity and grief. The Inhabitants shut up their houses; And after divine service a stillness reigned which exhibited a scene of the deepest distress and of sorrow unutterable. <<The houses of worship were crowded, divine services performed and sermons preached sensible to the occasion; when divine service was over a solemn stillness reigned through the City which seemed a repetition and a scene of sorrow not unlike in some measure resembling that which is described in the book of Esther, and which was taken for a text by one of the preachers, upon the issuing of the bloody decree against the Jews \""And in every province withersoever the King's commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth & ashes.\"" This was followed by meetings & private Assemblings of the people.> The minds of the people being thus prepared the Committee thought it necessary to request the governor to call the Assembly. For this purpose they drew up a petition stating \""that since the recess of the Assembly, the proceedings of the british Parliament towards America & particularly an Act lately passed against the town of Boston have filled the minds of the people with deep anxiety & distress---;that the petitioners apprehend the design of the act is to compel the Americans to acknowledge the right of Parliament to impose taxes upon them at pleasure---;that the precedent of condemning a whole town or city unheard & involving all its inhabitants of every age & sex & however differing in political sentiment or action in one common ruin gives universal alarm---;that deeply impressed with these sentiments and at the same time solicitous to preserve peace, order and tranquility they earnestly entreat the governor to call the Assembly of the province as soon as it can conveniently be done that they may have an Opportunity not only to devise measures to compose & relieve the anxieties of the people but to restore that harmony & peace between the Mother country and the Colonies which have been of late so much and so unhappily interrupted.\"" This petition was immediately signed by more than 900 freeholders & presented to the governor on the 8 of June. To this the governor replied \""that upon all occasions when the peace, order and tranquility of the province required it he should be ready to convene the Assembly but as that did not appear to be the case at present he could not think such a step would be expedient or consistent with his duty.\"" This refusal <<which was foreseen> opened the way for other measures. The members of the committee who advocated the <<cause of> people of Boston & who wished to engage the province to make common cause with them, promoted the petition for calling the Assembly, not with an expectation or desire that it should be complied with but   merely to preserve unanimity and to obviate objections which would otherwise be raised against the steps which they judged necessary to be taken to lead the whole province into a united Opposition. They had at several times intimated to the Comtt the necessity of calling together the freemen of the city and county in order that they might give their opinion on what was proper to be done in the present situation of public affairs: this was always opposed. But such was the ferment raised by the governor's refusal to call the Assembly that notwithstanding the reluctance of several individuals the Committee unanimously concurred in the measure, apprehending that a farther opposition would occasion tumults & consequently endanger their personal safety. The meeting was held in the States house yard on the 18 of June and was very large. By computation the number was estimated at 8,000. To give it the more respectability none were admitted but such as had a right of voting at elections for representatives. The greatest solemnity, order and decorum was observed, and the business was managed with such address, both in the preparatory meetings & afterwards that those who were the most averse seemed to be the principal movers. At this meeting it was unanimously resolved 1. That the act of parliament for shutting up the port of Boston is unconstitutional, oppressive to the inhabitants of that town, dangerous to the british Colonies and that therefore they considered their brethren at Boston as suffering in the common cause of America. 2. That a congress of deputies from the several Colonies in North America is the most probable & proper mode of procuring relief for their suffering brethren, securing their common rights and liberties and reestablishing peace and harmony between great Britain and the Colonies on a constitutional foundation. 3. To appoint a committee for the city & county of Philadelphia to correspond with the sister Colonies & with the several Counties in this province in order that all may unite in promoting & endeavouring to obtain the great & valuable ends mentioned in the foregoing resolution. 4. That the comtt consult together & on mature deliberation determine what is the most proper mode of collecting the sense of this province and appointing deputies for the same to attend a general Congress, and having determined thereon they should take such measures as by them should be judged most expedient for procuring this Province to be represented at the said Congress in the best manner that can be devised for promoting the public welfare. 5. That the Comtt set on foot a subscription for the relief of such poor inhabitants of the town of Boston as may be deprived of the means of subsistance by the operation of the Act of parliament commonly called the Boston port bill; the money arising from such subscription to be laid out as the committee shall think will best answer the ends proposed.  They then proceeded to appoint a committee and with a view to preserve & promote harmony they reelected the members of the former Committee adding such a number of new members as to give a decided majority in favour of the measures now agreed on. The comtt which consisted of 43 members met and determined, 1. that the Speaker of the Assembly be desired to write to the several Member[s] & request them to meet as soon as possible but not later than the first of August to take into consideration the very alarming situation of Affairs and secondly That letters be written to proper persons in each county recommending it to them to get committees appointed for their respective Counties and that the said committees or such number of them as may be thought proper may meet in Philadelphia at the time the representatives are convened in order to consult and advise on the most expedient mode of appointing deputies for the general Congress and to give their weight to such as may be appointed. The reason of the second determination was their not having a sufficient confidence in the members who then composed the House of Assembly and more particularly in the Speaker, whose influence was great but whose attachment to the cause of his Country was even then suspected, & whose conduct afterwards proved that the suspicion was well founded. They were apprehensive that if the members met they might be induced to take advantage of the irregularity of the call & of their not being convened in their legislative capacity & therefore break up without appointing delegates. In this case it was intended to have another body convened expressly for the purpose who should proceed to the appointment. Application was accordingly made to the Speaker who agreed to comply with the request of the Committee. But this was rendered unnecessary, by the governor's issuing a proclamation on account of some indian disturbances for the Assembly to meet in their legislative capacity on Monday the 18 July. It may not be improper to observe that though the Assembly of Pensylvania agreeably to the Charter & laws of the Province met every year on a certain day and afterwards on their own adjournments, yet in case of any emergency during their recess the governor had a right & power of convening them and they were bound to obey his call. Notwithstanding this call of the Governor the Comtt judged it necessary to proceed on the second determination and accordingly on the 28 of June wrote to each of the Counties enclosing copies of the resolutions passed at the meeting of the 18th & the determinations they had come to in pursuance of the trust reposed in them, informed them of the meeting of the Assembly and requested that the whole or a part of the Comtt appointed or to be appointed would meet the other committees at Philadelphia on the 15 July in order to assist in framing instructions and preparing such matters as might be proper to recommend to their represen[ta]tives at their meeting on the Monday following.  With this request the several Counties readily complied and the deputies met at the time appointed. Previous to their meeting the Committee for the city and county of Philadelphia had made such preparations that the business was soon dispatched. The Convention being assembled & having chosen a chairman & clerk, it was agreed that in case of any difference in sentiment the question should be determined by the deputies voting by counties. The letters from Boston of the 13 of May were then read and a short Account given of the steps taken in consequence thereof and the measures now pursuing in this and the neighbouring provinces after which the following resolves were passed---;---;---;(7) 1. That we acknowledge ourselves & the inhabitants of this province liege subjects of his Majy King G. the 3 to whom they & we owe & will bear true & faithful Allegiance. 2. That as the idea of an unconstitutional independence on the parent State is utterly abhorrent to our principles we view the unhappy differences between G B & the Colonies with the deepest distress & anxiety of mind as fruitless to her, grievous to us & destructive of the best interests of both. 3. That it is therefore our ardent desire that our ancient harmony with the Mother Country should be restored & a perpetual love and union subsist between us on the principles of the Constitution & an interchange of good offices without the least infraction of our mutual rights. 4. That the inhabitants of these colonies are entitled to the same rights within these colonies that the subjects born in England are entitled to within that realm. 5. That the power assumed by the parliament of G B to bind the people of these Colonies \""by statutes in all cases whatsoever\"" is unconstitutional & therefore the source of these unhappy differences. 6. That the act of parliament for shutting up the port of Boston is unconstitutional, oppressive to the inhabitants of that town, dangerous to the liberties of the british Colonies; & therefore that we consider our brethren at Boston as suffering in the common cause of these Colonies. 7. That the bill for altering the administration of justice in certain criminal cases within the province of Massachusetts bay, if passed into an Act of parliament, will be as unconstitutional, oppressive & dangerous as the act above mentioned. 8. That the bill for changing the Constitution of the province of Massachusetts bay established by charter & enjoyed since the grant of that charter, if passed into an Act of parliament will be unconstitutional & dangerous in its consequences to the American Colonies. 9. That there is an absolute necessity that a Congress of deputies from the several colonies be immediately assembled to consult together and form a general plan of conduct to be observed by all the   colonies for the purposes of procuring relief for our suffering brethren, obtaining redress of our grievances, preventing future dissensions, firmly establishing our rights & restoring harmony between G B & her colonies on a constitutional foundation. 10. That although a suspention of the commerce of this large trading province with G B would greatly distress multitudes of our industrious inhabitants yet that sacrifice & a much greater we are ready to offer for the preservation of our liberties; but in tenderness to the people of G B as well as of our country & in hopes that our just remonstrances will at length reach the ears of our gracious Sovereign & be no longer treated with contempt by any of our fellow subjects in England, it is our earnest desire that the Congress should first try the gentler mode of stating our grievances & making a firm & decent claim of redress. The foregoing were passed unanimously 11. Resolved by a great majority That yet notwithstanding, as an unanimity of councils & measures is indispensibly necessary for the common welfare, if the Congress shall judge Agreements of Nonimportation & Nonexportation expedient the people of this province will join with the other principle & neighbouring colonies in such an association of Nonimportation from & Nonexportation to G B as shall be agreed at the Congress. 12. Resolved by a majority That if any proceedings of the parliament, of which notice shall be received on this Continent before or at the general Congress shall render it necessary in the Opinion of that Congress for the Colonies to take farther steps than are mentioned in the eleventh resolve in such case the inhabitants of this province shall adopt such farther [steps] & do all in their power to carry them into execution. The following were passed unanimously 13. That the venders of Merchandize of every kind within this province ought not to take advantage of the resolves relating to Nonimportation in this province or elsewhere, but that they ought to sell their Merchandize which they now have or may hereafter import at the same rates they have been accustomed to do within three months last past. 14. That the people of this province will break off all trade commerce & dealing & will have no trade commerce or dealing of any kind with any colony on this continent or with any city or town in such colony or with any individual in such Colony city or town which shall refuse, decline or neglect to adopt & carry into execution such general plan as shall be agreed to in Congress.  15. That it is the duty of every member of this Comtt to promote as much as he can the subscription set on foot in the several counties of this province for the relief of the distressed inhabitants of Boston. 16. That this comtt give instructions on the present situation of public affairs to their representatives who are to meet next week in Assembly & request them to appoint a certain number of persons to attend a congress of deputies from the several Colonies at such time & place as may be agreed on to effect one general plan of conduct for attaining the great & important ends mentioned in the ninth resolve. Grounded on these resolutions they prepared a set of Instructions which on the 21 July were signed by their chairman and presented by them in a body to the Assembly then sitting.(8) Their instructions were bold animated and pathetic. They not only pointed out the causes of the present uneasiness, & recommended the appointment of persons to attend a general Congress of deputies from the several Colonies for the purpose of promoting and establishing harmony between G B & the Colonies on a constitutional foundation, but proceeded to delineate the measures that appeared most likely to produce that effect, and the terms of a compact to be settled between the two countries so as to put a final period to the unconstitutional claims of the one and to the fears & jealousies of the other. (As this is a curious paper and contains the sentiments which then prevailed in that province it may either be abridged or inserted at full length. I therefore enclose a copy of it.[)](9) Deputies were accordingly appointed by the legislature, and thus without tumult without disorder or divided councils the whole province was by prudent management & temperate proceedings brought into the opposition with its whole weight and influence. I shall trouble you no farther at present than just to request you to alter the sentence respecting my appointment to the office of Secretary & let it stand simply \""Charles Thomson of Philadelphia\"" striking out what is said respecting the part I took in the conduct of affairs of Pensylv[ani]a. I am &c. ""

 My Dr. Friend New York 5 Nov. 1786 We are encouraged in our Hopes and wishes for the safety of the commonwealth by the Papers and letters which the last post brought us. Persevere and you will restore the authority of Government. While I reverence the principles of rigorous Justice, and earnestly desire that the Constitution and laws may be superior to all Opposition, I feel compassion for those unfortunate men, who have thoughtlessly united in measures unauthorised by their sober Reflections. We have supposed that no men of consequence, have been connected with the Insurgents, and it has been taken for granted, that no external Council or Aid has been, or would be afforded them. But be assured, that neither you nor I comprehend the combinations, which these Insurgents may in possible Events be able to form. Let them shew their condition & numbers, and advance a little farther in open resistance of the Government, and a scene will then present itself of far more importance than has yet been conjectured. There will not be wanting leaders of name, and consideration, to conduct them. We all have our preferences & aversions, and perhaps in general they are both alike unfounded. I confess however, that with the single exception of one French Nobleman,(1) I have always been more willing to confide in the Citizens of our Country, novel as their employments have been, than in the most plausible, or experienced, Foreigners who have been among us. Although in some few instances we may have received Benefits from Foreigners in the public service, yet I have rejoiced when the Obligation has been discharged, and they have quitted America. Some Adventurers yet remain, they have their Rendezvous & their Leader(2)---;concerning his merits and pretentions, even you and I my Friend, have held different Opinions. I know that he was a soldier of Fortune, and a mercenary in Europe; and notwithstanding his affected Philanthropy, and artificial Gentleness, I hold his Character the same in America. The only Difference is this, in Europe he received little money, and less Flattery. In America, the Sovereign of it, having added bounty to exact Justice, and possessed him of real monies exceeding in amount the life Aggregate of the Revenues of a prince of the german Empire, he has, from this Circumstance of preference, and from the adulation of Sycophants, been buoyed up to the preposterous Belief, that his military Talents are superior to those of any  November 5, 1786  soldier in America. \""Alieni Appetens, sui profusus,\""(3) was the character of the man who plotted the Destruction of Rome: the same Dispositions, and the like desperate Fortune, mark the man who openly justifies the Conduct of our Insurgents, and who will head them if their cause prospers.

 Sir New York [post November 6, 1786](1) The Delegation had the pleasure of writing you lately by Mr. Edward Rutledge and enclosed several recommendations and resolutions of Congress, particularly that of a requisition for supplies.(2) By the enclosed schedule(3) you will find our State is called upon for  November 6, 1786  74,937 52/90 Dollars in specie and 103,015 dollars in Indents or Certificates of interest on the domestic debt as the balance due from her on the requisition of the 2d August last.(4) The board of treasury will state the debits and credits to accompany the requisition, by which you will find that our State has not had full credit on account of her supplies furnished the Southern Army; Congress concieving that her agreement with the late Superintendant of finance did not authorize the crediting her on the existing requisitions, more than her quota of the 30th October 1781 for eight millions of Dollars, which amounted to 373,598(5)---;the overplus of supplies it will be contended must be carried to her credit in the general account. This you will clearly discover to be the intention of Congress by inspecting the journals, where notwithstanding all our endeavours to be credited to the full amount on the present requisition, they confined the credit to the balance due on that of the 30th October 1781. The accompanying state will shew the sum, that still remains uncredited, and we concieve the claim so just and well founded, that we think it necessary to submit to the Legislature the propriety of applying to Congress for the purpose of admitting it as a Credit on the present requisition. The estimate inserted in the demand for supplies, fully shews the amount of the foreign and domestic debt, with the interest thereon, and the other purposes for which money is wanted. A schedule of the foreign loans shewing the period of their redemption and the annual interest payable thereon is also enclosed. The approach of the time at which these will become due and the importance of maintaining our Credit abroad, should foreign invasions or domestic convulsions make farther loans necessary, are too obvious, and too interesting to our welfare as a nation, not to demand the early and serious attention of every Member of the Union. On the 20th of October from a conviction of the necessity of the measure, and that thepresent situation of the confederacy required it, Congress resolved to increase their forces to 2,040 men. The resolutions stating the reasons is enclosed, and on the 21t they pass'd a requisition for 530,000 Specie dollars for the purpose of paying the expences of raising and equipping them.(6) The board of treasury are directed to open loans for raising the money as expeditiously as possible, and this requisition is a fund solemnly appropriated to discharge them. As the reasons which have induced this measure are of the most important and interesting nature, Congress have a high confidence in the attention of the several legislatures and trust their best exertions will be used to pay the sums respectively required of them on the last named requisition into the federal treasury by the time therein assigned. The quota of South Carolina is 33,973 Dollars in Specie and the time for paying it, the 1st day of June 1787. Some attempts have been made by States, particularly Rhode- Island and New Jersey to make their paper currencies receivable on arrears   of federal taxes, but as nothing but Specie can be applicable to the maintenance of the federal government and the payment of our foreign demands, on the 18th of September, Congress declared that no other payments ought or could be made in discharge of the Specie proportions of a requisition, and on the 20th directed no other money to be received in the several post offices.(7) It will however be still in the power of any State to negotiate with the board of treasury in produce, who will always allow them credit for it's net proceeds in specie, either here, or in Europe. We have received intelligence from Mr. Barclay, that he has concluded a treaty with the Emperor of Morocco(8)---;as soon as it shall arrive, or we shall be able to know the terms, they shall be transmitted. The only beneficial effect this treaty can have, is to acquire the influence of Morocco in assisting us to obtain treaties from the other piratical States, for until a peace is concluded with Algiers and the regencies of Tunis & Tripoli, our trade will still continue exceedingly unsafe in the Mediterranean and indeed in the Ocean as far as the Western Islands the Moorish cruisers having been there the last summer. It is said and we apprehend there is no doubt of it, that a treaty is also concluded with Portugal---;this will be probably here in time to transmit at the opening of our next session of the Legislature. The Secretary has enclosed you, and a copy accompanied our last dispatch of a recommendation to the legislature to pay to the officers of our late federal line certain months pay due them in 1782 and 1783 which ought long since to have been paid them out of the treasury here.(9) It's exhausted state and the little prospect of it's improving, induced us to wish a recommendation to the State to provide the sums due and deduct them from her Specie proportion of the requisition---;it can make no difference to her and will no doubt be a convenience to the gentlemen concerned. We wish however that the sumprovided may be immediately made known to us, that a proper credit may be obtained in the Books of the Treasury. The intelligence from the Indian nations northwestward of the Ohio, co-operating with that we have received of the intentions of the southern Indians induce us to suppose, that unless timely exertions are made to prevent it, a general Indian War may soon take place. Tho' our State or it's frontier Inhabitants are no[t] such exposed to the effects of their hostility as their neighbours, it is yet more than possible, if the operations of the southern Indians are well concerted and supported, that we may in some degree be affected. Should this be the case, we shall be much obliged to you for the earliest information, as in the event of a general combination it may not perhaps be improper to request the federal interposition and to make the protection of the southern frontiers, and the repression of the Indians a casus fOEderis. Upon this subject however it will be necessary to wait   the decision and instructions of our constituents and we sincerely hope that the calamities of an Indian war may not be added to the distresses that must have been consequent to the repeated losses they have sustained from inclement seasons and other accidents. The last delegation submitted to the Legislature, the necessity of conforming their representation to the direction of the Confederation, and the recommendations of Congress on that subject.(10) We beg leave again earnestly to recommend its adoption to the legislature at their next session as a thing highly necessary. The several recommendations of Congress are enclosed to be laid before the house and independent of the reasons therein contained we beg leave to remark that in our opinion strictly speaking no member of the union has a right to appoint their delegates in any other manner than that stated in the confederation, more than a county in an individual State can vary the mode of electing it's Members, from the one established in their Constitution; it might therefore be in the power of any Member to object to our sitting under Credentials until February, as unconstitutional, and to place us in an inconvenient situation by questioning our right to act as Members. Besides there is another reason which ought in our Opinions to operate strongly with the legislature in inducing them to conform to the recommendation---;it is, that until their members are elected, as the other members are to sit from November to November, a Delegate from South Carolina, never can or will be elected President, however qualified one of them may be to fill the chair, or the house desirous to appoint him---;for his credentials only authorizing him to sit until February and the president being appointed for a year, those members only will be elected whose times of service are coexistent with the presidency. It can never we are sure be the intention of the legislature to subject their Delegates to this inconvenience, but must be their wish to see the Chair filledin it's turn by a Delegate from South-Carolina. To admit of this taking place in future and to remedy the inconveniences of a different mode of election from the other States, we take the liberty of recommending that the ensuing election of delegates be only made until next November, and then an appointment be made to take their seats from the first Monday in November agreeable to the Confederation. When this is done your delegates will sit in Congress upon equal terms with those of the other States, but until then, they will be always under the inconveniences we have stated. If there should not be a probability of the house's sitting in September or some time in the summer, the inconvenience of not having a delegation is easily obviated by making two elections in February, one to sit until November and another from that time for a year. This as it is the surest, would in our opinions be the best way, and was adopted by several of the States when they conformed their Delegations to the recommendation.  On the 23d of October Congress again presented to the view of some of the Legislatures, the recommendation of the 30th April 1784 respecting Commerce.(11) It still remains with the States of New Hampshire and North-Carolina so to conform their Acts as to enable the United States to exercise the powers therein requested---;and with the legislatures of Connecticut, Pensylvania, Maryland & South-Carolina so far to amend their Acts as to vest the powers for fifteen years from the time they shall begin to operate. We have no doubt our legislature will very readily conform their Act---;indeed, such is the critical and important situation of the federal government, that unless farther powers are given and the States can be brought into some general and certain system of revenue, the most serious consequences are to be apprehended. It remains with the States of Pensylvania and New- York to bring the impost part of the revenue system of the 18th April 1783, into Action, and we hope that the knowledge they have of the situation of the Confederacy, and their affection and attachment to it, will induce them to conform and assent so as to give it operation. Congress have it in contemplation to recommend to the several States, an investiture of additional powers to the Confederation---;a report of a Grand Committee on this subject, has been the order of the day for some time and will be taken up as soon as the present Congress shall be sufficiently full to act upon it with effect.(12) As the alteration and strengthening the federal Constitution is a work of great Consequence, so it ought to be of much deliberation---;it will therefore be weighted with all the attention a subject of such importance demands, and we think that in the end such a system will be presented to the States, as their legislatures will with pleasure assent to, under a thorough conviction that the situation of the union made it necessary for Congress to recommend, and for them to confirm a government, more efficient and more productiveof the benefits expected from our union. The present system being defective, it is the duty of Congress to point to their Constituents the mode of remedying it. Being placed in the Administration, their experience will enable them to form a more competent opinion as to it's operation. The plan we have alluded to contemplates a grant of general Commercial powers---;a mode of rendering the States more attentive to the requisitions of Congress, by certain powers of collecting taxes where the States do not pass legislative Acts for the purpose in the time required---;a clause establishing a mode by which powers not delegated under the Confederation may be obtained, and the assent of a given number of the States bind the Confederacy as effectually as if the powers had been granted and confirmed by the legislatures of all the States. This would prevent the evil we have for some time experienced of one or two States defeating the intentions and wishes of the whole---;a power to erect a federal judicial Court, and an Article to oblige the States to   keep up a representation and to prevent a Delegate's leaving Congress without leave after he has taken his seat---;the great inconveniences which have frequently arisen from the want of a sufficient representation makes this absolutely necessary. These are the outlines of the plan which will engage the attention of Congress in the course of it's present session. There are other Articles tho' of subordinate Consideration, and some that are not at this time included but which may present themselves before the system is sufficiently matured to be transmitted to the States. We have thought it necessary to mention this report and the intention of Congress to the Legislature, for two reasons---;one is, that it will enable them individually to consider and examine the propriety and motives of the recommendation before it arrives and give time perhaps to suggest alterations and amendments that have escaped the notice of the Committee---;in subjects of this magnitude the more time that is given to examine the question, the better in general will be the judgment that is formed upon it's investigation. Another reason is, that it will evince an attention on the part of Congress, to the means of strengthening the fOEderal government; a subject which has been for some time generally convers'd of, and confessed to be necessary, by all who are acquainted with the true interests, or wish the welfare of these States. The definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain and the measures necessary to be taken in order to bring our interfering claims with that power to a settlement, will require much attention in Congress and the different legislatures. Upon our Minister's presenting a Memorial touching the surrender of the posts which they hold on our frontiers---;pressing an adjustment of the negroes or their value that were carried away contrary to the treaty, and for some other purposes respecting it, the british Secretary of State returned an answer, enclosing a recapitulation of all the Acts which have beenpassed by the several States and which they assert to be contrary to the treaty---;Such as those which provide for the recovery of old debts by instalments---;Such [as] declare no interest shall be recovered during the war on british debts---;Such as allow Actions to be brought for trespasses committed by those who were with the enemy---;and the tender laws &c. &c. all of which have been published in the papers. These communications were referred to the Secretary for foreign affairs for his report and opinion, as belonging to that department. He has since made a report incorporating at full length every thing that has been done in this business between the two powers, respecting what they have mutually asserted to be breaches of the treaty and including all the Acts passed by the several States against which they complain, either on account of forfeitures, debts, trespasses or disabilities. The report of the Secretary is now under a reference to a Committee.(13) As soon as Congress come to decision on this business we shall transmit it with such observations as shall be then necessary fully   to inform the legislature of the motives that have induced, and the consequences that are expected from it. While on this subject it may be proper to observe that Congress on the ninth of August passed a resolution directing the Secretary for foreign affairs to transmit to the executives of the several States concerned, lists, of the numbers, names and owners of the negroes carried away in contravention of the treaty.(14) We hope this list has been received in our State, and should any instructions be necessary on the subject, we shall receive and execute them with pleasure. We observed in our last dispatch, that an Ordinance had been passed for the settlement of the accounts between the United States and individual States, which, though it might expedite, and go farther to produce and [an] adjustment of those claims than the former regulations, did not in our opinions compleatly cover the equitable demands of our State arising from her assumptions of debts due to her Citizens for supplies furnished for the use of the United States.(15) We are still of this opinion and think that for all the assumptions made of well founded Claims, the State ought to be suffered to stand in the place of the individual, and to enjoy the benefits he would have done, had no such assumption been made. This would entitle her to receive a Certificate for the amount when ascertained, and discount the interest, on that part of the annual requisitions for supplies which is called for in Indents. But it is contended on the other hand, that as these assumptions were made without the authority of Congress, and their liquidation by the State, prevented an examination by the federal Commissioner into the propriety of the charges and of course injured the United States, that the amount when ascertained can only be admitted as a charge in the general account and not be considered as a part of the liquidated debt upon which Certificates of interest are receivable and discountable in taxes: they also oppose the Claims of theUnited States against us on account of their specific requisitions, to our demands for Supplies. But we still trust when they consider the situation of our State at the time these specific demands were made, they will suppose they must have originated in a want of information as to our being then invaded, and of course are improper to be insisted upon. But upon inspecting the journals at the time, we made an attempt to have this Ordinance passed upon such general and equitable terms as would have embraced all our Claims and done equal justice to both parties. You will find that they made an attempt to include their Claims on account of the greater proportion of Soldiers they had in the field, than the Southern States, and an account of the expences of the Penobscot Expedition and the redemption of the Old Continental money. These are always opposed to our Assumption claims and are the reason the Ordinance was not sufficiently comprehensive to have included them in the way we wished. We shall however continue upon every proper occasion to urge them, and hope ulti-  mately to have these Claims placed upon those terms of fairness and equality we conceive them entitled to. We mentioned to the last legislature the importance of having a federal rule established for ascertaining the quotas of the several States(16)---;the mode prescribed by the Confederation being supposed impracticable, Congress recommended another under their resolutions of the 18th April 1783. Our State though it has passed an Act for assenting to such an alteration of the Confederation as will effect it, has hitherto postponed transmitting a compleat enumeration of all her inhabitants. The one made and sent some Years since is so incompleat and partial as to be of no service in enabling Congress to ascertain her true quota. We therefore recommend that measures may be taken to obtain, and send on as soon as it can conveniently be done a compleat return of all the Whites and blacks in the State. By the enclosed list it appears that a majority of the States have already made returns, and there is reason soon to expect them from those which have not. It appears from our payments into the common treasury that 72,212 58/90 Dollars were paid at different periods in specie. We wish Your Excellency to send us duplicates of the receipts given for this Money, as it is necessary we should be informed whether the same was paid by us in discharge of our quota of the requisition of October 16th 1782 for 2 Millions of dollars, or for that of the 30 October 1781 for 8 Millions. We are of opinion that a discharge of our quota on the last mentioned requisition, we are entitled to a Credit on our supplies, and that the specie payments abovementioned ought to have been carried to our Credit on the other requisition upon which there is a balance due from our State. By a communication from the Board of Treasury we find that the Indents to be issued for interest on the liquidated debt of the United States in the hands of our Citizens have not yet been transmitted to our Loan Officer. Upon enquiring intothe reasons of this delay they inform us, that they have not until lately been able to obtain any tolerable degree of information as to the state of the Loan- Office debt in South-Carolina, owing to the loss of the Check books, and other papers belonging to that Office. That with respect to the Loan-Office debt, they have made such communications to Congress as will shew that Loan-Office Certificates have been issued from the Office of South-Carolina in such a manner as not to justify in their opinion the issue of Indents of interest on them, until the account of the late Commissioners of the loan-office are adjusted and reported on.(17) This they say shall be immediately done and they conceive it may be finished in two or three months at the farthest. The indents for interest on the 232,047 20/90 in Certificates issued the Officers of the late South Carolina line they say shall be forwarded   by the first safe opportunity to the Loan Officer. It will be recollected that the indents for interest issued either on the above or any other liquidated debt of the United States due to our Citizens, can only be received in discharge of our quota of the requisition of the 4 September 1782, which is still open and amounts to 72,000 Dollars. Our State is already credited for their Quotas of the requisitions of the 27th & 28th April 1784 and 27th September 1785. As an adjustment and report on the Accounts of our late Loan officers seem in the opinion of the treasury board necessary premiums to the issue of indents on our loan office Certificates, it might be proper for your Excellency to mention it to these Gentlemen, that their Accounts may be ready for settlement. In our last we mentioned that the Agents had written you fully respecting the proceedings of Congress in our territorial controversy with the State of Georgia.(18) Should the Commissioners appointed to negotiate an amicable compromise not succeed in the attempt, and a federal Court be ultimately necessary, we shall be obliged to you for the earliest and fullest intelligence and instructions, in order that proper measures may be taken for convening the Court at the time and place appointed. Several of the Judges have accepted their appointments and will attend, if informed that the cause will be tried---; in that event there can be no doubt of a very respectable Court's being convened. The Gentlemen who were here lately of Counsel for our State were fully acquainted with the nature of the evidence which will be necessary and allowed to be produced to the Court. Transcripts and Exemplifications of all records and public Acts of the former or present Governments will be admitted, and the general rules of Common law evidence pursued in most respects. No ex parte evidence allowed unless by agreement of the parties---;in every cause of this kind to prevent unnecessary trouble and expence, some agreement of this sort must beproper, and will therefore we suppose be the case in this instance, should a trial be had. We expected long before this to have informed you that Congress had compleated their political arrangements in the Western Territory by extending to it's Inhabitants the influence of the federal Government. This was nearly compleated some months since.(19) The general principles and outlines of the system were agreed to, [a disa]greement in opinions as to the time and principles upon which they shall be admitted to a seat and vote in the federal Council prevented it's being finished and carried into execution. Some are of opinion that so many inconveniences and injuries already arise to the union from a number of small States having an equal vote in the Affairs of the federal Government with the largest and most important, that no new State ought to be admitted to a vote, until it possesses a number of In-  habitants equal to the one thirteenth part of the Inhabitants of the original States. Others think that if they are to compose a part of the union, they must and ought to be admitted when possessing a number equal to the least numerous of the original States, otherwise it will be to them a government of inequality and oppression---;for supposing the United States to contain 3 millions of Inhabitants, if the first principle prevails one of these States might have upwards of 200,000 and still not have a vote. Consequently she will be governed and taxed by the votes of States not having one fourth of her inhabitants or resources, and be extremely uneasy under the operation of a system in the conducting of which she is not allowed to participate, tho' obliged to contribute to it's support. And there are not a few who assert that under the Confederation, Congress have no right to admit any of them, as Members of the Union and entitled to a voice in their government until a reference has been made to the States and their assent first obtained---;that until this is done, their Government must be a Colonial one. We shall take up the matter again in the present Congress and hope to be able to inform you of it's soon being perfected, and the officers appointed---;for the situation and circumstances of that Country call loudly for some establishments. Our foreign negotiations with Spain and Britain are still unfinished, nor can we form any opinion as to the time by which we may expect their conclusion. We shall be always glad to be favored with your dispatches either by post or water. The Contract for transporting the Mail by Stages will be concluded for the next year(20) and we hope will operate as an inducement to the more perfect establishment of those Carriages in our State and it's neighbours. The convenience of having them made the southern Members anxious to direct the post Master General to Contract for the Mails being conveyed by them, and we have no doubt they will answer our expectations.Signed Charles Pinckney Daniel Huger. John Kean John Parker. John Bull. PS While on the subject of the settlement of the accounts of the late loan-officers of our state we omitted mentioning a circumstance which may not have occurred to the state, but which is of great importance to them, as very large sums of money in loan-office certificates were from time to time remitted them, for which the state is debited in the books of the treasury of the United States, it is that agreeable to the resolution of the 3d October 1776 instituting the said offices---;the appointment of the officers are given to the states respectively who are to be responsible for the faithful discharge of their duty in the said of-  fices, so that whatever deficiency there may be in the settlement of those accounts it will be charged to the State. We also beg leave again to present to the view of the State, the propriety of their taking some measures respecting the paying into the federal treasury their quota of the old continental money. It amounts to 21,950,000 dollars & we apprehend a very inconsiderable sum of specie or bills of credit of equal value, well laid out, would bring the whole very soon into the treasury---;so great is it's present depreciation. We conceive it necessary to mention this as several of the states are taking measures at present to sink their quotas. ""

14039,dg0243,1786,Charles Pettit to Thomas Mifflin,"""Charles Pettit to Thomas Mifflin
 Sir, New York 8th. November 1786 When the Delegates of Pennsylvania were honoured with the Instructions of the late House of Assembly to obtain from Congress an Order that the Sum of Â£32,429.15.7 of the Bills of Credit omitted by the State in the year 1781, then lying in the Continental Loan Office, should be paid into the State Treasury and passed to the Debit of the State in the General Account, there were not a sufficient Number of States present to pass such an Order if they had been so disposed. The Instructions however, being public, became a Subject of Conversation, and your Delegates had no Difficulty in discerning that to make the Application in Form, even when Congress was more full, would not be attended with Success: it was therefore delayed, or rather withdrawn, for the Motion was made & some Debate had upon it.(1) A Negotiation was set on Foot with the Board of Treasury on the Subject; but the Sum stated not agreeing with the Amount reported by the Loan Officer, of that kind of Money in his Hands, and the Board not having clear Conceptions of the Circumstances under which that Money rested in the Loan Office, they did not choose to give any Opinion on the Matter, till they should receive farther Information. Mean while the Comptroller General of the State demanded from the Loan Officer 390,000 Dollars of the New Emission Money of March 1780, and pursued the Demand in a Manner that occasioned minute Enquiry and Investigation.(2) November 8, 1786  Perceiving, however, that Matters were tending towards a Contest between the two Officers, rather than towards Accomodation, and that it might lead to a Discussion which it might be more prudent to avoid, I thought it best, before an Appeal should be made to the Principals on either side of the Question, to propose a Conciliatory Plan to the Board of Treasury, especially as I had reason to believe they were taking Measures to turn into Circulation upwards of 50,000 Dollars of the New Emission Money of 1780, which is that Part of the Money in dispute which, according to their View of the Matter they had a Right to appr[opr]iate, & which I supposed would in some Measure derange the Plan formed for the Redemption of that Species of Money. The Measures taken by the Comptroller seemed to have created some Degree of Resentment. I told them that I understood those Measures to be entirely his own without any Directions from superior Authority; that without enquiring into the Propriety of them, I wished on the present Occasion to wave them altogether, as I conceived that the Proposals I should make, if acceded to, would supercede and bury them in oblivion. I drew up a Memorandum of which the inclosed Paper No. 1 is a Copy.(3) At the same Time I told them I was not authorized on the Part of the State to make the Proposition, it was therefore not to be considered as binding on them, even if they should signify their Willingness to agree to it, till the State should cloathe it with Authority on their Part. After some Conversation on the Expediency of avoiding a Dispute which might & probably would occasion the withholding from the federal Treasury Payments to a much greater Amount than the Sum they were aiming to avail themselves of, they seemed to acquiesce in my Opinion, and gave me Reason to suppose they would report in Favour of transferring the 78,642 Dols. of the State Money to the Debit of the State in the general Account, tho' they would not do it without an Order from Congress. We thereforemoved a Resolution to that Effect which was referred to the Board for Report. They kept it under Reference for several Weeks. The Paper No. 2 contains a Copy of the Report which was made some Days ago; since which we have not had a Congress.(4) You will observe that the Board seem to consider the 78,642 Dollars State Money as a good Payment towards the 390,000 Dollars; but that, supposing it to be otherwise, they do not mean to comply with the Desire of the State in passing it to the general Account. Whether their present Difficulties in Money Matters will induce them to issue it or not is uncertain; but they seem to conceive they have a Right to do it at its depreciated Value and to pass it to the Credit of the State at such Value only. The Schedule (No. 3) affords much Matter for melancholly Reflection.(5) That Pennsylvania stands foremost in her Exertions to support the federal Credit, may afford some Consolation to her Citizens. But   the Aggregate of the Delinquencies is too great to be safely submitted to; and the Lethargy which generally prevails in the States seems to threaten a ruinous Increase of them. We have as yet but six States represented in the new Congress. This Week will close the Attendance of Col. Bayard. I wish much to be relieved even if it be but for a short Time, I therefore hope that at least two of my honble. Colleagues will shortly appear. I have the Honour to be with great Respect, Sir, Your most obedient & most humble Servant, Cha. Pettit ""

14040,dg0245,1786,Massachusetts House of Representatives,"""Massachusetts House of Representatives
 November 9, 1786 This day, in compliance with a vote of the Honourable House of Representatives, the Hon. Nathan Dane, Esq; appeared before them, and made a statement of the situation of public affairs. The Hon. Gentleman observed, that many subjects of importance now employ the public attention; but as most of them have been long under consideration, as the Hon. House was well informed generally in the affairs of the Union, and had lately received particular communications, he presumed it would be proper for him only to mention some things of more immediate concern and more particularly attended to of late. He observed, the general impost-system, the compleat adoption of which was so much to be wished for, remains nearly in the state in which it has been for several months past; that eleven States had adopted it, and the objections of the other two, New-York and Pennsylvania, he presumed, were considered of less weight, than they have been heretofore, and found not so many supporters; that those of the former were principally supposed to be founded in their constitution, and those of the latter in the condition of their internal debt. On the  November 9, 1786  whole it may be reasonably hoped, that a measure, on the adoption of which so much good must apparently result to the Union, and on the non-adoption of which, so much evil will be acceded to by these States, whose characters are respectable, whose dispositions are federal, and he clearly conceived were interested in adopting the measure. As to the supplementary funds, Mr. Dane observed, that there is not much reason to expect they will be established; that a few of the States only had passed any acts on the subject, and he believed that most of these acts, when carefully examined would be found ineffectual. And on mentioning this subject, he could not help observing, with pain and anxiety, the success particular men have had in impressing on the minds of many persons, in the remote parts of this State, in particular, an idea that their present burdens are principally occasioned by the establishment of these funds, and to be continued twenty-five years, when in fact these funds are not in existence, and if they were they could constitute but above one fifth part of the present tax; that it was a matter of surprize to him, that representations so false and so insidious, could gain credit with an informed and enlightened people; their good sense must certainly very soon discover them. Mr. Dane stated, that eleven States have substantially complied with the recommendation of Congress, of the 30th of April 1784, for vesting certain commercial powers in that body, and that the other two, New-Hampshire and North-Carolina, have failed only by going too far; that their acts manifest such a disposition to vest those powers in Congress, that their compliance may be soon expected. The Hon. Gentleman observed, that this system did not embrace all the powers necessary for making commercial regulations in all cases; that it contained but one of the two great principles on which trade is extensively regulated, that of laying prohibitions, but not that of taxing or subjecting trade to duties; however, that inthe present state of our trade and commerce, he conceived that the full adoption of this recommendation would enable Congress to make many regulations beneficial to the United States, and probably most of those that it may be wise at present to adopt. That all the States, except New-Hampshire and Rhode Island, had fully adopted the proposed alteration of the 8th article of the Confederation for quotaing the States, according to their numbers of inhabitants, &c. The Hon. Gentleman then observed, that the late arrangements made by Congress, for the settlement of the State accounts, for the discontinuance of the Commissioners in the several States, after the first of April next, and for instituting a board of three Commissioners, to sit when necessary, with powers, when written vouche[r]s cannot be obtained, to admit circumstantial evidence, and to report to Congress a state of claims not founded on the acts of that body, were after much   attention conceived to be the best, under all circumstances. He observed, that those who had not paid particular attention to the circumstances of the late war in the several parts of the Union, and to the state of the public accounts, can have but very imperfect ideas of them; that large claims are made by Virginia and other States, the regular evidence to support which, is said to be unavoidably lost, and several States also make very extensive claims not founded on the acts of Congress, the propriety of allowing which must be determined principally by taking a comprehensive view of the whole; that much care and attention is necessary to prevent the debt of the Union, from being improperly augmented. As the business of this board ought to be expedited, it is highly important that the States having such claims, should speedily state and arrange them, and their evidence to support them; many of which claims, particularly those of this State, are not properly arranged and prepared for examination. As to the establishment of a mint, the Gentleman observed, that no great pecuniary advantages could be expected from it at present, but he conceived the measure of considerable importance, as it tends to give us a national feature, to render our circulating medium more pure, and gradually to increase it; that much skill and attention is required in assaying the materials, mixing in the alloy, and in providing against counterfeiting the coins of the States or Union; that it may be doubtful whether the States will have full confidence in the coins struck by each other, and when they are struck at several mints in the Union, the probability being, that more base money may get into circulation. For these considerations, and to save expence, it is to be wished that the coinage of money, at the federal mint, may be made as extensive as conveniently may be. The Hon. Gentleman took notice, that another subject of immediate concern, was now before Congress: the laws of several States, said to be in violation ofthe treaty with Great-Britain. On these he could only observe, that it is the general opinion of those who have attended carefully to the subject, that a treaty formed by Congress under the powers of the confederation is a part of the law of the land, is a solemn compact made by the highest and constitutional authority in the United States, with a foreign power, and it is therefore a law of superior obligation, and cannot be controuled by any act of Congress or of any State; that all questions arising on treaties not adjusted by the contracting parties, ought clearly to be decided by the Judicial Courts of the respective countries, the constitutional bodies for this purpose; that any State being but a part of our nation, and by the forms of our government unknown to foreign powers in national transactions, cannot pass any law which can operate to explain or restrict the force of a treaty.(1) Perhaps it is the duty of Judges and Jurors to consider such laws repugnant to treaties, as void; but to aid their resolution, if he migh[t] use the expression, it may be proper for Con  gress and the States to declare that such is the force of treaties, and to prevent like difficulties in future. The Gentleman mentioned, that the affairs of the Western territory, and of the Indians, had long employed the attention of Congress, and more particularly of late; that Congress is instructed with the disposition and governing of an extensive and valuable tract of country, which has been justly considered as a fund capable of going far towards discharging the federal domestic debt, on which, and on the frontiers of the Middle and Southern States, are about sixty tribes of Indians, who probably muster about ten thousand warriors; that it has been the policy of Congress, to keep peace with these tribes; that Commissioners have been sent out from time to time to treat with them, who have assigned them lands to live and hunt on, and paid them for their other lands; and that treaties have lately been formed with most of the nations, of importance to the United States, and at a very great expence; Congress having formed several treaties, and made many regulations, for the disposing and governing of that country in the last year, begun the surveys of those lands they had purchased of the Indians; and then conceived that the 700 troops at that time called for, would be sufficient to protect the frontiers and secure the federal lands, against those tribes which had not formed treaties; that it was soon found that the Indians are not to be depended on, the surveys were interrupted by them, and the benefits expected from those surveys that year, were quite lost to the Union, and a considerable expence incurred; that during the last winter and spring, treaties being further formed and more of those 700 troops brought into service and ordered to protect the surveys, it was reasonably hoped that the Surveyors, the present year, would be able to prosecute their business without interruption. Early in the summer past, information was received of the hostile disposition of several of the tribes, andmeasures were then brought forward to augment the troops of the United States, to the numbers now called for; but it was then thought by the Delegates of this State, and of some of the other States, that there was not sufficient evidence of a general hostile disposition in those nations; but the information from that country since, has fully evinced the hostile intentions, of several tribes, and their determinations to prevent the surveys of these lands. The Indians express a general uneasiness at our progress Westward, and much pains seems to be taken by some traders among them, to promote this uneasiness; that in this situation of affairs, the hostile Indians must be brought to terms, or the disposition of those federal lands suspended. Considering the extensive frontiers and surveys to be protected, and lines of post necessary to be established, through an extensive tract of country, against many hostile tribes of troublesome enemies, the troops called for, cannot be more than adequate to these purposes; and on the other hand, it is to be hoped, that under their protection, the surveys of that coun-  try, may be carried on, and the Indians again reduced by them, to peace and order. Fort-Pitt will probably be the place of rendezvous for these troops, and it is to be ardently wished, that they may take their respective positions, and to be ready to cover the surveys, early in the ensuing season, and to act against such tribes as they may be directed. Mr. Dane observed, that there was another subject under consideration, about which different opinions are adopted; he meant the report made by the gentlemen who met at Annapolis, in Convention:(2) That the gentlemen in their report had made use of very general and indefinite expressions, that seem, however, to suggest the propriety of submitting the federal system of government in general to a revision, or to be changed: That it does not fully appear whether they had it in contemplation to do away the present system, and to adopt another on different principles, and with different features, or to preserve the principles and great out-lines of the present, and to make some alterations in it, to give it more strength and energy. If the former is intended, may it not be asked, if the public mind is prepared for it? If the latter, will it not be best to consider the progress already made in amending the present system? That the amendments proposed by the recommendations of the 18th of April, 1783, and 30th of April, 1784, will, when, obtained, remedy some of its most important defects; and as the States have proceeded so far in adopting them, it must be highly imprudent to submit now to examination, in a different form, objects contained in those amendments, and thereby effectually prevent any further progress in compleating these alterations, now almost obtained. Mr. Dane observed, that there are no doubt other alterations, that time and experience will point out to be necessary: That it must be soon well understood, that there is a want of energy to constrain each part of the Union reasonably to bear its due proportion of the common burthens; and tohold men in public trust in a proper state of responsibility, a federal judiciary may be found to be expedient for several purposes, the means of keeping up a punctual representation, &c. But that a question arises as to the best mode of obtaining these alterations; whether by the means of a Convention, or by the constitutional mode pointed out in the 13th article of the Confederation. In favour of a Convention it is said, that the States will probably place more confidence in their doings, and that the alterations there may be better adjusted, than in Congress. It is asked, what reason there can be for supposing this, as several of the States consider such a Convention highly inexpedient, and some States unconstitutional, and not all the States are agreed even in the propriety of a commercial Convention? That there is not sufficient reason to conclude, from the conduct of the States relative to alterations already proposed (more interesting, per-  haps, than any that may hereafter be proposed) that there is a want of confidence in those who recommend them; that the States may generally delegate the same men to the known constitutional assembly, that they may wish to send to a Convention; and when proper, can direct those full delegations to attend two or three months, for the purpose of fully adjusting such alterations: That the first principles of government are to be touched with care and attention. The Hon. Gentlemen further observed, that there was another subject, which, though not an object before Congress, exceedingly interested the feelings and attention of all men, friends to the happiness of these States; he alluded to the late commotions in this State. It was a matter that gave general alarm and anxiety to see a State so suddenly shaken to its very centre, whose respectability has been acknowledged; whose constitution has been considered as excellent; and whose exertions in the late war have been so great, and evidenced so much firmness in her laws and policy. All men, friends to the States, seem anxious to see the government again restored to its former firmness and order. That many things might be further observed on this subject, but he thought it his duty thus only to observe generally, not being properly among those object respecting which he was called upon to make communications to the Hon. House.(3) Reprinted from the Boston Magazine 3 (November--;December, 1786): 439--;43. 1 For Congress' March 21, 1787, declaration on this point, see Charles Thomson to the States, April 13, 1787, note. 2 For discussion of the congressional reception of the Annapolis Convention report in the context of the movement for amending the Articles of Confederation, see Doc.

 Dear Sir, New-york 9th. Novemr 1786 I direct this letter to Annapolis on a presumption that it will find you in your seat at the Assembly. I am very sensible that it is was in a great measure owing to your friendship and influence, that I had the honor of being appointed last year as a Deligate to Congress and altho I was then by no means either anxious, or sollicitous for it, And altho at present it would be injurious to my Interest to accept of the appointment, Yet as I find there has been some pains taken to injure my character, in order I apprehend, to prevent my being elected.(1) And as being turned out will imply a censure, I cannot help feeling a wish that I still may enjoy the confidence of my fellow Citizans. You are I am convinced better acquainted with my conduct in those matters, on which all the charges that have ever been made again[st] me are founded, then any other member in the Assembly, and as I had the honor of being nominated by you the last year, I would rather this year be put in nomination by you then by any other member, provided I am still so fortunate as to enjoy your good opinion, and as I am not conscious of having done any thing to forfiet it, I flatter myself it is the case. But should I be even mistaken in this fond hope, I am certain that your generosity and Candor will prevent your making any improper use of this confidential letter. I have not wrote, nor will I write, the smallest intimation on this Subject to any other member of the Assembly. I wrote a long letter by the last post to my neighbor Mr. Bond,(2) a deligate for Cecil, it contains some matters which I wish you to see, and altho it is of a secret nature, as you will discover, yet upon your Intimating this my wish to him, he will put it into your hands, prov[id]ed you wish to peruse it.

 Sir Novr. 11th. 1786. I should have sooner done myself the honor of answering your note of the 8th instant,(1) but having no such accurate knowledge of the subject, as I wished to communicate to you I thought to have obtained some information from my Colleagues. I did not receive all their answers until this morning---;but find them wholly unacquainted---;so I must give you what I have heard---;observing that it has been gathered from transient conversation in Carolina & not from any examination of authentic papers. The frigate South Carolina for whose use the compensation is now required of the Court of Spain, was the property of the Prince De Luxembourg. She was chartered by Mr. Gillon in behalf of the State of South Carolina. The Prince was to receive as her hire a certain proportion of all the prizes she should take. Upon this it is that I found my idea that the Prince is intitled to a share of whatever money may be received of the court of Spain as a compensation for the use of this vessel. What the proportion is I cannot say absolutely---;but think it is twenty four per Ct. If there is a necessity for accurate information on the head---;it can be obtained from the State of South Carolina & if you think it proper the Delegates will write for it.

Be assured I should not have drawn on you for a shilling Could I have encom November 11, 1786  passed the needful by any resource in my power, & prove to me that you can meet proper demands whenever they approach. To you the bill is gone you have received advice & be ready, for you must take it up. So much for meum & tuum. I am in my preparations for my return, & perhaps may see you in Richmond.  Now for politics---;the East is in tumult, the dreadful appeal is too probable. Preparations are making by the Insurgents with assiduity. Measures are also taken by Government lately with decision & firmness. It is suggested that Vermont & British America foster the Madness of the Malcontents by their councils and promises. Whether we shall conquer this effort or whether it will conquer us, depends on the pecuniary aid of the tranquil states. It is certain if Massachusetts yeilds, that the victors will extend their conquest, & very destructive consequences will pervade from that victory, the whole empire---;a mob government for a time, which will terminate in despotism among ourselves or from abroad. I rejoice in your decided overthrow of paper. To be sure the expedient of nominal money is getting so ridiculous that common sense begins to abhor it, & therefore the vote of the deligates of Virginia is not surprizing.(1) Still it is grateful & will be I hope nationally useful. In a letr. of the date of your last Mr. Madison tells me that my congressional conduct relative to the Mississippi navigation, or rather the proposed treaty with Spain is carped at. I cannot brook the dishonor which he suggests may befall me, altho my intended & wished for return home invites the disgrace.(2) A community ought to be tender of the reputation of her servants, I expected delicacy as well as justice from my country, or I never would have risked a reputation dearer to me, than rise on the precarious tenure of a democratic assembly. If I am deceivd I must submit, but my submission will be bottomed on necessity, not on respect to her caprices---;nor will Iforgive the authors of the assassination, or forget every proper moment if announcing my remembrance. It is wonderful that you should have been silent on this head. It proved their cunning & your lethargy. Turberville writes two letters to me & says nothing on the subject. I hope imaginary doctrines & Western prejudices will not govern the votes of my country. If they do, we shall suffer bitterly, but our sufferings will not be long, for full information will put all things right. Farewel, H. Lee Junr ""

This moment Genl. Knox & Mr. King left me having perused the part of your letr. which respects the Insurgents. They expressed the highest satisfaction in finding that your retirement had not abated your affectionate zeal for the prosperity of every part of the empire. Every day brings new information of the designs & preparations of the malcontents---;they are training their people, have officered some considerable bodys & are forming connexions with their neighboring states and the Vermontese. A convention has assembled to devise ways & means of supporting their military arrangements, & of doing such other things as may be necessary for the prosecution of their intentions. We have authentic information that they contemplate a re-union with G. Britain, & it is not improbable but that the convention now sitting will formally make propositions of this nature to Lord Dorchester (Sir Guy Carleton) who is arrived at Quebec with plenipotentiary powers as Governor General of British America. They also declare their willingness to establish an imperial government in the U. States and I beleive could they be indulged with their favorite wish abolition of debts they would chearfully enter into the plan of a fOEderal government assimilating the British government.(2) In some matters these people certainly  November 11, 1786  think right, altho they act wrong. A continuance of our present feeble political form is pregnant with daily evils & must drive us at last to a change---;then it would be wise that this necessary alteration should be effected in peace & governed by reason, not left to passion & accident. If the insurgent would submit to government, & by constitutional exertions induce their state to commence this change, they woud benefit themselves, their country & the Union. Good management might perhaps produce this wholesome conduct, but it is too probable that desperate & entriguing men may pursue private objects only. I enclose you a piece signed Belisaurius.

I will write to B.T.(1) ---;but I wish you had been particular in suggesting the points that I should dwell upon. I can hardly suppose it possible that he should entertain any Ideas unfavorable to public or private credit. As to the Greivances of the People, so loudly and generally complained of, I confess myself in Opposition to the Opinions of those who unite in these complaints. Greivances can not be suffered in a Government constituted as our Government is. The laws are the acts of a majority of the people---; every citizin by the nature of the social compact is bound to submit to this majority---;such laws cannot be considered as Greivous---;the Execution or administration of such Laws are not Greivances. If the laws are incautiously or unwisely enacted, and the majority think so, they may be annulled by the new Legislature. The operation of a Law inconvenient, or unwise in itself, can continue but a single year, because it will be repealed, if the majority unite in opinion that it is inconvenient or unwise. No law would be passed which would be so enormous or bad, that it would be intolerable for one year; what reason is there then for the complaints, and rash proceedings of the present opposers of our Government? I will not add upon this subject---;you have fully considered, and are extremely capable of examining, the subject---;my remarks must therefore be either erroneous, or unnecessary because they have before passed in your mind.

 Dear Sir. N. York 22nd Nov. 1786. Your kind favor has come to hand, & since that I have heard of my being again appointed in the delegation of our State.(1) I am sorry to inform you that my health still continues in a languishing way. I am nearly in the same situation as when you left me; I hope however that the cold weather & exercise with proper medicine will produce an alteration for the better. We have little news here. There is no Congress yet: of course no President elected. Mr. Nash of N. Carolina is talked of. He at present lies dangerously ill at this place.(2) The affair of the Missisippi hangs at present in suspence. I rather think nothing has been done in it. The M. Bay delegation have been more on the conciliatory plan, since the late insurrections in that State. They I believe depend greatly on the fOEderal aid, of course wish not only for a continuance of the confederation, but that it may be made more adequate to the purposes of government. I am sorry to inform you, that it is the belief of people here well informed that this insurrection threatens the most serious consequences; and that the objects are more extensive than the mere stopping the Courts of justice. It is supposed that Vermont is leagued with them, and that they are secretly supported by emissaries of a certain nation; as to this latter conjecture, I have heard no satisfactory proof.(3) Before I came to this place Congress passed a Vote for augmenting the troops:(4) the object you may easily comprehend. I hope that you and Mr. Jones will come forward soon; my health will not permit a constant attendance and the idea of the State's being unrepresented is extremely mortifying to me indeed if I do not shortly get better it will be my desire to return home.

 Dear Sir N York Novr. 22nd. 1786. I have recieved your favors, for which I am very much obliged to you. I am sorry to inform you I have continued ill ever since you left me in Philada. & I cannot say I am much better at this time. I look forward to a regular fit of the gout as an event greatly to be wished for. We have no news here; Congress have not yet elected a President owing to their being too few States on the floor. Mr. Nash of N. Carolina, who lies dangerously ill, is talked of generally, & nothing but his death or extreme ill health will I am perswaded prevent his election. Colo. Lee has heard of his being left out of the delegation and is far from being pleased at the circumstance. I own I am surprised at R. H. Lee's being continued when he did not serve a day last year. Had Colo. Lee been continued instead of him, all would have been right: he is preparing to return to Virginia. I wish that R. H. Lee may resign, and he be elected in his room.(1) The disturbances in Massachusetz bay have been considerable, and absolutely threaten the most serious consequences. It is supposed the insurgents are encouraged by emissaries of a certain Nation, & that Vermont is in the association: how it will end God only knows, the present prospects are no doubt extremely alarming.(2) I wish to know when Mr. Jones and Maddisson mean to come forward. It will be necessary for one to set out soon, as my attendance in Congress will be extremely precarious; of course the State will in all probability be often unrepresented untill one of them appears. Mr. Kortright has got quite well; and so is all the family: they are uneasy at not having letters lately from you and Mrs. Monroe. I believe they have not heard yet from the Captain. The Massachusetz delegation have been much more friendly I have understood since the late insurrection in their State: they look upon the fOEderal assistance as a matter of the greatest importance of course they wish for a continuance of the Confederation.Their General  November 22, 1786  Court is now a sitting, but I believe are fearful of taking any vigorous steps against the insurgents. Mr. King sets out from this next week to meet the N. York and the other of the Massachusetz Commrs. to effect a compromise respecting the latter agt. the former: it seems they have got unlimited powers on both sides.(3) I remain wth. great sincty., Yr.

I have omitted putting the number of days, if the Gentleman should not incline to take it under those Circumstances be pleased to get them to accept it in any number they may think convenient, & get it discounted; you may see what a scrape you have drawn yourself into by offers of service, let me advise you to be more Cautious in future especially to such a large Chap as myself, who to get a thing off his hands would seize on a much slighter offer than you have made. You will no doubt find it very difficult to raise funds to support the present engagements; but if you should agree to the Impost for the Use of Congress it will certainly much encrease; The Congress look up to our State with much Anxiety dreading a refusal as the forerunner of Anarchy & Confusion, they seem to think that New York will not chuse to refuse after the Acceptance of Pennsylvania, how that point may be appears (from some conversation I have had with the Gentlemen of New York) to be doubtful, tho I hardly think they would chuse to Stand alone. We attend daily at the Room with but little prospect of making a Congress under two or three Weeks, there are at present in Town seven States but Governor Nash is expected to live but a few days, & the New York & Massachusets Delegates leave town tomorrow for Har[t]ford in expectation of settling the dispute between their States, without applying to the Federal Aid which is extreemly tedious & expensive. I was rejoiced to see a motion of Mr Morris's for a new act to enable Luzerne to chuse an Assembly Man & Counsellor,(2) it would be a happy Circumstance to restore peace in that country, for while there are unsettled claims, there's no knowing to what lengths they may arrive. I wasmuch affraid the N.Y. dispute might afford shelter for some of the same Class of People under a right of one of the Harpers, which was refused in this State & afterwards on application made & a registring in Massachusets took place, & some people from that country decoyed under what they thought a good purchase, the numbers are not great, & many are willing to pay for the land to the proper Owners, besides this there are a number more than equal to them from Vermont, who have lost their property by an adherence to th[e]ir State, & who have lands given them adjoining Harpers, which they are determined to hold with their lives; this with the resolution of the Governor to support in the greatest extent the good order of Government will I hope hinder any settlement in this state that might aid the Wyoming people, in case they would not accept of reasonable terms. He says Allen has not the Confidence of those people, & he beleves he will not trouble us again; under all these assurances it would take a weight of[f] my mind to hear the matter was perfectly fixed.   I mentioned some days past to Mr King my Idea of the Back Lands, & the little chance of even the Expences being defrayed by them, which he seemed to Agree in, & said it amtd to Â£100,000 Dollars specie; it would prove a happiness to all the settled parts of the Country if the Ohio was to be the boundary for a number of years, as well as be a means of quieting the Indians & Spaniards.

Although I much regretted the backwardness of the states in sending forward their delegates, yet on this occasion I was glad there was not a Congress formed, because in that case, my duty would have obliged me to lay your letter before them immediately. Whereas now I have an Opportunity as a friend of recommending this matter again to your consideration, and I am persuaded that upon a review of all circumstances considering your own character and standing in the commonwealth as well as the nature of the appointment you will find that you cannot so easily decline it. Had you been appointed by the Agents of the two states and declined, they might have agreed upon some other. But there is no provision made for supplying a vacancy where the Court is constituted in the manner this has been of which you are a judge. Government has claims upon individuals for services as well as individuals upon government for protection, and these of so  December 1, 1786  binding a nature as to be indispensible and so essential that a noncompliance is a violation of the social compact. Although the federal government may in some instances be defective yet it has made a wise provision for settling disputes between state and state. The state over which you lately presided experienced the advantage of it in preventing the effusion of blood. But if the persons appointed judges to constitute the court for deciding the controversy can withdraw at pleasure and refuse to serve, the provision is vain. Being therefore of Opinion that nothing but an Act of God or invincible necessity can relieve a judge constituted as you are from a discharge of the duties of the office I hope you will reconsider the matter and by the return of the post give me an Opportunity of informing Congress of your acceptance. I write this in the confidence of friendship and not in my official capacity. I shall be happy to see you in New York & hope you will bring Mrs Dickinson & Miss Sally with you, to whom you will be pleased to remember me.

 Dear Sir!(1) New York December 1. 1786 You were So obliging as to indulge me with the Promise of your Correspondence, on my Return to this Country.(2) I have been prevented (from various Avocations) from availing myself of many opportunities that have offered, to inform you of my Arrival. I must confess that I did not find the United States in as flourishing a Situation as I had Reason to expect. Many Circumstances have combined to check their Prosperity---;their immense Consumption of foreign Manufactures has greatly injured them, by involving them in a heavy Debt to Europe, which they will not be able to extinguish in many Years. In the mean while, the Specie of the Country, which after the War, constituted its only circulating Medium, has been almost wholly exported, & many of the States have had recourse to the dangerous Expedient of Paper Money, which by not being in general well funded, has in many Instances, greatly depreciated. December 1, 1786  The Confederation is likewise an Evil of an alarming Nature. It does not possess Sufficient Powers to constitute a firm, vigorous, & energetic Government, Such as So extensive a Country demands. The Individual States, from the Sufferings they are exposed to from the Weakness & Inefficiency of the Confederacy, Seem disposed to vest Congress with Such Authorities as are necessary to pursue & preserve the general Interests of the Union. This will make their Administration respectable abroad, & vigorous at home. There is often a Turn in human Affairs, which baffles the Foresight of the wisest Men. After the immense Expences that G Britain incurred in the Prosecution of the War, her most Sanguine Friends had no Idea of her Affairs being So Soon retrieved, & her Situation So prosperous, as it now appears to be. She is indebted for these Advantages, to the Wisdom of her Councils & the Energy of her Government. I hope this Turn will Soon take place in our Affairs. Our Resources are great, the Industry & Intelligence of our People are not to be Surpassed, & I do not believe there exists a greater Fund of public & private Virtue than in this Country. Nothing is wanting but a good Government to direct these Advantages to public Good & private Benefit. We have daily Accessions of Inhabitants, from Emigrations from different Parts of Europe, particularly Germany; It is a pleasing Circumstance to a benevolent Mind to contemplate the advantageous Situation this Class of People is placed in, on their Arrival here. From being in a State of Vassalage in their own Country, mere Hewers of Wood & Drawers of Water, they find themselves entitled to all the Rights of Citizenship in a free Country, & with a Small Pittance enabled to purchase a Freehold Estate for themselves & family. It is really fortunate for human Nature, that there is a Country, where the oppressed of all Nations may find a Secure Asylum. I know no State in the Union that would be Soenvied as Pennsylvania, if it was not So defective in its Constitution & Form of Government. By possessing but a Single Branch of Legislature, Subject to an annual Change, its Laws are very often crude & indigested, & its Conduct governed by no System. A few factious & designing Men, possessed of popular Talents, may at any Time throw the Councils of the Country into Confusion, & if their Views are Selfish, bend the public Business to meet their private Convenience. However, as our Constitution has wisely fixed a Septennial Period, when its Defects may be remedied by a Council of Censors & a Convention, I hope the Citizens of the State will take Advantage of this Circumstance, & adopt a more perfect Form of Government. Having the honor of being appointed to represent the State of Pennsylvania in Congress, I Shall reside here, for the greatest part of the ensuing Year.

 Revd. & dear Sir, New York Decr. 4. 1786 I was in hopes that Mr White would have taken Bethlehem in his way, but I find by your letter of the 4 November that both my letters were sent to you from Philadelphia.(1) It gives me great pain to hear that the Indian Congregation are likely to suffer for want of provisions. Upon receiving your letter, I called on the Secretary at War who informed me that immediately after the passing of the resolution of which I sent you a copy in a former letter, he dispatched Orders to col Harmar to deliver to them on their application the 500 bushels of corn and other articles mentioned in the resolution.(2) It might be well if this information could be communicated to them that they might send & receive this supply. But it is to be presumed that in case of want they will apply either to col Harmar or the Superintendant or his deputy, who I understand resides at Pittsburgh. I hope there is no foundation for the reports of an intention to commit another massacre. I am sorry the spirits of the frontier inhabitants are so imbittered against the Indian nations and wish with all my heart this bitterness could be removed. I presume the Indian Congregation will continue this Winter at or near Cayahoga. But in case they should think proper to remove to their settlements on Muskingum, I am persuaded they may rely on col Harmars giving them all the protection in his power as he has received orders to this effect.

 Dr Sir, New York Decr. 8. 1786 Your Excellencies favors of the 10th & 18th Ult. I have been honoured with, for Colo. Crocket I will endeavour to obtain whatever may appear to be due to him.(1) December 8, 1786  Be pleased Sir, to accept my sincere congratulations upon your appointment to the Government of Virga(2) ---;you have sacraficed much, in point of Interest, to accept it, and it may happen, that your administration will not glide on without meeting opportunities for the full display of your Military, as well as political talents, and influence, in the supream command. How far the contagion of the Eastern disorders will spread, it may not be so proper to conjecture from the present quiet State of the other parts of the Empire, as from the experience of human Nature, and the Constitutions of our Governments. Man is impatient of restraint; nor will he conform to what is necessary to the good order of society, unless, he is perfect in discernment and Virtue, or, the Government under which he lives, is efficient. The Fathers of the American Fabric seem to have supposed the first of these principles, peculiarly, our lot, and have chosen it for a foundation: in the progress of experiment, the fallacy is discovered, and the whole pile must fall, if the latter cannot be supplied. The Spirit of insurgency in Massachusetts, has proceeded to a Stage, which renders the subversion of that Government, an event too probable. The Malcontents have assumed a deliberate and systematic conduct, and, every day, gain confidence and numbers. The inefficiency of Government has been felt, by its friends, as well as enemies, and many are falling in with the measures of the insurgents, who, at first, shewed a readiness, and actually turned out to oppose them. A personal exertion of the Governor, such as was made by Sullivan in N. Hampshire, might, perhaps, in the infancy of the business, have been equally successful in Massachusetts: there has, however, been a kind of lassitude, and indecision, distructive of the confidence, and zeal, of all the members of the State, except those of property. These will lose all, in the event of a subversion of the Government, and will, doubtless, make an effort to preserve it. TheLegislature have, during their late Session, brought forward Sundry experiments for suppressing the spirit of insurgency; Acts for bringing into operation force; for alleviating some, and removing others, of the greivances complained of; and, under these, one of indemnity, without an exception, provided advantage is taken of it, by oaths of Allegiance, by a certain day, have passed. Amongst the first description, is one for suspending the rights of the Act of habeas Corpus, and this seems, alone, to have attracted the notice of the Malcontents; they have added it to their list of greivances; have proceeded to appoint Military Officers for a large body of Men, and continue to suppress the setting of the Courts, and these things are effected, not in a tumultuous, but regular manner. Mr. Shays, their leader, orders them into motion whenever a Court is about to sit, and this proves Sufficient to procure an adjournment Sine die. Hitherto their measures have operated only in the infected Counties, but they have now   set about to extend their powers into the neighbourhood of Boston, where no symptoms of the malady have been discovered. Upon the approach of the Session of the Court at Cambridge, last Tuesday sev'night, it was understood that a large body of the insurgents would march there to suppress it. Government accordingly took arrangments for its protection, and troops were actually advanced to receive the Enemy, of whom about 180 had assembled at some Miles distance from Cambridge, but conceiving their numbers not sufficient for the enterprize, they retired. The last accounts are that the Court was proceeding without interruption, and that a troop of Horse had gone forward with orders to take as many of the insurgents as they could come up with in Arms. From the languor of Government upon every former occasion, there is but little reason to suppose the pursuit was pushed to any effect, and therefore it may lead to nothing of consequence, but it is thought, by those best acquainted with the State of things there, that not a drop of blood can be Spilt, nor Captive taken, without the immediate consequence of a civil War. Had the insurgents been in sufficient force to attempt the execution of their designs at Cambridge, Government would have had no alternative, but to open this dreadful scene, or yeild the compleat domination of the State to them; and a conflict, terminating in their favor, would probably have been attended with the same consequence. This business began in County Conventions forming long lists of greivances the most triffling and unmeaning, that can be conceived, nor was there even an agreement in the complaints of any two counties: all, however, agreed in the remedies. These were, a suppression of the Courts, and an \""emission of paper money subject to a depretiation, and made a tender equal to gold and Silver, in all cases whatever.\"" Many of the Malcontents have now, however, thrown off this flimsy veil, and openly declare for an abolition of debts public and private, and a distribution ofproperty; in justification of the latter object they say that, in the act of opposing the british Government, the whole property of the people was forfeited, and ought, in the success of the revolution, to be considered as a Common acquisition. It is said that a british influence is operating in this mischievous affair: in the progress of the thing this has happened, but it certainly originated in the genuine baseness of the people. It is an undoubted truth that communications are held by Lord Dorchester with both, the Vermonteers, and the insurgents of Massachusetts, & that a direct offer has been made to the latter, of the protection and Government of great Britain, which they at present decline to accept, but hold in Petto [i.e., reserve], as a last resort, in case future events may place them in desperate circumstances. They also declare that it is not their intention to touch the Continental Magazine, which is situated at Springfield, in the Midst of their country, unless driven to it to save their lives: they   will, however, think the time arrived for this step, upon the happening of any conflict; nor is their a prospect of an adequate protection from any quarter. Here is felt the imbecility, the futility, the nothingness of the federal powers; the U.S. have no troops, nor dare they call into action, what is called the only safe guard of a free government, the Militia of the State, it being composed of the very objects of the force; neither can reliance be placed upon that of the neighbouring States: N Hampshire has already shewn her kindred to the revolters; Connecticut is not free from the infection; and, the Legislative Acts of Rhode Island, have discovered that an opposition to <<baseness> these, can be expected from no order of people there. These circumstances have alike forbid the attempt to remove the Magazine at an earlier period, as they now do that of protecting it. Any step to this purpose would have hastened the measures of the Malcontents; they were compleatly masters of the surrounding country, and that they would not permit the execution of the business, was certain. The attempt therefore must have been followed by the double consequence of cutting off all possibility of accommodation in the State, and blending the Union with her in a civil War. It was thought by Congress most politic to leave the Stores to the Mercy of events; to impress the insurgents with the distinction between Continental & State property, and idea that the United States had confidence in their fidelity and attachment to the Interests & government of the Union: thus have Congress been compelled to substitute a passive policy, for that exercise of power which would ensure stability and consequence to the federal, as well as State Governments. Upon the meeting of the Legislature of Massachusetts a verbal application was made, by her delegates in Congress, for the federal aid, this being the only practicable mode; a constitutional one, must have come from the Legislature, and could not have beenobtained, with the essential forms and authorities, without becoming a subject of public knowledge, and spurring the insurgents to immediate hostilities. Congress felt their embarrassments upon the occasion---; the mode of application was not a proper one, this difficulty was, however, reconciled upon the doctrine of necessity, but the inability of the federal Government to do any thing effectual, and, upon this consideration, the impolicy of provoking the hostile dispositions of the insurgents against the Union, from which the least inconvenience that could be calculated on, was their resort to the British Standard, necessarily came into view. Upon the whole, it was thought best, to take only a preparatory step, to be in readiness for whatever prudence, and necessity, might require in future. The Resolves of the 20th of October were the result of this determination.(3) The Western troubles are prefixed as the cause, nor were they intirely out of view, but those of Massachusetts immediately operated. The views of the insurgents are   indeed so unworthy, that the honor of the Union is interested; the Virtuous part of a State ought to meet, in the federal aid, a Sheild against the nefarious designs of a licentious Banditti, when the evil has become too extensive for their own controul. What further events will arise out of this unfortunate business must be unfolded in its progress. My conjectures are that should any act of violence shortly happen, a civil War must be inevitable, and to accedant we must trust for the consequences---;but despondency is not a common attendant of mine, and therefore I look forward to one possible ground of accommodation. Could a pause take place for a while, so as to admit the exercise of reason and reflection---;so enlight'ned a people must have enough of both, to behold in a proper light the baseness of the present pursuit. The means of a decent retreat may be sought for, and this may certainly be found in a compromise at the next election---;a change of Men in the Government would bring about a thorough investigation and correction of public measures---;real greivances may be remedied, pretended ones will not be urged---;it is said that there are causes of uneasiness, but although those may have been the first principles of action they have ceased to operate, could the minds of the people be once brought back to them all might yet go well. This instance, terminate however it may, will doubtless teach the necessity of efficiency in government. And perhaps it would be best placed in the federal head---;indeed if this cannot be got in the present form, some other ought immediately to be devised, a change of choice, will, probably be one of wisdom---;if it is left to accident, we cannot account for the result. That great Britain will be in readiness to improve any advantage which our derangements may present for regaining her lost dominions; we are not to doubt. All her appointment to her Colonies, as well as Missions into these States, are calculated to this Object. Lord Dorchester is knownto be penetrating and judicious, & the people are in the habits of thinking favourably of him. A Mr. Smith, formerly of this City, is sent with his Lordship in the Character of Cheif Justice.(4) He is a Man of talents, well acquainted with our Natural tempers & dispositions, and quitted the country, in the firm persuasion, that events like these which now prevail, would lead to a reunion of us with G.B. Mr. Temple has been here for some time, in the appointment of Consul General. A Mr. Bond formerly of Phila has lately arrived as Consul for the Middle States,(5) and it is said others are to be sent for the Eastern and southern: and thus the scheme of communication will be compleat. It is the practice of nations to admit Consuls from all, with whom they have any Commerce, but I do not conceive there can be a right of admission, unless there is an existing commercial Treaty. Mr T. was recognized before my time in Congress, and I am unacquainted with the principles upon which he was received. Mr.   Bond has arrived since the adjournment and his reception remains to be contemplated. I trust that I shall never harbour unreasonable jealousies, but when we know that an insidious foe, is vested with the garb of peace and freindship, it behoves us to be vigilant, especially when we are vulnerable in so many ways. The communications contained in this letter I conceive it my duty to make to Your Excellency, it being proper that you be fully informed upon so important a subject. I have endeavoured to found them upon the best information, and can pledge myself for the authenticity of them. How far it may be proper to suffer them to become public I leave to your own judgment. It may be well to communicate them confidentially to some of the members of the Legislature: it would however be a breach of the injunction of secrecy, and impolitic, to commit to public view the part that Congress is acting in the business.(6) My honourable Colleague Mr. Grayson is much indisposed and has been so for some time, I wish to see some of the New Members come forward. There has not yet been a sufficiency of States to form a Congress nor do I see a prospect that there will shortly be one. I have the Honor to be, with the highest respect, Your Excellencies Most Obt.

 Dr Sir Hartford 10 Decr. 1786 A party of men assembled at Concord under Shattuck, Parker & Page, to oppose the sitting of the court of common pleas at Cambridge on the 28th ult, but not meeting with assistance from Worcester & Bristol as they had been led to expect they gave up their design, and were  December 10, 1786  returning to their respective homes, when a party of men under the Sheriff of Middlesex aided by the those from Boston commanded by Col. Hichborn, over took and apprehended Shattuck, Parker and Page.(1) These men are now confined in the Boston Goal. Tuesday the 5th instant was the day assigned for the sitting of the court of common Pleas at Worcester; previous to that day Shays repaired to that County, and assembled a force in opposition to the court. On Tuesday the Judges preceeded by the Sheriff went towards the Court House, but were denied admittance by the insurgents. The Sheriff read the Riot Act, some of the Judges harangued the Insurgents, and finally by agreement or otherwise the Judges were permitted to enter the court House, where they opened the court and immediately adjourned the scene to a late Day in January. It is reported that a majority of the council was against any measure which might have brought the Question to an issue of Force; otherwise the well affected militia would have been collected in opposition to the Insurgents. By information received last evening from Worcester, on Friday last Shays had under his command, a body of 1500 Men well armed at that place, and at Rutland, about 18 Miles distant. The convention Troops were some Time of the Barracks which they formerly occupied. The division at Worcester are quartered upon the Inhabitants. The Insurgents are plentifully supplied with provisions which are brought to them daily by their Friends---;they conduct with great decorum to individuals, and have not yet been discovered to have plundered in a single instance. Their Force increases and the Gentleman who gives me this information adds that he met 200 Men in one body after leaving Worcester on Friday, on their way to join Shays---;the avowed object of remaining their together since the adjournment of the court, is the liberation of Shattuck, Parker & Page---;and to accomplish this purpose, they affirmed on Friday, that Shays had sent an express to the Governordemanding the liberation of the Prisoners and giving notice if he was refused, that he would march his party to effect that Object in another way. What measures have been pursued on the part of Government, I have not learnt. The post left Boston on Thursday morning, the idea then entertained there was that the Insurgents would separate after preventing the sitting of the Court. Knowing that the situation of this unhappy commotion would be the subject of curiosity, & perhaps anxiety, with the Gentleman of Congress, I cannot suffer the post to pass without this communication. The Gentleman is personally known to me from whom I received my information, I therefore give it full credit so far as relates to the positions and numbers of the Insurgents. I hope to be in New York some Time next week---;with Sentiments of Esteem & Respect, I am Dr. Sir your Obt. & very Humble Servant, R King(2)  ""

 Gentlemen December 16th 1786 Agreeable to Youre Resolve of Yesterday(1) I <<we> proceed to Lay before You a subject of importance,(2) which has for som time employd the deliberation of Congress. Som time prior to my <<our> Arrival at New York, Don diego de Gardoqui the Minister of Spain appear'd at the seat of Congress, & produced a Commission from his Catholic Majesty, to fix the Boundery between the United States & the King his Master, in which was contain'd som general expressions that imply'd a power to negociate a treaty of Commerce, in consequence whereof, the United States in Congress Assembled, granted to John Jay Esqr. Secretary of forreign affairs; Plenipotentiary powers to negociate a treaty of commerce, & fix the Boundery of the United States with Mr Gardoqui, Insisting as an ultimatum, on the free navigation of the  December 16, 1786  river Missecippey, & the Boundery as stipulated by the Treaty with Great Brittain. This subject remaind in a state of privasy, untill Tuesday the 30th of May last, when a letter was receiv'd in Congress from the Secretary of forreign affairs, who complaind of an obstruction that prevented his proceeding on the negociation with Mr Gardoqui, & requested Congress to appoint a Committee invested with equal Powers to assist him in the negociation, & Desired, that the existance of such a Committee should be kept a secret, to which Congress did not agree, but the day following thought proper to appoint a committee to confer with Mr. Jay on the subject, & give information to the house. In this situation the business remaind until Tuesday the 1st of August, when Mr. King mov'd to have the Committee discharg'd & the subject refer'd to a Committee of the house. To this preposition there arose Various objections. It was at length agreed that Mr Jay should appear before the house on the Thursday following to give an account of his proceedings on that business, at which time the secretary appear'd, & produc'd two letters from Mr Gardoque introductory to the negociation, in which the embassedar denied the right of navigating the Missecippey to be in the United States. He used som arguments to evince the Advantages that would arise to the United States by closing with the offers of the King of Spain. The secretary then offerd various reasons to discover the advantages that would arise from a treaty of commerce with Spain, & the Disadvantages consequent on a refusal, & urgd in pressing terms the expediency of relinquishing the right of navigating the river Missecippey, for the space of 25, or 30 Years, & concluded by reading the articles of the propos'd treaty, the substance of which were as follows Viz: The trade to be on principles of pefect reciprocity, a Tariff to be setled by commissioners in one Year after the ratification, importation to be freely made in each others Vessels,the Duties to be paid by each, in the ports of the other, the same as those paid by the natives. Masts & spars to be purchased from the United States for the Use of the Navy of Spain, & paid in specie, provided the[y] are as good & as cheap as those procured from the Baltic. Permission also to go to the Canaries, her ports in the West Indies, & in South America to be shut, & the article of Tobacca to be prohibitted in her European ports. The secretary then withdrew, & Congress after Various Debates agreed to refer the subject to a committie of the whole, who accordingly entered on the Business on Thursday the 10th of August, and continued on that subject until Wednesday the 23d, at which time the Committee agreed to report, on Monday the 28th, when the subject was again agitated with that warmth, which might have reasonably been expected on a Matter of such importance, & on Wednesday the 30th of August the Question was taken, when seven states Voted to repeal the Ultimatum & give up   the navigation of the Missecippey. Viz: New Hamshire, Massechusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Jersay, & Pensilvania. This Measure was oppos'd by Maryland, Virginia, North Carolinia, South Carolinia, & Georgia, who used their utmost endeavours to fall upon Conciliating terms, offering to grant to the King of Spain a Duty of 2Â½ per Ct. for all produce Landed at New Orleans, & to forbear carrying any kind of Merchantdise up the river, but return in emty boats, which proposals was refus'd. The arguments now turn'd on propriety of seven states repealing an ultimatum which enlarg'd the powers of a Negociator, when nine states was required by the Federal Compact, to enter on treaties. Mr King observ'd that nine States was only competant to enter on treaties, but seven were sufficient to repeal, & the power which could repeal the whole might certainly repeal any part. Various attempts were made to procure the Yeas & Nays on this important question, which was repeatedly evaded, & at length set aside by the previous question. On Monday the 4th of September it was agreed by the contending parties, to let the matter rest until Mr Munroe and Mr King return'd from Philadelphia, being appointed to attend the Assembly of Pensilvania. After their return the subject was renewed, & attempts made to prevent the journals of Congress on that subject, from being delivered to the Secretary of forrein affairs. But all in Vain, for on Wednesday the 26th of September, the[y] were delivered up. & we have reason to fear the Treaty is now on foot, if not compleated. It will rest with Youre Honorable House to Determine, the expediency of Instructing Youre Delegates either to consent to, or oppose, the ratification, as shall appear most advisable. Thus Gentlemen I have given You a concise account of the proceedings of Congress on the subject of the Spanish Treaty. I beg leave to subjoin the reasons that induced me to oppose the Measure. 1st: it was my Opinion that the United States inCongress Assembled, are not by the Federal compact, invested with power to Dispose of any of the priviledges, whether natural, or acquired, of the Individual States without their consent first obtain'd. Admit the position, & oure Dearest priviledges are rendered precarious, & insecure. Grant Congress the Power occluding the Missecippey, & by parrity of reason, every other river in the United States must be at their Disposal, which appears an absurdity, inadmisible. Vattell on the Law of Nations, in his chapter of mixed rights, observes that navigable rivers are not annexed to the sovereignty, nor can the[y] be added to the Domain, without the express grant of the people. 2d: the partial advantages offered by the propos'd treaty, the Eastern States are to recieve the benefits, by the sale of their fish & oile, which are consum'd in Spain, & the Southern States are to pay the purchase, by giving up the Missecippey, whilest Tobacca the staple commodity in som of the States are excluded, & the subjects of Spain   are admited into all oure ports without exception while the Citizens of the United States are precluded from the west India Islands, & south America. Spain grants us no exclusive priviledges, she has it in her power to encourage the trade of other nations, to a degree that may amount to a prohabition of the United States, & the reciprocity propos'd by the project exist only in term. The Duties paid in the ports of Spain are from 15 to 20 per Ct. whilest those paid in the United States are at present, 2Â½, & should the impost take place at 5 per Ct. the Tarriff propos'd may be evaded, as it requires joint consent of parties. Under these circumstances it is not dificult to Determin where the Ballance of advantages will remain. 3d & Lastly the pernicious Consequences inseperably connected with the measure, the Alienation of the Citizens, & the Depreciation of the Vallue of the Lands on the Western waters, on this subject it is needles to enlarge, as the disadvantages arising therefrom, must appear conspicuous to every Gentleman of Moderate discernment. One circumstance it may be proper to add, by a letter received in Congress on Tuesday the 26th of September, wrote by Mr Smith from London, advising Congress to gaurd against the British Influence in the Western Country.(3) Having annexed my <<our> reasons for opposing the Treaty, You Gentlemen will be able to Judge of the propriety of my <<our> Conduct. I <<we>(4) presume every other necessary Intelligence have been Laid before Youre Honorable House, by his Excellency. From Gentlemen, Your Most Obedient Humble Servant, Timothy Bloodworth ""

 Dr. Sir, New York Decr. 18. 1786 Your favor of the 4th Instant was received by the last post.(1) It was fortunate that the same causes of the delay of the Mail, operated also to prevent the sailing of the Packet---;with very little trouble I placed your letter in the hands of Mr. Chavalier.(2) The re- election of Colo Lee has afforded me the highest pleasure, as it undoubtedly relieves his feelings, but I am at the same time deeply affected by the loss of Mr. Jones from the delegation.(3) I cannot learn that Mr. Jay is proceeding in the business of the Mississippi. He probably will waite to see the Countenance of the new Congress. If he can assure himself of the cover of a bare majority, I believe he will make the treaty, and rely upon the timidity of some of the dissenting States for ratification. It is probable the Eastern column will be broken in Jersey and Pensylvania, and, it is equally so, that there will be a change in some of the Southern States. The business of a convention is well brought forward by Virginia, and I hope their act will be generally adopted. The dereliction of Massachusetts is, however, to be apprehended. The delegation of that State prevented the recommendation of the measure from Congress, as suggested by the deputations at Annapolis, and advised its non adoption in their Legislature.(4) The effect of this advice, I have not been informed of, but the natural supposition is, that nothing was done in the late session, and there will not be another, before the time proposed for the convention of the deputies. The reasons given by these Gentlemen for their opposition are, that the mode of amending the confederation is provided by the Act itself. Amendments, are to, originate with Congress, and, be agreed to by the States, and that it  December 18, 1786  would derogate from the dignity and Weight of that body, to take a secondary position in the business. This is an elevated idea, and, in an efficient Sovereignty, would be a wise one. The truth is, we have not a government to Weild and Correct, but must pursue the most certain means for obtaining one.

 Sir, New York Decr. 21. 1786 I have just seen your \""view of the debts and expences of the Com- December 21, 1786  monwealth of Pensylvania and of the funds and revenues of the same.\""(1) In the 14 page you remark that \""the amount charged by the United States advanced to Pensylvania from April 1776 to Decr 1782 when reduced to specie by the continental scale is 2,075,606 48/90 dollars\"" and that \""the amount which the state will be entitled to have a credit for in the said account will, you are confident exceed the foregoing sum and leave a balance in favour of the State equal at least to the balances due by the state in specie on the existing requisitions, which according to act of Congress of April 27, 1784 is allowed to go in discharge thereof.\"" I do not clearly comprehend the meaning of this. Do you imagine that the balance in favour of the state will exceed the State's proportion of the advances made by all the states on existing resolutions of Congress for the common defence? This I am aware can only be founded on conjecture until the accounts of all the states are liquidated. And therefore it would have been well either to have omitted the paragraphs above recited or to have expressed them in a different manner. Every State you know has received sums from the public treasury, and every state has made advances for the common defence and thinks or affects to think that the Union is endebted to it. The truth is that every State must be debited with the advances made to it and credited for whatever advances it has made either in men, money, provisions &c whether on requisitions or in virtue of existing resolutions of Congress & the balances, whatever they may be, will be carried to an aggregate fund which will be the debt of the Union and will be apportioned on the several States according to the rule of apportionment in the Confederation or by the number of Inhabitants. Now suppose all the accounts settled & the balances carried to this aggregate sum and that sum again apportioned on the states, will the balance of Pensylvania be greater or less than its proportion? If less the deficiencywhatever it may be will be a debt on the State & charged in future requisitions; but if greater, the balance will be passed to its credit and it will be allowed for the amount thereof or which will be the same thing, the state will be allotted the same in discharge of future requisitions. And therefore until the Accounts of all the states are thus settled & the balances carried to the aggregate sum & that sum is apportioned all that can be said on this head is that the state will have a large balance to be carried to the aggregate debt, of which it will be chargeable with its just proportion. But this ought not to be held out as discharging any part of the existing requisitions. More especially those made since the conclusion of the War. And for this reason the paragraph following which seems to confine the View of the legislature to the payment of 55,004 dollars before 1 June 1787 in full of all the existing requisitions is very exceptionable since nothing less than a payment in specie of the whole balance of 356,440 68/90 dollars as stated in the first page of your View together with the proportion of   facilities assigned to the State for interest can be a full discharge of the existing resolutions of Congress. You have seen the address of the legislature of Massachusetts to their Constituents and the amount stated of the monies raised in that state since 1780. It is alledged that that state has paid more taxes in that time than any state in the Union, I wish I could see a like statement of all the monies raised in Pensylvania within the same period. You will excuse this freedom. It is only taken with a view to induce you to reconsider this subject, & to render Your view as perfect & compleat as possible.

Upon these considerations I have determined to seize the present moment and shall set out early in the next week.(1) In the mean time I think it proper to give you notice of the circumstance, that you not rely upon my being present. I shall leave Colo Grayson here, who will be well enough to form with yourself a representation, but he is far from being recovered. My absence will not exceed six or eight weeks. We have as yet no Congress nor do I see a near prospect of one, but it will be well for you to get on the floor as early as you can.(2) Inclosed is a paper containing a letter from Mr. Calonne Comptroller General of the Finances of France to Mr. Jefferson which is truly interesting to the U.S.(3) I am dr Sir, Yrs. Sincerely, Ed. Carrington ""

 Dr Sir, New York Decr. 27. 1786 Sometime in July you inclosed a certificate of one David Atcheson requesting an explanation of a disagreement between it, and the balance appearing in his favor upon the list of debts.(1) Since the arrival of the Vouchers I have made the necessary examination, and have made a note on the back of the certificate, to which I beg leave to refer you. It is now returned. I will thank you for a statement of the payments you have made to the Creditors on my lists of debts that I may make in the Books the respective charges and form lists of the balances now remaining due. I think it will not be worth while to keep the business of it any longer and wish to get clear of it. Have you recd. from Mr. Webb a remittance of Â£100.6.8 Virga. money? I will set out early in the coming week for Virga. and will have the pleasure to see you as I go through Philadephia. I am Dr. Sir, your Servant, Ed. Carrington(2) ""

 My Dr. Sir(1) New York 27. Dec. 1786 I was unfortunate in being absent from this place at the Time you passed through it on your Return to Boston, you however afforded me a very genuine satisfaction by the friendly letter for me, which I received immediately on my Arrival. Mr. Hutchins has not arrived at this place; you may be assured that I shall be very attentive to your Ideas on the subject which you mention relative to your connection with his Department.(2) I have conversed with General Knox upon the other point, which is of more importance. You must be convinced that he is  December 30, 1786  your freind; his Ideas are in perfect correspondence with mine relative to your situation & just expectations. Whether your Wishes are practicable, I will not pretend to decide. My best exertions will be dedicated to their accomplishment. The Times are critical. The profession of a soldier will of consequence become more & more valueable. I hope you will not think of retiring. I indeed suppose you ought to engage. Depend on your own Talents, and the conviction, which your Freinds have of their superiority, for the Gratifications, which with great propriety you may claim. I will not add, except to assure that I am warmly & sincerely Your Friend & Hble Servt., Rufus King ""

 Sir New-York December 30th. 1786 The Consul General of France(1) has long been endeavouring to obtain an Exact Accot of what and how much each State annually Exports of her own Groth & Manufacture and has Obtained it from every other but North Carolina. And as I [am] sure it can be productive of nothing but good to the State that her exports should be known to him and thro' him to his Nation I take the Liberty of requesting that your Excellency will be pleased to direct the several Naval Officers to transmit to the Delegation of North Carolina in Congress without delay an exact Account of each & every Article Exported from that State in the Years 1785 and 1786 of her own Groth and Manufacture Certified under their hands with their Official Capacities.(2) The States in General publish in the News papers an Account of their Annual Exports, South Carolina has lately published hers in which the utmost particularity has been Observed even to the naming the Class of the Vessel that is whether, Ship, Brig or any other kind, and the Nation to which Each Vessel belong'd in which any of their produce was Exported.

 Dear Sir Sunday One OClock. [December 31, 1786] I recd. your Letter last night & as tomorrow is the first of Januy I have been taking the necessary steps to forward the buisiness of the lands, from my Calculation it appears to me to be much more advantageous to both of you, to make a final redemption which can be done for 14 Years purchase, the whole sum will not exceed Â£112. & you may get Holker in all probability to pay a considerable portion of it as his Lands then would be clear of any future demands, & if you have to pay till the time you sold deducting the Eight Years it may in all probability amount to as much. This you will consider, & give me an answer on immediately; I have got Colo Fish to call upon the Treasurer with my State of the Matter, and offering to lodge Certificates sufficient for the purpose till an answer can be had, in which way I shall act, for indeed you dont tell me what time you sold the lands, & therefore were it plain sailing I would chuse to wait your answer. There is likewise a tract of 5,000 left by my Father but how to describe it I am perfectly at a loss, I beg you will consider of it, & communicate it to Mr Clymer who can turn to the papers, & give a perfect description of it, the same mode I would recommend as in the former Case. This being Sunday & the mail made closed before two, I have been taken up in putting the land matters in train; tomorrow, or if possible to day, some steps shall be taken to put in motion the secretary &c &c & I have no doubt that the necessary papers will get in time, I wish you were in as much certainty of receiving a favourable decision, as you are in the having the paper. If you should think of any thing else, they may I think get to hand before the decision takes place, you will consider that such a large sum as you have a demand for is hard to be raised, & there will be proportionately a great resistance to a concluding verdict, & if you have not all your papers, signatures & segelatumaccording to Gunter, there will be a procrastination in the buisiness, therefore I shall be very neat & take care that the Publick shall be convinced of my great Industry & precision, both of which you have had so many proofs of that you will wonder how the World can be so blind as not to give me credit for. The time approaching for closing the mail & having a letter to write Mrs. M, you will excuse whats written, & whats deficient. Intended frequently to write Mr Hill but having a great antipathy to it, & generally deffering till the post was near setting out that I have  January 4, 1787  with difficulty wrote Mrs M. of whom I have continually inquired of Nancy health which she has repeatedly informed me was mending that it may continue so is the fervent wish of hers & yours, Sincerely, Saml Meredith [P.S.] Remember me to Mrs & Mr C.

Mr. Adams who contrary to his own sentiments has been hitherto silent in Convention, has given his public and explicit approbation of Mr. Hancocks propositions. We flatter ourselves that the weight of these two characters will ensure our success; but the event is not absolutely certain. Yesterday a committee was appointed on the motion of a doubtful character to consider the propositions submitted by Mr. Hancock and to report tomorrow afternoon. We have a majority of fOEderalists on this Committee and flatter ourselves the result will be favorable: P.S.
