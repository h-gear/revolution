 Dr. Sir New York 22 Nov. [17]86 Mr. Gorham left us on Monday, I expect to leave this place for Hartford on Friday.(1) No addition of Delegates since I wrote you last. I wrote a note to each of the Printers in this City & requested that they would not insert any thing in their papers relative to your communication with the Legislature,(2) as the accounts were very erroneous. Nothing has been or will be published. I have nothing to add except that we have a copy of the Treaty of Amity & Commerce concluded between Morocco & the US.(3) Its duration is Fifty years.

 Dear Sir Thursday 2Â½ Clock Januy 4, 1787 After a Slight conversation with a Col Fish at breakfast I retired to my Room & wrote in a hurry what you must have recd. in which I misstated the payments of quit Rents, in considering the matter further & a second application to him, I find it will be only necessary for you to mention the time You sold to Mr Holker from that, deducting the 8 Years will leave the sum to be paid, which can be done in the way you proposed, & if Mr Holker chooses to settle it finally & releive himself from any future payments, he must pay up thereon due to the time, & then pay 14 Years purchase. The Treasurer fell from his Horse some time past, broke his leg in several places, & has not been visible unless to his Friends, so that I got Col Fish who is one, to give him an Extract of your Letter, & an offer if he should think proper to lodge the Certificates in his hands till I could get your answer to a letter I had written, in this way the matter rests at present. The other papers I will try to get & send by this Post but if I should fail you may depend on them by the Next. Monday was new Years day on which there was no business done in the Offices. I am anxious to hear how the Bank matter was decided on, it was coming very near to have but a Majority of one, if they lessen in the same ratio on the other readings it must be thrown out.  Give my love to Nancy & believe me to be, Dr. Sr. Yours &c,  Sam Meredith P.S. I waited to the last moment to give You some further information respecting the papers. I find from Mr Duer that in all probability they will be finish'd this Evg. All this Morng have been employ'd in trying to find out some private hand that will leave this tomorrow. If none offer shall send them by express as the post dont leave here again till Monday which is the 8th. ""

 Dear Sir,(1) Newyork January 7th 1787 Not since the 19th November have I heard nor recived a single line from you and I never was more anxious in particular about the Proceedings of the Assembly and much as I wish to hear yet I am afraid to hear for I fear your party has been a weak one but pray give it all to me the bad with the good.(2) At present only the States of S.C., Penna., N.J. and N.Y are represented, from Georgia there's Col. Few, N.C. myself, V[irginia] Col. Grayson, M[aryland] none, D[elaware] none, C[onnecticut] Docr. Johnson, Rhode Island none, M[assachusetts] Mr. King, N.H. none. Few from Letters recived expects a Colleage and so do I, M[a]dison is shortly expected from Virginia, Marryland is expected shortly on the floor & Johnson & King are in Expectations of Colleagues shortly the former daily, from this State of facts you may judge as well as any body when we shall probably have a Congress. If it did not appear to me quite Certain that a certain Friend of yours will be president(3) I would certainly return home as soon as I could after the Assembly had adjourned and indeed even with that Certainty in view if I could do it consistently with the Wishes of my friends I believe I should. I wrote to Thos. Blount(4) by the British Packet which sailed yesterday under Cover to Mr. Benjamin Eyre. The Brother of Mrs. Eyre Mr. Richd. Smith is here at present, he was formerly a Merchant of Boston of much Business. At present he is closing his Business. I was introduced to him by Mr. Skipwith. He has made large Purchases of back lands in Virginia and within this Week made another of 40 or 50,000 Acres at 6d an Acre in which I believe Mr. Eyre is interested. Capt. Cossa arrived here on Friday the 5th and informs me that there was no accounts of Jacob or McDaniel when he came over Ocacock on the 24th Decr. My Compliments to Polly and believe as usual Yours, Wm.

 My Dr. Sir New York 7 Jan. 1787 Congress is not yet organized, and it is uncertain when it will be---;The Anxiety and Dissatisfaction still continues, which has for some Time existed concerning the Government of these States. God only knows what will prove the Issue. It is most certain that things will not long continue in their present condition, if foreseeing the Dangers which hang over us, we do not unite in measures calculated to establish the public Happiness, I am confident that no Man will be able to bear up against the calamitous Events, which will otherwise force themselves into Existence. January 7, 1787  You have seen the Virginia law for the appointment of Delegates to a convention in Philadelphia in May, Genl Washington, Mr. Wythe, Randolph, Maddison & others are appointed for this convention. Pennsylvania have appointed Mifflin, the two Morris, Fitzsimmons & three others on the part of that State. Hamilton who is a member of the Assembly of this State will exert himself to induce them to send Members. Jay & others are opposed to the measure, not alone because it is unauthorised, but from an Opinion that the result will prove inefficacious. Genl. Washington will not attend, although there will be at the same time & place a general meeting of Deputies from all the State Societies of the Cincinnati. If Massachusetts should send deputies, for God sake be careful who are the men---;The Times are becoming critical, a movement of this nature ought to be carefully observed by every member of the community. I thank you for the trouble you have taken in the negotiation of my little Draft on Mr. Lewis. Mr. Osgood has paid me the amount of your Draft. I never had heard a Whisper on the subject of the conduct of the Mr. Waltons, and upon Enquiry am induced to believe there is less foundation for your Apprehensions than perhaps you are led to imagine. I never have heard the subject was mentioned in any company, and since the Receit of your Letter I have enquired but cannot find any person who has ever been at an Entertainment given by any of the Walton Family except the usual ceremony which took place when Miss Walton married Mr. Roosevelt. Mrs. King unites with me in compliments to the ladies, & I beg you to be assured of the constant Friendship of Yours sincerely, Rufus King ""

 Dr. Sir New York 7 Jan. 1787 As I am uncertain of the precise terms, Which I have received from your Office as pay, during the time I have served as a Delegate in Congress; I pray you to have the Goodness to direct one of your Clerks to make out a Statement of the terms & to whom paid; which you will oblidge me by forwarding as soon as it may be convenient.

I never will ask to be paid in preference, and I should be unwilling to be paid with less punctuality than they are.

About ten days past I had a Conversation with some Gentlemen here of Public Character from Massachusetts respecting Shay and his Adherents, they say that on the 23 Instant a Court is by law to be held in one of those Counties in which Shays Adherents are very numerous which Government is determined to protect and they believe that Shay and his Adherents are as determined that it shall not set, if these Gentlemen are right in their Opinion the Issue of force is at Hand.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York January 11th 1787 I find myself in Possession of an \""Account of the County of Davidson in North Carolina\""(2) a Copy of which I inclose to you knowing it cannot be otherwise than acceptable as your Military or Bounty Warrant is located in that County.  Your Warrant as well as I can recollect was for about Two thousand seven hundred acres and is by this probably passed into a Grant in your Name. The particular quality of the land on which it has been located I have not been informed but I make no doubt but is very good as I put it very early into the hands of Colonel James Robertson with a Number more of my own and agreed to give him one fourth part thereof for the trouble of locating, the Division to be made by Lot if not otherwise agreed on, which is the same price I gave him for my own. The Surveyors fees I believe you are to pay a part of but I do not recollect what part nor can I inform you what the other Office Fees will be. You will see that it is necessary that I should have a Power of Attorney from you to convey to Colonel Robertson the fourth part agreeable to Contract. I was unfortunate in being from Home when you called but if you will fix any hour when you will call again and inform me by the Bearer I will certainly wait your coming or if this is not convenient to you, you will be sure always to find me at home at any Time before 11 OClock in the Morning.

 Dear Sir, Newyork January 12th 1787. Mr. Dowse arrived here last Night from Carolina and waited on me this Morning. He said very little about the Tobacco but I have heard  January 12, 1787  that he purposes to return again but for what I do not Know as no Person has given me the least Information or even Intimation of what he has done or offered to do. I had only the favour of two Letters by him one of John G. Blount of about ten Lines which told me in general Terms that there was a very great Uproar as I would see by an inclosed Proclamation but I did not find the Proclamation(1) and the other was from Winslow which did not contain much more and these are the only Letters that I have recived from any person at Fayetteville since the Session commenced. This I suppose will find you at Kinston a little more at Leasure than you have been for some Time past and you will infinitely oblige me by informing me in general Terms what the Assembly have done and in particular with the Tobacco for on this Head I am daily questioned by the Board of Treasury.(2) As there has been no Congress I can give you no Congressional News but I will tell you what Members are here Namely from Georgia Colonel Few, South Carolina, Pinckney, Bull, Huger, Parker and Kean, North Carolina myself, Virginia Mr. Grayson, Pennsylvania Mr. Meredith and Mr. Irvine, New-Jersey Mr. Clark and Mr. Scureman, Newyork Mr Laurence, Mr. Harring and Mr. Smith, Connecticut Dr. Johnson, Massachusetts Mr. King. Mr. Few daily expects Judge Walton or Major Pierce, myself, Mr. Bloodworth or some other, Mr. Madison and others are expected from Virginia, A Dele[g]ation is shortly expected from Maryland; Dr. Johnson expects Mr. Mitchel and Mr. King Mr. Dane. No Representation is expected from the other three States in any short Time namely Delaware, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Hence you can judge as we[ll] as any person here when We shall probably form a Congress. My Expectation of a Colleague is found upon the Knowledge that I ought to have one a[nd] not upon any Information that I have recived from them for I have not recived a single line from either of them. The inclosed Papers contain the latest Accounts of the Proceedings of Shaysand his Adherents. In a Conversation I lately had with Mr. King he informed me that a Court was to sit on the 23d Instant in one of the Counties in which the Adherents of Mr. Shays were very numerous which Court Government were determined to support and he believes Shays and his Adherents were as determined that it should not sit and if he is right in is Opinion & Conjecture the Issue of force is not far distant. The Object of my coming here so far as it respects myself appears quite in my power when a Congress is formed with which I assure you I am not perfectly satisfied for it will be very inconvenient for me to stay here the Year out indeed I am almost sometimes disposed to set out immediately but this I shall not do untill I hear from you.

[If only] you had been a little more [...](1) for you why you are not. Mr. D[ow]se has informed me  January 13, 1787  in general Terms of the proceedin[gs] and General Disposition to proceed while he stayed and to be sure as many as heard him relate are astonished to hear that the Constitution of that Country, says the Judicial, legislative and Executive Powers shall be forever sep[e]rate and distinct. I begin to feel partial to what I am told is the doctrine of the Farmer's Letters. Must not every thinking Man view our Repub[l]ican Gover[n]ment as the most intolerable of all Tyranny? Can any Man be safe in his house while the Legislature are sitting? I do not mean to say whether the Persons confined by the Legislature have suffer'd or have not suffered [ac]cording to their Demerit for I am inf[ormed . . .] a few you mention only But [...] there [is] an old and common Exclamation O Temp[ora], O Mores! O Times, O Manners. Blessed Fruits of Independence. By the Bearer Captain Cossa 50 pounds of Bees Wax were brought to this place on my account which I desired to sell for me and lay the Mony out in Flax for me and deliver the Flax to you. The Wax he sold for 2/3 per lb. and the Flax he tells me will cost him 1/ at least, however he will rendre you I suppose an Account. No Congress yet and uncertain when there will be, only four States represented. I feel a very great [dis]position to return home tho' the Object of my [...] here as respects my self appears quite [.... I shall not leave at] any rate before I hear from you. Pray [let] me hear what the Assembly has done. I fear there has been the Devil to pay; and you on the weak side or rather on no side, let me know the bad with the good if good there has been. Among other things tell me what is or what is like to be done with the Public Tobacco. On this be very particular for I am daily questioned about it either by the board of Treasury or by some Persons who I believe want to be medling with it.(2) I have heard Nothing of Tom Blount since the Letters I received by Mr Voss which I forwarded. If you have any Letters for him the Conveyances here are Weeklyand sometimes daily. I believe Dowse will not come back about the Tobacco tho' he talks [...] he will. I have been taught to understand partly how he proposed to have paid [the mo]ny so that the Tobacco would not really have cost more than about 22/4 per 100 lb Weight, he was only the Instrument & solely so, nor have I been able to learn the Names of more than one of the Principals. This to yourself unless you see an Advantage to yourself in leting Government Know or understand it. Let me hear by every post if it is but a Single Line. Compliments to Polly, Your's &c, Wm Blount P.S.

 Dear Washington(1) New York, Jany. 14th, '87. In looking around among my Friends, I know of no Man who deserves more of my attention than yourself. I esteem you much, and wish you well. I have no speculative views, and therefore you may believe me sincere. On the 11th instant we arrived here, after a tedious and dangerous passage of twenty nine Days. Nothing could be more disagreable than our Voyage, but it gave Mrs. Pierce an opportunity of seeing Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, & New York, which, in some measure compensated for it. Before my arrival Colo. Lee had taken his departure for Virginia,(2) so that I have not had an opportunity of seeing him. I wish I could have been fortunate enough to have seen him before his departure, that I might have hinted your speculation to him. The Southern Country, (particularly Georgia) is in high estimation every where through the Northern States. Your Lands will be valuable very shortly, and I doubt not but you would make sale of some of them if you was to reside a few Weeks in this City. Suppose you was to come and open a speculating Office. If any advantages from this quarter can be obtained, and be made to flow into Georgia I will take care to give you a hint, and if I can serve you in any thing whilst here, I shall be very happy to be employed. January 14, 1787  With respect to facilities, final settlements &c I have not been able to inform myself of their condition. I therefore can say nothing about them for the present. Congress have not yet made a House, but we shall most certainly in a Day or two be able to sit.(3) I think if Walton had come on he would probably have been made President; but as it is, a Mr Blount from North Carolina is talked of.

January 24, 1787  New York appeard. on the floor for one Day, when an attempt for a president was made, there seemd. a Division in Sentiment, Doctr. Johnson had two Votes, which was as many as any Gentleman could boast; we adjournd. for consideration, since which New York has not appeard. in Congress: tis said the time of their Delegates was nearly expired, & that tis now quite out. No measures have been taken by the Legislature of this State to supply the place altho' they have been convend. some weeks, I am told they are to re'elect next Fryday,(2) time will shew; twould not be a matter of surprize to me if they should omit the Matter for a month longer. You will see by the papers, that this State has by approbating the Conduct of the Govr. in not calling the Assembly upon desire of Congress; stepd. as twere out of their way to give Congress a Slap in the face. The Situation of Congress is truely deplorable, no one seems willing to contribute a Mite to extricate us from the mire into which we are fallen. Pensylvania in answer to Messrs. King & Monro, have so far declared in favor of dividing the Debt, as to say, they will pay their own Citizens only. I cannot see there remains any necessity for keeping up a Representation in Congress, in our present Scituation, all we can possibly do, is to recommend, which is an old, stale device & no better than the wish of a few Individuals relative to publick Concerns. Our Eyes at present are turnd. to Masechusetts & expect by Saturday's post, to hear of feats of Chivalry. We are told that Genl.

 Dear Sir, Private New York January 28th 1787 By this Conveyance I send a Number of News Papers inclosed to your Address which contain all the current News of this place or rather may serve to shew that there is but very little or none. About fifteen days past seven States appeared on the floor of Congress and produced their respective Credentials and proceeded to the Choice of a President but in vain as not more than two states could agree in any one Man and I really am unable to unravel the Mystery of this Business nor can I form any Opinion who will be the Man.(1) After this Meeting there continued to be seven States in the City for about a Week but never again appeared at the same Time on the floor owing to indisposition of some one or other and after this last mentioned Period expired the New York Delegation were off the floor and the new Appointment did not take place before yesterday so that I suppose We shall again on Monday that is tomorrow have seven States on the floor and if no more I believe it is pretty certain no President can be agreed on by them. The ostensible Objection raised by the Yankees against a Delegate from No. Carolina being put in the Chair(2) is that that state is about to make some antifederal Appropriation of her Tobacco that is by ordering the Mony arising from the sale of it to be applyed to the Payment of the Interest due on the foreign debt and not suffering it to come into the Continental Treasury subject to their Appropriation. This report has been spread by Mr. Dowse and indeed I am told that a Letter of Mr. Maclaines wrote as Chairman of a Committee justafies the Report. If this is true it is surely a very antifederal Act.(3) Mr. Dowse goes further and says a Dissolution of the Union was publickly and openly spoke as a thing that would and ought to happen because the Northern states were injurious to the southern and that some Members said if a Dissolution was to take place that it would be best to hold on altogether upon the Tobacco. In reply to all this I can onlysay that some imprudent Members may have expressed themselves unthinkingly but that I believe the Legislative Acts will evince a different Spirit. It is with great Pleasure I learn by a Letter from Mr. Sitgreaves for I have not been favoured with one from yourself that you are again reelected Governor also that Hawkins is elected to supply the place of Mr. Nash(4) and as he was elected so early as before the 20th December I am in hourly Expectation of his Arrival and Colonel Grayson of Vir- January 28, 1787  ginia is in hourly Expectation of the Arrival of Mr. Madison and these two Arrivals will complete the Delegation of the four southern states and a Delegation is shortly expected from Maryland so that the southern Interest will be strong. As there has been no Business done by Congress since my arrival you can expect no Congressional News. The new elected Delegation of this state are except one antifederal Peasants(5) notwithstanding the great Choice the state affords of Gentlemen of Abilities and who were Candidates. Recollecting how earnestly Col. Burton pushed his Election I have daily expected him tho' I have not been favoured with a Line from him nor any other of my Brother Delegates. Will you please to inform me which two may be expected or rather which one beside Hawkins for I count on him certain? I suppose you have seen the account published in the Papers \""that Spain had ceded the Floridas to France\"" and that you may know as much of the Truth of this assertion as is Known here I will inform You that both the Spanish and French Ministers deny the Truth of this Publication(6) and are displeased with the Report which induces some People to believe the Report is true as to myself I am unable to form any Opinion tho' I am upon the best of Terms with both these Ministers and have conversed with both of them several Times on this Report. If the state should have done as reported by Mr. Dowse the Delegation here will surely feel very humble for it is already in the Mouth of every body that she has never paid but 7/6 in the Continental Treasury.

If there would have been any impropriety in reminding me, when I had the honor to see you at your Office a few Days before, that there was an old Ballance long due, and that your Duty would require you to compel the payment of it, before you actually proceeded to a step, that must certainly affect my Credit, and might possibly produce my Ruin. I realy think I might have expected thus from any Person, and the purpose of preventing any loss to the State, would more probably have been answered, if the State was realy in Danger. I flat[ter] myself when you reflect upon it you will be of this Opinion. Indeed I shd not know that Ballance was owing tho' this I grant is no Excuse; for, doubtless it is my duty to be accquainted with the manner in which the Business of my Office is conducted. The State however is safe Sir, for they have very good Security, and I still hope, after all the hopes I have sustained, and the Sacrifices I have made in the Course of this Revolution, I am good yet for something more than one thousand Pounds.

Unluckily that Business is not yet completed. I have however heard from them that they had been upon the Farm, viewed it, heard Mr Bonde &c, but Mr. Eliot not being able to Attend them they had not finished their Enquiries upon the subject but sho'd chuse to see him before they come to any conclusion. Upon which I wrote so in Novr. to Mr. E. desiring him to attend them as soon as possible & to give them all the Informn. in his Power.(3) Since which have heard nothing from them. I have also seen Read who says he intends to do the best he can with the Farm & as he is confident the Gentn. will report in his favr. wishes I might be impower'd to give him a Lease for [the] Farm as you shall Judge proper, or from Year to Year.

Not so much for the Conseqe. of the thing to [. . .] us for tho' it might have been useful, yet all the efforts hitherto made to Content the Inds. have had little Effect, but because it has rather the Appearances of illiberality & resentment, I cannot conceive that there can be any sufft. Doubt of yr. right to exercise a Trust of so beneficial a Nature in any Court whatsoever. There is certainly no want of proper Objects here, as the Indians tho decay'd are yet numerous upon our borders. Theyhave of late in fact been very troublesome to the Southern States which has oblig'd Congress to raise a Body of Troops to repell their Invasions & protect the Frontiers. It is said they are instigated by the Spanish & British Traders, & the fact may  January ?, 1787  be so as it is natural to suppose they wish to Keep the Trade as much as they can in their own hands, yet I believe many of our own People have been extremily blamable in their Treatment of them & need Chastisement as much as the Indians themselves.

I hope therefore yr Corpo[ration] may yet at a more fav[orabl]e time reconsider their Resolutn. & not eventually confine their fav[or]s exclusively to N.

Genl Lincoln moved after them at Eight OClock on the same Evening and came on them by Surprize at 9 OClock the next Morning, they fled in all directions; 150 were made prisoners---;Shays escaped into New Hampshire, and his men are wholly dispersed.

The dissolution of the Assembly under Shays will totally discourage his partizans in Berkshire. The Leaders I think will be easily taken unless they fly. What will give you much satisfaction is the Declaration made by the Legislature that a Rebellion exists in the Commonwealth---;you know the energy and Authority of the supreme Executive in consequence of this Declaration.

 My dear friend,(1) New York 10 Feby. 1787 My letter of Thursday(2) informed you that Lincoln on the 30th of Jan. was at Hadley and Shays with his Party at Pelham distant about Eight miles. About the 2d instant Lincoln moved his Troops to Pelham and reconnoitered Shays' situation. This approach gave evident uneasiness to the Insurgents, on the Morning of the 3d a Flag was received from Shays with propositions of dispersing his party provided the Leaders could be assured of safety. General Lincoln replied, that  February 10, 1787  he could enter into no Engagements on that Subject---;immediately after, Lincoln received intelligence that Shays intended leaving Pelham, and taking Post at Petersham, distant 30 Miles eastwardly, and situated in that Part of the County of Worcester, where the People were the most disaffected to the Government. This information was confirmed soon after, and Lincoln put his whole Force in motion at Eight OClock that Evening for Petersham, the early part of the night was moderate, but it became a violent North East Snow Storm before three O Clock in the morning, and before day light the cold was intense. The Troops could not be covered, and the Cold was too severe for them to halt. They pressed on, and arrived at Petersham, at 9 O.Clock in the morning. They entered the town near its centre, and the party under Shays were so completely surprized, that the flight was totally irregular, and in all directions. 150 Men were made Prisoners, Shays escaped, and has fled into the State of New Hampshire, every man becoming his own General. I dont learn that there was a Gun fired, or a man hurt. On the 5th Lincoln disbanded a considerable part of his Forces, and gave orders that the militia at Springfield should be dismissed except a Guard of two companies of 50 men each for the protection of the federal magazine. A Body of Insurgents had collected in Berkshire, and another Body of Militia under Genl. Patterson was assembled to oppose them. Lincoln marched on the 5th or 6th with a respectable Force for Berkshire; since the dissolution of the Party under Shays the Resistance will be small in Berkshire. I think this insurrection will now be wholly suppressed, and the Government in Consequence may [become] more vigorous. I do not form this opinion from the Facts now communicated, but from another quarter; The Legislature of Mass. did not assemble until the 3d, the Governor then communicated the measures he had adopted, and stated that the Situation of the Insurgency required the most decisive measures. TheSpeech was committed and the two Branches adjourned until the next day, the Report was agreed to, and the Legislature on the same day that Lincoln dispersed Shays declared that a Rebellion existed in the Commonwealth, approved the conduct of the Governor, and requested him to adopt the most vigorous Measures to suppress the same. You will remember that when the Legislature declare the existence of a Rebellion the powers of the Governor, by our Constitution, become almost absolute. He may exercise Law martial, and in every Respect Treat the Citizens in arms agt. the state & their adherents as open Enemies. What think you of this? Farewel, R King  [P.S.] I hope to see you very soon. Nine states are represented. ""

From Princeton to Paulus' Hook we had a N.E. snow storm incessantly in our teeth. We met however with no misadventure, nor with any real difficulties except in passing some of the rivers some of which were clogged with Ice, and a half congealed mixture of snow & water which was more in the way than the Ice itself. The turn of the tide very critically removed these obstructions and we got over without danger or the apprehension of it. I found Mrs. Grayson pretty well. Col.

The continuance of his unhappy sensations is really extraordinary, and if they resist the influence of Spring as much as they seem to do that of the Winter, will become a source of apprehension to his friends as well as to himself.

The Declaration of the existence of a rebellion will do great Honor to the Government & constitution of Massachusetts. I can already mark good consequences in the Opinions which it authorizes relative to our vigour and spirit. I feel myself a much more important man, than I was in the Humility of a few Days past.

 Dear Sir New York Feby. 15th. [11th?] 1787(1) My last was from Richmond of the 4th of December,(2) and contained a sketch of our legislative proceedings prior to that date. The principal proceedings of subsequent date relate as nearly as I can recollect 1st to a rejection of the Bill on crimes & punishments, which after being altered so as to remove most of the objections as was thought, was lost by a single vote. The rage agst. Horse stealers had a great influence on the fate of the Bill. Our old bloody code is by this event fully restored, the prerogative of Conditional pardon having been taken from the Executive by a Judgmt. of the Court of Appeals, and the temporary law granting it to them having expired and been left unrevived. I am not without hope that the rejected bill will find a more favorable disposition in the next Assembly. 2dly to the bill for diffusing knowledge. It went through two readings by a small majority and was not pushed to a third one. The necessity of a systematic provision on the subject was admitted on all hands. The objections agst. that particular provision were 1. the expence; wch. was alledged to exceed the ability of the people 2. the difficulty of executing it in the present sparse settlement of the Country. 3. the inequality of the districts as contended by the Western members. The last objection is of little weight and might have been easily removed if it had been urged in an early stage of the discussion. The bill now rests on the same footing with the other unpassed bills in the Revisal. 3dly to the Revisal at large. It was found impossible to get thro' the system at the late session for several reasons. 1. the changes which have taken place since its compilement, in our affairs and our laws; particularly those relating to our Courts, called for changes in some of the bills which could not be made with safety by the Legislature. 2. the pressure of other business which tho' of less importance in itself, yet was more interesting for the moment. 3. the alarm excited byan approach toward the Execution-Bill which subjects land to the payment of debts. This bill could not have been carried, was too impor- February 11, 1787  tant to be lost, and even too difficult to be amended without destroying its texture. 4. the danger of passing the Repealing Bill at the end of the Code, before the operation of the various amendments &c. made by the Assembly could be leisurely examined by competent Judges. Under these circumstances it was thought best to hand over the residue of the work to our successors, and in order to have it made compleat, Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Wythe & Blair were appd. a Committee to amend the unpassed bills & also to prepare a supplemental revision of the laws which have been passed since the original work was executed. It became a critical question with the friends of the Revisal whether the parts of the Revisal actually passed shd. be suspended in the meantime, or left to take their operation. The first plan was strongly recommended by the advantage of giving effect to the system at once, and by the inconveniency arising from the latter of leaving the old laws to a constructive repeal only. The latter notwithstanding was preferred as putting the adopted bills out of the reach of a succeeding Assembly, which might possibly be unfriendly to the system altogether. There was good reason to suspect Mr. {Henry}(3) who will certainly be {then a member}. By suffering the bills which have passed to take effect, in the meantime it will be extremely difficult to get rid of them. 4thly Religion. The Act incorporating the protestant Episcopal Church excited the most pointed opposition from the other Sects. They even pushed their attacks agst. the reservation of the Glebes &c. to the Church exclusively. The latter circumstance involved the Legislature in some embarrassment. The result was a repeal of the Act, with a saving of the property. 5th The district Courts. After a great struggle they were lost in the House of Delegates by a single voice. 6thly taxes; the attempts to reduce former taxes were baffled, and sundry new taxes added; on lawyers 1/10 of their fees, on Clks of Courts Â¼ of do., on doctrs. a smalltax, a tax on houses in towns so as to level their burden with that of real estate in the Country, very heavy taxes on riding carriages, &c. Besides those an additional duty of 2 Per Ct. ad valorem on all merchandizes imported in vessels of nations not in treaty with the U.S. an addl. duty of 4 d. on every gallon of Wine except French wines, and of 2 d. on every gallon of distilled Spirits except French brandies which are made duty free. The exceptions in favor of France were the effect of the sentiments & regulations communicated to you by Mr. Calonne.(4) A printed copy of the communication was recd. the last day of the Session in a newspaper from N. York and made a warm impression on the Assembly. Some of the taxes are liable to objections, and were much complained of. With the additional duties on trade they will considerably enhance our revenue.

On all great points she must sooner or later bend to Massts. & Connecticut.

I was not to learn, Sir, that my Accounts are directed to be settled Quarterly, and that it is your duty to see it done, and to compel the payment of any Ballance that may be due to the State;(1) neither have I ever been absurd enough, even in thought, to complain of your discharging your Duty, however I may have expressed myself, which indeed I do not remember, as I have no Copy of the last Letter I wrote you. I did however, I know, complain that some intimation was not given that, if the Debt due by me was not paid by some certain time, a Suit would be instituted. I believe I said that I thought I might have expected such intimation and I believe upon Reflection you will be of Opinion that if I had not reason to expect it from You as an Officer, I was not wrong to expect it from you as a Man. It is most certain I did not know that old Ballance had not been paid off. Tho I acknowledge now, as I did then, that is no Justification---;but if you had been pleased to have been more  February 15, 1787  explicit, it would have led me to enquire more particularly, and I certainly had not left the City until provision had been made for the payment, tho' it had been attended with giving you the trouble to cut up more of my Certificates.

 My Dr Friend, New York 18 Feb. 1787 I am extremely pleased with the proceedings of the General Court;(1) they will procure them Honor wherever they are known---;be assured the late Exertions of the Commonwealth are viewed in a very respectable Light. I have some doubts about the policy of your Bill disqualifying certain Discriptions of Citizens. However I am not so competent a Judge as they are, who have decided in favor of the measure. I hope it will effect the Objects, and operate in the manners expected. We have heard Nothing from Lincoln since he went into Berkshire; If Patterson's conduct is well understood, he is certainly reprehensible, and I hope will meet his due reward. We have Nine States represented, and If I can form an Opinion from so short an acquaintance with this new Assembly, I should not lament if their year was nearer its Expiration than it is. I promise myself no good from their continueing together; I fear Pennsylvania & Jersey will be entirely under a southern influence---;if so, I can conceive of no mischief to public Credit, in the settlement of Accounts, and in the just claims of the states, which may not be apprehended. All the states south of this have appointed to the Convention, but the commissions, or authorities, seem to be different. I say have appointed; Five of them have appointed, and the other three undoubtedly will appoint. I will not venture a conjecture relative to the policy of this measure in Mass.

 My dear Sir New York Feby. 18th. 1787. Your letter for Mr. Jefferson arrived a few hours too late for the packet and must wait for some other conveyance. I have some reason to expect one in ten or fifteen days. Congress have received no late intelligence either from him or Mr. Adams. Nor have any interesting measures yet taken place since they have been assembled in force. Those in expectation relate to 1. The Mississpi. On this subject I have no information to give, not a word having passed concerning it since my arrival. 2. The treaty of peace. This subject is now depending in the form of a Report from Mr. Jay. I find what I was not before apprized of, that infractions on the part of the U.S. preceded in several instances even the violation on the other side in the instance of the Negroes.(1) If Congs. should be able to agree on any measures for carrying the Treaty into execution, it seems probable that the fundmamental one will be a summons of the States to remove all legal impediments which stand at present in the way. There seems to be no reason to believe that G.B. will comply on any other conditions than those signified in the communication of Lord Carmarthen to Mr. Adams.(2) 3. The proposed Convention in May. A great disagreement of opinion exists as to the expediency of a recommendation from Congs. to the backward States in favor of the meeting. It would seem as if some of the States disliked it because it is an extraconstitutional measure, and that their dislike would be removed or lessened by a sanction from Congs. to it. On the other hand it is suggested that some would dislike it the more if Congs. should appear to interest themselves in it.(3) I observe in a late Newspaper that instructions are to be brought forward in the Legislature here to the Delegates in Congress to propose and urge their interposition in favor of the Convention. What the sense of the State is on the merits of the project is not perfectly clear. A refusal a few days ago by a large majority to grant the impost does notaugur well.(4) Hopes however are entertained. The four States North of it are also still to declare their sentiments. Masts. it is now expected will appoint deputies to the Convention, and her example will be much respected by the three others. The intermediate States from N. York to  February 18, 1787  S. Carolina, Maryland excepted, have made appointments, and Maryland has determined to do so tho' she has not yet agreed on the individuals. S. Carolina & Georgia are supposed by their Delegates here to be well disposed, to back the plan. 4. the troops raising under the authority of Congs. in Massts. The prospect of a close to the turbulent scenes in that quarter has produced a motion for stopping the enlistments.(5) The delegates from the N England States generally and from Massts. in particular, are anxious that the motion should be suspended for a few weeks, that the influence of the military preparations of the U.S. may be continued in favor of their State Measures, some of which are likely to be pretty vigorous, and to try the strength of their Govt. It appears besides that the Ringleader of the insurrection has not been apprehended, and according to report, still harbours mischeif. We begin to experience already the inconveniency of the clause in our treaties stipulating the privileges of the most favored nation. Mr. Vanberkel has got hold of the late Act of our Assembly in favor of French Wines & brandies brought in French bottoms, and contends that it violates the Dutch Treaty.(6) He has been told that those privileges are a requital for equal ones granted on the side of France, and that Holland must pay the price before she can claim the concession. His answer is that nothing is said about compensation in the Treaty; that it is expressly stated that the Dutch shall pay no higher duties than the most favored Nation is or shall be obliged to pay. We tell him the compensation is necessarily implied; and that a contrary interpretation would render the Treaty too inconvenient to both the parties to be supposed the true one. He persists in alledging that it is the true one, that the treaty pursues the carrying policy marked by a like stipulation in every treaty where it could be introduced, and that the clause relative to compensation was intentionally omitted. He means to bring the matterbefore Congs. and to direct the Dutch Consul to protest agst. the duties in case of their being exacted. He professes and appears notwithstanding to be anxious for an amicable adjustment, and would have foreborne to apply to Congs if we could have authorized a hope that the law would not be actually put in Execution agst. Dutch Cargoes. As it is he means to put a copy of the note to Congs. in our hands, that it may be communicated to the State.(7) I have not yet thoroughly investigated the question. The letter of the Treaty is on his side. The equity of it on ours. If his construction be admitted, the U.S. could not purchase the W. India Trade of G.B. or France without letting in Holland to the privileges granted on our part, altho' she should keep her ports in that quarter shut agst. us: a consideration not only unjust towards us, but creating objections on the part of G.B. or France. A very dismal account of Clarke's proceedings in the Western Country has been informally laid before Congress, & will be forwarded to your department.(8) If the information be well founded you will proba- February 19, 1787  bly receive a confirmation thro' other channels. Send me the letter from Mr. Mercer if you please.(9) I forgot to ask you for it at the time of my leaving Richmond. Adieu Yrs Affecty. Js. M. ""

 In Congress. Feby. 19. 1787(1) Mr. Pinckney in support of his motion entered on the Journal, for stopping the enlistment of Troops,(2) argued that we had reason to suppose the insurrection in Massts., the real, tho' not ostensible object of this measure, to be already crushed: that the Requisition of 500,000 dollrs. for supporting the troops had been complied with by one State only, viz Virginia, and that but in part: that it would be absurd to proceed in the raising of men who could neither be paid, cloathed nor fed, and that such a folly was the more to be shunned, as the consequences could not be foreseen, of embodying and arming men under circumstances which would be more likely to render them the terror than the support of Government. We had, he observed, been so lucky in one instance, meaning the disbanding of the army on the peace, to get rid of an armed force without satisfying their just claims; but that it would not be prudent to hazard the repetition of the experiment. February 19, 1787  Mr. King made a moving appeal to the feelings of Congs. reminding them that the real object in voting the troops was, to countenance the exertions of the Govt. of Masts.; that the silent cooperation of these military preparations under the orders of Congs. had had a great and double effect, in animating the Govt. and awing the insurgents; that he hoped the late success of the former had given a deadly blow to the disturbances, yet that it would be premature, whilst a doubt could exist as to the critical fact, to withdraw the co- operating influence of the federal measures. He particularly and pathetically intreated Congs. to consider that it was in agitation and probably would be determined by the Legis. of Massts. not only to bring to due punishment the more active & leading offenders, but to disarm & disfranchise for a limited time the great body of them; that for the policy of this measure he would not undertake to vouch, being sensible that there were great & illustrious examples agst. it, that His confidence however in the prudence of that Govt. would not permit him to call their determinations into question; that what the effect of these rigors might be it was impossible to foresee. He dwelt much on the sympathy which they probably would excite in behalf of the stigma[t]ized party, scarce a man was without a father, a brother, a friend in the mass of the people; adding that as a precaution agst. contingencies, it was the purpose of the State to raise and station a small military force in the most suspected districts and that Â£40,000, to be drawn from their impost on trade had been appropriated accordingly: that under these circumstance[s] a new crisis more solemn than the late one might be bro't on & therefore to stop the federal enlistments and thereby withdraw the aid which had been held out, would give the greatest alarm imaginable to the Govt. and its friends, as it would look like a disapprobation & desertion of them, and if viewed in that light by the disaffected mightrekindle the insurrection. He took notice of the possibility to which every State in the Union was exposed, of being visited with similar calamities---;in which events they would all be suing for support in the same strain now used by the delegates from Massts. & that the indulgence now requested in behalf of that State might be granted without the least inconvenience to the U.S. as their enlistments without any countermanding orders, would not go on whilst those of the State were in competition; it being natural for the men to prefer the latter service in which they would stay at home & be sure of their pay, to the former, in which they might with little prospect of it, be sent to the Ohio to fight the Indians. He concluded with the most earnest entreaties, and the fullest confidence that Congs. would not at so critical a moment and without any necessity whatever, agree to the motion; assuring them that in 3 or 4 weeks, possibly in less time, he might himself be a friend to it and would promote it. Mr. P[inckney] in reply contended that if the measures pursuing by Massts. were such as had been stated, he did not think the U.S. bound to give them countenance. He thought them impolitic and not to be   reconciled with the genius of free Govts. and if fresh commotions should spring from them, that the State of Massts. alone should be at the charge, and abide by the consequences of their own misconduct. Mr. M[adison](3) would not examine whether the original views of Congs. in the enlargemt. of their militar[y] force were proper or not, nor whether it were so [to] mask these views with an ostensible preparation agst. the Indians. He admitted indeed that it appeared rather difficult to reconcile an interference of Congs. in the internal controversies of a State with the tenor of the Confederation which does not authorize it expressly, and leaves to the States all powers not expressly delegated; or with the principles of Republican Govts which as they rest on the sense of the majority, necessarily suppose power and right always to be on the same side. He observed however that in one point of view(4) military precautions on the part of Congs. might have a different aspect. Whenever danger was apprehended from any foreign quarter which of necessity extended itself to the federal concerns, Congs. were bound to guard agst. it, and altho' there might be no particular evidence in this case of such a meditated interference <<by G.B.>, yet there was sufficient ground for a general suspicion of readiness in G.B. to take advantage of events in this Country, to warrant precautions agst. her. But waving the question as to the original propriety of the measure adopted and attending merely to the question whether at this moment the measure ought from a change of circumstances to be rescinded, he was inclined to think it would be more advisable to suspend than to go instantly into the recision. The considerations which led to this opinion were 1. That though it appeared pretty certain that the main body of the insurgents had been dispersed it was by no means certain that the spirit of insurrection was subdued. The leaders too of the insurgents had not been apprehended and parties of them were still inarms in disaffected places. 2. that great respect is due on such an occasion to the wishes and representations of the suffering member of the federal body, both of which must be judged of by what comes from her representatives on the floor. These tell us that the measures taken by Congs. have given great satisfaction & spirits to their Constituents, and have co- operated much in baffling the views of their internal enemies; that they are pursuing very critical precautions at this moment for their future safety and tranqility; and that the construction which will be put on the proposed Resolution if agreed to by Congs. can not fail to make very unhappy impressions, and may have very serious consequences. The propriety of their precautions depends on so many circumstances better known to the Govt. of Massts. than to Congs. that it would be premature in Congs. to be governed by a disapprobation. 3. that every state ought to bear in mind the consequences of popular commotions if not thoroughly subdued, on the tranquility of the Union, & the possibility of its being itself the scene of them. Every State   ought therefore to submit with cheerfulness to such indulgences to others, as itself may in a little time be in need of. He had been a witness of the temper of his own State (Virginia) on this occasion. It was understood by the Legislature that the real object of the military preparations on foot, was the disturbance in Mass[t]s. & that very consideration inspired the ardor which voted towards their quota, a tax on tobacco(5) which wd. not have been granted for scarce any other purpose whatever, being a tax operating very partially in the opinion of the people of that State who cultivate that article: yet this class of the Legislature were almost unanimous in making the sacrifice, because the fund was considered as the most certain that could be provided.  4. that it was probable the enlistments for the reasons given would be suspended without an order from Congs. in which case, the inconveniency suggested would be saved to the U.S. and the wishes of Massts. satisfied at the same time. 5. that as no bounty was given for the troops, and they could be dismissed at any time, the objections drawn from the consideration of expence, could have but little force. 6. That it was contended only for a continuance of the apparent aid of Congs. for 3 or 4 weeks, the members from Massts. themselves considering that as a sufficient time. After the rejection of the motion as stated on the journal a dispute arose whether the vote should be entered among the secret or public proceedings. Mr. Pinkney insisted that in the latter(6) case, his view which was to justify himself to his constituents would be frustrated. Most of those who voted with him were opposed to an immediate publication. The expedient of a temporary concealment was proposed as answering all purposes.(7) ""

 Wednesday Feby. 21 [1787]. The Report of the Convention at Annapolis in Sepr. 1786 had been long under consideration of a Committee of the Congress for the last year; and was referred over to a Grand Committee of the present year.(1) The latter Committee after considerable difficulty and discussion, agreed on a report by a majority of one(2) only, which was made a few days ago to Congs. and set down as the order for this day. The Report coincided with the opinion held at Annapolis that the Confederation needed amendments and that the proposed Convention was the most eligible means of effecting them. The objections which seemed to prevail agst. the recommendation of the Convention by Congress, were with some 1. that it tended to weaken the federal autherity by lending its sanction to an extraconstitutional mode of proceeding---;with others 2. that the interposition of Congs. would be considered by the jealous as betraying an ambitious wish to get power into their hands by any  February 21, 1787  plan whatever that might present itself. Subsequent to the Report, the Delegates from N. York recd. instructions from its Legislature to move in Congress for a recommendation of a Convention; and those from Massts. had it appeared recd. information which led them to suppose it was becoming the disposition of the Legislature of that State to send deputies to the proposed Convention in case Congs. should give their sanction to it. There was reason to believe however from the Language of the instruction from N York that her object was to obtain a new Convention, under the sanction of Congs. rather than to accede to the one on foot, or perhaps by dividing the plans of the States in their appointments to frustrate all of them. The latter suspicion is in some degree countenanced by their refusal of the Impost a few days before the instruction passed, and by their other marks of an unfederal disposition.(3) The Delegates from N.Y. in consequence of their instructions made the motion on the Journal to postpone the Report of the Committee in order to substitute their own proposition. Those who voted agst. it, considered it as liable to the objection abovementioned. Some who voted for it particularly Mr. M[adison](4) considered it susceptible of amendment when brought before Congs. and that if Congs. interposed in the matter at all it would be well for them to do it at the instance of a State, rather than spontaneously. This motion being lost, Mr. Dane from Massts. who was at bottom unfriendly to the plan of a Convention, and dissuaded his State from coming into it, brought forward a proposition, in a different form, but liable to the same objection with that from N. York. After some little discussions, it was agreed on all sides except by Connecticut who opposed the measure in every form, that the Resolution shd. pass as it stands on the Journal, sanctioning the proceedings & appointments already made by the States as well as recommending further appointts. from other States, but in such terms as do notpoint directly to the former appointments.(5) It appeared from the debates & still more from the conversation among the members that many of them considered this resolution as a deadly blow to the existing Confederation. Docr. Johnson(6) who voted agst. it, particularly declared himself to that effect. Others viewed it in the same light, but were pleased with it as the harbinger of a better Confederation. The reserve of many of the members made it difficult to decide their real wishes & expectations from the present crisis of their affairs. All agreed & owned that the federal Govt. in its existing shape was inefficient & could not last long. The members from the Southern & middle States seemed generally anxious for some republican organization of the System which wd. preserve the Union and give due energy to the Govermt. of it. Mr. [Bingham](7) alone avowed his wishes that the Confederacy might be divided in[to] several distinct confederacies, its great extent & various interests, being incompatible with a single Government. The Eastern members were suspected by some of   leaning towards some antirepublican establishment, (the effect of their late confusions) or of being less desirous or hopeful of preserving the Unity of the Empire. For the first time the idea of separate Confederacies had got into the Newspapers. It appeared to day under the Boston head.(8) Whatever the views of leading men in the Eastern States may be, it would seem that the great body of the people particularly in Connecticut, are equally indisposed either to dissolve or divide the Confederacy or to submit to any antirepublican innovations.(9)  ""

The Secretary of foreign Affairs has very ably reported a view of the infractions on both sides, his exposition of the contested articles, and the steps proper to be taken by Congress. I find what I was not before apprized of that more than one infraction on our part, preceded even the violation on the other Side in the instance of the Negroes. Some of the reasoning on the subject of the debts would be rather grating to Virginia. A full compliance with the Treaty according to judicial  February 21, 1787  constructions, and as a ground for insisting on a reciprocal compliance, is the proposition in which the Report terminates.(2) 2. a Recommendation of the proposed Convention in May. Congs. have been much divided and embarrassed on the question whether their taking an interest in the measure would impede or promote it. On one side it has been urged that some of the backward States have scruples agst. acceding to it without some constitutional sanction: On the other that other States will consider any interference of Congs. as proceeding from the same views which have hitherto excited their jealousies. A vote of the Legislature here entered into yesterday will give some relief in the case. They have instructed their delegates in Congs. to move for the recommendation in question.(3) The vote was carried by a majority of one only in the Senate, and there is room to suspect that the minority were actuated by a dislike to the substance rather than by any objections agst. the form of the business. A large Majority in the other branch a few days ago put a definitive veto on the Impost. It would seem as if the politics of this State are directed by individual interests and plans, which might be incommoded by the controul of an efficient federal Government. The four States North of it are still to make their decision on the subject of the Convention. I am told by one of the Massts. delegates that the Legislature of that State which is now sitting will certainly accede and appoint deputies if Congs. declare their approbation of the measure. I have similar information that Connecticut will probably come in, though it is said that the interference of Congress will rather have a contrary tendency there. It is expected that S. Carolina will not fail to adopt the plan, and that Georgia is equally well disposed. All the intermediate States between the former and N. York have already appointed deputies except Maryland which it is said means to do it, and has entered into some vote which declares as much. Nothing hasyet been done by the New Congs. with regard to the Mississippi. Our latest information from Massts. gives hopes that the mutiny or as the Legislature there now style it, the Rebellion is nearly extinct. If the measures however on foot for disarming and disfranchising, those concerned in it should be carried into effect, a new crisis may be brought on. I have not been here long enough to gather the general sentiments of leading characters touching our affairs & prospects. I am inclined to hope that they will gradually be concentered in the plan of a thorough reform of the existing system. Those who may lean towards a monarchical Govt. and who I suspect are swayed by very indigested ideas, will of course abandon an unattainable object whenever a prospect opens of rendering the Republican form competent to its purposes. Those who remain attached to the latter form must soon perceive that it can not be preserved at all under any modification which does not redress the ills experienced from our present establishments. Virginia is the only   State which has made any provision for the late moderate but essential requisition of Congs. and her provision is a partial one only. This would have been of earlier date, but I have waited for more interesting subjects for it. I shall do myself the pleasure of repeating the liberty of dropping you a few lines as often as proper occasions arise, on no other condition however than your waving the trouble of regular answers or acknowledgments on your part. With the greatest respect and Affection I am Dr. Sir, Yr. Obedt. friend & Servt., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dear Sir New York Feby. 24. 1787. If the contents of the Newspapers of this place find their way into the gazettes of Richmond you will have learnt that the expedition of Genl. Lincoln against the insurgents has effectually dispersed the main body of them.(1) It appears however that there are still some detachments which remain to be subdued, & that the Government of Massts. consider very strong precautions as necessary agst. further eruptions. The principal incendiaries have unluckily made off. By some it is said they are gone to Canada; by others that they have taken shelter in Vermont, and by some that they are opening a communication with the upper parts of this State. The latter suggestion has probably some color, as the Governor here has thought proper to offer rewards for them after the example of Govr. Bowdoin.(2) We have no interesting information from Europe. The only step of moment taken by Congs. since my arrival has been a recommendation of the proposed meeting in May for revising the federal articles. Some of the States, considering this measure as an extraconstitutional one, had scruples agst. concurring in it without some regular sanction. By others it was thought best that Congs. should remain neutral in the business, as the best antidote for the jealousy of an ambitious desire in them to get more powers into their hands. This suspence was at length removed by an instruction from this State to its delegates to urge a Recommendatory Resolution in Congress which accordingly passed a few days ago.(3) Notwithstanding this instruction from N. York, there is room to suspect her disposition not to be very federal, a large majority of her House of delegates having very lately entered into a definitive refusal of the impost, and the instruction itself having passed in the Senate by a casting vote only. In consequence of the sanction given by Congs. Massts. it is said will send deputies to the Convention, and her example will have great weight with the other N. England States. The States fromN. Ca. to N. Jersey inclusive have made their appointments, except Maryd. who has as yet only determined that she will make them. The Gentlemen here from S. Ca. & Georgia, expect that those States will follow the general example. Upon the whole therefore it seems probable that a meeting will take place, and that it will be a pretty full one. What the issue of it will be is  February 24, 1787  among the other arcana of futurity and nearly as inscrutable as any of them. In general I find men of reflection much less sanguine as to a new than despondent as to the present System. Indeed the present System neither has nor deserves advocates; and if some very strong props are not applied will quickly tumble to the ground. No money is paid into the public Treasury; no respect is paid to the federal authority. Not a single State complies with the requisitions, several pass them over in silence, and some positively reject them. The payments ever since the peace have been decreasing, and of late fall short even of the pittance necessary for the Civil list of the Confederacy. It is not possible that a Government can last long under these circumstances. If the appro[a]ching Convention should not agree on some remedy, I am persuaded that some very different arrangement will ensue. The late turbulent scenes in Massts. & infamous ones in Rhode Island, have done inexpressible injury to the republican character in that part of the U. States; and a propensity towards Monarchy is said to have been produced by it in some leading minds. The bulk of the people will probably prefer the lesser evil of a partition of the Union into three more practicable and energetic Governments. The latter idea I find after long confinement to individual speculations & private circles, is beginning to shew itself in the Newspapers. But tho' it is a lesser evil, it is so great a one that I hope the danger of it will rouse all the real friends to the Revolution to exert themselves in favor of such an organization of the Confederacy, as will perpetuate the Union, and redeem the honor of the Republican name. I shall follow this introductory letter with a few lines from time to time as a proper subject for them occurs. The only stipulation I exact on your part is that you will not consider them as claiming either answers or acknowledgments; and that you will believe me to be with sincerest wishes for your health and everyother happiness Yr.

 Dear Sir N. York Feby. 25. 1787. I have received your favor of the 5th inst.(1) and have attended to the several objects suggested in it. Mordecai having given up all his effects to the Assignees can do nothing for his creditors. He tells me that a dividend will certainly be made in April & not before, and that he shall pay about 15/ in the pound. I have applied also to Crowley,(2) and having little confidence in my own judgment of Cabinet workmanship, got the favor of Grayson & Bingham to accompany me in looking at the furniture prepared for you. They were both of opinion that there was no ground for compelling him to dissolve the contract, and he seemed little disposed to do it voluntarily. The aspect of the furni- February 25, 1787  ture does not I own entirely please my eye, but he says the taste of it is conformable to instructions, and no particular defect appears in the workmanship. It is to be considered too that Mahogony is one of the few things which appears worst when New. I have been the rather determined to take the things as it was easy to perceive that waving the risk of a suit, the town would have been filled with complaints agst. you. Having adopted this plan it will be expedient for you to send me without delay the prices settled for the work. Miss Cortwright has no memorandum of them, and without them I shall be at the mercy of Crowley himself. Your instructions as to the bottoming of the chairs and forwarding the whole to Virginia shall be duly attended to, as well as any others which you may give relative to this or any other matter.  I have already mentioned to you Mazzeis affair,(3) and my anxiety to know what you have done and think ought to be done in it. Dorman is still here and it may be of consequence to take the necessary measures before he goes away which will probably be ere long. We hear nothing very interesting of late from Massts. Rewards are offered for Shays & the other leaders of the mutiny by Govr. Bowdoin, and in consequence of intimations that they were directing their course & incendiary views to this State, by Governor Lincoln.(4) Congs. have at length passed a Resolution in favor of the Convention. The difficulties were in some measure got over by an instruction from the Legislature of N.Y. to its delegates to move for such an interposition.

 My dear Sir N. York Feby. 25th. 1787 The Secreta[r]y's despatch will have communicated to you the Resolution of Congress giving their sanction to the proposed Meeting in May next.(1) At the date of my last a great division of opinion prevailed on the subject; it being supposed by some of the States that the interposition of Congress was necessary to give regularity to the proceeding, and by others that a neutrality on their part was a necessary antidote for the jealousy entertained of their wishes to enlarge the powers within  February 26, 1787  their own administration. The circumstance which conduced much to decide the point was an instruction from N. York to its delegates to move in Congress for some recommendation of a Convention. The style of the instruction makes it probable that it was the wish of this State to have a new Convention instituted, rather than the one on foot recognized. Massts. seemed also skittish on this point. Connecticut opposed the interposition of Congs. altogether. The Act of Congs. is so expressed as to cover the proceedings of the States which have already provided for the Convention without any pointed recognition of them.(2) Our situation is becoming every day more & more critical. No money comes into the federal Treasury: no respect is paid to the federal authority; and people of reflection unanimously agree that the existing Confederacy is tottering to its foundation. Many individuals of weight particularly in the Eastern district are suspected of leaning towards Monarchy. Other individuals predict a partition of the States into two or more Confederacies. It is pretty certain that if some radical amendment of the single one can not be devised and introduced that one or other of these revolutions, the latter no doubt, will take place. I hope you are bending your thoughts seriously to the great work of guarding agst. both. Yrs. Affely, Js. M. Jr [P.S.] Inclose a Newspaper when you write & think of it. ""

 Dear Col. New York Febry. 27th 1787 I received your favor of the 10th Decr. and will attend to your business whenever a fair oppertunity presents of being able to carry it through. We are obliged to watch for a proper time to strike here with as much attention and caution---;as a good General will an Enemy. February 27, 1787  I intend to make Fort Pitt a Visit in May before that time I hope you will receive orders for making an establishment at Vinango---;I mean a detachment only. My motives for wishing this done shall explain to you after the thing is accomplished which will be with difficulty if at all. The grand object most people seem to have in view is to prevent intruders on the lands. I confess this is not the principle with me. The great War in Massachusetts is near a close---; but the people of that Government are by no means satisfied. The Legislature have it is thought carried their triumph too far. An Act to disarm and Disfranchise for three years, all those who took up arms has passed it is thought the number is about 14,000---;outlaws. The numbers really disaffected by these measures will be three fold as all the near relations and particular friends to those disfranchised will feel sore. If this calculation & reasoning is Just---;is it not to be feared that insurgency will soon again raise its head? These troubles have doubtless had bad effect on the Recruiting. I believe the whole yet raised do not exceed 300. And it is said Massachusetts are about to raise 1500 Men for four months state Troops to keep the insurgents in awe. Under these circumstances I think it probable no competitors for the Command, will appear in the West for some time---; notwithstanding the poetick fire of an Humphry in the East---;shines with so much lustre.(1) Inclosed you have an Act of Congress---;which I hope will be productive of much good---;it may do good & can do no harm, which is greatly in favor of the measure. Several states have already appointed Delegates and I think all will. Such a respectable body of Men have not been convened on any occasion since the first Congress as it is supposed these will be. Some States have complied in part with the requisitions of Congress---;some not at all, and others have flatly refused. There is therefore no alternative to giving up all at once for lost---;but that ofattempting to revise and mend the Confederation---;or frame an entire new Government---;whether the proposed Convention will be able to effect either it is hard to say---;but an attempt is necessary and the sooner it is made it will be sooner compleated. Under the present Government it is much to be feared---;that insurgency---;& Rebellion---;may pervade more States than Massachusetts. The people of Maryland are at this moment in great ferment about paper money, some are Violent for & others as much against it. The Assembly were generally for---;and the Sennate unanimously against. Such was the Animosity that an Adjournment took place for the purpose of appealing to the people. They are soon to meet again when I hope they will accommodate. The foregoing hints I have t[h]rown out meerly to give you some general Ideas---;of what is passing. You will therefore not I am persuaded make an improper use of them. Pray present my respects to Mrs. Harmar---;and believe me to be with great regard, Dear Col., Your friend & Humble Servant, Wm. Irvine(2)  ""

To this he answer'd in the affirmative provided a Treaty was once formed between his Court & the United States. [Whenever] the event takes place, he would undertake the Negociation of the Business and that untill that period should arrive Nothing could be done about such a Contract. Now when this Period will arrive is uncertain: it is also doubtful whether it will ever arrive; I have some reasons to beleive it will not happen in the days of Mr. Gardoqui. I have also shewn it to Mr. De'Laforest the Consul General Resident here of his Most Christian Majesty and signafied to him our Wish to make a Contract to supply annually to the Navy of France a certain Quantity of Pitch, Tar & Turpentine. This Gentleman in my Opinion is the best informed and most industrious servant that any European Power has in America and at the same Time the best Friend of America ever endeavouring to blend so together the Interst of each as to be benefical to both. He was much pleased with the proposals but could give no possitive answer adding that he was uninformed how the Navy of France was supplyed with those Articles as well as of the Value of those Articles made in America. But very obligingly said and I am sure with great Sincerity, that if I would procure from the state of North Carolina an Account of the quantity of those articles exported from No. Cara. in the years 1785 & 1786 that he would transmit it to the Court and that he was sure the Court would give a Preference to those Articles made in America provided they should be found on Examination to answer her purposes as well and advised if a Contract was wished to be made and which he should be glad to see take place; that three Barrells of Tar, and a like quantity of  March 1, 1787  Pitch, Turpentine & Rosin should be sent to him here with a Certificate under the seal of the state that it is agreeable to the Laws of that state as to quantity and quality and that he will cause them to be shiped in the French Packet addressed to certain Persons in France to be examined and reported on to the Minister of Marine & that if Proposals were made to him he would at the same Time forward them to the Court and do every thing that he consistently could to serve Us in the Business. Whereupon I wrote to the Governor(2) and requested him to order the Naval Officers of the different ports to transmit without delay to the delegates in Congress an Account of all the Exports from N. Ca. for the Years 1785 and 1786---;since when Mr. Laforest has informed me that the Reports from the respective Naval Officers should be made to the Governor and be by him certifyed under the seal of the state and last Evening he called on me and informed that a Packet would sail from this on the 15th of April in which he should go Passenger, renewing his Declaration of wishing to see such a Contract take place and that as he should be in France, perhaps if the proposals were forwarded by him it would be more in his power to forward it. I fear you will say that the 15th of April will come too soon but I hope not, The greatest difficulty I apprehend in the Business will [be] to get the proper Certificates of the Exports properly authenticated by the Governor and this I think the Governor could cause to be done in a short Time and I am sure the Interest of that state will be perfectly considered in the Act especially if a Contract be thereby produced and this reason alone will no doubt induce the Governor to give every dispach in his power to the Business. Take Care that the samples are good and in good barrells. Hawkins says they should be branded with your Firm in plain Letters and I believe he is right. When you ship them address them to Mr. John Ramsay of whose Honesty I entertain the highest Opiniontho' he has been unfortunate. Another Packet will sail on the 15th June for France so that if you cannot be ready for the first you may for the second. Will you cause this Letter to be copied thus far and send a Copy thereof to the Governor in his private Capacity to the End that it may in some degree govern him in his Public.

 Gentlemen, 13 Princess Street 1st of March 1787 We have no regular information respecting the State Tobacco:(1) And it is probable our want of it is owing to the returns having been made to the Delegates of the State who were in Congress last year, And which has been carried to North Carolina among their papers. The enclosed from Mr. Dowse(2) we give credit to ourselves, subjoining the following remarks. The quantity at Wilmington must have been inspected at Fayetteville or as he names it Campbell's town. That at Roanoke is in the warehouses from whence the shipments are made at the port of Edenton: And it is of the Halifax inspection rarely inferior to the Petersburgh. That at John Gray Blount's is at Washington and of the Tarborough inspection latterly equal to the Halifax inspection. Mr. Hawkins was at Fayetteville in December and at Halifax in January, and made some inquiry as to the quality of the inspectors, they told him, it was superior to any made the Crop 1786, and the most of it, if not damaged, of the Petersburg quality. But as he did suppose that the proper information was lodged with the Delegates: he did not apply farther. The quantity reported by a Committee who brought in the bill for the sale &ca of it, was 1,360,000 lb. nett. If the report of the Committee is just, and founded on the number of hogsheads reported by Mr. Dowse, the average weight of the Tobacco is a certain evidence of the goodness of it.

 Dear Sir, Newyork March 8th 1787 This Morning your's of the 11th Febry inclosing TB's(1) of the 20th November and am really much concerned for his Situation. A few Minutes before I received it I had delivered to Mr Smith the brother in law of Mr Eyre who sails this day for London, a Letter for T. Blount in which I had advised him to return to America and not to Wait the arrival of the Brig John in France but on the Receipt of yours and his Letter I again wrote him and told him that I thought he had best wait your Order and that you would certainly shortly relieve him.  Nothing decisive can shortly be done by the Delegates in the sale of the Tobacco but it appears to me very certain that Mr. Robert Morris must be the Purchaser and if he is I have not [a] doubt but you'll be able so to agree with him that he will let us have 100 Hogsheads on the Terms on which he purchased the whole and I would really advise you as the Tobacco is in your Possession to make use of the quantity you want relying that you shall have that quantity at the price the other sells at let who will become the Purchaser, it must go cheap because you may rely that no Adventurer will be able to get it by biding us a high price for before it goes out of our Hands you may rely we shall have the most unequivocal Proofs of our being paid. How far the Farmers General have been supplyed with Tobacco I can get no Information but this you may rely on that whatever can be done by my Friend Delaforest in our favour will be done on that Head for us.  If you should wish [to have any] more or the whole of the tobacco at Washington let me know by Letter for I will not quit Congress untill this business is closed. At present I do not see that it will be in our power to sell the Tobacco untill we are informed officially where the Tobacco is stored and the quantity and quality at each place. I am, Your's Wm.

 Dear Sir, New-York 8th March 1787 I have had within a few days the pleasure to receive your favor of the 13th August.(1) It was received at the office of Foreign affairs in Novr. and has been traveling since southwardly and Northwardly to meet with me. I have been attentive to your other request, and expect I shall be able to send you a few plants of the Dionaea muscipula some time this Spring; Mr. de la Forest(2) who returns to France promises to take charge of them: And a very attentive worthy man is to send me a dozen or more from Wilmington in small earthen pots. I will also send you some of the seed as soon as it is practicable. I shall send you by Mr. de L Forest the little Vocabulary of the Cherokee & Choctaw tongues:(3) and such other information as I may receive. I have a letter from Mr. McGillivray which gives room to hope by that period he will have answered fully the part I allotted to him. We are not here in so profound a calm, as in Europe. The uneasinesses which have existed in Massachusets for some time past grew into a serious opposition to that Government, and they are now by the vigorous though not timely opposition of the government but in train of adjustment. The Southern States are more tranquil, and are emerging fast into order; and if the Foederal Government can be made efficient the revolution will be a blessing to them. Virginia taking the lead for this most desirable object proposed a convention to be in May next at Philadelphia. North Carolina and some other States have followed her example and Congress on the 21st of February recommended it to all as the most probable mean of establishing a firm national Government. Spain availing herself of probable conjectures bids far to be the first power who will strengthen our bonds of Union, unmindful of her true interest, she seems determined to oppose her partial contracted policy, to that generous reciprocity of mutual good offices, which being the basis of our friendship would be a never failing guarantee to both Nations.She has seized some of our boats on the Mississipi and refuses us absolutely the navigation thereof. Our citizens view this as an infraction of their rights. The States of Virginia, North Carolina, New Jersey and some others have expressed it in strong terms, the words of North Carolina are \""That their delegates be instructed to oppose in the most unequivocal terms any attempt that may be made to barter or surrender to any Nation the right of this  March 8, 1787  State to the free and common Navigation of the Mississipi, and in case any such surrender should take place, that they should be instructed to protest against the same, as an unjust depravation of the right of this State, and one which Congress are not authorized to make by the articles of confederation.\"" This arose from this additional circumstance. {Seven states}(4) only {counting from the east have repealed the article in favor of the Missisipi in the instructions to} Mr. {Jay and he} is now at full liberty to {shut up or not the Mississipi} and he appears to me to approve of it for the {period of twenty years}. Should this take place, I know not what consequences may ensue. Our Western citizens will feel much alarmed for their situation. They will have less {confidence in the justice of Congress} and be disposed to {carve} for {themselves}. They are already numerous and daily increasing. For a {violation of a treaty Congress would be immediately responsible}---;And probably our western citizens might {skirmish for some years without bringing about an open rupture and within eight or ten we would be able to support our right. What can be done? You may eventually be able to do something}. If the French court had the Floridas and would establish an entrepÃ´t at New-Orleans or some other place equally convenient on a liberal scale, it would certainly be of the first consequence to them, in a commercial point of view, as we should consume their manufactures principally, in return for the raw materials which we could supply them with in abundance. With Spain somthing could be done if we had a man of great abilities and prudence at Madrid there to treat; here I am sure we have nothing to hope as I conjecture Mr. Gardoqui has duped himself and consequently given such an impression of things here as to lead his court to be very sanguine in their expectations. And {he does not appear to me to be a man of a noble mind enough to acknowledge his error} and to give that true complexion which he hascertainly learnt to discover. I have used the cypher of our friend Mr. Madison. He, expecting shortly an opportunity more certain than the present, postpones writing untill then, and he presents you his most respectful compliments. Your acquaintance Mr. Nash is dead and I am in Congress in his stead. I am with sincere esteem & regard & Friendship, Dear Sir, your most obedient & hl. Servt., Benjamin Hawkins ""

 Dear Sir New York March 10th. 1787 As the Business of the Mississippi, and consequently the Treaty with Spain is, I see likely to be agitated in the Assembly, I have taken the  March 10, 1787  Liberty to give you an Abstract, as well as I can recollect, of what passed on that Subject in another Place;(1) not that I presume to furnish you with any new Ideas, or that I am insensible of the impropriety of divulging the Substance of Debates where Secresy is enjoined. It is in my Opinion a very improper thing to bring matters of general national Import before the individual Legislatures, and is very rarely done, I believe, but where single Men conceive some Object of immediate Interest to themselves may be affected, and which they are inclined to pursue without much regard to the public good, and I take this to be very much the Case in the present Instance. It is realy a sort of Apeal to the People, who have Passions only to be roused, and no reason to be convinced or Judgment to be directed. It may be some excuse for myself that I know that Communications on this Subject have been made, and expressly with that view, to leading Men in some of the States, and have reason to believe that the same is done or doing by one, if not two of my Colleagues to Members of your House, and it appears to me to be proper that if one Side of a Picture is to be shewn, it should be presented on [the] other side also. The Vote to remove the Seat of Government(2) has surprised us here very much, and augurs ill to other Measures. I am of Opinion it would be best not to give it very serious Opposition, or it will end in transferring it to Lancaster, and perhaps detaching the Members from that County from the Party. I cannot think them serious in the Design to go Harris's, but I think it very probable that they may explain themselves to them as having Lancaster realy for their Object. There seems to be a Spirit of Madness gone forth amongst the People that nothing but some severe calamity I fear will restrain. The Massachusets Insurection seems to be quelled, but it is certain the Discontents still prevail, and it may well be doubted whether the disqualifying so many People till the next general Election shall be over,was very prudent, or at all likely to remove them. We shall want one State more from the Southward to carry the removal from this Place and have not a prospect of having it soon, as Maryland will not be here at all until a new Appointment takes place, after the meeting of their Legislature. I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Ar. St. Clair [P.S.] What is your Opinion of the Pittsburgh County. I wish we may not overshoot ourselves in that Business. I know Mr. Brackenridge is sanguine that the Republican Interest would prevail there---;but I think he is mistaken, and I know that County very well. There are very few People in it that either know or care any thing about the State of Partys, still fewer that are decidedly with us and have any weight, and scarce any that would not sacrifice at the Shrine of popularity. The Presbyterian Interest is the prevailing Interest in all the western Counties, and they and the Constitutionals have made almost every where common Cause. The County Town for Westmoreland should be  March 11, 1787  fixed---;neither Hanna's nor Lacks Town are the proper places, the last is but eight miles from the southern boundary and the first about four miles farther whilst is forty at least to the northern and great deal more to the north East. Hannas Town would do well enough however whilst the County is kept together---;but in case of a Division, and it must come some time, the place should be some where on the Loyal Hanning. There is a very good place at the Breast Works below the nine Mile run---;but the land belongs to me, which woud be I suppose an Objection. Irwin was complaining to me this morning that he is suspected of desertion. I wish the matter of his correspondence may not have been improperly mentioned. I told him I had heard of it in Philada. with Smillie---;and that he boasted of it, on all occasions. ""

 My dear friend N. York March 11th. 1787 The Governor of this State is just returned from his trip to the upper parts of it. He found every thing quiet in the place to which suspicions & reports carried him. He says also as I am told that Lincoln has restored a calm in that part of Massts. which borders on N.Y. as he had before done in the other disaffected parts.(1) Notwith- March 11, 1787  standing these favorable accounts there is reason to apprehend that every thing is not yet right in Massts. and that the discontents are rather silenced than subdued. The measures taken by the Legislature of that state prove that such is their view of the matter. They have disfranchized a considerable proportion of the disaffected voters, have voted a military force for the purpose of maintaining the tranquility of the Commonwlth, and their Delegates in pursuance of instructions have within a few days put on the Journals of Congs. a representation including an assertion of right to federal support in case of necessity.(2) The appointments for the Convention are still going on. Georgia has appointed her delegates to Congs. her representatives in that body also. The Gentlemen from that State here at present are Col. Few, and Majr. Pierce formerly Aid to Genl. Green. I am told just now that S. C. has appointed the two Rutledges and Majr. Butler. Col Hamilton, with a Mr. Yates and a Mr. Lansing are appointed by N. York. The two latter are supposed to lean too much towards State considerations to be good members of an Assembly which will only be useful in proportion to its superiority to partial views & interests. Massts. has also appointed. Messrs Ghorum, Dana, King, Gerry & Strong compose her deputation. The Resolution under which they are appointed restrains them from acceding to any departure from the principle of the 5th article of Confederation. It is conjectured that this fetter which originated with their Senate, will be knocked off. Its being introduced at all denotes a very different spirit in that quarter from what some had been led to expect.(3) Connecticut it is now generally believed will come into the measure. Nothing has been yet done in the principal business before Congress, and I fear the number of States will not increase so far as to be competent to it. The Negociations with Spain are carried on if they {go on at all}(4) entirely {behind the curtain}. The business hasbeen put into such a form that it rests wholly {with Jay how far he will proceed with Guardoqui} and how far {he will communicate with Congress}. The instructed States are hence {under some embarrasment}. They can not demand information {of right}. They are unwilling by asking it {of favour to risk a refusal} and they cannot resort to the present thin Congs. with any hope of success. Should Congs. become pretty full, and {Pennsylvania} follow N. C., Virga. & N. Jersey, in giving instructions, the {case may be altered}. Adieu. Js. M.  [P.S.] We have just agreed that the delegates here shall in future write individually and in rotation to the Executive. You will please to consider this which I had written before the rule was fixed as a private letter, in the light of a public one so far as it may deserve communication to the Board, not however depositing it among their public papers.

 Dear Sir, Newyork March 12th 1787 Yesterday and the day before H[awkins] & myself had Conversations with the individual Members of the board of Treasury and also with Duer their Secretary and they (as a Board) wish the Tobacco to be sold to raise Mony to pay the June Interest in Holland and say a Credit may be given as late as November provided the payment is m'de in Bills that can be discounted in Holland in June. Constable Rucker & Co of which Morris is one will I expect offer us 26/4 per 100 lb Weight in this Kind of payment and I think more cannot be offered by any than who means to pay for it and it will not be sold to no Man for no price however high without we have the greatest Certainty of the Mony. It will be in my power I believe to get such part of the purchase as I please at present. I only think of 100 Hogsheads and I repeat that you may venture to use that quantity.

I believe much, however, is to be done yet, to render peace and order permanent; & to give health and vigor to our republic---;it is not sufficient that the political condition of men should, in fact, be good & eligible; but they must be made to esteem it so. I hope the Government and it's friends will, with the eye of dispassionate reason, view the Commonwealth; and the progressive effect of public measures. I should be very sorry to see great numbers of our people moving to Canada, &c. It would much effect the Strength and honor of the United States---;but I fear such an event---;great encouragement is given by the British Government to tempt them to do it. The British are very busy on our frontiers, and our frontier Inhabitants from New Hampshire to Georgia in my opinion will give us much trouble in a few years if we do not treat & govern them with much prudence & good policy. Pray how Stand affairs in Vermont---;is it supposed in your part of the Country that the people of that State are desirous of coming into the Confederacy? New York has it in Contemplation to move for their admission in the Confederacy, & an acknowledgment of their independance &c.

If my continuing as a security for the Sum I endorsed a Note for will be any manner of Service to you, I am willing to do so, and ready to renew it in the manner it now stands or to put it into any other Shape that may be most useful, at any time that it may be des[ired.] I have been turning in my Mind [the state] of the Lands you mentioned that you intended to [give] as a Security for your part of the Debts of your late unfortunate Partnership and been making Enquiries here from Persons that I believe competent Judges of the value of Lands situated as yours [are,] the Result of which has been that they would [be] a very ample Security for a much greater Sum provided there was not a necessity of very suddenly converting them into Money. When their Situation, all either upon the Delaware or having an easy communication with it and by it to the City of Philadelphia together with the Settlements that are already formed and the moral certainty of their rapid progression it is taken into consideration it is clear to almost a Demonstration that their value must encrease more rapidly than any other Species of property whatsoever---;indeed I presume if they were to be sold even now and time given for the payment they [wou]ld sell for much more Money, tho the Case might be otherwise if ofered for ready Money only, for in that Case they must fall into the hands of monied Men who purchase only with a view to the encreasing  March 13, 1787  value and have no design of settlement.

 Teusday March 13 [1787]. Col. Grayson & Mr. Clarke having lately moved to have the military stores at Springfield removed to some place of greater security, the motion was referred to the Secretary at War, who this day reported agst. the same as his report will shew.(1) No opposition was made to the report, and it seemed to be the general sense of Congs. that his reasons were satisfactory. The Movers of the proposition however might suppose the thinness of Congs. (8 States only being present) to bar any hope of successful opposition. Memor[an]dum. Called with Bingham today on Mr. Guardoqui, and had a long conversation touching the Western Country---;the Navigation of the Mississpi---;and commerce; as these objects relate to Spain & the U.S. Mr. B. opened the conversation with intimating that there was reason [to] believe the Western people were exceedingly alarmed at the idea of the projected Treaty which was to shut up the Mississippi and were forming committees of correspondence &c. for uniting their councils & interests. Mr. Guar. with some perturbation replied that as a friend to the U.S. he was sorry for it, for they mistook their interest; but that as the Minister of Spain, he had no reason to be so. The result of what fell in the course of the conversation from <<us> J. M. & Mr. B. was, that it was the interest of the two nations to live in harmony. March 13, 1787  That if Congress were disposed to treat with Spain on the ground of a Cession of the Mississippi, it would be out of their power to enforce the treaty---;that an attempt would be the means of populating the western Country with additional rapidity---;that the British had their eye upon that field, would countenance the separation of the Western from the Eastern part of N. A; promote the settlement of it, and hereafter be able to turn the force springing up in that quarter agst. Spanish America, in co-operation with their naval armaments---;that Spain offered nothing in fact to the U.S. in the commercial scale which she did not grant to all other nations from motives of interest. Mr. Guardoqui would not listen to the idea of a right to the navigation of Mississpi by the U.S. contending that the possession of the two banks at the mouth shut the door agst. any such pretension. Spain never would give up this point. He lamented that he had been here so long without effecting any thing: and foresaw that the consequences would be very disagreeable. What wd. these consequences be? He evaded an answer by repeating general expressions. Spain could make her own terms he said with G.B. He considered the Commercial connection proposed as entirely in favor of the U.S. & that in a little time the ports of Spain wd. be shut agst. fish. He was asked whether agst. all fish or only agst. fish from U.S.: from all places not in treaty he said with Spain. Spain would act according to her own ideas. She would not be governed by other people's ideas of her interest. He was very sorry for the instructions passed by Va. He foresaw bad consequences from them.(2) He had written to soften the matter as well as he cd. but that troops & stores wd. certainly reinforce N. Orleans in consequence of the Resolutions. He had not conferred at all with the Minister of For. Af. since Octr. and did not expect to confer again. He did not expect to remain much longer in America. He wished he might not be a true prophet, butit would be found that we mistook our interest, and that Spain wd. make us feel the vulnerable side of our commerce by abridging it in her ports. With an air of ostensible jocoseness he hinted that the people of Kentucky would make good Spanish subjects, and that they would become such for the sake of the privilege annexed to that character. He seemed to be disposed to make us believe that Spain & Britain understood one another---;that he knew the views of G. B. in holding the western posts---;and that Spain had it in her power to make G. B. bend to her views. He affected a misterious air on this point, which(3) led to a supposition that [he] doubted what to say on it. He intimated that Spain could not grant any inlet of the American trade by Treaty: but that in case of a treaty, trade thro' the Mississippi as well as other channels wd. be winked at.  In speaking of the Mississpi and the right of Spain he alluded to the case of the Tagus which Spain had never pretended to a right of navigating thro' Portugal. It was observed to him that in estimating the rights of Nations in such cases regard must be had to their respective proportions of territory on the River. Suppose Spain held only 5 Acres on each side at the mouth of Mississii wd. she pretend to an exclusive right in such case? He said that was not the Case; Spain had a great proportion. How much? After some confusion & hesitation he sd. she claimed at least ----- as far as the Ohio. We smiled, & asked how far Eastwardly from the Mispi. He became still more at a loss for an answer, & turned it off by insinuating that he had conversed on that matter with the Secretary of F. Affairs. He was reminded of the doctrine maintained by Spain in 1608, as to the Scheld.(4) He seemed not [to] have known the fact, and resolved it into some political consideration of the times. He was asked whether the partition of the B. Empire could deprive this part of it, of the rights appertaining to the King of G. B. as King of this Country---;and even whether the rupture of G. B. & Spain could deprive, in justice, the U.S. of Rights which they held under the Treaty of 1763 whilst they remained a part of the British Empire? Whether in case no such rupture had happened, the Treaty(5) would have been dissolved by the Revolution? &c &c. He did not seem well to understand the principles into which such questions resolved themselves---;and gave them the go by, referring the claim of Spain principally to her conquests of the British possessions in N. America. He betrayed strongly the anxiety of Spain to retard the population of the Western Country; observing that when ever sufficient force should arise therein, it wd. be impossible for it [to] be controuled: That any conciliating measures that might be taken now, would have little effect on their temper & views 50 or 100 years hencewhen they should be in force. When we rose to take leave, he begged us to remember what he had said as to the inflexibility of Spain on the point of the Mississippi and the consequences to America of her adherence to her present pretensions.(6) ""

I have not spoke to C[onstable] & R[ucker] & Co. to purchase any part of it but depend on geting 100 Hogsheads at the same price. The Tobacco being sold I have only one more Object in staying, that is to Vote for the Removal of Congress from this to Philadelphia and this I believe will undoubtedly happen as soon as Maryland comes up. To do this Act I owe to myself, the Yankees and the state of Newyork. Let Molsey know I am well. Your's &c &c, Wm.

 Sir, `Newyork March 14th 1787 The Delegates of North Carolina are just now offered for the Public Tobacco by Constable, Rucker & Co.(1) three dollars and one third of a dollar per Cwt. payable in such Bills on Holland as the Board of Treasury will recive as a payment from the State and as they will apply to the Payment of the Interest due on the Dutch Loan in June next. One Condition is that the Tobacco shall be reinspected under the Eye of an Agent of the Purchasers by some one or more of the North Carolina Inspectors. Another is that 30,000 dollars shall be advanced by the Purchasers on Closing the Contract otherwise the June Interest can't be provided for in Time. It is my Opinion at present that the Delegation ought to accept the Offer and I believe will and if they do Vessels will be immediately sent from hence to the different ports to receive it.

 Dear Sir, New York March 18th. 1787 Recollecting to have heard you mention a plan formed by the Empress of Russia for a comparative view of the aborigines of the new Continent, and of the N. E. parts of the old, through the medium of their respective tongues, and that her wishes had been conveyed to you for your aid in obtaining the American vocabularies, I have availed myself of an opportunity offered by the Kindness of Mr. Hawkins,(1) of taking a copy of such a sample of the Cherokee & Chactaw dialects as his late commission to treat with them enabled him to obtain, and do myself the honor now of inclosing it. I do not know how far the list of words made use of by Mr. Hawkins may correspond with the standard of the Empress, nor how far nations so remote as the Cherokees & Chactaws from the N. W. shores of America, may fall within her scheme of comparison. I presume however that a great proportion at least of the words will answer, and that the laudable curiosity which suggests investigations of this sort will be pleased with every enlargement of the field for indulging it. Not finding it convenient to retain a  March 18, 1787  copy of the inclosed as I wished to do for myself, I must ask the favor of your amanuensis to perform that task for me. The appointments for the Convention go on very successfully. Since the date of my last, Georgia, S. Carolina, N. York, Massts. & N. Hamshire have come into the measure. Georgia & N. Hampshire have constituted their Delegates in Congs. their representatives in the Convention. S. Carolina has appointed Mr. J. Rutlidge, Genl. Pinkney, Mr. Laurens, Major Butler, and Mr. Chs. Pinkney late a member of Congs. The deputies of Massts. are Mr. Dana, Mr. King, Mr. Ghoram, Mr. Gerry, Mr. Strong. I am told that a Resolution of the Legislature of this State which originated with their Senate lays its deputies under the fetter of not departing from the 5th of the present articles of Confederation. As this Resolution passed before the Recommendatory act of Congress was known, it is conjectured that it may be rescinded; but its having passed at all denotes a much greater prevalence of political jealousy in that quarter than had been imagined.(2) The deputation of N. York consists of Col. Hamilton, Judge Yates and a Mr. Lansing. The two last are said to be pretty much linked to the antifederal party here and are likely of course to be a clog on their Colleague. It is not doubted now that Connecticut & R. Island will avoid the singularity of being unrepresented in the Convention. The thinness of Congs. has been an obstacle to all the important business before them. At present there are nine States on the ground but this number, though adequate to every object when unanimous, makes a very slow progress in business that requires seven States only. And I see little prospect of the number being increased. By our latest and most authentic information from Massts. it would seem that a calm has been restored by the expedition of Genl. Lincoln. The precautions taking by the State however betray a great distrust of its continuance. Besides their act disqualifying the malcontents fromvoting in the election of members for the Legislature &c. another has been passed for raising a corps of 1000 or 1,500 men, and appropriating the choicest revenues of the Country, to its support.(3) It is said that at least half of the insurgents decline accepting the terms annexed to the amnesty, and that this defiance of the law agst. Treason, is countenanced not only by the impunity with which they shew themselves on public occasions, even with insolent badges of their character, but by marks of popular favor conferred on them in various instances in the election to local offices. A proposition has been introduced & discussed in the Legislature of this State, for relinquishing its claim to Vermont, and urging the admission of it into the Confederacy.(4) As far as I can learn difficulties will arise only in settling the form, the substance of the measures being not disliked by any of the parties. It is wished by those who are not interested in claims to lands within that district to guard agst. any   responsibility in the State for compensation. On the other side it will at least be insisted that they shall not be barred of the privilege of carrying their claims before a federal Court, in case Vermont shall become a party to the Union. I think it probable if she should not decline becoming such altogether, that she will make two conditions if not more: 1. that neither her boundaries, nor the rights of her citizens shall be impeachable under the 9th art. of Confederation.(5) 2. that no share of the public debt already contracted shall be allotted to her.  I have a letter from Col. Jno. Campbel dated at Pittsburg, from wch. I gather that the people of that quarter are thrown into great agitation by the reported intention of Congs. concerning the Mississippi, and that measures are on foot, for uniting the minds of all the different settlements which have a common interest at stake. Should this policy take effect I think there is much ground to apprehend that the ambition of individuals will quickly mix itself with the first impulses of resentment and interest, that by degrees the people may be led to set up for themselves, that they will slide like Vermont insensibly into a communication and latent connection with their British neighbours, and in pursuance of the same example, make such a disposition of the Western territory as will entice into it most effectually emigrants from all parts of the Union. If these apprehensions be not imaginary they suggest many observations extremely interesting to Spain as well as to the United States. I hear from Richmond with much concern that Mr. Henry has positively declined his mission to Philada. Besides the loss of his services on that theatre, there is danger I fear that this step has proceeded from a wish to leave his conduct unfettered on another theatre where the result of the Convention will receive its destiny from his omnipotence. With every sentiment of esteem & affection I remain, Dear Sir, Your Obedt. and very hble Servt., Js. MadisonJr. ""

 Dear Sir N. York. March 19th. 1787. My last was of the 11th of Feby. and went by the Packet. This will go to England in the care of a French gentleman who will consign it to the care of Mr. Adams. The appointments for the Convention go on auspiciously. Since my last Georgia, S. Carolina, N. York, Massts. and N. Hampshire have come into the measure. The first and last of these States have commissioned their delegates to Congress, their representatives in Convention. The deputation of Massts. consists of Messrs. Ghoram, Dana, King, Gerry, and Strong. That of N. York, Messrs. Hamilton, Yates & Lansing. That of S. Carolina, Messrs. J. Rutlidge, Laurens, Pinkney (General) Butler, and Chas. Pinkney lately member of Congress. The States which have not yet appointed are R. Island, Connecticut, and Maryland. The latter has taken measures which prove her intention to appoint, and the two former it is not doubted will follow the example of their neighbours. I just learn from the Governor of Virginia that Mr. Henry has resigned his place in the deputation from that State, and that Genl. Nelson is put into it by the Executive who were autho March 19, 1787  rized to fill vacancies. The Governor, Mr. Wythe & Mr. Blair will attend, and some hopes are entertained of Col. Mason's attendance. Genl. Washington has prudently authorized no expectations of his attendance, but has not either precluded himself absolutely from stepping into that field if the crisis should demand it. What may be the result of this political experiment cannot be foreseen. The difficulties which present themselves are on one side almost sufficient to dismay the most sanguine, whilst on the other side the most timid are compelled to encounter them by the mortal diseases of the existing constitution. These diseases need not be pointed out to you who so well understand them. Suffice it to say that they are at present marked by symptoms which are truly alarming, which have tainted the faith of the most orthodox republicans, and which challenge from the votaries of liberty every concession in favor of stable Government not infringing fundamental principles, as the only security against an opposite extreme of our present situation. I think myself that it will be expedient in the first place to lay the foundation of the new system in such a ratification by the people themselves of the several States as will render it clearly paramount to their Legislative authorities. 2dly. Over & above the positive power of regulating trade and sundry other matters in which uniformity is proper, to arm the federal head with a negative in all cases whatsoever on the local Legislatures. Without this defensive power experience and reflection have satisfied me that however ample the federal powers may be made, or however Clearly their boundaries may be delineated, on paper, they will be easily and continually baffled by the Legislative sovereignties of the States. The effects of this provision would be not only to guard the national rights and interests against invasion, but also to restrain the States from thwarting and molesting each other, and even from oppressing the minority within themselves by papermoney and other unrighteous measures which favor the interest of the majority. In order to render the exercise of such a negative prerogative convenient, an emanation of it must be vested in some set of men within the several States so far as to enable them to give a temporary sanction to laws of immediate necessity. 3dly. to change the principle of Representation in the federal system. Whilst the execution of the Acts of Congs. depends on the several legislatures, the equality of votes does not destroy the inequality of importance and influence in the States. But in case of such an augmentation of the federal power as will render it efficient without the intervention of the Legislatures, a vote in the general Councils from Delaware would be of equal value with one from Massts. or Virginia. This change therefore is just. I think also it will be practicable. A majority of the States conceive that they will be gainers by it. It is recommended to the Eastern States by the actual superiority of their populousness, and to the Southern by their expected superiority. And   if a majority of the larger States concur, the fewer and smaller States must finally bend to them. This point being gained, many of the objections now urged in the leading States agst. renunciations of power will vanish. 4thly. to organise the federal powers in such a manner as not to blend together those which ought to be exercised by separate departments. The limited powers now vested in Congs. are frequently mismanaged from the want of such a distribution of them. What would be the case, under an enlargement not only of the powers, but the number, of the federal Representatives? These are some of the leading ideas which have occurred to me, but which may appear to others as improper, as they appear to me necessary. Congress have continued so thin as to be incompetent to the despatch of the more important business before them. We have at present nine States and it is not improbable that something may now be done. The report of Mr. Jay on the mutual violations of the Treaty of peace will be among the first subjects of deliberation.(1) He {favors the British claim of interest}(2) but {refers} the {question to the court}. The amount of the {report which is an able one} is that the {treaty should} be {put in force} as a {law and the exposition of it} left like that {of other laws to the ordinary tribunals}. The {Spanish project sleeps. A} perusal of the {attempt of seven states} to make a {new treaty by repealing} an {essential condition of the old} satisfied me that Mr. {Jay's caution} would {revolt at so irregular a sanction}. A late accidental conversation with {Guardoqui proved to me} that the {negociation is arrested}.(3) It may appear strange that a member of {Congress should be indebted to a foreign minister} for {such information yet such} is the {footing on which} the {intemperance} of {party has put the matter} that it rests wholly with {Mr. Jay how far he} will {communicate with Congress} as well as {how far he will negociate with Guardoqui}. But although it appears that the intended{sacrifice of} the {Missisipi will not be made}, the {consequences of the intention} and the {attempt are likely to be very serious}. I have already made known to you the light in which the subject was {taken up by Virginia}.(4) Mr. {Henry's disgust exceeded all measure} and I am not singular in ascribing his refusal to {attend the Convention} to the {policy of keeping himself free} to {combat or espouse the result of it according} to the result {of the Missisipi business among other circumstances. North Carolina also} has given {pointed instructions} to {her delegates, so has New Jersey}. A {proposition} for the {like purpose} was a {few days ago made in the legislature of Pennsylvania} but went off without a {decision on its merits. Her delegates in Congress are equally divided} on the subject. The tendency of this {project} to {foment distrusts among the Atlantic states} at a {crisis when harmony} and {confidence ought to have been} studiously {cherished} has not been more {verified than its predicted effect} on the {ultramontane-  settlements}. I have credible information that the people {living on the western waters are already in great agitation and are} taking {measures for uniting their consultations}. The {ambition} of {individuals} will {quickly mix itself} with the {original motives of resentment and interest}. A {communication will gradually} take place {with their British neighbors}. They will be {led to set up for themselves} to {seize on the vacant lands} to {entice emigrants(5) by bounties} and an {exemption from federal burdens} and in all respects to {play the part of Vermont on a larger theatre}. It is {hinted to me} that {British partisans} are already {feeling the pulse} of some of the {Western settlements}. Should these {apprehensions not be imaginary Spain may have equal reason} with the {United States to rue the unnatural attempt to shut the Missisipi. Guardoqui has been admonished} of {the danger} and I believe {is not insensible to it tho'} he {affects to be otherwise} and {talks} as if the dependance of {Britain on the commercial favors of his court} would {induce her to play into the hands of Spain}. The eye of {France also can not fail to watch over the western prospects}. I learn from those who {confer here with Otto and de la Forest} that they {favor the opening of the Missisipi} dis{claim[in]g at the same time any authority to} speak the {sentiments of their court}. I find that the {Virginia delegates during the Missisipi discussions} last {fall entered into very confidential interviews with these gentlemen}. In one of them the {idea was communicated to Otto} of {opening the Missisipi for exports} but {not for imports} and {of giving to France and Spain} some {exclusive privileges in the trade}.(6) He {promised} to transmit it to {Vergennes to obtain his sentiments} on the {whole matter} and {to communicate them to the delegates}. Not long {since Grayson called on him} and {revived the subject}. He as{sured G---;---;} that {he had received no answer from(7) France} and signified his {wish that youmight pump the Count de Vergennes observing that he would deny to you his having received any information from America}. I {discover thro} several {channels that it would be} very {grateful to the French politicians here to see our negociations with Spain shifted into your hands} and {carried on under the mediating auspices of their court}.(8) {Van Berkel has remonstrated against the} late {acts of Virginia giving privileges to French wines and brandies in French bottoms, contending} that the {Dutch are entitled} by {their treaty to equal exemptions} with the {most favored nation without being subject to a compensation for them}. Mr. {Jay has reported against this construction} but considers the {act of Virginia as violating the treaty} first {because it appears to be gratuitous} not {compensatory on the face of it}. Secondly {because the states have no right to form tacit compacts} with {foreign nations}. No decision of Congress has yet taken place on the subject.(9) The expedition under General Lincoln agst. the insurgents has effectually succeeded in dispersing them. Whether the calm which he   has restored will be durable or not is uncertain. From the precautions taking by the Govt. of Massts. it would seem as if their apprehensions were not extinguished. Besides disarming and disfranchising for a limited time those who have been in arms, as a condition of their pardon, a military corps is to be raised to the amount of 1000, or 1500 men, and to be stationed in the most suspected districts. It is said that notwithstanding these specimens of the temper of the Government, a great proportion of the offenders chuse rather to risk the consequences of their treason, than submit to the conditions annexed to the amnesty, that they not only appear openly on public occasions but distinguish themselves by badges of their character, and that this insolence is in many instances countenanced by no less decisive marks of popular favor than elections to local offices of trust & authority. A proposition is before the Legislature of this State now sitting for renouncing its pretensions to Vermont, and urging the admission of it into the Confederacy. The different parties are not agreed as to the form in which the renunciation should be made, but are likely to agree as to the substance. Should the offer be made, and Vermont should not reject it altogether I think they will insist on two stipulations at least, 1st. that their becoming parties to the Confederation shall not subject their boundaries, or the rights of their citizens to be questioned under the 9th art. 2dly. that they shall not be subject to any part of the public debts already contracted. The Geographer and his assistants have returned surveys on the federal lands to the amount of about 800,000 Acres which it is supposed would sell pretty readily for public securities, and some of it lying on the Ohio even for specie. It will be difficult however to {get proper steps taken by Congress, so many of the states having} now {lands of their own at market}. It is supposed that this consideration had {some share in the zeal for shutting theMissisipi. New Jersey} and some others {having no western lands} which {favored this measure} begin now to {penetrate the secret}. A letter from the Govr. of Virga. informs me that paper money is beginning to recover from the blow given it at the last Session of the Legislature. {If Mr. Henry espouses it, of which} there is {little doubt I think an emission will take place}. The Governor mentions the death of Col A. Cary speaker of the Senate. This letter will be accompanied by another inclosing a few Peccan Nuts.(10) When I sent the latter to the Gentleman who is charged with it, I doubted whether I should be able to finish this in time, and I only succeed by having written to the last moment. Adieu. Yrs. Afey., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Sir New York March 19th. 1787 Your Excellency's two favors of the 1st & 4th of March, with the papers referred to have been duly received. Of the latter a discretionary use will be made as you are pleased to recommend.(1) A copy of the Note from Mr. Vanberkle complaining of Certain late acts of Virginia has been already transmitted. I now add the Report of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the subject, which has not yet undergone the consideration of Congress.(2) The appointments for the Convention go on auspiciously. All the States have now come into the measure except Maryland of whom no doubt is entertained; and Connecticut and Rhode Island, who it is expected will follow the example of their neighbours. Notwithstanding the apparent victory in Massachusetts over the spirit of rebellion, it is said that at least half the offenders choose rather to defy the consequences of treason, than accept of the amnesty on the conditions annexed to it; that they not only appear openly on public occasions, but have the insolence to wear badges of their character, and that this boldness is countenanced in many places by popular elections of them to local offices. A proposition has been introduced & discussed in the Legislature here for relinquishing the claim of the State to Vermont and urging the admission of it into the Union. The substance of the proposition is not disliked by any party and it is expected will be agreed to. The only difference of opinion turns on the form, the party not interested  March 19, 1787  in claims to lands within that district being jealous of a design in the interested party to involve a responsibility in the State for compensation, and the latter party being not less jealous perhaps of a latent wish in the former to see their claims barred even of the chance which the 9th art. of the Union will present if Vermont should become a member of it. The reports of a friendly communication between that district and Canada have of late been very strong and if well founded render it unlikely that the Government of it will be disposed to join the confederacy at all. In no case will they do it I presume without securing their boundaries, and the rights of their people agst. the operation of the 9th art. of Confederation, and the State agst. the burden of the public debt already contracted. Congress have been too thin for the dispatch of important business, and indeed for any business at all. To day we have 9 States in Town. How long that number may remain is uncertain, and if it should remain how far in practice it may be found competent to the business of 7 States is equally so.

 Dear Sir, New York the 19th March 1787 Immediately on the receipt of your Excellency's favor of the 12th of January with the extract of an Act for the disposal of the public Tobacco Colo. Blount turned his attention to that important object, but could not make any progress: And on the arrival of Mr. Hawkins we agreed to apply to the Board of Treasury for their advise and assistance and accordingly wrote them the letter marked 1) with the extract.(1) We at the same time called on the Board and gave such an explanation as would remove as far as was practicable any objections against the unfoederal aspect of the Act. The United States in Congress assembled having the authority \""to ascertain the necessary sums of money to be raised for the service of the United States, and to appropriate and apply the same for defraying the public expences.\"" The Board seemed much disposed to cooperate with us, and took upon them the part assigned in our first quere. To their letter marked 2)(2) we could give no other information than such as is detailed in the enclosed which follow in order, that letter. We soon discovered, that to sell the Tobacco and at a higher price was practicable, provided we would do it on credit, and at the risque of not being paid, or if paid, in paper money in our own State or some other State at par with the specie contract. The variety of Bankrupts in the large commercial Cities, has given such a shock to private faith, that Bills of exchange are deemed a very uncertain remittance. The Act did not authorise us to Ship the Tobacco, or we should most assuredly have sent it to the Farmer's general of France, having it previously ensured in Europe, and under the care of Mr. Jefferson our minister plenipotentiary at Paris. This mode it is generally agreed here, would have produced the most, and next to it the one we have adopted. This latter will produce us a credit at twenty six and eight pence per hundred, on the receipt of the receipts of the Tobacco, at the Treasury and it will, moreover, be paidaccording to the intentions of our Legislature in discharge of so much of the interest which will be due on the Dutch Loans on the 1st of June next. This payment from  March 19, 1787  our State is at a very critical period, as, while we pay our interest on the Dutch Loans our credit will be high in the United Netherlands, and the finances of the United States were utterly inadequate thereto, without this and from us. The Minister of the U. Netherlands, has been sufficiently impressed with the upright views & friendly intentions of North Carolina in this business, and he assures us he will in return render us any civilities in his power, particularly, in endeavouring to establish an extensive commercial connection between the two Countrys. We have assured Constable, Rucker & Co. that orders would be immediately given by your Excellency to the several Commissioners to have the Tobacco reinspected &ca. according to the Forms of the agreement.(3) And we have farther to add that the Tobacco at Wilmington will be the first called for. A ship now in port here being ready to sail for that purpose. As the credit is to be given on the receipts, we request that duplicates may be taken and sent forward from time to time as the Tobacco is delivered; Thus much as to the transaction and now, to our own feelings, we did deem it proper to wait for a short period the arrival of Colo. Ashe, because in all money matters we well know that Republicks were invariably jealous, and not being able to trust themselves, would with extreme difficulty be brought to give that credit which should be paid to their faithful servants more especially, when absent. The affair was urgent, payment of interest must be made, at a given period, that period near at hand, the resources of the U. States inadequate thereto, Our National credit at Stake, and all Bills of Exchange or credit transactions very dubious. What was the best to be done? We trust your Excellency will say, & after you, our constituents; that, which your delegates have done. We have the honor to be with great & sincere esteem, Dear Sr., yr. Excellency's Most obt. & h.

I would entreat Council to consider that I am not exactly in the same situation with other Officers concerned in the collection of the public Revenue---;with those the Monies come directly into their hands without any Risque---;with me they do not---;from the manner in which the Business of the vendue Office has been conducted, which I did not introduce, and have not been able to remedy, I am obliged to give Credit, not only for the State Duties, but for the value of the property disposed of, and to make advances of my own Monies to the proprietors and collect it again sometimes with great loss, always at a risque, and at a very heavy Expence. That the Reason of my being at present so far behind is the large outstanding Debts, which, with all the Industry that could be used, I have not been able to get in. That however, I do expect that on the Day a considerable part of the Ballance will be paid off. That the remedy the State has against me is a summary One, whereas against my Debtors, where obliged to bring Suits, I must wait all the Delays that legal forms allow, if they please to avail themselves of them; and in the present situation of Things, there are few that will not avail themselves of them, which does not put me upon an equal footing. That the consequence of a Suit will probably be ruin to me and my Family, which I flatter myself, indeed I am confident, it would give pain to Council to bring upon any Man where there was no Crime. I beg Council farther to consider that so far from being a lucrative Office, the City Vendue has never, since it has been in my Hands, maintained my Family, and that for some time past it actually has not paid the Expences. I persuade myself it was their Intention to confer a favour when they appointed me to the Office, and I have ever cherished the most grateful Sentiments; but at this Moment a rigorous Exertion of the Ballance I owe,would convert it into the most cruel Injury, involving, with the loss of Credit, the Destruction of a large Family, the principal part of whose provision has been swept away by the Expences that attended the Station I held in the prosecution of the Revolution, and the Depreciation of the Money. I entreat Council farther to consider that the State runs no risque of finally losing the Debt, because they have ample Security, for a much larger Sum---;but should any Doubt be entertained on that Head, I will deposit in the Hands of the Comptroler public Securities to a much greater amount. It is peculiarly unfortunate that at this time I am confined to this City, if I could be only a few Days at Philada. I have reason to believe I could accomplish the payment, at least do something towards it from my own Funds, which I certainly would tho' at a great loss, there is however a probability that I shall soon be able to go there. In the mean time some farther indulgence in point of time would be of infinite Service,(2) and I have to request Council that they will be pleased to give Directions to the   Comptroler accordingly which will be most gratefully acknowledged by, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Ar. St. Clair ""

 Sir, New York 20th March 1787. Your obliging letter of the 4th, instant I received by Capt. Tillinghast, who was six days on his way. Nothing particular has occurred since my second,(1) saving that Congress will very soon announce an Ordinance respecting the Treaty of peace with Great Britain, which will express the rights of the United States, & the nullity of all Legislative acts of particular or individual States that may immediately or consequentially tend to operate upon the positive Articles contained in that treaty.(2) \""That it is the law of the land,\"" supereminent &c. & therefore must be considered judicially, & enforced upon the ninth and thirteenth of the Articles of Confederation. As this Ordinance will be tendered to Great Britain as a full compliance, & in answer to her complaints of Fractions, the United States must enforce it practically, or loose the advantages of a declared sovereignty on the part of Great Britain. This is just, serious, important, necessary and inevitable. Consider then the dreadful ruin consequent upon a tender of paper for past Contracts, to those creditors at home, who are Debtors abroad, upon a compliance, without altering the emitting System! And should the Courts refuse, or the legislative Acts intervene, Reprisals upon the State refusing will be the Necessary consequences. I wrote, a few days since, to Mr. Manning,(3) more particulars than in my last letter to you, to him be pleased to be referred. Our want of representation is hazardous to the State. At present, I am able to manage matters well for her; but shall not continue long in my present situation. I am anxious to hear of the last proceedings of the General assembly---;Then I shall decide according to their policy. For I will not be here alone. My letters to the Governor were calculated to produce wise measures, but if they have not met with a proper return, my part is decided. For, I assure you, that I feel so perfectly inde[pe]ndent of them, that I will not persist in rendering goodoffices without a correspondent return. My expenditures are great, being connected with characters of enlarged minds, whose way of life is necessarily with the first. I will never therefore consider my resources, 'till they put me in mind of a departure from the place, not from my station. March 20, 1787  Probably you will not hear from me again 'till you may see me. Perhaps I should go southward from this. At all events I shall see you but for a short time. God bless you, your family and friends.

 Wednesday Mar. 21. [1787] The subject of yesterday Resumed. Mr. Yates was now satisfied with the Resolutions as they stood. The words, \""constitutionally made\"" as applied to the Treaty seemed to him on consideration to qualify sufficiently the doctrine on which the Resolution was founded.(1) The 1st Resolution declaring the Treaty to have the force of a law & denying the Right of any State to contravene it was agreed without dissent & almost without observation. The 2d & 3d Resolutions urging on the States a repeal of all laws contravening the Treaty, 1st. that they might not continue to operate, as violations of it. 2d. that questions might be avoided touching their validity---;underwent some criticisms & discussions.(2) Mr. Varnum & Mr. Mitchel thought they did not consist with the first which declared such laws to be void, in which case they cd. not operate as violations. Mr. [Madison](3) observed that a Repeal of those contravening laws was expedient & even necessary to free the Courts from the bias of their oaths which bound the Judges more strongly to the State than the federal authority. A distinction too he said might be started possibly between laws prior & laws subsequent to the Treaty: a Repealing effect of the Treaty on the former, not necessarily implying the nullity of the latter. Supposing the Treaty to have the validity of a law only, it would repeal all antecedent laws. To render succeeding laws void, it must have more than the mere authority of a law. In case these succeeding laws contrary to the Treaty should come into discussion before the Courts, it would be necessary to examine the foundation of the federal authority, and to determine whether it had the validity of a Constitution, paramount to the legislative authority in each State. This was a delicate question, and studiously to be avoided as it was notorious that although in some of the States the Confederation was incorporated with & had the sanction of their respectiveConstitutions, yet in others it recd. a legislative ratification only and rested on no other basis. He admitted however that the word operate might be changed for the better & proposed in its place, the words \""be regarded\"" as violations of the Treaty which was agreed to without objection. Mr. King in the course of the business observed that a question had been raised in N. York, <<how ever> whether stipulations as they might affect Citizens only---;and not foreigners could restrain the States  March 21, 1787  from legislating with respect to the former, and supposed that such stipulations could not. The Resolutions passed unanimously.(4) ""

Miss Wadsworth left town last week, which deprives me of the pleasure of receiving postage upon the one addressed to her---;a former letter enclosed one for Mr Cushman which was sent by the Charleston packet. I cannot flatter You with any hopes, for the final success of Your application to Congress.(2) Matters of Justice or generosity are not the subjects of deliberation. The question now is can the Government any longer exist? Where are the supplies by which it is to be supported? In this melancholy dilemma---;in so critical a situation, we have more reason to fear worse, than hope for better times. A reduction of the civil last [list] has been a long time on the carpet, & I think will take place previous to the commencement of the next Quarter. As far it respects me, I May lament the occasion, but I will endeavor so far to lessen my expences as not to be distressed by the defalcation.(3) I wish it was more the object of people in public or private stations, to find out the art of living frugally---;but so different are their wishes, that all are pursuing new pleasures and wrecking their brains to discover more methods for Amusement or dissipation. A majority of the States have appointed Delegates to meet in Convention at Philadelphia in May next. It is very probable that Congress will adjourn very soon for a few weeks, as many of the Members are elected---;but whether I shall enjoy the pleasure of a recess is uncertain. If a Committee of the States remain, it will be my business to attend, and will prevent me from making so early a visit as I should wish. Payments on the civil list have been very punctual since the peace---;but I feel a little anxious about the present Quota. which becomes due the first of April---;if it fails, we small ones, shall be compelled to taste the sweets of the Country from necessity---;and nomortification to me---;for the pleasures of the country are more to my liking, than those of a dissipated city.

 Friday Mar. 23d [1787]. The Report for reducing salaries agreed to as amended Unanimously.(1) The proposition for reducing the salary of the Secretary of F. Affairs to 3000 dollars was opposed by Mr. King & Mr. [Madison](2) who entered into the peculiar duties & qualifications required in that office, and its peculiar importance. Mr. Mitchel & Mr. Varnum contended that it stood on a level with the Secretaryship to Congress. The yeas & nays were called on the question, & it was lost. A motion was then made to reduce the Salary of 4000 dollrs. to 3500. Mr. Clarke who had been an opponent to any(3) reduction, acceded to this Compromise. Mr. King suffered his Colleague to vote in the affirmative. There being six States for reducing to 3500, and Mr. Carrington being on the same side in opposition to Mr. Grayson, Mr. M[adison] gave up his opinion to so great a majority, and the Resolution for 3500 passed. The preceding yeas & nays on the motion for reducing to 3000 was then withdrawn & no entry made of it. It seemed to be the general opinion that the Salary of the Secretary at war was disproportionately low, & ought to be raised.(4) The Committee would have reported an augmentation, But conceived themselves restrained by their commission wch. was to reduce not to revise the civil list.(5) ""

 Madam, Newyork 24th March 1787 I had the very great pleasure of writing to you, a very few days since,(1) (& which you will probably receive with this) in the terms of sensibility. Perhaps this sudden change of manner, may induce you to think, I am fickle. Do not think so. Whatever I then excluded from the subjects of my epistolary Ideas, could not include [any]thing connected with your interest. For, altho' dry politicks may not be consistent with the pleasures of imagination, yet the management of revenue and finance is necessary to that quiet and ease, which affords scope to the most charming fancy. ---;---;---; Sans cÃ¨rÃ¨monie, then. Mr. Charles Pinkney, who wishes to be mentioned to you with great respect, informed me, this day, that he had received a Bill of exchange from Mr. Edward Rutledge, drawn upon a house in this city in funds of Mr. Pinkney, for your use, & for the sum of five hundred and fourteen Pounds newyork currency. This Bill is accepted, payable in forty days. Mr. Pinkney has written to Colo. Wadsworth, giving him the information: But he tells me, that his instructions are to pay the contents to your appointee, and requested me to communicate the matter to you. Upon knowing this matter, I went to the first Character here in money matters, Major Platt, who is your friend. I now mention to you that the exchange between the paper of this state and real cash is three per Cent; That one per Cent would be demanded for discounting the Bill in paper to be paid in ten days from this date. Major Platt will, in a most friendly manner, pay the real cash in seventy five days from the time of the Bills being payable in paper, at par. Th[e terms] of nag[ocia]tion will benefit you more than two per Cent upon the plainest calculation. The Major says he will make some advances sooner, if necessary; Or lend his Credit, which is perfect Colo Wadsworth knows him. It will be necessary for you to appoint some person to receive the Amount of this bill from Mr. Pinkney. If you should not wait forColo Wadsworths particular advice, I recommend to you to direct an Order to Mr Pink[n]ey in favor of Mr. Ray[...]d, who is a young Gentleman in good credit here, sensible, honest and punctual. I will form the negociations influentially, tho' he will, I am certain, be happy in doing the remainder; but if you should prefer any other plan, I will lend my utmost aid to be of service to you. Remember this, that if you transfer the amount of this Bill to any person,  March 25, 1787  he must account with you for the whole sum in actual specie at a discount of no more than one and an half per cent---;for Platt will take all the risque upon himself. I repeat it, he would not do business in this way but to oblige you; as paper payments are slow here compared to specie payments, which are checked by the Bank. No doubt but the funds upon which this bill was drawn will account with Mr. Rutledge, & so with you, for the par of Exchange in the mode of payment, being in [pape]r, at three per cent, so that you may [gain?] instead of loosing upon the whole.  As I am now upon the topic of business, permit me to assure you that I have taken a most serious part in a matter which is much more interesting to you than the foregoing detail. Upon this head, I have conversed pretty fully with Colo. Wadsworth, & have written to him upon the subject. The Project we have agreed upon is very practicable; the only thing that grieves me is that it may not be ripe for execution, while I shall have it in my power in Congress, to convince you how much I am ever devoted to your happiness.

 My Dr. Friend, New York 25. March 1787 My opinion relative to our friend in the Treasury Board(1) was well founded, there is no probability of a vacancy there; & at present I see nothing sufficiently valueable to mention to you. Congress have it in contemplation, or more accurately speaking, many Gentlemen appear to be impressed with the propriety of a project to establish a board with very extensive powers finally to settle the accounts between the States. Should the States unite in this measure, the characters will necessarily be of the first rank, and consequence; and I am confident that you would be thought of, provided you could be obtained. Some Time since congress determined to erect a board; but as the powers did not exceed those wh. the late commissioners possessed, the plan has been objected to, and is now under consideration with a view of establishing something, which will be more decisive and expeditious.(2) I am persuaded that on this, and every other subject, in which you can have any interest, that you will not doubt the sincerity of my disposition to unite with your wishes, and to exert myself for their accomplishment. I therefore intreat you to suggest to me any Ideas which you may entertain on  March 25, 1787  this subject, at the same Time assuring you, that you can do it with all the confidence of the most inviolable Freindship. I yesterday eat Fish with Mr. Thompson together with Doctr. Johnson & Mr. Harrison; Col Hamilton was to have been with us, but something I presume of consequence detained him. Miss Helen did the honors of the Table with great propriety. We spent some hours after Dinner in examining the Bills & answers in Mr. Thompson's Chancery suits---;and on the whole, the Gentlemen seemed to unite in Opinion that the suits stand well in favor of the Complainants; several articles charged in the Bill for the recovery of Mr. Thompsons paternal fortune, although not very material, are completely answered by the other party---;but the most essential, and indeed the only important Charges of the Bill remain, in my Judgment, unsatisfactorily answered. I think each of the Gentlemen is with me, in this Opinion. There has been much Time already consumed and no decree; I think it is not improbable that considerable Time must yet elapse before final decree with safety be urged in the Bill for the paternal Fortune. Exception must be formed to some of the answers in order to draw out a more complete view than at present is exhibited. I was pleased with Mr. Harrison and he appears to me to understand and to be well disposed in the cause. You informed me some Time since of the unfortunate situation of Mr Dana---;pray tell me, is he in a way of a complete recovery? I think that misfortune is not only a severe private one, but a real and important cause of public concern. Will Mr Strong attend the convention, if Mr. Dana does not, who will be appointed in his place? How goes Electioneering?

 My dear Sir New York Mar. 25. 1787 I have had the pleasure of your two favors of the 1 & 7 instant.(1) The refusal of Mr. Henry to join in the task of revising the Confederation is ominous; and the more so I fear if he means to be governed by the event which you conjecture. There seems to be little hope at present of being able to quash the proceedings relative to the affair(2) which is so obnoxious to him; tho' on the other hand there is reason to believe that they will never reach the object at which they aimed. Congress have not changed the day for meeting at Philada. as you imagine. The Act of Va. I find has done so in substituting the 2d day for the 2d Monday in May, the time recommended from Annapolis.(3) I can not suppose that Mr. Otto has equivocated in his explanation to the public, touching the Floridas.(4) Nothing on that subject has been mentioned here as far as I know. Supposing the exchange in question to have really been intended I do not see the inference to be unfavorable to France. Her views as they occur to me would most probably be, to conciliate the Western people in common with the Atlantic States, and to extend her commerce, by reversing the Spanish policy. I have always wished to see the Misspi. in the hands of France or of any Nation which would be more liberally disposed than the present holders of it. Mr Jay's Report on the Treaty of peace has at length been decided on. It Resolves & declares that the Treaty having been constitutionally formed is the law of the land, and urges a repeal of all laws contravening it, as well to stop the complaints of their existing as legal impediments, as to avoid needless questions touching their validity.

I have had no small Share in this Measure having urged it in the strongest Manner upon the Eastern Members who were at first averse to it---;but Massachusetts having at last acceeded the others will follow. I cannot sit still & see a Dissolution of the Confederacy without making an Effort to save it from Anarchy & Ruin. How far the Measure in Question may prevent it I am not Prophet enough to say---;in it however we have some Chance---;but if we leave our Affairs to go to Pieces, silently acquiescing in the Consequences wh. must ensue it will in my Idea be criminal in the highest Degree. A Spirit of oeconomy prevails at present in Congress to so great a Degree that we have proceeded to a Reduction of the Civil List Expences & in the Course of the Business limited the Presidents Expences to 8,000 Dllrs per Annm., lowerd Jay to 3,500 from 4000; Thompson to 2,600 & reduced the Commissrs of the Treasury to 2000 each besides cutting down those of the other Departments (except the Secretary of War) & the numerous Train of Clerks &c &c.

It ought however to be observed, that these advances ought to be made in the manner directed by the Resolutions of Congress. Monies are appropriated for the support of the military Establishment of the united States; and the application of these Monies is the peculiar province of the Board of Treasury, who have the sole authority under Congress to contract for the Cloathing and subsistence of the federal Troops. We are wholly uninformed how the contributions of Massachusetts for the raising & subsisting of her Quota of these Troops have been conducted, and the board of Treasury inform us that they are alike destitute of information. Possibly the state may have advanced monies to, or entered into Engagements with, Col. Jackson on this subject. Such Advances, or Engagements, being unauthorised by the board of Treasury, may, for obvious reasons, hereafter prove the Source of Altercation & Embarrassment between the state & Congress.

When convenient for you I should be obliged to you for a short State of the Claims you mention, to property in this Place, for, tho' I know that they are considerable, I am very little accquainted with them, and if I had some Clue, I might while here, obtain some useful Information.

A Committee was appointed, in general  March 28, 1787  to consider the military: Establishment, and particularly to report a proper Resolution for stopping the enlistments.(2) The Virga. delegates laid before Congs.

 Thursday March 29 [1787]. The Committee appd. to confer with the Treasy. board on the great business of a final settlemt. of the accts. of the U. States, reported that they be discharged, and the Board instructed to report an ordinance. Mr. King in explanation sd. that it was the sense of the Committee and of the Treasy. board both, that Commissioners shd. be appointed with full & final powers to decide on the claims of the States agst. the Union &c. The Report was agreed to nem. contr.(1) Sundry papers from the Illinois complaining of the grievances of that Country, which had arrived by a special Express, were laid before Congs by the presidt. and committed.(2) Mr. Mitchell from Connecticut observed that the papers from Virga. communicated yesterday were of a very serious nature, and shewed that we were in danger of being precipitated into disputes with Spain which ought to be avoided if possible; & moved that those papers might be referred to the Committee on the Illinois papers, which was done without opposition; Mr. King only observing that they contained mere information, & did not in his view need any step to be taken on them.(3) The Virga. delegates communicated to Mr. Guardoqui the proceedings of the Executive relative to Clarke's seizure of Spanish property,(4) at which he expressed much regret, as a friend to the U.S. though as a Spanish Minister he had little(5) reason to dread(6) the tendency of such  March 29, 1787  outrages. The communication was followed by a free conversation on the Western Country & the Mississpi.(7) The observations of the delegates tended to impress him 1. with the unfriendly temper which would be produced in the western people both agst. Spain & the U.S. by a concerted occlusion of that river. 2. with the probabil[it]y of throwing them into the arms of G.B. 3. of accelerating the population of that Country after the example of Vermont. 4. the danger of such numbers under British influence as well to Spanish America as to the Atlantic States. 5 the universal opinion of right in the U.S. to free use of River. 6. the disappointment of the people of America at an attempt in Spain to make their condition worse as Citizens of an independent State in amity & lately engaged in a common cause, than as subjects of a formidable & unfriendly power. 7 the inefficacy of an attempt in Congs to fulfil a Treaty for shutting the Mississpi. & the folly of their entering into such stipulation. 8. that it would be wise in Spain to foresee & provide for events that could not be controlled, rather than to make fruitless efforts to prevent, or procrastinate them. Mr. G. reiterated his assertion that Spain would never accede to the claim of U.S. to navigate the river. 2. urged that the result of what was said was that Congs. could enter into no Treaty at all. 3. that the trade of Spain was of great importance & would certainly be shut agst. U.S.; affecting to disregard the remark that if Spain continued to use fish, flower &c. her interest would restrain her from shutting her ports agst the American Competition. 4. He signified that he had observed the weakness of the Union & foreseen its probable breach; that he lamented the danger of it as he wished to see it preserved & strengthened which was more than(8) France or any other Nation in Europe did. No reply was made to this remark. The sincerity of his declaration as to his own wishes was not free from suspicion. 5 Helaid much stress on the service Spain had Rendered the U.S. during the struggle for their independence, considering it as laying them under great obligations. The reality of the service was not denied, but he was reminded of the interest Spain had in dividing a power which had given the law to the House of Bourbon & compelled Spain to relinquish as he said the exclusive use of the Mississippi. 6 In answer to the remark that Spain was for putting the U.S. on a worse footing than they stood on as British subjects, he not only mentioned the necessity which dictated the Treaty of 1763, but contended that the recovery of W. Florida made a distinction in the case. It was observed to him that as the navigable channel of the Misspi. ran between the Island & the Western Shore, Spain had the same pretext from holding both shores, when Florida was a British Colony as since.(9) He would neither accede to the inference, nor deny the fact. 7. He intimated with a jocular air the possibility of the Western people becoming Spanish subjects; and with a serious one that such an idea had been brought forward to the King   of Spain by some person connected with the Western Country,(10) but that his Majesty's dignity & Character would never countenance it. It was replied that that consideration was no doubt a sufficient obstacle---;but it was presumed that such subjects would not be very convenient. It would be much more for the interest of Spain that they should be friendly neighbours, than refractory subjects. It did not appear that he viewed the matter in a different light. 8. He disclaimed his having ever assented to or approved of any limited occlusion of the Missipi---;tho' in a manner that did not speak a real inflexibility on that point. 9. It appeared clearly that the check to the Western settlements was a favorite object & that the occlusion of the Missippi. was considered as having that tendency. 10. The futility of many of his arguments & answers, satisfied the Delegates that they cd. not appear convincing to himself, and that he was of course pursuing rather the ideas of his Court than his own.

 Dear Sir,(1) New York March 30. 1787. I received yours of the 16th Ulto. Accept my sincere thanks and ac- March 30, 1787  knowledgements for your friendly disposition and frankness manifested in it. I should have noticed your favor sooner but a few days prior to my receipt of it I made to Mr. Prescot on the Subject you mention such and all the observations in my power to make before my return and in the present uncertain State of affairs. My friends who expect me to continue in public life I think are not well informed. I confess the warfare of the profession is not agreeable to my disposition---;nor are the Cabals and deceitful contentions of public life much more so---;nay I think the latter can be tolerable only on the idea that a man is in a great measure independent of them. It is and ever will be therefore my object to be in some degree independant in my private circumstances and never to Stand in need of public employments or public charity. Nor does it in my opinion require a great Estate to make one that independant man I mean in this Country. Had I a disposition to support myself and family by pursuing public business I should consider its total uncertainty the Caprice of those on whom it depends sufficient to render it improper to be calculated upon as the means in any degree of subsistence by a prudent man. A man of my age may yet see several revolutions in America and may even be banished alternately by parties. I believe the people of the United States in general to be as virtuous and as much attached to order and Good Government as any people whatever---;but there are in every class some profuse, turbulent, embarrassed and vile characters who will keep our Governments in perpetual commotions and danger till they shall be more Strengthened and confirmed. These characters in Massa., R. Island, Pennsyla., Maryland, the Western Country, &c &c, who under a daring leader might shake the foundations of our present governments, would under a firm efficient head or federal Government be only monuments of their own unimportance---;but I can say nothing new to you relative to public affairs---;thingshave I think for several months preserved their natural Course. All measures in the several states of importance---;all measures relative to the proposed Convention As that have taken place I have seen published in our Boston papers. The States have all determined to send members to it except R. Island & Connecticut the latter will probably send. This Convention by thinking men every where is considered as a bold and untried measure & nothing can be more variant than opinions respecting the result of it---;in some it produces sanguine expectations in others it most evidently produces an extreme depression of Spirits. They seem to feel themselves launched into the ocean, embarked on a hazardous and untried voyage and bound to an unknown Shore. No man that I have heard converse on the subject seems to have formed any definite ideas of what alterations the Convention will propose---;and much will certainly depend on the abilities, prudence and characters of the   men who shall meet in the Convention. There are many good men chosen to it and many very unsound and uncertain politicians. It is doubtful whether Gen. Washington will attend and Gov. Henry of Virginia has resigned---;but on the whole I think there is a good appointment of men if they all attend. The danger is in my mind that the best & most Judicious men will not attend. It is a work of immense magnitude to mend so complicated a machine of Government as our's is and to infuse into it sufficient energy---;it is in my mind a work adequate to the abilities of the most industrious and able politicians at least during thirty or forty years to come. I wish among others most ardently to see our governments rendered equal & free, firm & efficient in the Course of a few years but I cannot in moments of sober reflection form an idea that we shall nay fortune must be propitious too. Our object is a wise government in which freedom & protection, Strength and energy are united or a government in which there shall be a kind of balance of power of the different classes of men in which the laws shall be made by the people's representatives & executed independant of the popular opinions in which persons and property shall be punctually protected and secured to at a moderate expence. How many nations have Struggled for ages and failed in obtaining these great objects one nation excepted. Can we name another on earth that ever has according to our ideas fully obtained them---;but don't suppose dear Sir I despond, I only urge the propriety of patience, attention and Steady perseverance in the political voyage. These will make a people every thing that is g[...]t who have had an early and excellent education. If like the wise navigator we plan generally the intended voyage and mark the situation of the proposed port and like the prudent & experienced sailors watch the motions of the ship, the wind and waves & casual events and not forget to observe like them Steddy boys when green hands run intoextremes we shall do well enough. To detail on these subjects is a work of years and constant attention---; to make only one concise observation on this subject---;it appears to me the wise man after he has drawn the out lines of his political edifice & put govermt. in motion he will constantly watch events and everyone & then something will turn up if improved to induce the people to give it strength & compleat the machine. With regard to Massa. we do not hear so much about elections as we expected we should. It is said there is a coalition lately formed between A---; & H---;(2) and that exertions are made to put H---;---; into the chair. I need not repeat my sentiments on these subjects to you---; most men here seem to possess a just idea that to leave out B---;---;(3) who is considered now as intimately connected with the Governmental Cause would have the appearance of a disapprobation of it in the people. That his conduct has been on the whole wise and firm---;&c. I men  tioned to you in my last that I had received the contents of your bill of Ludlow and Goold & held them subject to Your orders.

 Friday Mar. 30th [1787]. Mr. Jay's report in favor of the admission of P. Bond as British Consul for the middle States, was called for by Mr. Cadwallader.(1) Mr. [Madison](2) said he was far from being satisfied of the propriety of the measure: he was a friend in general to a liberal policy & admitted that the U.S. were more in the wrong in the violation of the Treaty of Peace than G.B. But still the latter was not blameless. He thought however the question turned on different considerations. 1. The facility of the U.S. in granting privileges to G.B. without a Treaty of Commerce, instead of begetting a disposition to conclude such a Treaty had been found on trial to be made a reason agst. it. 2. The indignity of G.B. in neglecting to send a public minister to the U.S. notwithstanding the lapse of time since Mr. Adams's arrival there, gave them no titles to favors in that line; and self-respect seemed to require that the U.S. should at least proceed with distrust & reserve. Mr. Grayson, thought as the Secretary had done that it would be good policy to admit Mr. Bond, and that it could not be decently & without offence, refused after the admission of Mr. Temple.(3) Mr Clarke said he was at first puzzled how to vote, as he did not like the admission proposed on one hand, and on the other thought it not decent to refuse it after the admission of Mr. Temple. On reflecting however that Mr. Temple was admitted at a time when hopes were entertained of a Commercial Treaty which had since vanished---;& that the question might be postponed generally without being negatived, he should accede to the idea of doing nothing on the subject. Mr. Varnum animadverted on the obnoxious character of Mr. Bond, and conceived that alone a sufficient reason for not admitting him. The postponement was agreed to without any overt dissent except that of Mr. Grayson.(4) March 30, 1787  The delegates from N. Carolina communicated to Congress sundry papers Conspiring with the other proofs of discontent in the Western Country at the supposed surrender of the Misspi---;and of hostile machinations agst. the Spaniards.(5) It was orderd that they should be referred to the Secry. of Foreign Affairs(6) for his information. It was then moved that the papers relative to the same subjects from Virga., yesterday referred to a Committee should, after discharging the Committee be referred to the Office of Foreign Affrs. Mr. Clarke proposed, to add \""to report.\"" This was objected to by Mr. King, and brought on some general observations on the proceedings of Congs. in the Affair of the Mississippi. It was at length agreed that the reference sd. be made without an instruction to report.(7) Mr. Pierce then observed that it had been hinted by Mr. M[adison] as proper to instruct the Secy. of F. A. to lay before Congs. the State of his negociation with Mr. Guardoqui, and made a motion to that effect which was seconded by several at once. Mr. King hoped Congs. would not be hurried into a decision on that point, observing that it was a very delicate one---;that he did not altogether like it---;and yet it was of such a nature that it might appear strange to negative it. He desired that it might at least lie over till Monday. Mr. M[adison] concurred in wishing the same, being persuaded, that the propriety of the motion was so clear, that nothing could produce dissent, unless it were forcing members into an unwilling decision. The Motion was withdrawn, with notice that it would be renewed on Monday next.(8) ""

 Sir, New York April 2d. 1787 I do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellencies favor of the 15th Ult. to the Delegation.(1) Any additional information which may be acquired upon the subject of Mr. Van Berkels Memorial will be punctually transmitted.(2) I lament exceedingly the Situation into which our Trade is thrown under the late Laws---;it will occasion a deminution of the Revenue which we are in no condition to bear. This circumstance evinces the impossibility of Managing the Trade of America by State arrangements, and necessity of vesting the fOEderal Head, with full Authority over that, and every Interest of the like general nature. Until this is the case, State schemes will be pursued with surreptitious views against each other, which must eventually destroy a source of Revenue that might be immensely valuable to the whole Union; and every effort prohibitory of foreign Articles will also be vain. The Resolutions upon the proposed Convention between the States of Virginia, Maryland and Pensylvania, have been laid before Congress, and referred to a Committee, who have reported favourably; The proposition is, however, viewed with a Coolness which will retard the decision, nor can I venture an opinion as to the issue.(3) Congress last week had under consideration the civil list establishment and made some considerable reductions therein; inclosed your Excellency will receive the resolutions upon that subject.(4) This measure in some instances resulted rather from necessity than choice. The House of Assembly of New York have passed an Act to Authorise the delegates of that State in Congress, to accede to, ratify and confirm the Independence and Sovereignty of Vermont, and it is understood that it will pass the Senate and Council of revision. The enclosed papers contain the principles and arguments upon which the measure is founded.(5) As soon as the Act is Compleat it shall be transmitted. It is suggested that there may arise a difficulty upon the point of aparticipation in the public burthens, heretofore incurred. By some late acts of Rhode Island it appears that the current of Madness in that state has not yet compleated its course.(6) The Assembly have decided by a Majority of upwards of twenty, not to send Deputies to the Convention---;and, by the same majority, they have declined to aid the State of Massachusetts in apprehending the Insurgents who have taken refuge amongst them. The Board of Treasury still decline sending the Indents---;this conduct is founded upon the information of the loan Officer that the funds for complying with the requisition are inadequate.(7) The Act of Congress makes the Indents issuable upon condition that adequate  April 2, 1787  funds shall first have been provided, and the Board alledge, that having no data on which to found an opinion of their own, they are obliged to conform to that of the Loan Officer. Perhaps upon an interview between the Executive and the loan Officer this difficulty might be removed. The Indents now to be issued would not, I beleive, be receivable in the Tax now collecting, but that of 1787 will be coming on, and it is of some consequence that the people should have it in their power to get the Indents in time for it. The Treaty with Sweden is enclosed.(8) I have the Honor to be, with due respect, Your Excellencies Most Obedt. Servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 My dear Sir N. York April 2d. 1787 I have your favor of the 15th inst.(1) All of preceding date have been already acknowledged. The information which you wished to go to Mr. Guardoqui has been communicated.(2) The real impression made by it cannot easily be seen thro' the political veil. If he views the state of Western affairs in the true light, his representations to Spain, must convince her that she has no option but between concession and hostilities. It is to be lamented that so many circumstances have concurred to enlist her pride on the side of the latter alternative. The papers accompanying the advice of the Council as to Clarke have been laid before Congs. Similar communications have also been made from N. Carolina.(3) The impression they have made is not unfriendly I conjecture to the Rights of Western peoples and it is probable that a rediscussion of these may be produced by the occasion. Our strength however is unequal to any effectual vote. A Reinforcement from either Maryland or S. Carolina would I believe supply the defect; Pennsylvania having lately appointed Armstrong in the place of Pettit which throws that State into the right Scale. We have some hopes also as to Rh. Island. She begins to see the policy of some States in her neighbourhood, in excluding the federal territory from the Market at which they offer their own. N. Jersey has entered fully into this view of the matter, and feels no small indignation at it. Rhode Island has negatived a motion for appointing deputies to the Convention by a majority of 22 votes. Nothing can exceed the wickedness and folly which continue to reign there. All sense of Character as well as of Right is obliterated. Paper money is still their idol, though it is debased to 8 for 1.

 Sir,(1) Newyork 2d April 1787. I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 19th March last, but am very unhappy to be informed of your ill state of health. As you are  April 2, 1787  upon the recovery however, let me persuade you, that, when you mention \""that your mind has been affected,\"" you was a little tipp'd. And this I can easily account for, when the assiduities of a tender mother, and the anxieties of an affectionate wife are considered as stimilating to a vigorous habit, beyond the power, perhaps, of your constitution, tho' within the compass of your wishes. Even at this distance, and in perfect health, when I revolve the charming moments which have, in the most pleasing variety of succession, bound me to the felicities of domestic enjoyment, my delirium of rapture enslaves the senses; and surely then, the mind is disordered. But, as the torments of absence may be subdued by approaching to the object of our desires, so the debilities arising from too constant an attention, may require a centrifugal motion. Both of us then, being erratic, from causes so obvious, you must submit to the projectile force, and I must wish for a concentration. Your cure, my dear friend, is probably within your immediate reach, mine is destined to be postponed for the space of about two months, and (oh! bitter reflection) in the mean time, it may become inveterate.

There are existing Resolutions in favor of Brigadier General Howe 15th April 1777, Moultrie the 13th May 1779, and the 8th May 1781 To the Commanding General at West point for the time being.(1) I have reason to think General McIntosh has been settled with in the State of Georgia, which will of course be charged to the United States, but of this I am not certain. Claims of sundry inferior Officers in similar cases have also been allowed.  Permit me to assure your Excellency and the honorable members, that I would not give you this trouble, if I did not consider my claim founded in strict Justice, and sanctioned by precidents---;as I conceive in every other instance no Officer that I know of who Commanded in seperate departments, but what have been settled with. If therefore Congress view my claim in the same light, I hope they will be pleased to order their Commissioner to settle with me on the same principle he has in all other cases been directed to settle with Officers of the same rank when Commanding in seperate departments.(2) I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Your Excellencys Most Obedient Humble Servant, Wm.

 Sir, Newyork 4th April 1787. Agreably to your Excellency's request, I delivered to Mr. Hazard, the post master general, your note, and informed him of everything in my power relative to the subject matter to which it related. Mr. Richardson wrote to him by the same post that brought your letter, complaining bitterly of the conduct of the General assembly in not paying up the arrearages due upon the postage of public letters.(1) Mr. Hazard gave me no other satisfaction, than that he would write properly upon the matter, highly blaming the insults. The General assembly have suffered, in the opinion of many, for refusing the appointment of delegates to meet in Convention at Philadelphia.(2) Perhaps they will reconsider that matter in May, when an appointment will be in time. But one measure of Congress has taken place since I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, that may be deemed important. That respects the interference of the respective legislatures in obstructing the operations of the treaty with Great Britain, this business is not fully detailed; as soon as it is compleated, we will have the pleasure of communicating it.(3) I say we, because Mr. Arnold has joined me. In general, it denies the power of the individual states to vary, in any measure, the conclusive acts of the United States in Congress in matters confided to them by the Articles of Confederation; And therefore, deems all acts void that bear such a complexion. A very serious and important subject will be taken up in a few days respecting the western territory & the navigation of the Missippi; at present, every thing essentially relating to that business is upon the secret Journals.(4) A reduction of the Corps w[ill] also take place, in which Rhode Island will be excused from raising any troops. There is no necessity of sending forward the proof of payment upon the oxx team Certificates, or upon the pension establishment. Mr. Ellery's office is the place where proof is to be made of the payment of the specie part of therequisition of 27th Septr. 1785; and when that is done, he will issue the remaining indents. The payments to Mr  April 4, 1787  Clarke, and not credited in the Treasury books, are of two kinds principally. Interest upon public Securities of the United States, & endorsed. Certificates of the payments are necessary. The other is in the old continental Bills. The only way to obtain a credit for these, is to send forward to the Treasury the State's quota to be burnt.

 My dear friend N. York April 8th. 1787. Your two favors of the 22d & 27th of March have been received since my last. In a former one you ask what Tribunal is to take cognizance of Clarke's offence?(1) If our own laws will not reach it, I see no possibility of punishing it. But will it not come within the Act of the last Session concerning treasons and other offences committed without the Commonwealth.(2) I have had no opportunity yet of consulting Mr. Otto on the allegation of Oster(3) touching the marriage of French subjects in America. What is the conspicuous prosecution which you suspect will shortly display a notable instance of perjury? I am glad to find that you are turning your thoughts towards the business of May next. My despair of your finding the necessary leisure as signified in one of your letters, with the probability that some leading propositions at least would be expected from Virga. had engaged me in a closer attention to the subject than I should otherwise have given. I will just hint(4) the ideas which have occurred, leaving explanations for our inteview. I think with you that it will be well to retain as much as possible of the old Confederation, tho' I doubt whether it may not be best to work the valuable articles into the new System, instead of engrafting the latter on the former. I am also perfectly of your opinion that in framing a system, no material sacrifices ought to be made to local or temporary prejudices. An explanatory address must of necessity accompany the result of the Convention on the main object. I am not sure that it will be practicable to present the several parts of the reform in so detached a manner to the States as that a partial adoption will be binding. Particular States may view the different articles as conditions of each other, and would only ratify them as such. Others might ratify them as independent propositions. The consequence would be that the ratifications of both would go for nothing. I have not however examined this point thoroughly. Intruth my ideas of a reform strike so deeply at the old Confederation, and lead to such a systematic change, that they scarcely admit of the expedient. I hold it for a fundamental point that an individual independence of the States is utterly irreconcileable with the idea of an aggregate sovereignty. I think at the same time that a consolidation of the States into one simple republic is not less unattainable than it would be inexpedient. Let it be tried then whether any middle ground can be taken which will at once support a due supremacy of the national authority, and leave in force the local authorities so far as they can be subordinately useful. April 8, 1787  The first step to be taken is I think a change in the principle of representation. According to the present form of the Union, an equality of suffrage if not just towards the larger members of it, is at least safe to them, as the liberty they exercise of rejecting or executing the acts of Congress, is uncontroulable by the nominal sovereignty of Congress. Under a system which would operate without the intervention of the States, the case would be materially altered. A vote from Delaware would have the same effect as one from Massts. or Virga. Let the national Government be armed with a positive & compleat authority in all cases where uniform measures are necessary. As in trade &c. &c. Let it also retain the powers which it now possesses. Let it have a negative in all cases whatsoever on the Legislative Acts of the States as the K. of G. B. heretofore had. This I conceive to be essential and the least possible abridgement of the State Soveriegnties. Without such a defensive power, every positive power that can be given on paper will be unavailing. It will also give internal stability to the States. There has been no moment since the peace at which the federal assent wd have been given to paper money &c. &c. Let this national supremacy be extended also to the Judiciary departmt. If the judges in the last resort depend on the States & are bound by their oaths to them and not to the Union, the intention of the law and the interests of the nation may be defeated by the obsequiousness of the Tribunals to the policy or prejudices of the States. It seems at least essential that an appeal should lie to some national tribunals in all cases which concern foreigners, or inhabitants of other States. The admiralty jurisdiction may be fully submitted to the national Government. The supremacy of the whole in the Executive department seems liable to some difficulty. Perhaps an extension of it to the case of the Militia may be necessary & sufficient.  A Government formedof such extensive powers ought to be well organized. The Legislative department may be divided into two branches: One of them to be chosen every years by the Legislatures or the people at large; the other to consist of a more select number, holding their appointments for a longer term and going out in rotation. Perhaps the negative on the State laws may be most conveniently lodged in this branch. A Council of Revision may be superadded, including the great ministerial officers. A National Executive will also be necessary. I have scarcly ventured to form my own opinion yet either of the manner in which it ought to be constituted or of the authorities with which it ought [to be] cloathed. An article ought to be inserted expressly guarantying the tranquility of the States agst. internal as well as external dangers.  To give the new system its proper energy it will be desirable to have it ratified by the authority of the people, and not merely by that of the Legislatures. I am afraid you will think this project, if not extravagant, absolutely unattainable and unworthy of being attempted. Conceiving it myself to go no farther than is essential, The objections drawn from this source are to be laid aside. I flatter myself however that they may be less formidable on trial than in contemplation. The change in the principle of representation will be relished by a majority of the States, and those too of most influence. The Northern States will be reconciled to it by the actual superiority of their populousness: the Southern by their expected superiority in this point. This principle established, the repugnance of the large States to part with power will in a great degree subside, and the smaller States must ultimately yield to the predominant Will. It is also already seen by many & must by degrees be seen by all that unless the Union be organized efficiently & on Republican Principles, innovations of a much more objectionable form may be obtruded, or in the most favorable event, the partition of the Empire into rival & hostile confederacies, will ensue.

 My Dr. Sir (confidential) N York 11 Apl. 1787 I informed you some Time since that the injurious Influence of 1783 would be again experienced by the present Congress. It appears to me most evidently that every State south of this is decidedly under this Influence. Rhode Island at present represented by Genl. Varnum & a Mr. Arnold will desert that wise policy which has been so often and so successfully opposed to political Vice & Degeneracy, and will unite in measures foreign to the true Interest of the Union, & nearly allied to corruption. A question was yesterday moved to adjourn Congress on the last Friday of this Month to meet at Philadelphia on the first Monday in June(1) ---;six States south of this are represented. I moved to strike out the place of meeting and called the Yeas and nays on the words standing; to my astonishment Rhode Island voted that they shd. stand, and the six States south of this joined in the vote of Rhode Island. From this vote it was clear that there were seven States in favor of adjourning to Philadelphia. We postponed the Question in right of Massachusetts until this Day,(2) and successfully employed the interim in detaching for the present one of the R. Island Delegates from his Vote of Yesterday. The Subject was therefore farther postponed by order of the house; I fear Rhode Island will yet vote for this pernicious measure, or that on the arrival of Maryland it will be carried. We have a public Letter from Mr. Adams soliciting leave to come home;(3) I think he will return in the Spring of 1788 when his commission will expire.

 My Dear Son, New York April 12th. 1787. You have been very good in writing to us so frequently for which we  April 12, 1787  are extremely obliged to you, tho' we have been very unfortunate in not having yr. Letters arrive so speedily as we wish'd. That of Jany. came first, but not till late in Feby. & those of Decr. did not reach us till March. The last indeed Dated in March, had a pretty speedy passage.(1) We have been equally unfortunate in not having had Opportunities to write to you. Unluckily, we never once heard of young Mr. Stewarts being in Town till he must have arriv'd amongst you, & since that there has been no Conveyance that we could find till the present. Blessed be God that tho' late we learn'd that tho' you had a disagreeable Passage you enjoy'd good health, the first of all temporal blessings, & was as prosperous in your affairs as you could expect. By the favour of the same good providence we also have been very well except slight Indispositions. I, in particular, have had some Attacks of the Gout, but upon the whole they have been but moderate, & have never confined me for any time. Our Winter commenced very soon after you left us, was severe, especially the forepart of it, & has been long & disagreeable, but now Spring opens upon us pretty promisingly. Nothing very material has occur'd to us. Your Brother was admitted to the Bar in Janry (tho' not of full age) with applause, & I hear begins to appear to good advantage before the Justices, arbitrators &c. But alas! the Law they say is failing fast in Connecticut. They had but 25 new Actions at New Haven in Janry. last. In Massachusetts it is ruin'd by their Commotions, in Rhode Island & N. Hampshire by their Paper Money & Poverty, so that their ablest & oldest Lawyers cannot procure a support by their Profession. There they have receiv'd a severe blow in the present session of their Legislature, which has struck off many of their Emoluments. I shall not therefore send you their last Table of Fees but that of 1786 which is that I presume you desired. In general, throughout our States, in proportion as ourGovernments relax, & we grow licentious & embarrass'd in our affairs (which by the way seems everywhere encreasing) a Clamour is excited against the Lawyers & attempts are made to diminish their profits & injure the Profession. How this is to end I know not. We are to have a Convention of Delegates from the States at Philadelphia in May to endeavour to strengthen our federal Government & restore our affairs. To this Measure all the States have acceded except Rhode Island, which has refused to send Delegates, & Connecticut which has not yet had the subject before them, nor can till the Assembly meets next Month. But whether they will be able to put us upon a better footing, appears to me very problimatical at present, & if they do not, our disorders & difficulties will for some time at least rapidly encrease. These prospects afford you but little encouragement at present to return to us. Yet I see both by your & Mr. Stewarts Letters, what you will remember struck me early & which I objected to the first proposal of your going there with a view to practice, that from the smallness of the Island &c your Field is too confined. I have flatter'd myself especially   since Mr. Stewart was appointed there that the Field would be enlarg'd by opening the Port to America, which would no doubt be beneficial to Britain as well as to the Island. I am not willing yet to despair of it, but if it is not done, & upon some further trial you find it will not do there you must return to us bad as our prospects here may be. Your being so much cut off from your Connections will be a powerful Motive to all of us to induce it, perhaps more powerful than perfect prudence would justifie. Let us then wait a while in attentive observation to discover what Providence may seem to point out to us, & in the mean time continue to communicate as you have done, the remarks that occur upon circumstances there, all which I will consider as well as I can & accordingly advise you.  Mr. Stewart I see has proved himself the good Friend I tho't he would, I cannot therefore, but regret extremely that you are so soon obliged to part with him, & fear that he may not speedily return again to you. Let us however hope the best. Mr. Van Dam too another valuable Friend I see is not reconciled to his situation there. The Legislature of this State are about repealing, if they have not already done it, that part of their Trespass Act which prohibited the production of any Military Order in Justification of Acts done during the War, so that if he has one, he may now plead it in Bar of the Demands made upon him & return in safety to N York. At any rate, he would be perfectly safe either in Jersey or Connecticut, if the critical situation of our public afairs dos not discourage him from settling again amongst us. I hoped to have sent you some Corn by this Opportunity, but the Captain says he has no room for it, so that I fear I shall have nothing to send you unless it be a great Number of News Papers, which I wish might afford you some amusement since I can give you at present nothing else. Yr.

Mention to us whatever you need, & be assured we shall with pleasure do all in our Power to supply your wants. You say nothing of Money matters, you will draw on me if you have occasion. The Letters you enclosed me were immediately forwarded. I have Letters of Tuesday last from Stratford acquainting me that they were all well, & that Mamma intended making a Visit here very soon. Charles has been to Middletown to look after your affairs there, but I fear I shall have no accounts from him to forward you by this conveyance.(2) I send you in the Box with the News Papers, Atkyns's Reports which I just now met with, the N York Fee Act, Some green Silk from Betsey & Gain's Register which Majr. Alden sends you, & begs you will excuse his not writing by this conveyance, as by Mr. Thompsons Illness, he is incessantly engaged in the business of the office. I  April 13, 1787  enclose you a Report from our Secrety of Foreign affairs which Congress have just now adopted, & which I trust will do us some Honour. Your Dear Mamma writes me she has a Box of Provisions to send you, but they probably cannot arrive so as to go by this Vessel.

I now do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 22d Ult.(1) The Act of the Executive upon the subject of the Illinois Accounts, was laid before Congress, together with some communications from Mr. Fox to the Board of Treasury, requesting an Augmentation of his pay, and signifying his intention to decline any further attendance in case of refusal, whereupon the inclosed resolutions were adopted for sending the Commissioner of Army Accounts  April 13, 1787  upon that business. Mr. Pierce has served for many years as Paymaster General & Commissioner of Army Accounts, and is distinguished for his abilities and integrity.(2) The reduced State of our Treasury has rendered it advisable to discharge all the Troops that have been enlisted under the Resolutions of the 20th of October 1786, except two companies of Artillery, to be formed out of those raised in Massachusetts. These are to be stationed, at present, at Springfield and West point. This is a disgusting measure to the disbanded Troops, and it was distressing to Congress to adopt it, but had they been retained the event must have been met at last under accumulated inconveniencies and embarrassments to both parties.

Franks the bearer of the public dispatches from Paris, informs that before the sailing of the Packet, accounts were received at Havre, of the death of the Count Vergennes---;our letters from Mr Jefferson mention his indisposition, and that it occasioned great anxiety.(3) His Most Christian Majesty has adopted the measure of a general convention upon the national concerns---;the meeting of the notables was to have been on the 29th of January, but was put off to the 7th or 8th of February. This is an important event from which, it is said, some expect great things, others nothing. Our Friend the Marquis de la Fayette was originally placed on the list, afterwards his name disappeared, but was finally reinstated. It seems his education in the American School draws on him the jealous Eye of some whose principles are more assimalated to their own despotic government; He has, however, the favourable disposition of the King and the good will of the people. He is the Youngest Man upon the list of Notables except one, whose Office placed him there. This is a distinction noless honourable and flattering to us than him. Mr. Jefferson Observes that the Tumults in America have not produced those unfavourable effects upon the public opinion in Europe, which might have been expected. On the contrary the small effect they had, and the interposition of the people on the side of government, have given an additional confidence in the firmness of our Governments. The inclosed papers contain a Speech of a Mr. Harrison against the Vermont Bill, or rather in behalf of non residents who held lands there, and one of Colo. Hamiltons in answer thereto.(4) I have the Honor to be, with great respect & esteem, Your Excellencies Most Obt. Servt., Ed. Carrington  [P.S.] Mr. Jeffersons public letters have not yet been laid before Congress---;they are accompanied by some papers which are in French, and these are translating.

 Dear Sir New York, April 14th. 1787. I received your Letter by our mutual Friend Colo. Carrington. I wish I could return you thanks in person for your civil congratulations on my appointment to Congress. Why should fate so order things as to direct your views last Summer this way,(1) and not to permit you to come to New York this Summer? It would make me very happy to take you once more by the hand before we go hence, and be no more seen. Better than five years have passed away since I have had the honor of looking on that pleasant and good-humoured face of yours.(2) I wish much to know if time has made any furrows in it, or whether age has placed a gloom on that brow, which used to be the seat of mirth. Surrounded by a numerous Family, I can easily conceive of your additional importance, and approve it, but I never can give my cons[ent] that time or circumstances shall interupt [...] good-humour or happiness. Be then what [may] ever have been, the comfort of your Family, the pride of your Friends, and the Supporter of your own felicity. I promise you that when you shall have gone your round, and death shall lay his leaden hands upon you, I will engrave in lasting characters on your Tomb, that, which was never applied but to the greatest Man that ever lived, \""Hic cinis ubique fama.\""(3) The season being near at hand for the meeting of the Convention little else is talked of in this quarter but the changes that will likely take place in our federal Government. It is certain that the confederation is very incompleat, and deficient in point of energy, but I fear we shall meet with great difficulties in amending it. The different States will not make such a surrender of their sovereignty as may be found necessary to give the federal head compleat weight in the Union. Nothing will produce such a surrender but a sense of the greatest danger. But for the present I shall forbear to say any thing farther about it. Congress have recommended to the several States to repeal all Laws that are in contraventionof the treaty. In a little time your Executive will have the circular Letter together with the resolutions on that subject.(4) I hope the different States will see the propriety of this measure. National honor and public faith demanded it of Ci[vil] and private justice, and federal prop[riety] ought to induce the different States to g[rant] it. April 14, 1787  To-morrow Evening will be exhibited at the Theatre here a new American Comedy called the Contrast, written by a Majr. Tyler a young Gentleman from Boston.(5) The curiosity of the whole City is awakened on the occasion, and parties are already forming to damn or to support the play. I think it will be received with eclat, as I have had an opportunity of hearing it read. The unities are well observed, the dialogue easy, and the incidents flow rapidly and connectedly together. There is a great deal of humour in it, and the whole is marked with a novelty and originality that strike very forcibly. The Major finished this play in Six Days. It is divided int[o] five Acts, and is as long as the West Ind[ies]. If Shakespear is so much to be applau[ded] for writing the Merry-wives of Windsor in six Weeks, how much more ought our young American Writer to be admired for writing the Contrast in six Days? Please to offer my best respects to your Lady in which Mrs. Pierce joins me, and believe me to be, Dr. Sir, Your Friend & humble servt,  Wm. Pierce. ""

 My dear friend N. York April 15. 1787 Your favor of Apl. 4(1) has been recd since my last. The probability of Genl. Washington's coming to Philada. is in one point of view, flattering. Would it not however be well for him to postpone his actual attendance untill some judgment can be formed of the result of the meeting. It ought not to be wished by any of his friends that he should participate in any abortive undertaking. It may occur perhaps that the delay would deprive the Convention of his presiding auspices and subject him on his arrival to a less conspicuous point of view than he ought on all occasions to stand in. Agst. this difficulty must be  April 15, 1787  weighed the consideration above mentioned, to which may be added the opportunity which Penna. by the appt. of Docr. Franklin has afforded of putting sufficient dignity into the Chair. The effect of the interposition of Congs. in favor of the Treaty at this crisis was foreseen by us.(2) I would myself have preferred a little procrastination on the subject. But the manifest and undeniable propriety of the thing itself, with the chance that the Legislature here which will adjourn in a little time untill next winter, & which is one of the principal transgressors, may set an immediate example of reformation, overruled the arguments for delay.(3) The difficulties which as you suggest may be left behind by a mere repeal of all existing impediments, will be probably found of a very serious nature to British Creditors. If no other advantage should be taken of them by the State, than the making the assent of the Creditors to the plan of instalments, a condition of such further provisions as may not come within the Treaty. I do not know that the existence of these difficulties ought to be matter of regret. In every view Congs. seem to have taken the most proper course for maintaining the national character, and if any deviations in particular States should be required by peculiar circumstances, it will be better that they should be chargeable on such States, than on the U. States.  The Maryd. Assembly met on the 2d inst. being convened by proclamation. The expected delay therefore in her appointments for the Convention, can not be admitted among the considerations which are to decide the time of your setting out. I am sorry that punctuality on your part will oblige you to travel without the company of Mrs. Randolph. But the sacrifice seems to be the more necessary as Virga. ought not only to be on the ground in due time, but to be prepared with some materials for the work of the Convention. In this view I could wish that you might be able to reach Philada. some days before the 2d Monday in May.This City has been thrown into no small agitation by a motion made a few days ago for a short adjournment of Congs. and the appointment of Philada. as the place for its reassembly. No final question was taken but some preliminary questions showed that six States were in favor of it. R. Island the 7th State was at first in the affirmative, but one of its delegates was overcome by the exertions made to convert him.(4) As neither Maryland nor S. Carolina were present the vote is strong evidence of the precarious tenure by which N. York enjoys her metropolitan advantages. The motives which led to this attempt were probably with some of a local nature. With others they were certainly of a general nature. I found on my arrival here among the Southern Gentlemen a heavy complaint of the preponderance given to the Eastern Scale by the very excentric position of Congs. and a determina-  tion to seize the first moment for taking a position in which the equilibrium would be less violated. The indignation of N. Jersey & of R. Island agst. N. York, presented this moment, & the experiment was accordingly made. It can not be denied that very substantial inconveniences arise to the Southern States from their remoteness from the seat of Government, both with respect to the attendance of their delegates and the various intercourse of business within the federal administration, and that from the nature of things, the interests and views of the States nearest to Congs. will always press more on their attention, than those of more distant. Had Congs. been sitting last fall at Fort Pitt, it is morally certain in my opinion that a surrender of the Mississpi. wd. not have had two votes: to these considerations may be added the improbability that the Eastern States will ever consent to remove Congs. to a proper permanent seat whilst they can retain them here. But notwithstanding this view of the matter, the objections agst. the suddenness of the measure & the peculiarity of the present crisis, appeared to me in so strong a light that I should certainly have voted agst. it, had the probability been less that by waiting for a proper time, the proper measure might be lost altogether. The plan which appeared least objectionable to me was, to fix Philada. for the meeting of the ensuing Congs. in Novr. next, and if the immediate removal had been carried, I meant to have proposed such an alteration which would have been readily agreed to by the opposite side. Mr. {Jay}(5) was a few days ago {instructed to communicate to Congress} the {state} of the {Spanish negociation}.(6) An {unwilling but silent assent} was given by {Massachusetts} and {Connecticut}. The {report shews} that {Jay viewed} the {act of seven states as valid} & has {even adjusted} with {Guardoqui} an {article} for {suspending our use} of the {Mississippi during} the {term of} the {Treaty}.

 Dr Sir. N. York Apl. 16 1787. It is not for want of attention or respect that I have so long declined writing to you: my silence has been owing to a very different cause. I have understood that every letter which goes from this country to France is opened at some of the Post Offices for the information of Government. A few hours sinc[e] I understood that Mr. Paine was to go in the French packett, in the morning so that I am much harried. I am sorry to inform you that American affairs in general wear the worst aspect you can possibly concieve. The people discontented, The public treasury without money, <<and laws in several of the States but faintly executed> and the states either refusing or not complying with the requisitions of Congress. Jersy last year rejected the requisition: & Connecticut this. Only Virginia, N. York & Pensylvany. pay any thing towds. the support of Governmt. through their means the Dutch Interest & Civil list of the U. States have been paid since I have been in Congress: The rest of the Union appear to be in a <<stupid> insensible languor as to money supplies. The much talked of 5 Per Ct Impost has been rejected by N. York: & if she had passed it it would have availed little as Pensylvany has coupled it with the supplementary funds, & will I believe never separate the one from the other. Congress annually vote requisitions for the foreign & domestic interest which are totally disreguarded. It appears to me there is a considerable party in every State agt. the payment of the domestic debt: & though this matter has shewed it self openly only in Massachusets yet I am satisfyed <<the same cause exists most generally & would be drawn forth by pressure of taxation> a vigorous taxation would produce the same affect in many of the other states. Connecticut would have been in the situation of Massachusetts if she had passed the requisition. I dont pretend to say that the domestic debt is the only cause of discontent. I believe adislike to the payment of private debt to be equally prevalent. Rhode Island has issued paper money to satisfy her people which has depreciated amazingly: North & So. Carolina & N. York & Jersey did this some time since & Maryland is now about doing it. Upon the whole it seems to be the current opinion that however excellent democratical governments may be in some respects, the payment of money & the preservation of the public faith is not among their good qualifications. Congress have lately recommended a meeting of deputies to revise the fOEderal constitution: they are to assemble the 2nd Munday  April 16, 1787  in May next at Philada. It is said Genl. Washington (if he attends) will be Presidt.; if not Doctr. Franklin; There are as great expectations here from the result of their deliberations as I presume there are in France from the Notables. I believe the whole will terminate in nothing; either the Assembly will not agree, or if they do agree, the States will not ratify; our distresses are not sufficiently great to produce decisive alterations. Besides the more slack the government the better the people like it; of course they will not give up any power which will prevent them from being compelled to make satisfaction to their Creditors. They may perhaps go as far as granting the regulation of commerce to Congress, under such conditions, limitations & restrictions as in all probability will render the exercise of the power impracticable. Some of the gentlemen of the Convention are here & I have conversed freely with them as to the reform; they are for going a great way. Some of them are for placing Congress in loco of the King of G.B.---;besides their present powers---;for giving them a perpetual duty on imports & exports. Figure to yourself how the States will relish the idea of a negative on their laws &c &c &c. Congress have lately determined on the representation of the Court of G.B. respecting the infractions of the treaty; & have recommended to the States in the most pointed terms to repeal all acts & parts of acts, which violates the same. This though a right measure I am satisfied will create great uneasiness in most of the States & particularly in ours; where you know so many people will be affected. Our Negotiations with Spain goes on but slowly: indeed We have got into a dilemma which it will be hard to extricate ourselves from. A Part of Congress are for giving up the Navigation of the Missisippi for 25 Ys. Another part (nearly equal) are for no treaty witht. the river. Our embaressment is great. The people on the Western Waters are all in aferment abt. it. The treaty with Morocco is arrived.(1) With respect to Tripoli, Tunis & Algiers people begin to think the game not worth the Candle: & I believe there will be no farther attempts made in that business. If we make a treaty today they may break it tomorrow & we have no fleet to punish or intimidate them. Besides we are far distant. Congress are I think beginning to recover from their treaty madness: Indeed it is high time---;a late application from Van berkell Respecting a law passed in Virga. in favor of France, has helped to open their Eyes.(2) They begin to understand (though at this late hour) the doctrine of the right of the most favored nation: They will early begin also to see the folly of a weak disjointed nation contracting with a strong one, who can explain the contract as he pleases.  An Attempt was made a few days since to remove the session of Congress to Philada. & lost by half a Vote. I expect the new Congress will sit at that place.(3) The State of New York have passed a law declaring Vermont independant in certain conditions.(4) We shall oppose Kentucki to Vermont, & from this circumstance (as we are instructed by the State) it is not improbable but both may get into the Confederation provided the Missisippi business does not altogether detach Kentuckie from the Union. I forgot to inform you that Spain claims almost all Kentucki. Indeed I dont know whether she does not go to Richmond. The treaty with Portugal is not yet arrived; I am satisfied our Ministers did every thing in their power: though it is greatly to be lamented that we cannot send our flour there. Mr. Adams has requested leave to return to America. This will I expect be granted. Mr. Bond appointed by the Court of G.B. Commissary & Consul, will be received only in the latter capacity, if at all.(5) There is a proposition now depending before Congress for sending Mr. Jefferson to Spain on particular business; but doubtful whether it will be carried.(6) You will consider this letter as perfectly confidential: if the packett does not go in the morning I will add to it as well as correct & copy it. If I have not time you must guess at the contents as well as you can. From yr. Affect. frd & hhble servt., Willm. Grayson. ""

 Dear Sir New York April 16 1787 I have been honoured with your letter of the 31 of March,(1) and find with much pleasure that your views of the reform which ought to be pursued by the Convention, give a sanction to those which I have entertained. Temporising applications will dishonor the Councils which propose them, and may foment the internal malignity of the disease, at the same time that they produce an ostensible palliation of it. Radical attempts, although unsuccessful, will at least justify the authors of them. Having been lately led to revolve the subject which is to undergo the discussion of the Convention, and formed in my mind some out- April 16, 1787  lines of a new system, I take the liberty of submitting them without apology, to your eye. Conceiving that an individual independence of the States is utterly irreconcileable with their aggregate sovereignty; and that a consolidation of the whole into one simple republic would be as inexpedient as it is unattainable, I have sought for some middle ground, which may at once support a due supremacy of the national authority, and not exclude the local authorities wherever they can be subordinately useful. I would propose as the ground-work that a change be made in the principle of representation. According to the present form of the Union in which the intervention of the States is in all great cases necessary to effectuate the measures of Congress, an equality of suffrage, does not destroy the inequality of importance, in the several members. No one will deny that Virginia and Massts. have more weight and influence both within & without Congress than Delaware or Rho. Island. Under a system which would operate in many essential points without the intervention of the State Legislatures, the case would be materially altered. A vote in the national Councils from Delaware, would then have the same effect and value as one from the largest State in the Union. I am ready to believe that such a change will not be attended with much difficulty. A majority of the States, and those of greatest influence, will regard it as favorable to them. To the Northern States it will be recommended by their present populousness; to the Southern by their expected advantage in this respect. The lesser States must in every event yield to the predominant will. But the consideration which particularly urges a change in the representation is that it will obviate the principal objections of the larger States to the necessary concessions of power. I would propose next that in addition to the present federal powers, the national Government should be armed with positive and compleat authority in all cases which requireuniformity; such as the regulation of trade, including the right of taxing both exports & imports, the fixing the terms and forms of naturalization, &c &c. Over and above this positive power, a negative in all cases whatsoever on the legislative acts of the States, as heretofore exercised by the Kingly prerogative, appears to me to be absolutely necessary, and to be the least possible encroachment on the State jurisdictions. Without this defensive power, every positive power that can be given on paper will be evaded & defeated. The States will continue to invade the national jurisdiction, to violate treaties and the law of nations & to harrass each other with rival and spiteful measures dictated by mistaken views of interest. Another happy effect of this prerogative would be its controul on the internal vicisitudes of State policy; and the aggressions of interested majorities on the rights of minorities and of indi-  viduals. The great desideratum which has not yet been found for Republican Governments, seems to be some disinterested & dispassionate umpire in disputes between different passions & interests in the State. The majority who alone have the right of decision, have frequently an interest real or supposed in abusing it. In Monarchies the sovereign is more neutral to the interests and views of different parties; but unfortunately he too often forms interests of his own repugnant to those of the whole. Might not the national prerogative here suggested be found sufficiently disinterested for the decision of local questions of policy, whilst it would itself be sufficiently restrained from the pursuit of interests adverse to those of the whole Society? There has not been any moment since the peace at which the representatives of the union would have given an assent to paper money or any other measure of a kindred nature. The national supremacy ought also to be extended as I conceive to the Judiciary departments. If those who are to expound & apply the laws, are connected by their interests & their oaths with the particular States wholly, and not with the Union, the participation of the Union in the making of the laws may be possibly rendered unavailing. It seems at least necessary that the oaths of the Judges should include a fidelity to the general as well as local constitution, and that an appeal should lie to some national tribunals in all cases to which foreigners or inhabitants of other States may be parties. The admiralty jurisdiction seems to fall entirely within the purview of the national Government. The national supremacy in the Executive departments is liable to some difficulty, unless the officers administering them could be made appointable by the supreme Government. The Militia ought certainly to be placed in some form or other under the authority which is intrusted with the general protection and defence. A Government composed of such extensive powers should be wellorganized and balanced. The Legislative department might be divided into two branches; one of them chosen every years by the people at large, or by the legislatures; the other to consist of fewer members, to hold their places for a longer term, and to go out in such a rotation as always to leave in office a large majority of old members. Perhaps the negative on the laws might be most conveniently exercised by this branch. As a further check, a council of revision including the great ministerial officers might be superadded. A national Executive must also be provided. I have scarcely ventured as yet to form my own opinion either of the manner in which it ought to be constituted or of the authorities with which it ought to be cloathed. An article should be inserted expressly guarantying the tranquility of the States against internal as well as external dangers.  In like manner the right of coercion should be expressly declared. With the resources of Commerce in hand, the national administration might always find means of exerting it either by sea or land; But the difficulty & awkwardness of operating by force on the collective will of a State, render it particularly desireable that the necessity of it might be precluded. Perhaps the negative on the laws might create such a mutuality of dependence between the General and particular authorities, as to answer this purpose, or perhaps some defined objects of taxation might be submitted along with commerce, to the general authority. To give a new System its proper validity and energy, a ratification must be obtained from the people, and not merely from the ordinary authority of the Legislatures. This will be the more essential as inroads on the existing Constitutions of the States will be unavoidable. The inclosed address to the States on the subject of the Treaty of peace has been agreed to by Congress, & forwarded to the several Executives. We foresee the irritation which it will excite in many of our Countrymen; but could not withold our approbation of the measure. Both, the resolutions and the address, passed without a dissenting voice.(2) Congress continue to be thin, and of course do little business of importance. The settlement of the public accounts---;the disposition of the public lands, and arrangements with Spain, are subjects which claim their particular attention. As a step towards the first, the treasury board are charged with the task of reporting a plan by which the final decision on the claims of the States will be handed over from Congress to a select sett of men bound by the oaths, and cloathed with the powers, of Chancellors.(3) As to the Second article, Congress have it themselves under consideration. Between 6 & 700, thousand acres have been surveyed and are ready for sale.(4) The mode of sale however will probably be a source of different opinions; as will the modeof disposing of the unsurveyed residue. The Eastern gentlemen remain attached to the scheme of townships. Many others are equally strenuous for indiscriminate locations. The States which have lands of their own for sale, are suspected of not being hearty in bringing the federal lands to market. The business with Spain is becoming extremely delicate, and the information from the Western settlements truly alarming. A motion was made some days ago for an adjournment of Congress for a short period, and an appointment of Philada. for their reassembling. The excentricity of this place as well with regard to E. and West as to N. & South has I find been for a considerable time a thorn in the minds of many of the Southern members. Suspicion too has charged some important votes on the weight thrown by the present position of Congress into the Eastern Scale, and predicts that the Eastern members will never concur in any substantial provision or movement for a proper perma[ne]nt seat for the national Government whilst they remain so much gratified in its temporary residence. These seem to   have been the operative motives with those on one side who were not locally interested in the removal. On the other side the motives are obvious. Those of real weight were drawn from the apparent caprice with which Congress might be reproached, and particularly from the peculiarity of the existing moment. I own that I think so much regard due to these considerations, that notwithstanding the powerful ones on the other side, I should have assented with great repugnance to the motion, and would even have voted against it if any probability had existed that by waiting for a proper time, a proper measure might not be lost for a very long time. The plan which I shd. have judged most eligible would have been to fix on the removal whenever a vote could be obtained, but so as that it should not take effect until the commencement of the ensuing federal year. And if an immediate removal had been resolved on, I had intended to propose such a change in the plan. No final question was taken in the case. Some preliminary questions shewed that six States were in favor of the motion. Rho. Island the 7th was at first on the same side, and Mr. Varnum one of her delegates continues so. His colleague was overcome by the solicitations of his Eastern brethren. As neither Maryland nor South Carolina were on the floor, it seems pretty evident that N. York has a very precarious tenure of the advantages derived from the abode of Congress.  We understand that the discontents in Massts which lately produced an appeal to the sword, are now producing a trial of strength in the field of electioneering. The Governor will be displaced. The Senate is said to be already of a popular complexion, and it is expected the other branch will be still more so. Paper money it is surmized will be the engine to be played off agst. creditors both public and private. As the event of the Elections however is not yet decided, this information must be too much blended with conjecture to be regarded as matter of certainty. I do not learn that theproposed act relating to Vermont has yet gone through all the stages of legislation here; nor can I say whether it will finally pass or not.(5) In truth, it having not been a subject of conversation for some time, I am unable to say what has been done or is likely to be done with it.

Dennison and Mr. Ellis. I am sure they are both to be obtained. Mr. Ellis Certificate is founded on the face of his Books which Books I have seen. This Day a Brig belongi[ng] to Constable, Rucker & Co. sails for Washington to take on a part of the Public Tobacco which they [have] purchased of the North Carolina Delegation with which she proceeds to France and by her I think it is probable one Copy of both their Depositions will be forwarded to you because I am sure she will afford the f[i]rst Conveyance from Washington for Europe. Herewith you will receive a Letter from Mr William Constable to his Partner Mr. Rucker of London of Introduction which please deliver.  I am glad to find Mr. Hudson discovers so much Inclination to pay the Legacy due Mrs. Hall perhaps if he was offered a handsome discount he would pay the Mony without [the] [a]forementioned Deposition say a Discount of 15 Per Ct. or less. If upon Inquiry you should discover then that he would it is decidedly my Opinion that you give it without Hesitation for however dear Mrs Halls Claim may be and I think is the Uncertainty and Delay of the Law is as great but this offer should not be made untill you discover a Certainty of its being accepted. Take every Opportunity to Inform the State of this Business for it may be when it is certain to be obtained by you that it could be cheaply purchased in Carolina of Mrs. Hill. If you should get it in hand hold it untill you inform and as well advise what is proper as to its disposition. I have also wrote to J.G.B. respecting Billy Morans Claim and respecting the Claim of Geo. Lovick of New Bern who has an undoubted Right to a valuable House & Lot near the Foot of LondonBridge respecting both whom I suppose he will w[rite] you by Constables Brig via France. The following is an extract of a Letter this day address to J G Blount by which you will see how much Tobacco J.G. & T. B. have purchased of Constable, Rucker & Co. and on what Terms.(2) As to the Politicks or People of North Carolina I know but very little about them except that your friends are all well. Congress are doing very little Business in general tho they have lately passed  April 18, 1787  some Resolution respecting the Treaty of Peace that will do them much Credit in Europe.(3) Much is expected from the Convention at Philadelphia which is to meet on the 2d Monday in May which I shod attend and shall go from thence to Carolina. Mr Adams [...] to return to America after the Time for which he was appointed shall have expired about 10 or 12 Months to come which he will certainly obtain & it is equally certain that Colonel Smiths Appointment will not be renewed so that he may return also.(4) ""

 My dear Sir New York Apl. 18. 1787 Col. Franks arrived here last week in the French Packet from Havre de Grace. He says that before he sailed accounts were received at Havre of the death of the Count de Vergennes, and Mr. Jefferson in some dispatches Col. F. is the bearer of, mentions his indisposition, and that it occasioned great anxciety at the time he wrote.(1) These corroborating circumstances placed the event in tolerable certainty. This was a great and good minister, whose life was important to the United States, and valuable to the world. He was so considerable a Spring in the present tone of European politics, that it may, perhaps, depend upon his successors acting like him, and possessing the same degree of confidence whether she will remain at peace. The dispatches brought by Col. F. contain Accounts of the Convention which his Most Christian Majesty has called upon the National concerns, it consists of the several orders of the Kingdom, and the Members are denominated the Notables---;it seems a similar measure was adopted about 160 years ago. This event is considered as a very important one in Europe from which, some expect great things, others nothing. A british packet arrived last Sunday and brings papers which contain the Speech of the King of France and others upon the opening of the Convention, and some of the proceedings of that body, from which you will form, in some degree, an idea of the objects of the measure---;these communications are contained in the inclosed paper.(2)  April 18, 1787  Our Friend the M. de la Fayette was originally placed upon the list of Notables, afterwards his name disappeared but was finally reinstated---;his education in our School has, it seems, drawn upon him the jealous eye of some of his Court whose principles are rigidly formed to those of their own despotic government. He has, however, the good disposition of the King, the affections and confidence of the people, and is supported by powerful family connections. He is the youngest Man upon the list of Notables, except one, whose office placed him there. This distinction is no less honourable and flattering to us than him. These circumstances shew that the Marquis's character is not considered as a triffling one, and that it occasions some agitation---;he has however passed his Crisis. The papers which came by the british packet mention the death of the Count de Vergennes upon a certain day---;this is premature, being prior to the date of our letters from Mr. Jefferson---;it is however little to be doubted that the event has taken place. We are endeavouring to get a practicable Scheme adopted, to supercede an impracticable one, for selling the Western territory---;the business is Committed.(3) We have taken the ground of indiscriminate locations from which we may, perhaps, concede to some intermediate stage between that & the present ordinance. The Eastern States, Rh. Island excepted, aim at nothing but to prevent an agreement, as the existing scheme answers their views. We shall endeavour to meet Rhode Island & Jersey, in some measure retaining the idea of Townships, but still calculated to accellerate the Sales, and throw the expence of Surveying upon the purchasers. These two States are much more free from the eastern Shackles, under their present delegations, than they were last year---;in the further progress of this business you shall hear from me. Mr. Madison in Conjunction with myself has agreed to take the furniture from your Mechanic, although we do not like it, in the wholeappearance. We cannot fix upon any particular exceptions so as to justify a refusal to take it, except as to one of the Card table[s] which we insist on his replacing with another. Major Pinkney has not, that we can discover, provided for the payment of 100 dollars as you expected. The Family at the Sycamores are well except as to the old gentleman, who is in his old way.

 April 18th [1787] Wednesday It having appeared by the Report of Mr. Jay on the instruction agreed to Monday the 2d inst & on information refd. to him concerning the discontents of the western people:(1) that he had considered the act of 7 states as authorising him to suspend the use of the Misspi. and that he had accordingly adjusted with Mr. Guardoqui an article to that effect;(2) that he was also much embarrassed by the ferment excited in the western Country by the rumoured intention to cede the Misspi. by which such cession was rendered inexpedient on one side; and on the other side, by the disinclination in another part of the Union to support the use of the River by arms if necessary: It was proposed by Mr. M[adison] as an expedient which if it should answer no other purpose would at least gain time; that it should be Resolved \""that the present State of the Negociations with Spain [meaning the step taken under the spurious authority of seven States](3) and of the affairs of the U.S. [meaning the temper & proceedings in the Western Country], renders it expedient that the Minister Plenipo. at the Court of France should proceed under a special commission, to the Court of Madrid, there to make such representations, and to urge such negociations as will be most likely to satisfy the said Court of the friendly disposition of the U.S. and to induce it to make such concessions relative to the Southern limit of the sd. States, and their right to navigate the river Misspi. and to enter into such commercial Stipulations with them, as may most effectually guard against a rupture of the subsisting harmony, and promote the mutual interest of the two nations: And that the Secy. of F. A. prepare & report the instructions proper to be given  April 18, 1787  to the said Minister, with a proper commission & letter of credence; and that he also report the communications and explanations which it may be advisable to make to Mr. Guardoqui relative to this change in the mode of conducting the negociations with his Court.\""(4) Mr. King said he did not know that he should be opposed to the proposition as it seemed to be a plausible expedient, and as something seemed necessary to be done; but that he thought it proper that Congs. should before they agreed to it give the Secy. for F. A. an opportunity of stating his opinions on it, and accordingly moved that it should be referred to him. Mr. Clarke & Mr. Varnum opposed the reference, it being improper for Congs. to submit a principle for deciding which no further information was wanted, to the opinion of their Minister. The reference being however at length acceded to by the other friends of the proposition on the principle of accomodation, it had a vote of seven States.(5) ""

 Dear Sir, New-York 18th. April 1787. We have laid the papers respecting the seizure and Confiscation of the property of Mr. Amis before Congress in Obedience to the Commands of the Legislature,(1) and it will probably be productive of some good to our Western Citizens, as thereupon such a representation will be made on this business Comprising in a general point of View our entire Claim to the Navigation of Missippi and the prospects of the citizens there founded on this their right, as will eventually we trust lead  April 18, 1787  Congress to the adoption of some uniform decisive line of policy with Spain.(2) The State of this Business as Communicated by our predecessors to the Legislature is highly reprehensible & those Active therein in Some Measure disirous of finding a mean to extricate themselves from their embarrassment. We shall do everything in our power to facilitate it, as we foresee consequences Serious & Alarming to the peace & happiness of our western Citizens and eventually of all the United States. Virginia and New-Jersey have instructed their Delegates in terms similar to ours:(3) & the Gentlemen Now in Congress independant on their instructions are in Opinion with us. We have recived some Resolutions or rather a report of a Committee concurred with by our Legislature on the propriety of keeping up some troops in Davidson County to prevent the Indians from taking any hostile resolutions in aid of the Northern Tribes and we are instructed to lay before the United States of America in Congress Assembld the Necessity of this Measure and to obtain leave to continue the Same in service while the necessity exists.(4) Your Excellency will readily see an ambiguity here which is very ambarrassing to us, for if Congress are to Judge of the necessity the Troops are not Necessary as the Necessity does not exist. Congress having lately thought proper to discharge all the Troops raised under the resolution of October last except two Companies of artillery as guards for the Magazine at Springfield & at West Point: and on the other hand if the Legislature have views of their Own & are of opinion that Troops are necessary for the protection of our western Citizens it would we presume to say have been proper so to have instructed us, that we Could bring forward the Measure & Obtain if practicable the Concurence of Congress with the State. We have to request that if any other resolutions or Acts of the Assembly will throw away light on this business they may be sent forward as early as is practicable.Congress have been necessitated to examine the infractions of the Treaty of peace with great Britain, & to express themselves after a dispasionate and dilibrate examination in a firm, decisive and unequivocal manner. The Resolutions thereon & the letter of Congress Accompanying the same will be forwarded this post to Your Excellency from the Office of the Secretary of Congress to add any thing on Our parts to a subject so properly treated would be improper because unnecessary.(5) We have no information from Great Britain that gives room to except a Commercial Treaty with them. Our disunion in grand National points has induced Britain to suppose She can avail herself of any Advantages which can be derived from us in the Way of Commerce without a receprocity on her part And we doubt not she will Continue her nefarious Schemes untill she discovers that we are capable of seeing & feeling as a nation. When this most deserible period will arive is a question incapable of solution from present prospects. Although the present are more bright and promising than   we did believe they would be for some time past France is invariably & unchargeably our friend. They have already made several alterations favourable to us & a Committee is appointed to report other favourable regulations as may be most beneficial to our Commerce,(6) of these you shall be informed from time to time as they Occur. The present period is a very important one for France. The King has Called a Convention of the Notable, and they will have met some time early in February, and in addition she has lossed the Count de Vergennes which is the greater as it happened during this critical poise of europian politics. He was the friend of America and a very dear one to us, he was the helmsman of Europe, and in him the world has lost a man who dared to espouse the cause of freedom in oposition to the bigotry of the Clergy and the Tyranny of the rulers of the Earth. His successor is not yet announced But we have hopes it will be M. de Montmorrin who is of very great abilities & firm in his friendly disposition towards us. Mr. Barcley has concluded a treaty with the emperor of Morocco & as soon as it is ratified it will be sent forward to you. Our Negotiator has through the whole of this transaction discovered much good sense and a pointed attention of the Rights & interest of the United States. At Algiers we have been so fortunate and various are the causes ascribed to the failure Three of which only we Subscribe to the unsklfulness of the Negotiator, the poverty of the United States, and the Very unfriendly opposition given by the British there. They have twenty one prisoners, several of whom are Actually employed as slaves in the Marine, and the Remainder variously employed, some in the household of the Dey &ca.

The instructions of Virga. agst. relinquishing the Missippi were laid before Congs. by the delegates of that State, with a motion that they should be referred to the department for F. A. by way of information.(1) The reference was opposed by Mr. King & Mr. Benson as unnecessary for that purpose, the instructions having been printed in the newspapers. In answer to this it was observed that the memorial accompanying the instructions had never been printed; that if it had, no just objection could be thence drawn agst. an official communication; that if Congs. would submit a measure as they had done yesterday to the opinion of their Minister(2) they ought at least to supply him with every fact in the most authentic manner, which could assist his judgment; and that they had actually referred to the same minister communications relative to the Western views, less interesting & authentic, and which he had made the basis of a Report to Congs.(3) The motion was lost: Massts. and New York being agst. it, and Connecticut divided.

 Dear Sir New York April 19, 1787. No definitive steps are yet taken for the transportation of your furniture. I fear we shall be obliged to make use of a conveyance to Norfolk as soon as one shall offer. I have examined the workmanship of the man in Chappel Street.(1) The face of it is certainly superior to that of your workman. Whether it may prove much so for substantial purposes, I do not undertake to say. Should Mrs. Monroe not be pleased with the articles, I wd. recommend that you dispose of them, which may be done probably without loss, and send us a commission to replace them. I think we could please you both; and on terms not dearer than those of your purchase. We learn nothing yet of a remittance from S. Carolina.(2) The business of the Mississippi will I think come to a point in a few days. You shall know the result in due time. A motion was lately made to remove shortly to Philada. Six States would have been for it. Rh. Island was so at first, and would have been a seventh. One of the delegation was overpowered by exertions of his Eastern brethren.(3) I need not rehearse to you the considerations which operated on both sides. Your conjectures will not mistake them. My own opinion is that there are strong objections agst. the moment; objections which nothing would supercede but the difficulty of bringing the sense of the Union to an efficient vote in Congress, and the danger of losing altogether a proper measure by waiting for a proper time. A middle way would have been my choice; that is to fix Philada. for the meeting of the ensuing Congs. & to remain here in the mean time. This would have given time for all preliminary arrangements, would have steered clear of the Convention, and by selecting a natural period for the event, and transferring the operation of it to our successors in office, all insinuations of suddenness, and of personal views, would have been repelled. I hear with much pleasure that you are to aid the deliberations of the next assembly, and with much concern thatpaper money will probably be among the bad measures which you will have to battle.(4) Wishing you success in this and all your other labors for the public, and for yourself, I remain with best respects to Mrs. Monroe yours affely., Js.

 My dear Sir New York April 22. 1787 The period since my last has afforded such scanty materials for a letter that I have postponed it, till I have now to thank you for yours of 7th inst.(1) which came to hand two days ago. I always feel pleasure in hearing from you, but particularly when my concern for your doubtful health is relieved by such an evidence in its favor. At the same time I must repeat my wishes to forego this pleasure, whenever it may interfere with the attention which you owe to your ease, your business, or your other friends. I do not learn that any symptoms yet appear of a return of the insurgent spirit in Massts. On the contrary it is said that the malcontents are trying their strength in a more regular form. This is the crisis of their elections, and if they can muster sufficient numbers, their wicked measures are to be sheltered under the forms of the Constitution. How far their influence may predominate in the current appointments is uncertain, but it is pretty certain that a great change in the rulers of that State is taking place; and that a paper emission, if nothing worse is strongly apprehended. Governor Bowdoin is already displaced in favor of Mr. Hancock, whose acknowledged merits are not a little tainted by a dishonorable obsequiousness to popular follies. A great change has also taken place in the Senate, and a still greater is prognosticated in the other branch of the Legislature.  We are flattered with the prospect of a pretty full and very respectable meeting in next month. All the States have made appointments except Connecticut, Maryland & Rd. Island. The last has refused. Maryland will certainly concur. The temper of Connecticut is equivocal. The turn of her elections which are now going on, is said to be rather unpropitious. The absence of one or two States however will not materially affect the deliberations of the Convention. Disagreement in opinion among those present is much more likely to embarrass us. The nearer the crisis approaches, the more I tremblefor the  April 22, 1787  issue. The necessity of gaining the concurrence of the Convention in some system that will answer the purpose, the subsequent approbation of Congress, and the final sanction of the States, presents a series of chances, which would inspire despair in any case where the alternative was less formidable. The difficulty too is not a little increased by the necessity which will be produced by encroachments on the State Constitutions, of obtaining not merely the assent of the Legislatures, but the ratification of the people themselves. Indeed if such encroachments could be avoided, a higher Sanction than the Legislative authority would be necessary to render the laws of the Confederacy paramount to the Acts of its members. I inclose a late Act of Congress which will shew you the light in which they view and inculcate a compliance with the Treaty of peace.(2) We were not unaware of the bitterness of the pill to many of our Countrymen, but national considerations overruled that objection. An investigation of the subject had proved that the violations on our part were not only most numerous and important, but were of earliest date. And the assurances on the other part are explicit that a reparation of our wrongful measures shall be followed by an immediate and faithful execution of the Treaty by Great Britain. Congress are at present deliberating on the most proper plan for disposing of the Western lands, and providing a criminal and civil administration for the Western settlements beyond the Ohio. The latter subject involves great difficulties. On the former also opinions are various. Between 6 & 700,000 acres have been surveyed in Townships & are to be sold as soon as they shall be duly advertised. The sale was at first to have been distributed throughout the States. This plan is now exchanged for the opposite extreme. The sale is to be made where Congs. sit. Unquestionably reference ought to have been had in fixing on the place, either to the Center of the Union or to the proximity of thepremises. In providing for the unsurveyed lands, the difficulty arises from the Eastern attachmt. to townships, & the Southern to indiscriminate locations.(3) A Copper Coinage was agreed on yesterday to the amount of upwards of two hundred thousand dollars. 15 Per Ct. is [to] be drawn into the federal Treasury from this operation.(4) Our affair with Spain is on a very delicate footing. It is not easy to say what precise steps would be most proper to be taken on our side, and extremely difficult to say what will be actually taken. Many circumstances threaten an Indian war, but the certainty of it is not established. A British officer was lately here from Canada, as has been propagated, but not on a mission to Congress. His business was unknown, if he had any that was important. I am extremely concerned though not much surprized at the danger of a paper emission in Virginia. If Mr. H. shd. erect the standard he will certainly be joined by sufficient force to accomplish it. Re-  morse and shame are but too feeble restraints on interested individuals, agst. unjust measures, and are rarely felt at all by interested multitudes.

 My dear Sir New York April 22. 1787. I have the pleasure of your's of the 11 inst.(1) acknowledging mine of the 2d. In some of your letters I observe you do not say whether any have been recd. from me or not. I have not omitted to write in a single instance since our correspondence commenced. The time approaches so nearly now when I shall have an opportunity of asking verbal communications on confidential points that I forbear to commit them to paper. Congs. are deliberating on the plan most eligible for disposing of the western territory not yet surveyed. Some alterations will probably be made in the ordinance on that subject, in which the idea of townships will not be altogether abandoned, but rendered less expensive. An Act passed yesterday providing for the sale of the surveyed lands, under the direction of the Treasury board.(2) The price is to be one dollar at the lowest. The sale is to be duly advertised in all the States, but the office is to be opened & held where Congs. shall sit. The original plan of distributing the sale through all the States was certainly objectionable. To confine it to one place, and that so remote as N.Y. is both from the center of the Union, and the premises in question, can not be less so. The inhabitants of the Illinois complain of the land jobbers, particularly Pentecost & Clarke, who are purchasing titles among them. Those of St. Vincents complain of the defect of criminal and civil justice among them, as well as of military protection. These matters are before Congs. and are found to be infinitely embarrassing.(3) A copper coinage was agreed on yesterday to the amount of two hundred & odd thousand dollars. It is to be executed under a contract between the Treasury board & the Coiner, and under the inspec- April 22, 1787  tion of a person to be appointed on the part of the U.S. 15 Per Ct. is to be drawn from this operation into the federal Treasury.(4) A great revolution is taking place in the Administration in Massts. Bowdoin is displaced in favor of Hancock. A great proportion of the Senate is already changed, and a greater is expected in the other branch of the Assembly. A paper emission there also is much feared by the friends of Justice. I find that the fetter originally put on the deputies from that State to the Convention was taken off in consequence of the recommendatory act of Congs. & the commission adjusted to that act. Connecticut has not yet been in assembly, and of course has not decided on the convention. I am told the changes which are taking place in her elections, are far from strengthening the probability of her concurrence. If Mr. Beckley has no other view in coming to Philada. than that of the secretaryship to the Convention, I suspect the chance of his success ought hardly to recommend the trip. Other solicitations will certainly oppose him, backed by services in a more conspicuous & in the common opinion, more meritorious line.(5) Yrs. affy., Js. Madison Jr. ""

He said he was not attached to the expedient he had bro't forward, and was open to any other that might be less exceptionable.  Mr. Ghorum avowed his opinion that the Shutting the Mississpi would be advantageous to the Atlantic States, and wished to see it shut. Mr. [Madison] animadverted on the illiberality of his doctrine, and contrasted it with the principles of the Revolution, and the language of American patriots. Nothing was done in the case. ""

 Dear Sir April 23. 1787. Since my last which was of March 19, I have had the pleasure of yours of Decr. 16, Jany. 30, and Feby. 7,(1) which were handed to me by Col Franks. Along with them were received the copying machine and other articles referred to in them. You will accept my warmest thanks for all these favors. The packet for the Governor of Virginia under the same cover with your letter of Feby. 7 has been forwarded. The accident to your wrist was first made known to me by these communications. I learnt with satisfaction from Col. Franks that the pain and weakness were apparently going off, and ardently wish that your projected trip to the South of France may produce a radical cure. The vigorous measures finally pursued by the Government of Massachusetts against the insurgents, had the intended effect of dispersing them. By some it was feared that they would reembody on the return of favorable weather. As yet no symptom of such a design has appeared. It would seem that they mean to try their strength in another way; that is, by endeavoring to give the elections such a turn as may promote their views under the auspices of Constitutional forms. How far they may succeed is not yet reducible to certainty. That a great change will be effected in the component members of the Government is certain, but the degree of influence imputable to the malcontents can not be well known till some specimen shall be given of the temper of the new rulers. Mr. Hancock takes the place of Mr. Bowdoin. His general character forbids a suspicion of his patriotic principles; but as he is an idolater of popularity, it is to be feared that he may be seduced by this foible into dishonorable compliances. A great proportion of the Senate is also changed, and a greater proportion of the other branch it is expected will be changed. A paper emission at least is apprehended from this revolution in their Councils. Congress have agreed to Mr. Jays report on the treaty of peace and to an address which accompanies it. Copies of bothwill no doubt be sent you from his department. The Legislature of this State which was sitting at the time and on whose account the acts of Congress were hurried through, has adjou[r]ned till Jany. next without deciding on them. This is an ominous example to the other States, and must weaken much the claim on Great Britain of an execution of the Treaty on her part as promised, in case of proper steps being taken on ours. Virginia we foresee will be among the foremost in seizing pretexts for evading the injunctions of Congress. S. Carolina is not less infected  April 23, 1787  with the same spirit. The present deliberations of Congress turn on 1. the sale of the western lands. 2. the Government of the Western settlements within the federal domain. 3. the final settlement of the Accounts between the Union and its members. 4. the {treaty with Spain}.(2) 1. Between six & seven hundred thousand acres have been surveyed in townships under the land ordinance, and are to be sold forthwith. The place where Congress sit is fixed for the sale. Its excentricity and remoteness from the premises will I apprehend give disgust. On the most eligible plan of selling the unsurveyed residue Congress are much divided; the Eastern States being strongly attached to that of townships, notwithstanding the expence incident to it; the Southern being equally biassed in favor of indiscriminate locations, notwithstanding the many objections agst. that mode. The dispute will probably terminate in some kind of compromise, if one can be hit upon.(3) 2. The Government of the settlements on the Illinois & Wabash is a subject very perplexing in itself; and rendered more so by our ignorance of many circumstances on which a right judgment depends. The inhabitants at those places, claim protection agst. the savages, and some provision for both criminal and Civil justice. It appears also that land jobbers are among them who are likely to multiply litigations among individuals, and by collusive purchases of spurious titles, to defraud the United States. 3. The settlement of the public accounts has long been pursued in varied shapes, and with little prospect of success. The idea which has long been urged by some of us, seems now to be seriously embraced, of establishing a plenipotentiary tribunal, for the final adjustment of the mutual claims on the great and simple principle of equity. An ordinance for this purpose has been reported by the Treasury board and has made some progress through Congress.(4) It is likely to be much retarded by the thinness of Congress, as indeed is almost every othermatter of importance. 4. The {Spanish negociation} is in a very {ticklish situation}. You have been already apprized of the {vote of seven states last fall} for {ceding} the {Mississippi} for a {term of years}. From sundry circumstances it was {inferred that Jay was} not {proceeding under this usurped authority}. A late instruction to {him to lay the state} of the {negociation before Congress} has {discovered} that he has {adjusted} with {Guardoqui} an {article} for {suspending} the {use of the Mississippi} by {the citizens of United States.} The report however leaves it {somewhat doubtful how far United States} are {committed by this step} and a {subsequent Report of} the {secretary} on the {seizure of Spanish property} in the {western country} and on {information of discontents} touching the {occlusion of the Mississippi} shews that the probable {consequences of the measure perplex him extremely}. It was nevertheless conceived by the {instructed delegations} to be {their   duty to press a revocation} of the {step taken} in some {form which would least offend Spain} and {least irritate} the {patrons of the vote [of] seven states}. Accordingly {a motion was made} to the {following effect}---;that the {present state of the negociation with Spain and of} the {affairs of United States rendered it expedient} that {you should proceed under a special commission to Madrid} for the {purpose of making such representations} as {might at once impress} on that {court our friendly disposition} and {induce it to relax} on the {contested points} and that the {proper communications} and {explanations} should {be made to Guardoqui relative} to this {change in} the {mode of conducting the negociation}. This {motion was referred} to {Mr. Jay} whose {report disapproves of it}. In this state the {matter lies}.(5) Eight {states only being present no effective vote} is to be {expected}. It may notwithstanding be incumbent {on us to try some question} which will at least {mark the paucity of states who abet} the {obnoxious project. Massachusetts} and {New York} alone of the present {states are under that} description; and {Connecticut and New Hampshire alone of} the {absent. Maryland} and {South Carolina} have heretofore been on the {right side}. Their {future conduct} is somewhat problimatical. The opinion of {New Hampshire} is only {conjectured}. The {conversion of Rhode Island} countenances a {hope that she too} may in this instance {desert the New England standard}. The prospect of a full and respectable convention grows stronger every day. Rho. Island alone has refused to send deputies. Maryland has probably appointed by this time. Of Connecticut alone doubts are entertained. The antifederal party in that State is numerous & persevering. It is sd. that the elections which are now going on, are rather discouraging to the advocates of the Convention. Pennsylvania has added Doctor Franklin to her deputation. There is some ground to calculate on the attendance of Genl. Washington. OurGovernor, Mr. Wythe, Mr. Blair, and Col. Mason will pretty certainly attend. The last I am informed is renouncing his errors on the subject of the Confederation, and means to take an active part in the amendment of it. Mr. Henry pretty soon resigned the undertaking. Genl. Nelson was put into his place, who has also declined. He was succeeded by R. H. Lee, who followed his example. Docr. McClurg has been since appointed, and as he was on the spot must have been previously consulted. Considerable changes are taking place I hear in the County elections in Virginia, and a strong itch beginning to return for paper money. Mr. Henry is said to have the measure in contemplation, and to be laying his train for it already. He will however be powerfully opposed by Col. Mason, if he should be elected & be able to serve, by Monroe, Marshal, and Ludwel Lee (son of R. H. L.) who are already elected, and sundry others of inferior rank. Mr. Harrison the late Governor, has so far regained the favor of Charles City as to be reinstated   a representative. The part which he will take is uncertain. From his repeated declarations he ought to be adverse to a paper emission. My next will probably be from Philada. In the mean time with my fervent wishes for your happiness I remain Yr.

 Dear Sir, New York April 24. 1787 I had the honor to receive your favor of the 16th of Jan. by Colo. Franks,(1) and thank you sincerely as well for the confidence with which you claim my services, as for your friendly communications. The former you may at all times command: the latter will not only be gratefully received, but repaid as far as my attempts to do so can go. The letters to your freinds were immediately forwarded under cover to Doctor Curry. The packages are committed to the care of Mr. Banister, who goes off this day by stage to Richmond. No gentleman before him has been travelling thither by this mode, since the arrival of the packet, and to have committed them to the stage without the immediate Care of a person who was to go the whole way, would have amounted to no more than a consignment to the first stage office in  April 24, 1787  which they might have been deposited for a night, or perhaps to be thrown into the high way by the first traveller who might conceive himself incommoded by them. There is scarsely an instance of any thing going safely that is casually committed to the stage. Mr. Banister intends to go immediately on, but should he, by any accident be delayed, he will more readily meet with a hand who is going to Richmond further on the way than I shall here, and is apprised of the dispatch which is necessary in the case. You have doubtless been informed of the measure of a general Convention which was proposed by Virginia in the fall session, for revising and, thoroughly amending the Confederation. Some of the States hesitated upon the adoption of the measure as being unauthorised by Congress, and, of course, improper. To remove every possible difficulty, Congress came to a resolution in February, recommending its adoption; all the states have appointed deputies except Maryland, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Maryland is now in session, and that she will appoint, is not doubted. Connecticut is also in session, and it is believed will appoint. Rhode Island is at all points so anti-federal, and contemptible, that her neglecting the invitation, will probably occasion no demur whatever in the proceedings. The meeting is to take place in Philada. the second Monday in May. Various are the conjectures as to the issue of this meeting, and still more various are the suggested remedies to the defects of our system. I am rather a zealot in the measure because it will operate, at least as an alarm, but whether it will be productive of any immediate effects, may be doubtful. Perhaps that experiment has not yet been made of the present system, which could discover its defects, or point to their remedies; I am certain it is very imperfect, but at the same time there are evident causes for its failure, other than those of defectiveness in the constructure. The best of Governments, like other things, can prosper alone by dueattention. America was placed in possession of peace and independence under circumstances which have not only deprived her political systems of the necessary care of her Citizens, but exposed her to the injurious designs of Men, whose interest it has been to destroy the efficiency of Government. A great proportion of the people, being loaded with debt, have found an interest in promoting measures directly opposed to good government, and have been solicitous to direct the public affairs, whilst better men have been inactive, or engrossed by the alluring invitation of ease and plenty in our vast western & southern Regions. The deputies to the convention for Virginia are Genl. Washington, E. Randolph, G. Wythe, John Blair, Geo. Mason, J. Madison & Jas. McClurg. Mr. Henry, Mr. R. H. Lee & Genl. Nelson have declined ap-  pointments which were offered them. Genl. Washington it is hoped will attend but there is some reason to apprehend the contrary---;his state of health is not a good one. I am pleased to hear of the impressions which have been received in Europe with respect to the late commotions in Massachusetts. A perfect quiet prevails there now, but it is said the elections for the ensuing year are not free of the influence of the Malcontents. The Convention will be productive of things worth communicating to you, and I will do myself the pleasure to write by the first opportunity that offers after its commencement. Be good enough to present me to Mr. Short, to whom I will write by the next packet. I have the Honour to be, with great respect & Esteem, Dr Sir, Your Most Obt. Servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 Sir, Newyork 24th April, 1787. The following measures have been adopted by Congress since our last communications. The resolution of the twentieth Octr. last is so far repealed, that only two Companies of the Massachusetts' line are retained.(1) Congress have unequivocally declared the operation of the treaty of peace with Great Britain, & recommended to the respective states to repeal all laws repugnant to the principles of that treaty.(2) The reasons inducing this measure accompany the resolution; & the consequences will be an evacuation of the western posts, provided the States comply, as they certainly will upon principles of right, & of good policy. A copper coinage, upon the federal standard, for the value of one hundred thousand pounds this currency, is established.(3) The Contractor gives a premium of fifteen per cent, and loans the whole sum, upon the common funds, for twenty years, with six per cent interest, with an option in the United States, of discharging the debt sooner. The appropriation is for sinking the debt, and well conducted, will produce the best objects of financiering. The pay of the Civil list is reduced.(4) The western lands already surveyed, are directed to be sold agreably to the Ordinance for that purpose, in five months, at public vendue, in the place where Congress may set, for not less than one dollar in paper or specie per Acre.(5) Much attention has been paid to a plan for speedily settling the accounts of the United  April 24, 1787  States with the individual states, but the want of nine states in representation now impedes the accomplishment of that desirable object.(6) It is probable that no business, of very essential importance, will be conducted for some time to come, as the public attention is very much engrossed upon the meeting of the delegates in convention, some of whom are members of congress. This period forms a most serious crisis in our political existence! The avowed objects of this new assembly, sanctioned by general opinion, and pointing to the great interests of the whole Union, are too momentous not to claim the attention of the state of Rhode Island! How far an intire adherence to the articles of Confederation may justify the policy of any one or two states in remaining indifferent spectators to the probable events of these arrangements, we shall not presume to decide; but common safety, and the relation a part bears to the whole should have their due influence upon this occasion. As representatives of the state in the General confederacy, we feel no motives but those which are directed to the honor and happiness of all our constituents, and therefore do not urge, but offer our sentiments, that the resolution of Congress for appointing delegates in the convention ought to be complied with. The Legislature of this state have ordered a prosecution against the printer, in consequence of our letter to Governor Clinton, should we request it. In this matter we acted deliberately, and, as we conceive, with propriety. The peculiarity and delicacy of our situation required an assertion of the dignity of our state, or a submission to the most debasing humility. Our views are fully answered, and we have it now in our power to gratify our feelings to the extremes of generosity.(7) In a short time, we shall be able to retire from public business, & pay some attention to our private concerns; but in order to obtain that intermission, & preserve a character worthy of those who imployed us, we hope for thesupplies our appointments intitle us to. Be pleased sir, to accept our congratulations upon the commencement of a new political Year and, while our most earnest wishes are directed to the prosperity of the state, under the influence of wise and salutary measures, be assured of the great esteem and regard, with which we have the honor of being, your excellency's very obedt. & most humble servants, J M Varnum.

14230,dg024205,1787,James Madison s Notes of Debates,"""James Madison's Notes of Debates
 Wednesday April 25 [1787]. Mr. [Madison](1) Observing to Congs. that he found a settled disinclination in some of the delegations to concur in any conciliatory expedient for defending the Mississippi agst. the operation of the vote of seven States, and that it was hence become necessary to attack directly the validity of that measure to the end that the adversaries to it and particularly the instructed delegations,(2) might at least discharge their duty in the case, made the following motion: \""Whereas it appears by the Report of the Secretary for the department of F. A. made on the instant;(3) that in consequence of a vote entered into by seven States on the day of last,(4) he has proceeded to adjust with Mr. Guardoqui an article for suspending the right of the U.S. to the common use of the River Mississippi below their Southern boundary: And Whereas it is considered that the said vote of seven States having passed in a case, in which the assent of nine States is required by the articles of Confederation, is not valid for the purpose intended by it; and that any further negociations in pursuance of the same, may eventually expose the U.S. to great embarrassments with Spain as well as excite great discontents and difficulties among themselves: Resolved that the Secy. for the said department be informed that it is the opinion of Congress that the said vote of seven States ought not to be regarded as authorising any suspension of the use of the River Mississippi by the U.S.; and that any expectation thereof which may have been conceived on the part of Spain ought to be repressed.\""(5) Mr. King reminded Congress that this motion was barred by the rule, that no question should be revived which had been set aside by the previous question, unless the same states or an equal number be present as were present at the time of such previous question. This rule had been entered into in consequence of a similar motion made shortly after the vote of seven States had passed.(6) Mr. K. contended that this rule was aprudent one & recommended by the practice of all deliberative assemblies, who never suffered questions once agitated & decided to be repeated at the pleasure of the unsuccessful party. Mr. M[adison] admitted that the rule if insisted on was a bar to his motion; but that he had not expected that it would be called up; being so evidently improper in itself, and the offspring of the intemperance which characterized the epoch of its birth. As it was called up  April 25, 1787  however it was become necessary that a preliminary motion for its repeal shd. be made, and which he accordingly made. His objections agst. the rule were 1. that it was an attempt in one congs. to bind their successors which was not only impracticable in itself, but highly unreasonable in the very instance which gave birth to the rule. 12 States were on the floor at the time. 7 were for the previous question. 5 agst. it. The casting number therefore was but two. Was it not unreasonable that 11 States unanimously of a contrary opinion should be controuled by this small majority when 12 were present; & yet such would be the operation of the rule, if 11 States only should at any time happen to be present, altho' they should be unanimous in the case. 2. The operation of the rule in another respect was still far more reprehensible. In the former case the 11 States, or even 7 could extricate themselves by a repeal of the rule. In case a number less than 7 should wish to justify themselves by any particular motion, they might be precluded by such a rule: 6 States instructed by their constituents to make a particular proposition, or to enter a particular protest, might be thus fettered by a strategem of 7 States. In the case actually depending 3 States were instructed, and two if not 3 more ready to vote with them. 3. The practice of other Assemblies did not reach this case; and if it did, the reason of it wd. be inapplicable. The restriction in other assemblies related to the same assembly & even to the same Session. Here the restriction is perpetual---;In Legislative assemblies, no great inconvenience could happen from a suspension of a law for a limited time. In Executive Councils, which are involved in the Constitution of Congs., and particularly in military operations, & negociations, the vicicutude of events would often govern, and a measure improper on one day might become necessary the next. Mr. Clarke & Mr. Varnum contended that the rules of the Congs. for the last year, werenot in force during the present, and supposed that a repeal was unnecessary.  In the course of this discussion the question as to the validity of the vote of 7 States and the merits of the proposition of Mr. M[adison] barred by the rule, incidentally came into view. The adversaries to the latter did not maintain the validity, or rather declined studiously giving an opinion on it. They urged only the impropriety of any exposition by Congs. of their own powers & of the validity of their own acts. They were answered that the exposition must lie somewhere, and more properly with Congs. than with one of their Ministerial officers---;that it was absurd to say that Congs. with information on their table that a Treaty with a foreign nation was going on without a constitutional sanction, should forbear out of such scruple to arrest it, and prevent the dilemma which wd. ensue, of either recognising an unconstitutional proceeding, or of quarrelling with the K. of Spain, that   Congs. had frequently asserted & expounded their own powers and must frequently be obliged to do so. What was the late address to the States on the subject of the Treaty of peace, but an exposition & vindication of their constitutional powers:(7) that in the vote itself; the entry \""so it was resolved in the affirmative,\"" asserted it to be valid & constitutional; the vote of 7 States when 9 were reqd. being otherwise to be entered like a vote of 6 States in the negative. It appearing to be the inflexible predetermination of the advocates for the Spanish Treaty, to hold fast every advantage they had got, the question was shortened, and an adjournment took place without any question. Mr. K. in conversation repeatedly, though not in public debate, maintained that the entry \""so it was resolved in the affirmative\"" decided nothing as to the validity of the vote of 7 States for yielding the Missippi---;and that they amounted to no more than a simple affirmation or summary repetition, of the fact that the said seven States voted in the manner stated.(8) ""

In referring you to Mr Whitehurst, I did not mean to recommend him as an Author on which you were to build your faith.

I shall attend particularly to the last, and avail myself of such opportunities as may offer to execute your wishes. These things you know appear awkward when introduced out of time; I have already spoken to George Meade a particular friend of mine in Philada. Affairs go on here very slowly. Mr. Jay has reported to Congress that he and Gardoqui have adjusted an article in which the navigation of a certain river is giv'n up: that Mr. Gardoqui has wrote for instructions respecting the limits; the English of the matter is that Rendon has gone to Spain on this business, & if that Court gives up the limits, I have no doubt but the design is to conclude the treaty immedy. Several attempts to reverse the proceedings of the seven States have been made in vain. It is true that we have got Rhode Island & Jersey, but then it is said confidently that So. Carolina & Maryland when they get on the floor will be against us. I think the chances for Delawar are in our favor. If all the States were represented I believe we should carry the point: but there is no expectation that this will be the case during this year: In the mean time Rendon arrives & the question put upon the ratification, which I think will go against us. The Convention are to meet soon, but am satisfied will effect nothing: or if they do, that the States will not confirm. The Insurgts. of Massachusets have got full possession of the Governmt. Constitutionally they talk of a depreciating paper, & other villainous acts: & I have no doubt but they will be precisely in the situation of R. Island without delay.

This evil has been so fully experienced both during the war and since the peace, results so naturally from the number and independent authority of the States and has been so uniformly examplified in every similar Confederacy, that it may be considered as not less radically and permanently inherent in, than it is fatal to the object of, the present System. 2.

Accordingly not a year has passed without instances of them in some one or other of the States. The Treaty of peace---;the treaty with France---;the treaty with Holland have each been violated. [See the complaints to Congress on these subjects].(4) The causes of these irregularities must necessarily produce frequent violations of the law of nations in other respects. As yet foreign powers have not been rigorous in animadverting on us. This moderation however cannot be mistaken for a permanent partiality to our faults, or a permanent security agst. those disputes with other nations, which being among the greatest of public calamities, it ought to be least in the power of any part of the Community to bring on the whole. 4. Trespasses of the States on the rights of each other. 4. These are alarming symptoms, and may be daily apprehended as we are admonished by daily experience. See the law of Virginia restricting foreign vessels to certain ports---;of Maryland in favor of vessels belonging to her own citizens---;of N. York in favor of the same. Paper money, instalments of debts, occlusion of Courts, making property a legal tender, may likewise be deemed aggressions on the rights of other States. As the Citizens of every State aggregately taken stand more or less in the relation of Creditors or debtors, to the Citizens of every otherStates, Acts of the debtor State in favor of debtors, affect the Creditor State, in the same manner, as they do its own citizens who are relatively creditors towards other citizens. This remark may be extended to foreign nations. If the exclusive regulation of the value and alloy of coin was properly delegated to the federal authority, the policy of it equally requires a controul on the States in the cases above mentioned. It must have been meant 1. to preserve uniformity in the circulating medium throughout the nation. 2. to prevent those frauds on the citizens of other States, and the subjects of foreign powers, which might disturb the tranquility at home, or involve the Union in foreign contests. The practice of many States in restricting the commercial intercourse with other States, and putting their productions and manufactures on   the same footing with those of foreign nations, though not contrary to the federal articles, is certainly adverse to the spirit of the Union, and tends to beget retaliating regulations, not less expensive & vexatious in themselves, than they are destructive of the general harmony. 5. Want of concert in matters where common interest requires it. 5. This defect is strongly illustrated in the state of our commercial affairs. How much has the national dignity, interest, and revenue suffered from this cause? Instances of inferior moment are the want of uniformity in the laws concerning naturalization & literary property; of provision for national seminaries, for grants of incorporation for national purposes, for canals and other works of general utility, wch. may at present be defeated by the perverseness of particular States whose concurrence is necessary. 6. Want of Guaranty to the States of their Constitutions & laws against internal violence. 6. The confederation is silent on this point and therefore by the second article the hands of the federal authority are tied.(5) According to Republican Theory, Right and power being both vested in the majority, are held to be synonimous.(3) According to fact and experience a minority may in an appeal to force, be an overmatch for the majority. 1. If the minority happen to include all such as possess the skill and habits of military life, & such as possess the great pecuniary resources, one third only may conquer the remaining two thirds. 2. One third of those who participate in the choice of the rulers, may be rendered a majority by the accession of those whose poverty excludes them from a right of suffrage, and who for obvious reasons will be more likely to join the standard of sedition than that of the established Government. 3. Where slavery exists the republican Theory becomes still more fallacious. 7. Want of sanction to the laws, and of coercion in the Government of the Confederacy. 7. A sanction isessential to the idea of law, as coercion is to that of Government. The federal system being destitute of both, wants the great vital principles of a Political Constitution.(3) Under the form of such a Constitution, it is in fact nothing more than a treaty of amity of commerce and of alliance, between independent and Sovereign States. From what cause could so fatal an omission have happened in the articles of Confederation? from a mistaken confidence that the justice, the good faith, the honor, the sound policy, of the several legislative assemblies would render superfluous any appeal to the ordinary motives by which the laws secure the obedience of individuals: a confidence which does honor to the enthusiastic virtue of the compilers, as much as the inexperience of the crisis apologizes for their errors. The time which has since elapsed has had the double effect, of increasing   the light and tempering the warmth, with which the arduous work may be revised. It is no longer doubted that a unanimous and punctual obedience of 13 independent bodies, to the acts of the federal Government, ought not be calculated on. Even during the war, when external danger supplied in some degree the defect of legal & coercive sanctions, how imperfectly did the States fulfil their obligations to the Union? In time of peace, we see already what is to be expected. How indeed could it be otherwise? In the first place, Every general act of the Union must necessarily bear unequally hard on some particular member or members of it. Secondly the partiality of the members to their own interests and rights, a partiality which will be fostered by the Courtiers of popularity, will naturally exaggerate the inequality where it exists, and even suspect it where it has no existence. Thirdly a distrust of the voluntary compliance of each other may prevent the compliance of any, although it should be the latent disposition of all. Here are causes & pretexts which will never fail to render measures abortive. If the laws of the States, were merely recommendatory to their citizens, or if they were to be rejudged by County authorities, what security, what probability would exist, that they would be carried into execution? Is the security or probability greater in favor of the acts of Congs. which depending for their execution on the will of the state legislatures, are tho' nominally authoritative, in fact recommendatory only. 8. Want of ratification by the people of the articles of Confederation. 8. In some of the States the Confederation is recognized by, and forms a part of the constitution. In others however it has received no other sanction than that of the Legislative authority. From this defect two evils result:(3) 1. Whenever a law of a State happens to be repugnant to an act of Congress, particularly when the latter is of posterior date to the former, it will be at least questionable whetherthe latter must not prevail;(6) and as the question must be decided by the Tribunals of the State, they will be most likely to lean on the side of the State. 2. As far as the Union of the States it to be regarded as a league of sovereign powers, and not as a political Constitution by virtue of which they are become one sovereign power, so far it seems to follow from the doctrine of compacts, that a breach of any of the articles of the confederation by any of the parties to it, absolves the other parties from their respective obligations, and gives them a right if they chuse to exert it, of dissolving the Union altogether. 9. Multiplicity of laws in the several States. 9. In developing the evils which viciate the political system of the U.S. it is proper to include those which are found within the States individually, as well as those which directly affect the States collectively, since the former class have an indirect influence on the general malady and must not be overlooked in forming a compleat remedy.   Among the evils then of our situation may well be ranked the multiplicity of laws from which no State is exempt. As far as laws are necessary, to mark with precision the duties of those who are to obey them, and to take from those who are to administer them a discretion, which might be abused, their number is the price of liberty. As far as the laws exceed this limit, they are a nusance; a nusance of the most pestilent kind. Try the Codes of the several States by this test, and what a luxuriancy of legislation do they present. The short period of independency has filled as many pages as the century which preceded it. Every year, almost every session, adds a new volume. This may be the effect in part, but it can only be in part, of the situation in which the revolution has placed us. A review of the several codes will shew that every necessary and useful part of the least voluminous of them might be compressed into one tenth of the compass, and at the same time be rendered tenfold as perspicuous. 10. Mutability of the laws of the States. 10. This evil is intimately connected with the former yet deserves a distinct notice, as it emphatically denotes a vicious legislation. We daily see laws repealed or superseded, before any trial can have been made of their merits; and even before a knowledge of them can have reached the remoter districts within which they were to operate. In the regulations of trade this instability becomes a snare not only to our citizens but to foreigners also. 11. Injustice of the laws of States. 11. If the multiplicity and mutability of laws prove a want of wisdom, their injustice betrays a defect still more alarming: more alarming not merely because it is a greater evil in itself, but because it brings more into question the fundamental principle of republican Government, that the majority who rule in such Governments, are the safest Guardians both of public Good and of private rights. To what causes is this evil to be ascribed? These causes lie 1. in theRepresentative bodies. 2. in the people themselves. 1. Representative appointments are sought from 3 motives. 1. ambition. 2. personal interest. 3. public good. Unhappily the two first are proved by experience to be most prevalent. Hence the candidates who feel them, particularly, the second, are most industrious, and most successful in pursuing their object: and forming often a majority in the legislative Councils, with interested views, contrary to the interest, and views, of their Constituents, join in a perfidious sacrifice of the latter to the former. A succeeding election it might be supposed, would displace the offenders, and repair the mischief. But how easily are base and selfish measures, masked by pretexts of public good and apparent expediency? How frequently will a repetition of the same   arts and industry which succeeded in the first instance, again prevail on the unwary to misplace their confidence? How frequently too will the honest but unenligh[t]ened representative be the dupe of a favorite leader, veiling his selfish views under the professions of public good, and varnishing his sophistical arguments with the glowing colours of popular eloquence? 2. A still more fatal if not more frequent cause lies among the people themselves. All civilized societies are divided into different interests and factions, as they happen to be creditors or debtors---;Rich or poor---;husbandmen, merchants or manufacturers---;members of different religious sects---;followers of different political leaders---; inhabitants of different districts---;owners of different kinds of property &c &c. In republican Government the majority however composed, ultimately give the law. Whenever therefore an apparent interest or common passion unites a majority what is to restrain them from unjust violations of the rights and interests of the minority, or of individuals? Three motives only 1. a prudent regard to their own good as involved in the general and permanent good of the Community. This consideration, although of decisive weight in itself, is found by experience to be too often unheeded. It is too often forgotten, by nations as well as by individuals that honesty is the best policy. 2dly. respect for character. However strong this motive may be in individuals, it is considered as very insufficient to restrain them from injustice. In a multitude its efficacy is diminished in proportion to the number which is to share the praise or the blame. Besides, as it has reference to public opinion, which within a particular Society, is the opinion of the majority, the standard is fixed by those whose conduct is to be measured by it. The public opinion without the Society, will be little respected by the people at large of any Country. Individuals of extended views, and of national pride, may bring the publicproceedings to this standard, but the example will never be followed by the multitude. Is it to be imagined that an ordinary citizen or even assembly-man of R. Island in estimating the policy of paper money, ever considered or cared, in what light the measure would be viewed in France or Holland; or even in Massts or Connect.? It was a sufficient temptation to both that it was for their interest: it was a sufficient sanction to the latter that it was popular in the State; to the former that it was so in the neighbourhood. 3dly. will Religion the only remaining motive be a sufficient restraint? It is not pretended to be such on men individually considered. Will its effect be greater on them considered in an aggregate view? quite the reverse. The conduct of every popular assembly acting on oath, the strongest of religious Ties, proves that individuals join without remorse in acts, against which their consciences would revolt if proposed to them under the like sanction, separately in their closets. When indeed Religion is kindled into enthusiasm, its   force like that of other passions, is increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary state of religion, and while it lasts will hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm of Government. Besides as religion in its coolest state, is not infallible, it may become a motive to oppression as well as a restraint from injustice. Place three individuals in a situation wherein the interest of each depends on the voice of the others, and give to two of them an interest opposed to the rights of the third? Will the latter be secure? The prudence of every man would shun the danger. The rules & forms of justice suppose & guard against it. Will two thousand in a like situation be less likely to encroach on the rights of one thousand? The contrary is witnessed by the notorious factions & oppressions which take place in corporate towns limited as the opportunities are, and in little republics when uncontrouled by apprehensions of external danger. If an enlargement of the sphere is found to lessen the insecurity of private rights, it is not because the impulse of a common interest or passion is less predominant in this case with the majority; but because a common interest or passion is less apt to be felt and the requisite combinations less easy to be formed by a great than by a small number. The Society becomes broken into a greater variety of interests, of pursuits, of passions, which check each other, whilst those who may feel a common sentiment have less opportunity of communication and concert. It may be inferred that the inconveniences of popular States contrary to the prevailing Theory, are in proportion not to the extent, but to the narrowness of their limits.(7) The great desideratum in Government is such a modification of the Sovereignty as will render it sufficiently neutral between the different interests and factions, to controul one part of the Society from invading the rights of another, and at the same time sufficiently controuled itself, from setting upan interest adverse to that of the whole Society. In absolute Monarchies, the prince is sufficiently, neutral towards his subjec+ts, but frequently sacrifices their happiness to his ambition or his avarice. In small Republics, the sovereign will is sufficiently countrouled from such a Sacrifice of the entire Society, but is not sufficiently neutral towards the parts composing it. As a limited Monarchy tempers the evils of an absolute one; so an extensive Republic meliorates the administration of a small Republic. An auxiliary desideratum for melioration of the Republican form is such a process of elections as will most certainly extract from the mass of the Society the purest and noblest characters which it contains; such as will at once feel most strongly the proper motives to pursue the end of their appointment, and be most capable to devise the proper means of attaining it. 12. Impotence of the laws of the States.  ""

 My dear Sir New York May 1. 1787. The result of a consultation between Mr. Madison and myself was that your furniture be shipped to the care of Colo Josiah Parker at Norfolk, the chance of an early opportunity directly to Fredericksburg being but precarious---;the measure has accordingly been put into  May 2, 1787  practice as the inclosed papers shew. The certificate of the articles being manufactured here, is to exempt you from the duties upon foreign goods. I have written to Colo. Parker and requested him to receive and forward the consigned property to you, and also to advance the freight in your account---;his good disposition to serve his friends ensures you the full observance of the request, and I hope you will receive the furniture in good order. If you can dispose of this adventure so as to serve yourself, you may at this time replace it with much better articles at prices at least as low, and perhaps lower. Should you adopt this measure we shall be happy to aid you in carrying into execution that part which is to be done here. I am favoured with yours of the 10th Ult. I am happy that you have participated in the use of my Books with my Nephew, they are of no use to me where they are, nor is it worth while to bring them here. They will remain at your service for Several terms. I will attend to your request as to the Laws of the several states, and I beg you to command me freely in all cases where I can be useful to you.  The event of the Spotsylvania election as it respects you, secures my first and most anxious wish, in this annual business. I at the same time cannot but confess my regret that it should exclude from the Assembly a man of Mr. Pages(1) probity, good sense and fortune, nor can I forbear to express the flattering anticipations I have Conceived of the public good which will result from the services of your Collegue. He is a young Man of whom I have really received favourable impressions. It seems you will have to combat the wicked attempts of the paper money faction, and I hope you will procure a second triumph over that desperate band. We have it here that Mr. Henry has brought over the people of his County to the measure---;if so, I fear the disorder will extend through the southern parts of the state, so as to render the success of an opposition to him precarious. Yoursituation at Richmond enables you to give me some information upon this point. Be good enough to present me to Mrs. M. and believe me to be with great affection, Your Most Obt Servt., Ed.

 Dear Sir Philada.(1) May 5th. 1787 When I left N. York which was on Thursday last nothing had been done in the business which you had particularly at heart. A motion was made soon after you left us, to the effect which you urged. It was referred to the department to which the subject of it belonged. The report disapproved of the expedient and it was found needless to pursue it farther in Congress.(2) The next proposition was that the invalidity of the unconstitutional vote, should be declared, as an instruction to the proper department. To the admission of this proposition, the rule formerly entered into, was urged in bar. It was then proposed that the rule should be repealed. This also was refused by those whose concurrence in so thin a Congs. was necessary. No final vote therefore was taken on any of the motions, and in this State I left the matter.(3) Whether any further attempt will be made in the present thin state of Congs. or when a full Congs. will be together, are questions which I can not answer. Most of the other business remained in the state you left it.(4) I shall not return to N. York before the meeting of the Convention which is to commence on Monday week. Maryland has appointed  May 5, 1787  deputies to this assembly. R. Island had refused to appt. before you set out from N. York. Connecticut has not yet decided on the subject. All the other States as you know have concurred. With sincere esteem & regard I am Dear Sir, Your mo. obt. hb[e Servt?] Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Hond. Sir. New York May 13th. 1787. I recd Yours enclosing a letter to General Parsons which I delivered to him & another to Mrs Verplank and was happy to hear that You and the family were all well. May 13, 1787  I have been very busily employed since You and Mr Thomson left town,(1) and had I been more accustomed to do the business, I should have enjoyed more pleasure in discharging my duty. But I believe that I have made no mistakes, and have the satisfaction to be told that I do it very well. The ordinance for appointing a board of Commissioners to settle the public Accounts & the proceedings on the motion for adjournment have been the most perplexing(2)---;and some of my friends anticipating my wishes, were kind enough to advise & assist me. On Monday last 9 States were represented, by the return of Mr Mitchell from Delaware. On Tuesday the first trial of power appeared by a Motion for the repeal of the order of Sept. 1st, 1786, respecting the operation of the previous Question. This was effected on Thursday following---;& succeeded by Mr Kearny's motion for Adjournment.(3) The debates continued till four oClock---;& the Jersey Members, being a little impatient, having gone to dine, prevented any decision. The next morning opened with the Mississippi business on the application of Mr Jay for express instructions.(4) After long debates the letter was referred to a Committee of 5. Between three and four oClock---;the Motion for adjour[n]ment was taken up. After some warm and animated speeches by the Minority, Mr K---;---;(5) observed, that if the Majority were determined, nolens et volens, to carry the Question, he should request time to prepare a motion to lay before the house, and if he found them not liberal enough to grant the indulgence he should demand it in right of his State. He was frank enough to declare, that it was his opinion that the house hadn't power by the confederation to adjourn for any period beyond a certain time without appointing a Committee of the States, and as 9 States were necessary to empower the Committee, he should prepare his business for the house to decide upon. This produced much altercation, during this, the State of New Jersey was unrepresented and MrS---;---;n(6) was not to be found. Then the Majority had their fears, and Mr Pet---;---;t,(7) in his place, observed---;that if he was supported by his colleagues he should require the matter to be postponed until tomorrow in right of his State. The impropriety of this step aroused the minority, & some of the warmest expressions fell from some of the Gentlemen that I have ever heard---;and in the midst of the confusion---;Adjourn, Adjourn was cried---;and carried---;and left the business as it was taken up. I[t] appears that the Majority were confident of success and Mr Sch---;---;n had requested the ferry boat to wait for him to a certain time. This having elapsed, he made the best of his way fearing a disappointment---;and left his friends to lament his absence, and the loss of their cause.(8)   How many States will be present tomorrow is uncertain.(9) Mr Few went on to Philadelphia yesterday, and it was thought that some other Gentlemen would leave town. How the fact is I am not able to say. Another vessel is arrived from Bermuda, but no letters from Mr Johnson. Mr Dickinson informs me that neither of these will return again. He expects one every day which he shall order back immediately.

 My dear Sir,(1) New York, May 19th, 1787. Your [Letter o]f the 9th I received sever[al] days ago. This Morning I was presented with a view of your Letter to Webb, in which you inform him that eight States had met, but, do not say what States they are. I wish much to be with you, but Schemmerhorn has not yet made his appearance; and untill he arrives with my credentials,(2) it will be in vain for me to go on. Pray are there any Members with you in my predicament? May 19, 1787  The Convention is much talked of here, and various are the conjectures about the alterations that will probably take place in the fOEderal Government. You are, I find, for having matters highly toned. I am for powers equal to a prompt and certain execution, but tempered with a proper respect for the liberties of the People. I am for securing their happiness, not by the will of a few, but by the direction of the Law. Upon whatever principles a Government is founded, whether rights are equally distributed among the People at large, or among a few, some respect ought to be paid to the temper of the People, as produced by one or the other of these rights. To depart from the general freedom of our Governments, which act by given Laws, and [. . .] to step into a Monarchy, which will at times be despotic, would plunge the States into a tumult infintely worse than anarchy itself: torrents of blood would follow the confusion. I maintain that it would be even dangerous too suddenly to abolish the State inquisition of Venice. Mankind may be fashioned in some measure to any kind of Government, and when changes are necessary, they should be brought about gradually, keeping in view some of the original principles to which they have been accustomed. From this you may learn, that I am not for a total change of the Commonwealth. Fortunate indeed would be that People who could live under a Government that would operate only by fixed and established Laws, and not be made liable to obey the will of a Body independent of the Government itself. It is a matter of doubt with me whether any expedient (by which I would be understood to mean anything that is extraneous) ought ever to be practised by a People desirous of living under a well regulated system of Laws. The creation of power not recognized by the constitution is ever dangerous to liberty. The exercise of the dictatorial power in Rome was inconsistent with their commonwealth; the creation of Prators, of Tribunes, of the Decemvirs &c. gave such anunsettled Spirit to the People, that they were never satisfyed but when they were in pursuit of expedients to suit the various situations to which they were constantly shifting. Unless we can settle down into some permanent system very shortly, our condition will be as fickle and inconstant, as that of the Romans; and our political schemes be nothing more than chimeras and disorders. Now sir the great point---;shall we be three confederated Republic's or not? I leave you to examine the interrogatory. Mrs. Pierce joins me in the most respectful compliments to Mrs. Turner. I am dear Sir, Yours very affy, Wm. Pierce [P.S.] The Statesman & the Phylosopher have their attention turned towards us: the oppressed and wretched look to America. May 20, 1787  ""

By the inclosed Papers your Excellency will be informed that some part of the debt due from Bryan Ward of Georgia to the State of North Carolina for the Goods by me sold him has been by him paid to Mr. George Ogg in Deerskins which have been shiped to this place and sold by my Order on account of the State by Mr. John Ramsay at three Months Credit.(1) You will also be informed that I have caused nearly the whole of the Mony or more truly the Note of Hand of the Purchasers at three Months arising from the Sales of the Skins to be laid out in good Hyson Tea and in what manner I have directed it to be disposed of. My Wish was that Tea should be shiped to the amount of the Sales but as the Shipers would not break a Box they could not ship to the exact amount and upon Reflection that I had made this Shipment without Order from the State and being no Stranger to the Liberties many People would indulge themselves in if it should be lost, I have caused it to be insured which will nearly balance the account. Your Excellency will I make no doubt recollect that I had given Orders to Mr. Ogg to ship these Skins to Stewart and Barr at Philadelphia but last Winter while the Delaware was closed with Ice I thought it would be most beneficial to the State to order them to this place which I accordingly did. A Desire to render every Transaction of mine as beneficial as possible to the State has induced me to order the Mony arising from the Sales of the Skins to be laid out in the aforementioned Teas, a Motive that I hope will justafy the Act be the Loss or Gain what it may, tho' Loss there cannot be unless the Ship is lost and the Insurers fail. I have endeavoured to put the whole of this Transaction in so clear a point of Light that I hope the Tongue even of Malevolence itself will be compeled to confess that I have no other Interest in it than that of a Citizen in general. This Remark I should have thought unnecessary if my  May 20, 1787  Conduct as an Agent for the State to the Treaties with the Indians at Hopewell had been treated with the Candour it deserved. If this Transaction should meet the Approbation of your Excellency it will be particularly pleasing to Your most obedient Humble servant, Wm Blount ""

 Dr Sir N York May 22d 1787 The adjustment of the demands of the several States against Union is a subject which has very often engaged the attention of Congress---;but the more they have entered into that business the more they have been convinced that it is utterly impracticable for that body to agree upon rules for the admission of accounts that are not covered by existing resolutions of Congress. They are however convinced that by farr the greater part of those demands are founded in justice. In Order therefore to bring that business to a close they have agreed to the inclosed Ordinance(1) which in its opperation is to bring all the accounts into the view of three grand Commissioners who are to have a chancery & equitable power to admit all demands of States against the Union which they think in justice and equity ought to be allowed---;and  May 22, 1787  they are to be sworn to the performance of their duty---;in fact they are a kind of arbitrators between the States and are without any interference of Congress (other than the rule of apportionment or valuation) to report the ultimate state of the Ballances between the several States. So farr as I have been able to examine this subject this appears to me to be the only plan on which Massachusetts can ever expect to obtain justice for those great exertions she has so frequently made for the benefit of the Union, especally as some of her principal demands are not sanctioned by Congressional resolves.  I have by this post written to Messrs. Deming & Bowyer(2) on the subject that they may have notice in season to be preparing their accounts. I have been informed that they have the accounts of the late Treasurer to examine---;if so it will be a great enterruption, & as this is a business of such consequence to the State; allmost every thing should give way to it. I wish you to call upon them & converse with them upon it---;and if more Clerks are necessary do get the Legislature to allow them. It seems at present to be the disposition of Congress to appoint Men of note in the Union and of liberal sentiments---;which I think affords encouragment that we shall have justic[e] done us. Upon examining our Commission for the Convention we find that three are required as the number to represent the State---;and no Gentleman having come forward but Mr King & myself. He is gone to Philadelphia & I continued here in order if possible to keep a Congress. I have been daily in hopes of seing Mr Dana or Mr Gerry or both. However as Congress cannot be kept up at present I shall set of[f] for Phia tomorrow or next day in hopes that some of the other Gentm will soon be after me. The business of the convention is of the last importance for if the meeting or its doings should prove abortive. The present phantom of a Government must soon expire---;if those Gentm. have not set of[f] do speak tothem & let them know that by the Commission three are necessary. I am extreamly desirous of attending the Legislature at least some part of the next Session. I have therefore to beg you to get a resolve impowering two to represent the State in the convention---;& if any of the Gentm. in the present Commission cannot attend do get others appointed in their room.  I must beg your pardon for all this trouble & remain your Friend & Humble Servant, Nathaniel Gorham ""

 Dear Sir 24th. May 1787. I am much obliged by your kind favor and am sorry I have little to communicate from this quarter worth your acceptance; We have been a caput mortuum for some time past except the little flurry that was kicked up about Philada.(1) Carrington I presume has giv'n you full information on that point; during the contest, the Enemy wanted to raise a mutiny in our camp by proposing to go to Georgetown at a certain time. They were answered, they had served us so once before. Since the matter has blow'n over, some particular gentlemen have offered to join us in getting Georgetown fixed as the capital of the fOEderal Empire: they say they will vote money for the buildings, & in every respect make the compact as irrevocable as the nature of the case will admit of provided we will agree to stay here a reasonable time untill every thing is made proper for their reception. I am not certain when all the Eastern States come forward, but some good may come out of this, provided we act with delicacy & caution. Most of the foreigners who come among us, say the sessions of Congress should be fixed by national compact; I think they are right in their reasoning with respect to all such governments as ours. The arguments are too obvious to be mentioned to you. We have a right to it at Georgetown: & ought in justice to get it.  Entre nouz. I believe the Eastern people have taken ground they will not depart from respecting the Convention. One legislature composed of a lower-house biennially elected and an Executive & Senate for a good number of years. I shall see Gerry & Johnson, as they pass & may perhaps give you a hint. Since your departure Maryld. has openly declared agt. the Missisippi. It is therefore of the utmost importance that So. Carolina should think right on the subject. Parker who comes in in Nov. next is firm---;& Mr. Kean from his bad State of health will not in all probability attend.(2) We have lately had a new farce wrote by Poet Tyler, calledMay day. It has plott & incident and is as good as several of the English farces; It has however not succeeded well, owing I believe to the Author's making his principal character a scold; Some of the New York ladies were alarmed for fear strangers should look upon Mrs. Surdus as the model of the gentlewomen of this place.(3) Inclosed is a letter from France which was handed to me by a Mr. Walton who came over in the packett.(4) All my family present their complimts. to yourself & the worthy family where you live: Alfred laments your absence in very pathetic though I believe very interested  May 24, 1787  strains.

 Dear Sir, N York May 29th. 1787. Your favor has duly come to hand and for which I am much obliged. Since my last(1) I have very little to acquaint you with in the way of news. The draught made from Congress of members for the Convention has made them very thin & no business of course is going on here. I do not believe that this will be the case untill that body shall be dissolved, which I hardly think will be the case these three Months. What will be the result of their meeting I cannot with any certainty determine, but I hardly think much good can come of it. The people of America don't appear to me to be ripe for any great innovations & it seems they are ultimately to ratify or reject. The weight of Genl. Washington as you justly observe is very great in America, but I hardly think it is sufficient to induce the people to pay money or part with power.  The delegates from the Eastwd. are for a very strong government, & wish to prostrate all the State legislatures, & form a general system out of the whole; but I don't learn that the people are with them, on the contrary in Massachuzets they think that government too strong, & are about rebelling again, for the purpose of making it more democratical. In Connecticut they have rejected the requisition for the present year decidedly, & no Man there would be elected to the office of a constable if he was to declare that he meant to pay a copper towards the domestic debt. R. Island has refused to send members. The cry  May 30, 1787  there is for a good government after they have paid their debts in depreciated paper: first demolish the Philistines (i.e. their Creditors) & then for propriety. N Hamshire has not paid a shilling, since peace, & does not ever mean to pay one to all eternity: if it was Attempted to tax the people for the domestic debt 500 Shays would arise in a fortnight. In N. York they pay well because they can do it by plundering N Jersey & Connecticut. Jersey will go great lengths, from motives of revenge and Interest. Pensylvany will join provided you let the sessions of the Executive of America be fixed in Philada. & give her other advantages in trade to compensate for the loss of State power. I shall make no observations on the southern States, but I think they will be (perhaps from different motives) as little disposed to part with efficient power as any in the Union. I have lately been at the Sycamore. They are all perfectly well at present, though the Captain had a severe attack last week; he was seized with a fit suddenly & alarmed the family extremely. Mrs. Heiliger is really a fine woman, and I think after she gets over the death of her husband a little more will be of great service to the family; She I hope will have influence enough to drag Esther into the World, which at the same time will be of no small service to Maria her sister. They have been completely buried since your departure. I understand a vacancy is expected in the Court of Chancery & perhaps in the Genl. Court. You know best. I wish you to speak to Mr. Jones on the subject and any other of your friends on my behalf, as from yourself if you approve my being appointed witht. mentioning my having said a word to you on the matter. I would prefer being in the Chancery by a great deal of odds. My best respects to my worthy friend Mrs. Monro, I hope you are well, & I heartily wish you may thrive in the pursuit of the law; when I come into the State I think I can help you among[s]t my oldclients.

The absence of the Secretary of Congress, for several weeks past, I presume, has been the occasion of this resolution's not being officially transmitted in the Common Course of doing business in his office. I yesterday saw Mr. Hutchins one of the Commissioners appointed to run the Jurisdiction line, between Massachusetts and New York, on the subject of the appointment,(3) he informed me, that the Commissioners will be ready to attend that business by the middle of June next---;and one of the Delegates of New York informed me, that the agents appointed by that State will be ready to attend the Commissioners at that time.

It is generally thought, probable, that the Convention will continue setting for some months---; and it seems to be uncertain whether either of those gentlemen can attend Congress while the Convention shall be setting. As not less than two Delegates can represent the State in Congress, and my being here alone can be therefore of no service, I take the liberty of suggesting to Your Excellency, that I shall conceive it proper for me, and my duty, in a few days from this, to return to Massachusetts and be at home, 'till some one of the deleg[ates] of the State can Join with me in making a representation of it in Congress, unless I shall hear that Dr. Holten has rec[overed] his health, and will probably come on soon to New York.

You will recollect that I before informed you that I had requested the Governor to furnish the Delegation with authenticated Certificates of the Exports of the Produce of North Carolina for the years 85 & 86.(1) June 3, 1787  In reply to this request the Governor informed me that it should be done but as yet no such Certificates have made their appearance here. And Mr. DeLaforest says this Certificate is indispensible to the insuring [successfully] to the Contract for how[ever] desirous he may be to serve individuals he must speak on the Subject in a National Sense and this he can't do unless he has authentic Documents to show the Court the very large Exports made by North Carolina of Naval Stores and the advantage it would be to France to take it by Contract directly from the State in which it is made and adds that the Marine of France would be more apt to give a Contract to No. Carolina or her Citizens than to any other State because France never has yet done anything for No. Carolina. Mr. DeLaforest appears much disposed to serve us and I am sure will do every thing in his power to place such a Contract in so advantageous a View to his Nation as to insure it if in his power---;For this we are chiefly indebted to Hawkins. Mr. Otto the Charge des Affairs of France spoke to me about this proposed Contract about two days past and said he hoped to see it take place---;For my part I feel not any doubt from my certain Knowledge that the French mean and wish to push a Trade with America but [a] Contract may be made for the annual delivery of a few thousand Barrells for as many as three Years at Brest at a good price. When the Samples go to France which is needless untill they are accompani'd by the afore-mentioned Certificate it is Necessary that the Terms of Proposals should at the same Time be sent to the Marine of France in which must be clearly expressed the Time and place of Delivery, the price, when & how paid and that No duties shall be paid in France neither on the Naval Stores nor the Vessels on which they are freighted and the Bottoms in which they shall be shiped say French or American---;there must also be sent one of the Certificates of the Governor showing who J.

Rhode Island has not yet acceded to the measure. As their Legislature meet very frequently, and can at any time be got together in a week, it is possible that caprice if no other motive may yet produce a unanimity of the States in this experiment. \""In furnishing you with this list of names, I have exhausted all the means which I can make use of for gratifying your curiosity.

The names of the members will satisfy you that the States have been serious in this business. The attendance of Genl. Washington is a proof of the light in which he regards it. The whole Community is big with expectation. And there can be no doubt but that the result will in some way or other have a powerful effect on our destiny. \""Mr. Adams' Book(3) which has been in your hands of course, has excited a good deal of attention.

Men of learning find nothing new in it. Men of taste many things to criticize. And men without either not a few things, which they will not understand. It will nevertheless be read, and praised, and become a powerful engine informing the public opinion. The name & character of the Author, with the critical situation of our affairs, naturally account for such an effect. The book also has merit, and I wish many of the remarks in it, which are unfriendly to republicanism, may not receive fresh weight from the operations of our Governments. \""I learn from Virga. that the appetite for paper money grows stronger every day.

 Sir.(1) New york June 8th. 1787 I have to ask pardon for my omission in writing last week, and now beg leave to reply to your letters of the 19h & 28h of May.(2) The first relates to the detention of the indents for 86 & 87.(3) We feel very much distressed to know that our country is groaning under injurys, which we have no opportunity to attempt to releive her from. The remedy being solely in Congress and that body being for the present out of session. The board of treasury are merely executive, and dare not exercise the power of altering resolutions committed to their conduct.  The scheme of indents originated for the purpose of enabling the public to discharge the interest of the domestic debt, & is marked by  June 8, 1787  three conditions which seem clearly to explain the natural operation & effect of this branch of the revenue system---;viz---;That indents shall be issued only to such state or states as may have passed the requisition, providing for its payment, adequate funds---;That the payment of indents shall be in proportion to the payment of specie, & that they shall be receivable only in discharge of the requisition of the year, to which they were allotted. From the first condition it follows that indents cannot be issued to any state whose compliance with the requisition is not substantial and effective. If then the act of the Legislature of Virginia passed in the last session, is only a compliance in name, the board of treasury are bound to withhold the indents for the present year. If on the contrary the compliance is effective, the board has criminally neglected their duty, & deeply injured the state. The act of the assembly has been laid before congress, & will be the subject of their deliberation as soon as they re-assemble. Certain it is that our country has been grossly injured, & that the injury is attributable either to the Legislature, or to the board of treasury. The detention of the indents for the year '86 is authorized by the last of the three recited conditions, for the receipt of indents issued on the requisition of the 27h Septr. 85 is only admissible in payment of the taxes of that year & in the specified ballances stated in the resolve of the 12h Oct. of the same year, it being a fundamental principle of the revenue system that distinct appropriations shall be established for the redemption of indents issued on distinct requisitions. The letr. of the 28h respects the pay of the third commissioner appointed in conformity to the resolve of Congress for adjusting the claims of Virginia against the union, for moneys expended and services performed in the conquest & protection of the western territory. We communicated the purport of this letr. to theboard of treasury, who in compliance with our wishes have been pleased to issue their order for two hundred dollars, in favor of the commissioner, determining to unite with the state in advances of money to this officer, untill the decision of Congress shall be had on the subject. This we trust will prevent any interruption in the concluding a business, which has already too long been neglected.

 Dear Sir. New York June the 9. 1787. By the last post I received your's of the 3d inst.(1) with the two letters inclosed which I forwarded to your son---;(you mention that Mr. Jackson proposes going in person to Aux Cayes). I wrote you in my last that we had given your Statement relative to your affairs with Wethered, at that place, to Mr. Jay and as soon as we could obtain his opinion I would give you his sentiments as well as our own on the subject agreeable to your request. I have since consulted him upon it. He is of opinion, and I think his opinion is well founded, that it will be advisable immediately to get an authentic Statement of the facts so as to establish the two most material facts---;that Wethered was a Citizen of the United States when he died---;and that his effects have been claimed under the Droit d'Aubaine. These facts established will lay the foundation for negociations with the Court of France, and for an explanation of the  June 9, 1787  treaty relative to the extent of our exemptions from the operations of this law or right of Escheatage. As soon as the material facts mentioned, can be authenticated Congress will, I conceive, as early as possible direct their minister at that Court, to pursue the proper measures for obtaining a true explanation of the part of the treaty in question. As to the proper construction of this part of the treaty I find different opinions are adopted. Mr. Otto seems to be of opinion that our privileges or exemptions from this law are limited to the Kingdom of France. Perhaps this opinion is countenanced by the mere words, by a literal limited construction of the article---;but Mr. Jay & other gentlemen, I believe, who have considered it on National principles and the principles of reciprocity, conceive the exceptions claimed, are as extensive as the subject of the treaty, Viz. the Dominions of France or territories subject to the most C. king, as well as the Dominions or territories of the United States. For construing this or any other National treaty, sensible and liberal negociators will always attend to the general ideas and objects of the parties. The contrary practice or conduct, that of adhering to the words or letter strictly, would, I am very confident, render three fourths of the treaties made in the present and last Centuries totally useless & inconsistent. As our Citizens can be relieved in the case in question, only by a fair explanation of the treaty, or by some new article; which can be obtained only by consent of the parties, it may not be of much importance now to adduce the reasons and authorities that may be suggested in favor of the construction of the treaty our Citizens are interested in claiming. However, then, when brought fairly into view, may have influence on the conduct of the French officers &c concerned in executing the alien law in contemplation. I do not feel myself able to furnish you with any, which have not already, probably, occurred to you, but as you request mysentiments on the subject, and my examination of it may, possibly, be of some service, I readily communicate to you the result of the few reflections which have occurred to me on this subject. From a careful examination of treaties, made in the present & last Centuries, I find this position clear; that very little attention has been paid by negociators to the accurate and proper use of words, especially those signifying territories, or the whole or part of the nations dominions &c. A little attention to this will shew the glaring impropriety of confining ourselves to mere words in treaties. The words---;France---;Spain---;England---;Holland &c. it is well known, literally construed, convey only the ideas of certain limited tracts of Countries, being but a part of the French, Spanish, British, & Dutch Dominions. Yet in many treaties, and in a multitude of instances, those words only, are used where the subject and the conception was clearly the national body politic, government, Dominions, &c. This was remarkably the Case in the treaties of the Cromwells---;Louis 14 &c. In the treaty of 1655 be-  tween the British and French Nations---;the parties say \""if any prince make war on France or England they will join their forces,\"" & they say, \""English ships may lade in any of the dominions of France\"" & the next Art. Englishmen \""dying in France\"" shall not be subject to the Droit d. Aubaine, &c. They speak of the enemy of France---;Enemy of England---;king of France---;king of Spain---;king of England, &c. repeatedly in this and other treaties, when binding the respective Nations. Literally speaking, there was no king of England---;no king of France, could be no enemy of England or enemy of France---;in the treaty of 1678 Between the French & Dutch Nations. The parties say---;\""the subjects of each party in the Dominions of the other\"" shall be exempt from the law of Aubaine & other similar duties. Here it may be observed the exemption and expression were coextensive with the subject or reason of the Case---;but in the same treaty they say \""if any breach shall happen between France & Holland then &c\""---; France here must mean something more than a certain tract of Country called France, apart of the French Dominions or of the French Nation---;and were it not a fact---;one would hardly conceive a Dutch negociator would use the world [word] Holland, the name of a single province, to convey the idea of his nation. In the treaty of Utrecht between the British & French Nations---;the parties say there shall be liberty of Commerce between their subjects in all their kingdoms, States, Dominions & provinces in Europe. But by the 8 & 13 arts it is clear the respective subjects in their enjoying the benefits of the most favored Nation and exemptions from the law of Aubain are not confined to the kingdoms &c in Europe. The first they have expressly \""in all Countries & places subject to either power\""---;the last \""within the Dominions and any other places belonging to the Queen of Gr. Britain and to the Most Ch. King.\"" It may deserve notice that this treatymakes those benefits and exemptions more extensive than the liberty of trade. The words kingdoms in Europe, Countries in Europe, Dominions in Europe have been used with more attention, and meaning, but in several Cases the words in Europe have been clearly inadvertently inserted---;and relative to the law of Aubaine or alienage the restrictive words, \""in Europe\"" are used in but very few treaties, and, I believe, in none with any particular meaning unless they are in the family Compact of 1761. In that the words, in France, in Spain, in the Spanish Dominions in Europe---;in the two kingdoms in Europe seem to be repeated with a meaning---;when speaking at will of the subject of the treaty as of the exemptions from that law---;tis possible the French may urge this as a reason for a limited construction of our treaty---;but there is a clear distinction in the words & principles of the two treaties which I shall mention hereafter. We are naturally led to examine our treaty with France and other treaties in point---;to consider the objects and views of the parties---;the   reasons of the several Stipulations---;and to draw our conclusions not from words merely, but from words taken in connexion with the objects which probably existed in the minds of the parties. Our treaty with France is a treaty of \""Amity and Commerce for founding Commerce on reciprocal utility, and the Just rules of free Intercorse.\"" The treaty throughout preserves this idea of liberality and reciprocity except in a limited expression in the 4 art. and one in the 13th art. In the 4 it is said we are to enjoy in the kings ports &c in Europe---;the privileges and exemptions of the most favored Nations---;why are the words \""in Europe\"" inserted? In allowing the benefits allowed to other nations the most favored I see no such distinction [with] treaties made before this. The French enjoy those benefits in all our ports and Dominions---;and if she admit other nations to her ports, &c not in Europe, freely, or on certain terms, why not our Citizens on the same conditions? These words \""in Europe\"" I confess puzzle me; if they mean any thing, they mean a vast deal---;the benefits allowed the most favored Nations are extremely indefinite at best, and when secured without limitation, they are of no great importance; for the Nation granting them may make any commercial or other restrictions she pleases, provided they operate equally on those called favored---;as to these benefits in the french European ports, so many Nations enjoy them, and even without treaties, that when we obtain them only, or a share in them, we get but very little---;and if we cannot claim these in her Colonial ports, the other Nations may, where is the equality of the treaty? As she has, I believe, inserted these restric[t]ive words, also in some of her late treaties perhaps She means to insist on the limited construction of this Art---;and her officers may attempt to make use of it in construing the 13th Art---;tho I think not with much reason even admitting the limited meaning of the (4th art). By the 13th art the inhabitantsof the Un. States shall not be reputed Aubenes in France and shall be exempted from the droit d'Aubane, &c, and the French subjects are secured, in a perfect reciprocity in this respect in all the dominions of the U. States. What are we to understand by the words \""in France\"" is the question. Can they possibly have in this plan any literal meaning? Strictly what is France in the sense of treaties; Louis is King of France and Navarre, &c. The word France, as before observed, has been vagely used in treaties, and to make any sense of the treaties we must generally understand by it, the Dominions of France, the French Nation or territories subject to his most Ch. majesty. The word, therefore, having been thus used we are at liberty, to consider and construe it as will best agree with the reason of the case. The reflections which must occur on this subject are natural. They occur on a general view of society. The law, or custom in question, by which kings, &c., are authorised to seize the effects of Strangers dying in their dominions has never been the Gen-  eral law of Nations---;it grew up in barbarous times, when it was thought best to have little or no intercourse with foreigners and is totally opposed to the Commerce and liberality of modern times. It has long been almost a matter of Course in all commercial, and friendly treaties, to provide agt. the operations, severe and unusual effects of this law---;and tho in many treaties the liberties of free trade, have been limited, by the parties, to certain Countries, &c. Yet the exemptions from this law have, usually, been general, and extended to all their dominions. This was the Case in the Treaty of Utrecht before mentioned. By our treaty with the Dutch we cannot trade to their East and West India ports, &c. but by the 6 art we enjoy these exemptions in all their Dominions & our effects will pass to our heirs, &c. There is a like principle in the Swedish treaty---;the like may be seen in other treaties.  It is true in the family Compact this does not seem to be the Case. The liberties of trade, and these exemptions in it, appear to be limited to the French & Spanish European ports---;but it may be remarked that this singular treaty does not extend any commercial or other intercourse between the subjects of the two Nations beyond their European dominions and this was rather a treaty of offensive & defensive alliance than any thing else. The declared object of our treaty with France was Amity, Commerce and a perfect equality. It clearly admits an idea which must have very considerable weight in the Construction of it, even admitting the limited sense of the 4th art that we have no claims to trade to the French West Indies, &c. tho other nations should be admitted there---;independent of a fair constructive claim of reciprocity in this respect. The treaty admits the fact that our Citizens on the liberal principles of intercourse with all French subjects, may be and have property in all French ports as well in those that are not called free as those that are---;by the19th the subjects of either party, may carry, freely, their prize effects &c. into all the ports, of the other, and depart with them when they please. The suggestion that we had no law of Aubene, and that therefore, this exemption on the part of France, was gratuitous and without an equivalent, does not appear to me to have much weight in it. The treaty when considered must appear clearly to have the same effect in this respect as to both parties. France gave up nothing; she resigned no effects of our Citizens; she stipulated only, that in future she would not seize the effects of our Citizens dying in her Dominions. We agreed to a perfect reciprocity; that is, Stipulated that we would not seize the effects of her subjects dying in our dominions. Tho we had no law of Aubene, we could at any time have made one if we had not been restrained by the treaty.  On the whole carefully considering the treaties and conduct of nations, especially in modern times, relative to this law, and the effects of deceased aliens, I think, it is clear, they readily and carefully, in general, guard against the operations of it---;that exemptions from it are usually as extensive as the dominions of the nation granting them, and if limited at all, to particular parts, it is only in a few Cases that may receive that construction---;that the exemptions in no Case are more limited than the liberties of trading & intercourse, but in most Cases, more extensive. These facts appear to me to be perfectly conformable to Reason and Justice. National policy may often dictate that a Sovereign may exclude some parts of his dominions to foreigners, and open to them other parts. Liberties and benefits in trade, to carry our goods to certain markets, and bring from thence what we want, are founded in mere principles of Interest, and with propriety may be more or less extensive according to existing circumstances. But when we are admitted into the ports of a friend with our property, freely, or on conditions, humanity, Justice, and every social principle seem to forbid the sovereign of them seizing the effects of those who may happen to die there. These and many other reasons, that may be urged, for extending the exemptions in question, the liberality of his most Ch. majesty on these subjects &c appear to me to make it highly probable, at least, that the treaty will receive the construction you wish for---;in Case it can be proved that Wethered when he died was a Citizen of the United States. In the late Division of the British Empire, Wethered might fall into either part, and avow his allegiance to G. Britain or to the united States, I should suppose his conduct in the early parts of the revolution must go far towards determining to which side he adhered.(3) Mr. King is in Philadelphia. The Convention seems to be setting in solemn silence---;we hear not a word fromthem---;we do not even conjecture what they will do. We all hope they will do something good, but I am confident you would feel, every day, extremely diverted to hear the various opinions circulating about what is called a good government, were you here or near the vortex of federal politics.

Finding that I had lost most of my plants through the inattention or ignorance of the Captain who had the care of them from North Carolina although I made repeated trials and the last with giving particular directions on the proper method of treating them: And fearing that similar inattention might prevent your receiving of them, I have taken the liberty of addressing the whole to M. le Comte de Buffon intendant du Jardin du Roi au Jardin du Roi a Paris: And in return for this liberty I have requested the favor of the Comte to divide the plants equally between you and himself. Mr. de la Forest do's not go to France as I expected but he, nevertheless, interests himself in the safety of the p[l]ants and has written to Monsieur de Mistral commissarie general de la Marine au ordonnateur au Havre, to forward with great care the box and four earthen pots in which they are contained. As soon as I can procure any of the seeds, I will send them as you have directed. The largest of the pots and the broken one is filled with the native soil. In the box and the other pots I laid a clay foundation, not having a sufficiency of the Native soil to fill them.

 Philada. June 10. 1787. \""I have been discouraged from answering sooner your favor of (1) by the bar which opposes such communications as I should incline not less to make than you must do to receive. One of the earliest rules established by the Convention restrained the members from any disclosure whatever of its proceedings, a restraint which will not probably be removed for some time. I think the rule was a prudent one not only as it will effectually secure the requisite freedom of discussion, but as it will save both the Convention and the Community from a thousand erroneous and perhaps mischievous reports. I feel notwithstanding great mortification in the disappointment it obliges me to throw on the curiosity of my friends. The Convention is now as full as we expect it to be unless a report should be  June 11, 1787  true that Rh. Island has it in contemplation to make one of the party. If her deputies should bring with them the complexion of the State, their company will not add much to our pleasure, or to the progress of the business. Eleven States are on the floor.

 Sir, New York June the 12th 1787. I had the honor of receiving the Secretary's letter of the 25th Ulto. accompanied with an extract from the Honble. Mr Sedgwick's letter of the 17th Ulto. both relative to the late conduct of the rebels, who have fled from Massachusetts into this State; and the former requesting the Delegates to communicate to his Excellency Governor Clinton the extracts of Mr. Sedgwick's letter. As my Colleagues were at Philadelphia, I immediately made that communication, and had some convirsation with Governor Clinton on the subject of it. I have since seen him and the Attorney General together on the same subject. They appeared to be clearly of opinion, that the laws of this State, take cognizance of the offences of those rebels, who, in armed parties, or in a hostile manner, make incursions into Massachusetts, or bring from that Commonwealth its Inhabitants, or their effects into this State, in the lawless manner mentioned, and amply to provide for the punishment of those offences; as also for the punishment of the Citizens of this State, who conceal, aid or encourage those incursions or hostile proceedings.(1) They appeared also to be fully impressed with a sense of the pernicious consequences of suffering men who seem to possess but imperfect ideas of the true principles, blessings and sacred rights of society, by time to acquire and Strengthen habits so hostile and injurious to order and good government. They assured me, the Ascertainment of facts only was wanting to this Government's taking prompt and effectual measures to prevent the further progress of the evils and crimes complained of. The rebels have connexions in this State, and no doubt, friends who conceal, protect and countenance them; but they are supposed to be so dispersed about in private families, and they, and their friends, so far concealed, that no military force, at present, can be brought to act, to  June 12, 1787  any valuable purpose against them. The best measures, therefore to be adopted, are supposed to be, those of decidedly carrying the laws of this State into execution, and to direct the Courts of law, Magistrates, Jurors, &c. as early as may be to ascertain facts, so as to form particular charges against individuals among the rebels and their abettors, guilty of the offences before mentioned, and to prosecute them without delay. Directions, I understand, were sometime since, given to this purpose, and will be further urged immediately. Information received from that part of the Country, upon examination, is often found to be erroneous, and for want of particular information of offences committed by known individuals, those Courts and Officers cannot, it seems, proceed effectually to punish them. Tho well disposed, there is, perhaps, in this, as in all, especially elective Governments popular or timid feelings in many Officers, that induce them to be less prompt in executing the laws against offenders in Cases like the present. As soon as charges can be fixed on individuals, they will, I am assured, be arrested, this must reduce the offenders to order and due obedience to Government, or force them to collect together; if the latter the magistrates have been assured of having a sufficient force immediately collected and ordered out to subdue opposition. The Government of this State appears to be disposed, to co-operate with the Government of Massachusetts on the present Occasion, and any evidence of facts, it was observed, tending to fix the crimes complained of, and cognizable by the laws of this State, upon the proper individuals, should receive every degree of Attention. Perhaps, officers and individuals in Massa. acquainted with the characters and particular crimes of these armed parties can furnish evidence of certain facts, So as to expedite the operation of the laws of this State. I conceive it is understood as well by this State, as by Massachusetts, that all the crimes committed in thisState are punishable by those laws, and that the perpetrators of crimes in Massachusetts, fleeing to this State, when charged and demanded on the principles of the Confederation, must be taken up by this State and conveyed to that. The Governor of this State has ample powers in the present Case---;and I feel Strongly impressed with this beleif, that every Government in the union must highly resent the conduct of armed parties, not only become open Enemies to the governments lately established by their's and the common consent of the people, but also mere robbers. Nor does it fail to excite the attention of those Governments to see men collected and armed against them, and attempting to give law in an extensive and Strong Country---;men well known to pay but little respect to rights and obligations, religious or civil, whose armed connexions seem to form their hopes and importance, & who may become very troublesome to the other parts of the Confederacy, if not early brought back to their duty.  With the Greatest Esteem and respect, I am your affect freind & Most Obedt. hum. servant, Nathn. Dane P.S. Conceiving that Governor Clinton has made lately official Communications to our Governor on this subject and given him all the information useful or important on it, in answer to our Governor's letter &c in my letter to Gov. Hancock(2) I have only mentioned that I made the communications requested, &c but lest the Case may be otherwise, I have thought it best to state to you and two or three friends in private letters these facts and any measures proper may be taken.

 Sir. New York June 12th. 1787. I do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency, the inclosed copy of a letter directed to the Delegates of the States, Massachusetts and New York, by the Commissioners appointed by Congress to run the Jurisdiction line between those States. This letter from the Commissioners was, yesterday, received in answer to a Joint letter of the Delegates of Massachusetts and New York of the 23d of April last, to those Commissioners upon this subject.(1) By this answer from the Commissioners it appears, that they have finally fixed on a later day for entering on the business of their appointment, than the middle of the present month, the time named by Mr. Hutchins,(2) one of them, when in New York a few days since, and of which I took an early opportunity to inform your Excellency. Had the Commencement of this business been earlier fixed upon and known, the Delegates would have improved the opportunity of giving more timely information of it. As two of the gentlemen, appointed agents by the Act of Massachusetts relative to this subject, live in the Westerly part of the State, and may need earlier notice than can well be obtained by the way of Boston, I transmitted to them also a copy of the Commissioner's letter. With the greatest respect, I am, your Excellency's Most Obedt. Humble Servant, Nathn. Dane P.S. The extracts from the Honble.

 Sir N. York. June 12th. 1787. Your letter of the 2nd of Instant inclosing the communications from Colo. Shelby, has been recieved, and shall be laid before Congress as soon as a sufficient number of States shall have assembled, so as to enable them to proceed to public business;(1) When this will be the case is altogether uncertain; many of the members of Congress are now attending at the Convention, & some of the States have not sent delegates either to the one or the other. It is much to be lamented that the desire of dismembering States prevails in so great a degree among the citizens of the Union; if a doctrine of this sort is allowed, it will go directly to the destruction of all government for if the right exists in the first instance it may be carried so far as to reduce a State to the size of a county or a parish. It was a great misfortune that the principle was not attacked in the instance of Vermont: they might have been crushed in the beginning; but they have been permitted in quietness to grow powerful, & to furnish a fatal example to the Union. There can be no doubt but the United States are bound to guaranty the limits of every State in the Confederation; their not interfering in the case alluded to, has subjected them to great inconveniences already; a very considerable body of people, residents of Vermont pay no taxes towards the support of the fOEderal government, neither are they in fact a part of the union; they also furnish a comfortable asylum to all those who are disposed to fly from taxation in the others. With respect to the State of N. Carolina it must be acknowledged they have acted with the greatest imprudence. After having giv'n up the country to the United States, & the government to the people they ought not afterwards [(]on the reassumption) to have expected a voluntary obedience.(2) I shall transmit a copy of your letter with the communications to our delegates in the Convention, although I believe they are already sufficiently impressed with thepropriety of defining in the most accurate manner, the limits of the States, as well as of providing an adequate remedy for the suppression of evils of this sort. By letters from a Mr. Syms in Kentucki, late a member of Congress for the State of N. Jersey, we are informed that the people at the  June 12, 1787  Kaskaskies & Post Vinc[en]t are in the most unsettled situation. They complain (& in my opinion with great justice) that Congress notwithstanding their frequent applications, has [(]ever since the cession of Virginia) suffered them to remain in a state of nature, with[ou]t law, government or protection; & they talk very strongly of becoming Spanish subjects.(3) I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Yr.

 Dear Sir, New York June 13. 1787 I am favoured with yours of the 10th Instant(1) and thank you for it. Be good enough to pay Major George Turner, if he is still in the City, Â£4.5.6 Pensylvania Currency, and, at your leisure, send me the balance of the 100 dollars by some freind who may be coming here. It will, however, be unnecessary for you to put yourself to the least inconvenience to do so. Nothing yet of the remittance from South Car- June 13, 1787  olina for our freind Monroe,(2) nor will the distribution of Mordicais effects take place until sometime in July. It is supposed that it will not exceed 5/. in the pound. Had the rules of the convention permitted communications from thence, you would have conferred an obligation by including me in the number of your correspondents upon the subjects of deliberation in that assembly. My curiosity is, however, perfectly suppressed by the propriety of the prohibition. Having matured your opinions and given them a collected form, they will be fairly presented to the public, and stand their own advocates---;but caught by detachments, and while indeed immature, they would be equally the victims of ignorance and misrepresentation. The public mind is now on the point of a favourable turn to the objects of your meeting,(3) and, being fairly met with the result, will, I am persuaded, eventually, embrace it. Being calculated for the permanent fitness, and not the momentary habits of the country, it may at first be viewed with hesitation, but derived and patronised as it will be, its influence must extend into an adoption as the present fabric gives way. The work once well done will be done forever, but patched up in accommodation to the whim of the day, it will soon require the hand of the cobbler again, and in every unfortunate experiment, the materials are rendered the less fit for that Monument of Civil liberty which we wish to erect. Constitute a federal Government, invigorate & check it well---;give it then independent powers over the Trade, the Revenues, and forces of the Union, and all things that involve any relationship to foreign powers---;give it also the revisal of all State Acts. Unless it possesses a compleat controul over the State Governments, the constant effort will be to resume the delegated powers, nor do I see what inducement the federal Sovereignty can have to negative an innocent act of a State. Constitute it in such shape that, its first principles being preserved, it will be agood republic. I wish to see that system have a fair experiment---;but let the liability to encroachments be rather from the federal, than the State, Governments. In the first case we shall insensibly glide into a Monarchy, in the latter nothing but Anarchy can be the consequence.  Some Gentlemen think of a total surrender of the State Sovereignties. I see not the necessity of that measure for giving us National Stability or consequence. The negative of the federal Sovereignty will effectually prevent the existence of any licentious or inconsiderate Act---;and I beleive that even under a Monarchy it would be found necessary thus to continue the local administrations. General Laws would operate many particular oppressions and a general legislature would be found incompetent to the formation of local ones. The Interests of the United States may be well combined for the Common   good---;but the affairs of so extensive a Country are not to be thrown into one mass. An attempt to confederate upon terms materially opposed to the particular Interests would in all probability occasion a dismemberment, and in that event, within a long time yet to come, the prospects of America will be at an end as to any degree of National importance, let her fate be what it may as to freedom or Vassalage. Be good enough to present me to your honourable Collegues and beleive me to be with the Utmost sincerity, Your affectionate Freind & Humble Servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 Philadelphia, June 18, 1787. \""It was with singular pleasure I saw your name(1) in the list of Representatives. I hope all the measures of your body will be dictated by the principles of honor and justice. Among the various subjects which will come before you, the requisition of Congress of the last year will undoubtedly be one. I hope you will excuse me for just suggesting to you, that I think it will be burdening the people to no essential purpose to comply with that requisition any further than applies to the cash part of it; not that I have any doubt of the justice and duty of paying the domestic debt; but it is in vain for Massachusetts alone to expect to support the public credit; for six or seven States have absolutely refused to comply with the one of the year before the last, and, of those who have complied in appearance, very few will make any effectual payments; and I presume there will not be any that will comply with the one that is now to be considered by you, excepting the cash part of it, and with that numbers will comply. In short, the present Federal Government seems near its exit; and whether we shall in the Convention be able to agree upon mending it, or forming and recommending a new one, is not certain. All agree, however, that much greater powers are necessary to be given, under some form or other. But the large States think the representation ought to be more in proportion to the magnitude of the States, and consequently more like a national government, while the smaller ones are for adhering to the present mode. We have hitherto considered the subject with great calmness and temper; and there are numbers of very able men in this body who all appear thoroughly alarmed with the present prospect. I do not know that I am at liberty to write anything on this subject. I shall therefore only observe further, that all agree the legislative and executive ought to be separate, and that there should be a national judiciary.\"" June 18, 1787  MS not found; reprinted from Theophilus Parsons, Memoir of Theophilus Parsons, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (Boston: Tichnor and Fields, 1859), pp. 461--;62. 1 Parsons was identified in these Letters, 20:143n.

 Sir New York June 18th 1787 The enclosed address, of which I presume your excellency has receved a duplicate, was returned to me, from N York, after my arrival in this State.(1) I flattered myself that our Legislature, which convened on Monday last, would have receded from the resolution therein referred to, and have complied with the recommendation of Congress in sending delegates to the Federal Convention. The Upper house or Governor & Council, embraced the measure, but it was negatived in the house of Assembly by a large majority, notwithstanding that the greatest exertions were made to support it.(2) Being disappointed in their expectations, the minority in the administration and all the worthy citizens in the state, whose minds are well informed, regreting the peculiarities of their situation, place their fullest confidence in the wisdom and moderation of the national council, and indulge the warmest hopes of being favorably considered in their deliberations. From these deliberations they anticipate a political system which must finally be adopted & from which will result the safety, the honor and the happiness of the United States. Permit me, sir, to observe, that the measures of our present Legislature do not exhibit the real character of the state. They are equally reprobated & abhorred by gentlemen of the learned professions, by the whole mercantile body, & by the most respectable farmers & merchanics. The Majority of the administration are composed of a licentious body of men, destitute of education & many of them void of principle. From anarchy & confusion they derive a temporary consequence & this they endeavor to prolong by debauching the minds of the common people whose attention is wholly directed to the abolition of debts, public & private. With these are associated the disaffected of every description, particularly those who were unfriendly during the war. Their paper money system, founded in oppression & fraud, they are determined to supportat every hazard; and rather than relinquish their favorite pursuit, they trample upon the most sacred obligations. As a proof of this they refused to comply with the requisition of Congress for repealing all laws repugnant to the treaty of peace with Great Britain; and urged as their principal reason, that it would [be] Calling in question the propriety of their former measure. June 18, 1787  These may be attributed partly to the extreme freedom of our Constitution and partly to the want of energy in the federal Union; and it is greatly to be apprehended that they cannot be speedily removed, but by uncommon and very serious exertions. It is fortunate, however, that the wealth and resources of the state are cheifly in possession of the well effected, and that they are entirely devoted to the public good.

 Dear Sir. New York June 19th. 1787 I fully agree to the propriety of the Conventions order restraining its members from communicating it's doings---;tho' I feel a Strong desire and curiosity to know how it proceeds. I think the public never ought to see any thing but the final report of the Convention, the digested result only, of their deliberations and enquiries. Whether the plans of Southern, Eastern, or middle States succeed, never, in my opinion, ought to be know[n]. A few reflections on this subject lead me to doubt whether one of your members, Mr. P---;---;,(1) who two or three days since, returned to this City fully understood the true meaning, full and Just extent of the order not to communicate, &c. I have received no information from Massa. of any importance lately. I believe the new legislature, as yet has done but very little business---;they put good men, in General, into the Senate, and from this circumstance my expectations were a little raised---;but in filling up the three vacancies made in the Council by Phillips, Tufts and Dwight's declining, the legislature, by appointing Hutchinson, Peter Penniman and John Frost to those vacancies certainly gave no evidence of good politics and views.(2) Penniman and Frost I am not acquainted with; but H---;---; is an unwearied advocate for paper money, tender laws &c, &c. Had he been of the Legislature many might think it policy to put him into the Council, but he was elected from among the people at large, and after the members too had had time to know men and parties in some measure. My friends I find agree that there is a good Senate, but they all seem to be doubtful on which side a majority of the House in numbers may be. By the inclosed paper you will see that Govr. Hancock the 5th inst. proposed to the Legisa. to continue in the service of the State 800 men. The Senate immedy. adopted the measure 20 agt. 6. The House had it under consideration, several days, & it seems wished to make it a part of a conciliatory plan. What arethe contents of this conciliatory plan I do not know---;nor do I think that the true sentiments of the House can, at all, be collected from their unanimous adoption of Jarvis's motion in the inclosed paper. This motion appears to me to be a mighty general unmeaning something. I suppose no party denies such general truths and positions. I have not heard a word from Dr. Holten himself. I received letters from several of the members of the Legislature dated about the first of this month; all of which informed me, that he proposed, in two or three days from that time, to set out for N York---;that he was then well and in the legislature.

I imagine the Yeas & nays as they stand on the resolve of the 13th are true evidence of the disposition of the House(1) ---;those in the negative argued that the troops were unnecessary---;probably they thought so---; but I think you will not be at a loss to discover the principle on which they acted and formed their opinions when you shall cast your eye upon the accurate division of men---;men on the one hand that have been for years steady in support of Government &c---;on the other men who for years have opposed taxes, proposed paper money, tender laws, &c. Dr. Holten has arrived---;and I wish the officers of Congress and members not engaged in the Convention would return to New York. I do not know how it may be in the Southern States---;but, I assure you, the present State of Congress has a very disagreeable effect in the Eastern States. The people hear of a Convention in Philada. and that Congress is done sitting, &c. Many of them are told, it seems, that Congress will never meet again probably---;Dr. H. says he saw several sober men who had got an idea that the people were to be called on to take arms to carry into effect immediately the report of the Convention &c.

 Sir, New York 23d June, 1787. I have conversed with Mr. Dane respecting your affairs,(1) & he informs me, Congress have had no information from Mr. Adams, more than, that he had made the British ministry acquainted with his instructions, respecting the settlement of the western line;(2) & that Mr. Dane's letter to you(3) contains his sentiments upon your affairs, & to which I must ask leave to refer you; and `tho' it would give me sensible pleasure to be able to afford you immediate assistance, yet, I think it not likely, that there will be any particular resolution of Congress in your favor, untill they have further information from Mr. Adams, respecting the settlement of the s[ai]d line, for if they were to make a Grant in your favor, it might be construed, as considering your claim without the line of the United States: however, you may be assured of my further attention to the same as it would give me pleasure to render you services.

 Sir Philadelphia 24 June 1787. You must be sensible from the State of my account with the Treasury that I have a much larger demand for arrears of pay than either of my colleagues. I have made it a rule to forbear my importunities on this Subject as long as possible. My present situation exposes me to heavy expenses, and I cannot but think that you will unite with me in Opinion that my claims are not behind those of any person who has a  June 25, 1787  Demand on the Treasury. I took an order some months since, or a note of the late Treasurer's, for 100Â£. I sold it for 90Â£. I cannot think of suffering so great a loss of my wages in future. I pray you to inform me When you will authorise me to draw on you for 200Â£---;a much larger sum is due to me but I shall be content to wait some Time for the balance.

 Sir New York June 25th. 1787. I have the honor of acknowledging your letter of June 6th with the extracts of letters from the district of Kentucki & the proceedings of the Executive thereon,(1) & I entirely concur with you on the propriety of the State's calling upon Congress either to exert the fOEderal force, in defense of her frontiers or to enable her at the expence of the Union to defend her citizens in such manner, as may be most likely to ensure success. The misfortune is that there is no Congress at present to whom the application can be made; & if there was, I doubt much whether there would be a disposition in that body to incur any great expence for the security of an individual State. There are so many States who are protected (by their situation) from the depredations of the Indians, that if we judge from their conduct on Governor Henry's application last year, efficient measures in this respect are hardly to be expected.(2) On that occasion after every exertion of the delegation, only two companies were procured, & these were directed by the Secretary at war to act on the defensive; & As to the expenditures made by the State; I doubt whether ever a shilling will be allowed. I shall be happy however to find myself mistaken in my conjectures. I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Yr. Most Obed serv., Willm. Grayson. ""

I suppose it is very imperfect as to many of the State debts---;whatever further I can collect relative to these subjects I will transmit to you.(1) We yesterday formed a Congress of seven States and elected Grayson chairman.(2) Today we had no Congress owing to the inattention of two or three members---;we expect Connecticut and Pennsylvania here in a few days. We have various letters touching the hostile conduct of the Indians as usual. From our ministers we have letters as late as the 20th of May, but nothing of any kind of importance.(3) The Legislature of Massa. I believe has done as yet but very little business---;every thing done of any Consequence you have, probably, seen published in the New York papers, or may see in the inclosed papers. July 5, 1787  I am very sorry to hear you say that it is uncertain what will be the result of the Convention---;because I infer there must be a great diversity of Sentiments among the members. The Convention must do something---;its meeting has all those effects which we and others who did not fully discern the propriety of the measure apprehended. You know the general opinion is, that our Federal Constitution must be mended, and if the Convention do not agree, at least in some amendments, a universal despair of our keeping together will take place. It seems to be agreed here that the Virginia plan was admitted to come upon the floor of investigation, by way of experiment, and with a few yieldings on this point & that keeps its ground at present. The contents of this plan was known to some, I believe, before the convention met. Perhaps the public mind will be prepared in a few years to receive this new System---;however I leave the whole to the wisdom of the Convention & remain, Your's Sincerely, N. Dane P.S. Several concerns makes it highly important to me to make a short visit to Massa. sometime in this month or early in the next.

 Dear Sir New-York the 10th July 1787 I wrote to your Excellency in June,(1) and informed you of my intention, to return to North Carolina immediately on the arrival of Mr. Burton: And accordingly I sat out as early as practicable by the way of Philadelphia. Mr. Ashe & Mr. Burton having thought proper to return to North Carolina, for reasons which they did assign to you, the State for a short period was unrepresented. It being of great importance to the Union at this time particularly, that Congress should be and continue in session, the members present and the secretary wrote after me and Mr. Blount and requested our return. The letters reached me on the eave of my departure for Virginia, and although I had but scanty means of support, having not drawn on the public resources and my own being nearly exhausted yet I determined to return induced thereto in a great measure From a hope of being able to procure some aid from the Union towards the protection of our Western Citizens, and of securing and preserving our right to the free and common use of the navigation of the Mississipi. The first we find to be impracticable from the want of information, and, our having but seven States represented in Congress. But the latter, which is very interesting to the Western citizens of the southern States, as it regards their peace and welfare, has at length, from a variety of circumstances unnecessary as well perhaps as improper to relate, been put in a better situation than heretofore.

 My dear brother, New York July 14th. 1787 I arrived at this place a week ago almost destroyed with heat and fatigue. Here I found Grayson in the Chair of Congress Locum Tenens for the President who is absent.(1) After some difficulty we passed an Ordinance for establishing a temporary Government beyond the Ohio as preparatory to the sale of that Country.(2) And now we are considering an offer made to purchase 5 or 6 millions of Acres with pub. Securities. I hope we shall agree with the offer, but realy the difficulty is so great to get anything done, that it is not easy for the plainest propositions to succeed.(3) We owe much money, the pressure of Taxes  July 14, 1787  is very great & much complained of---;we have now something to sell that will pay the debt & discharge the greatest part of the Taxes, and altho this something is in a fair way of being soon wrested from us by the Sons of Violence, yet we have a thousand little difficulties that prevent us from selling! I found the Convention at Phila. very busy & very secret, it would seem however, from variety of circumstances that we shall hear of a Government not unlike the B. Constitution---; that is, an Executive with 2 branches composing a federal Legislature, and possessing adequate Tone. This departure from simple Democracy seems indispensably necessary, if any government at all is to exist in N. America. Indeed the minds of men have been so hurt by the injustice, folly, and wickedness of the State Legislatures; & State Executives that people in general seem ready for any thing. I hope however, that this tendency to extreme will be so controuled as to secure fully and completely the democratic influences acting within just bounds. The Land Speculators continue to urge the Open Missippi immediately against every principle of policy, common good, & common sense. Upon this I shall write you more fully hereafter. The bills of R. Morris have been refused in France, to a very considerable amount it is said. Time must discover how this will work, & what it will produce. The discoveries of fraud among the great officers of State in France proves that private embezzlement of public Money [is] not confined to America. There seems to be much convulsion in France on this occasion at present. My love, if you please to Mrs. Lee and when you have an opportunity, let me know that you are all well. Farewell.

 Dear Sir, New York July 15. 1787 I have the honor to enclose to you an Ordinance that we have just passed in Congress for establishing a temporary government beyond the Ohio, as a measure preparatory to the sale of the Lands.(1) It seemed necessary, for the security of property among uninformed, and perhaps licentious people, as the greater part of those who go there are, that a strong toned government should exist, and the rights of property be clearly defined. Our next object, is to consider of a proposition made for the purchase of 5 or 6 millions of Acres, in order to lessen the domestic debt.(2) An object of much consequence this, since the extinguishment of this part of the public debt would not only relieve from a very heavy burthen, but by demolishing the Ocean of public Securities, we should stop that mischievous deluge of speculation that now hurts our morals, and extremely injures the public affairs. Our Gazettes continue to be filled with publications against the Spanish Treaty and for opening the Mississippi, some of them plausible, but generally weak and indecent. This seems to be contending for an Object unatainable for many years, and probably Never without War not only with Spain, but most likely with the Bourbon Alliance---; July 16, 1787  And by such contention exposing the Government of the United States to a dishonorable acquiescence under the Captivity of its Citizens and Confiscation of their effects by Spain on the Mississippi, or entering prematurely into a destructive war in resentment for such doings. At the same time discarding the friendship for the enmity of a powerful Monarch and thereby probably loose what we may possess, our Share of a Commerce that yields annually 4 or 5 millions of dollars for Cod fish only, independant of the Flour & many valuable articles of American production used in Spain & not interfering with their own products. To say nothing of a most lucrative contraband Trade from the Ocean & on the Mississippi which a friend might wink at, but which a vigilant and powerful enemy will prevent. It seems to me that N. America is going, if we are prudent, to be the EntrepÃ´t between the East Indies and Spanish America. If to these we could join the settlement of a disputed boundary and obtain a powerful Guarantee therefor surely such considerations greatly outweigh the far sought apprehension of an Alliance of the Kentuckians with the British, and especially when we consider that a conduct which will procure the enmity of Spain, will probably force her into the open arms of G. Britain much to our Commercial and political injury. And after all, if this navigation could be opened and the benefits be such as are chimerically supposed, it must in its consequences depopulate & ruin the Old States. The argument may shortly thus be stated---;Spain will not agree to the Navigation within her limits. Can we force it in 25 years---;if we cannot, why risk, for an unatainable Object, the loss of valuable objects, and the incurring pernicious consequences. A Candid and impartial consideration of this subject, must, I think determine the question without difficulty. But I beg your pardon Sir for writing as much on this question, which I doubt not but you have fully considered before.

 Dear Sir New York July 16. 1787. I am obliged to you for yours of the 11th inst. With pleasure I communicate to you what we are doing in Congress---;not so much from a consciousness that what we do is well done, as from a desire that you  July 16, 1787  may be acquainted with our proceedings. We have been much engaged in business for ten or twelve days past for a part of which we have had 8 States. There appears to be a disposition to do business, and the arrival of R. H. Lee is of considerable importance. I think his character serves, at least in some degree, to check the effects of the feeble habits and lax modes of thinking in some of his Countrymen. We have been employed about several objects---;the principal ones of which have been the Government inclosed and the Ohio purchase.(1) The former you will see is completed and the latter will be probably completed tomorrow. We tried one day to patch up M---;s(2) Systems of W. Governt.---; Started new Ideas and committed the whole to Carrington, Dane, R. H. Lee, Smith, & Kean---;we met several times and at last agreed on some principles at least Lee, Smith & myself. We found ourselves rather pressed, the Ohio Company appeared to purchase a large tract of the federal lands, about 6 or 7 million of acres---;and we wanted to abolish the old system and get a better one for the Government of the Country---;and we finally found it necessary to adopt the best system we could get. All agreed finally to the inclosed except A. Yates---;he appeared in this Case, as in most other not to understand the subject at all. I think the number of free Inhabitants 60,000, which are requisite for the admission of a new State into the Confederacy is too small, but having divided the whole territory into 3 States, this number appeared to me to be less important, each State in the Common Course of things must become important soon after it shall have that number of Inhabitants. The eastern State of the 3 will probably be the first, and more important than the rest---;and, will no doubt be settled cheifly by Eastern people, and there is, I think, full an equal chance of it's adopting Eastern politics. When I drew the ordinance which passed (in a few words excepted) as I originally formed it, I had no idea the States wouldagree to the sixth Art. prohibiting Slavery---;as only Massa. of the Eastern States was present---;and therefore omitted it in the draft---;but finding the House favourably disposed on this subject, after we had completed the other parts I moved the art---;which was agreed to without opposition.(3) We are in a fair way to fix the terms of our Ohio sale, &c. We have been upon it three days Steadily. The magnitude of the purchase makes us very cautious about the terms of it, and the security necessary to ensure the performance of them. We have directed the board to enquire into and report on Holker's affairs &c.(4) Massa. Legisa. was prorogued the 7th inst. having continued the tender act, as it is called, to Jan. 1, 1788 & having passed no other act of importance except what, I presume, you have seen re[s]pecting the raising of troops and the powers of the Governor to pursue the rebells, &c. July 17, 1787  You ask me how I like my new Colleagues. Sedgwick, you know, we all esteem but I fear he will not make his attendance an object. Thatcher I am quite unacquainted with. I do not know whether Mr. Otis at his period of life and under his misfortune will enter with vigor into federal politics. I wish his Accounts with the Union had been settled &c. Nothing occurs worth particular notice. Your affecta. friend, N. Dane P.S. States present. Massa., N.Y., N.J., Delaware, Virga., N. Cara., So. Carolina & Georgia.

 Philada. July 18. 1787. \""The Convention continue to sit, and have been closely employed since the Commence[me]nt of the Session. I am still under the mortification of being restrained from disclosing any part of their proceedings. As soon as I am at liberty I will endeavor to make amends for my silence, and if I ever have the pleasure of seeing you shall be able to give you pretty full gratification. I have taken lengthy notes of every thing that has yet passed, and mean to go on with the drudgery, if no indisposition obliges me to discontinue it. It is not possible to form any judgment of the future duration of the Session. I am led by sundry circumstances to guess that the residue of the work will not be very quickly dispatched. The public mind is very impatient for the event, and various reports are circulating which tend to inflame curiosity. I do not learn however that any discontent is expressed at the concealment; and have little doubt that the people will be as ready to receive as we shall be able to propose, a Government that will secure their liberties & happiness. \""I am not able to give you any account of what is doing at N. York. Your correspondents there will no doubt supply the omission. The paper money here ceased to circulate very suddenly a few days ago. It had been for some time vibrating between a depreciation of 12 & of 20 Per Ct. Its entire stagnation is said to have proceeded from a combination of a few people with whom the Country people deal on market days, agst. receiving it. The consequence was that it was refused in the market, and great distress brought on the poorer Citizens. Some of the latter began in turn to form Combinations of a more serious nature in order to take revenge on the supposed authors of the stagnation. The timely interposition of some influencial characters prevented a riot, and prevailed on the persons who were opposed to the paper, to publish their willingness to receive it. This has stifled the popular rage, and got the paper into circulation again.It is however still considerably below par, and must have recd a wound which will not easily be healed.(1) Nothing but evil springs from this imaginary money wherever it is tried, and yet the appetite for it where it has not been tried, continues to be felt. There is great reason to fear that the bitterness of the evil must be tasted in Virga. before the appetite there will be at an end. \""The Wheat harvest throughout the Continent has been uncommonly fine both in point of quantity & quality. The crops of Corn &  July 10, 1787  Tobo. on the ground in Virginia are very different in different places. I rather fear that in general they are both bad; particularly the former. I have just recd. a letter from Orange which complains much of appearances in that neighbourhood; but says nothing of them in the parts adjacent.\"" ""

 Dr. Sir New York 19th July 1787 From the Period of July 1776, when I first arrived in the French West Indies untill the Month of February 1778, I found all their Ports open for the Admission of Lumber, Salted Fish & Live Stock, & indeed for all the Productions of America, (even those that entered into Competition with the Articles that France could furnish her Colonies with) but this was only a temporary Indulgence, arising out of our peculiar Situation & from the Benefits that France derived from the sale of large Quantities of Merchandize which the Americans took in Exchange for their cargoes of produce.(1) Previous to that Period, the first enumerated Articles were alone permitted to be disposed of; And no Ordinance of the Court established this Right in our Favor, but a discretionary Power was lodged with the Intendant to regulate this Intercourse.  The Port of the Caranage in St Lucie, La Triniti & St Pierre in Martinico & Point a Petre in Guadaloupe, were the most frequented in the Windward Islands. Indeed, at one Period, previous to our Revolution, I found it had been in Agitation to confine all the American Commerce to St Lucie, as the Vigilance of the Guarda Costas was not Sufficient to prevent an illicit Trade in Articles whose Admission was Severely prohibited in the French Colonies. After the Month of February 1778, American Vessels made regular Entries into all the Custom Houses, & were indulged with every Advantage that the Subjects of France partook of.

 Dear Sir,(1) Newyork July 19th 1787. Herewith I forward to your Address the Papers of today in one of which is contained a Letter dated at Nashville May 1st addressed to the Honorable B. H.(2) You will readily conjecture it was fabricated by a Person better informed that [than] any Inhabitants of Davidson County can be it only remains for me to tell you that it has been written on my Motion in the first Instance by my Friend H. W.(3) It has been here much applauded as well written and it certainly is well timed. He is not suspected of being the Author. It has been translated into French & will be published in Paris & London. I arrived here on the 3d July from Philadelphia accompanyed by Mr. Hawkins, the Reasons that induced us to do [so] We have given you in official Lettrs by Post which I suppose will be to hand before this.(4) We have at present nine States on the floor, & I have from day to day for Several days past been about to return to Philadelphia but sundry things which require the Assent of that Number of States has been so pressing and still continues so to be that I believe we shall continue here untill Sunday (we are so now industrious that We set on Saturday). I had yesterday a Letter from D<<avie>(5) in which he says \""since you left us We have progressed obliquely and retrograded directly so that we stand on the same Spot you left us\"" and when I left them much Progress was not made. My Colleagues were very unanimous, H. W. are there Head, and were in Sentiment with Virginia who seemed to take the lead, Madison at their Head, tho Randolph and Mason are also great. The general outlines were to have a National Assembly composed of three Branches, the first to be elected by the People at large and to consist of about 70 Members, the second Branch of a less Number to be chosen by the respective Legislatures for a longer duration and the third an Executive of a single Man for a still longer Time. I must confess notwithstanding all I heard in favour of this System I am not insentiment with my Colleagues for as I have before said I still think We shall ultimately and not many Years first be seperate and distinct Governments perfectly independent of each other. The little States were much opposed to the Politics of the larger they insisted that each State ought to have an equal Vote as in the present Confederation.  Congress yesterday recived a Letter from Mr. Brandt written in the Indian Language informing that all the Nations of Indians of the North West of the Ohio had formed a Confederacy offensive & Defensive, it was couched in hostile Language and contained a request in the Terms of a Demand that our Surveyors should desist from  July 19, 1787  survey[ing] the Lands west of the Ohio.(6) Daily Accounts from Kentuckey prove the Indians are hostile in that quarter and by the Report of the Superintendent from the Creeks there is much Reason to fear Hostilities will shortly commence between them and the Citizens of Georgia. There has been at Philadelphia a Mr. Drungold with a Cherokee & John Woods with a Chickasaw & Choctaw and have all returned, the two latter by way of Fort Pitt, the former complained loudly against the Infraction of the Treaty at Hopewell in as much as that the Whites had settled within a few Miles of their towns, and within that part assigned them by the State of N.Ca. I would wish the Whites had forborn there Settlements on that part---; the other two complained that Trade had not been sent among them as they were taught to expect and that they were suffering for the Want of the promised Supplies, in Short We have three Reports from the Secretary at War, on Indian Afairs, one in particular which is the Subject of this day recommends the Stationing Continental Troops on the Ohio in different parts as low as the Rapids and the Calling out Militia on Continental pay to protect the Kentuckey and other Inhabitants on the east side of the Ohio.(7) ""

 Dear Col.(1) New York July 22d(2) 1787 The Secretary at War will doubtless transmit to you with all possible dispatch the Resolutions of this day(3)---;or perhaps it may first reach you Via Virginia. However troublesome this new Commission may be to you yet I think it an honorable mark of the confidence of Congress in your integrity and discretion. And I assure you this was one motive with me for agreeing to the whole of the Resolutions as they stand. The part that I have material objection to is leaving to you to Judge of the propriety of calling out Militia---;for tho you are not authorised to carry on an expedition without the further Orders of Congress---;yet the rumour that you have in your power to call them out to cover the frontier &ca. will I fear lay you under many difficulties, as you will on the one hand as well from duty as inclination wish to avoid unnecessary expences on the other I know you will be hazed to death, by rumours of persons killed, strong assertions & persuasions of the necessity of establishing posts, at this that and the other place. If you give way in one instance to these persuasions you will find your Judgment & resolution both hard pressed to stop til the whole number authorised by the Resolutions are called out. Your own good sense will be a sufficient montitor to you how far this matter is to extend---;when you reflect for a moment on the present wretched state of the treasury (which you yourself must feel but too sensibly). It is said Virginia will defray the expence in the first instance---;true---;but is she not to be allowed out of the requisitions of the present year---;and is not Virginia one of the few States who pay any thing & has the most immediate efficient funds. If that is Idly squandered what will be the consequence. I know you have a delicate part to act; You know I presume that there is a general confederacy of all the Indian tribes north west of the Ohio. Will not an attack on part be deemed attacking the Whole? They demand a Generaltreaty; the consideration of this is taken up  July 22, 1787  but what will be the result---;is yet unknown. To these detached hints I will take the liberty of adding another which is dictated solely by personal friendship Viz.---;When I was in nearly a similar situation to that you are now in, I heard & listened attentively to every Mans advice & plan, yet neither absolutely approved nor rejected any, but left myself at full liberty to act as circumstances required and I thought proper which I did invariably. To this let me also add that I should never have given my voice to your being employed on this petty, partial or subordinate (or what else you please to call it) negotiation did I not think it probable that something greater may spring from it---;under present appearances. We are about to sell all that tract of Country between the 7th range of townships & Siota to a Company who you must have heard of,(4) but I fear the Contract can not be closed advantageously to the United States, as the Company want a preemtion to much more than they can at present pay for---;this plan is not agreeable to some of your friends here, as they wish to begin an immediate extinguishment of as much of the public debt as possible. You will probably get fuller accounts of all these things from the War office, or from some other friends who have more leisure than I have at present.

 My dear Cousin, New York July 22d. 1787 Having recover'd my health much better than I ever expected to have done, I have again taken my Seat in Congress. I arrived in this City a fortnight ago, having stayed a week in Philadela. where I saw your friends all in good health and your father, as usual, in high spirits. I was extremely happy to find that you were so well placed for improvement and to see, under your own hand, such strong proofs that you had greatly profited by your situation.(1) The federal Convention at Phila. is proceeding slowly, but I hope surely in a practical improvement of our federal Constitution. Experience seems to have proved that our governments have not Tone enough for the unruly passions of men, and so far as I can judge, the general wish is for a ballanced government where the powers shall be placed independently as in England, and of duration somewhat longer than the present. Congress is proceeding with the ordinary business until the Convention shall report their plan for consideration and recommendation to the different States. I suppose it will be recommended to the States to call Conventions for the special purpose of approving the new System, that it may rest on the broad base of the peoples choice, rather than on the more feeble opinion of the ordinary Legislatures. In my last to you from Virga. I requested you to send me a few of the newest books, if there were any published of high Character and to apply to Mr. Thos. Blane Merchant in London for the cash to pay for them, and to deliver them to him that they might be forwarded to me. If you have not already complied with this request, you need not now trouble yourself about it, because I have written to Mr. Blane for as many books as my finances will allow me to devote in one year to that article. But you will very much oblige me by getting for me one of the most improved Modern Lamps of polished Tin, such as Doctor Franklin brought over with him for giving great splendor of light to a Parlour where company sit. If, inorder to use this Lamp, any explanation is necessary, let such explanations accompany it. Mr. Blane will receive and forward the Lamp with my other Goods that he sends me the ensuing Fall. And he will on your application, supply the money necessary to pay for it as I have directed him. I pray you to remember me affectionately to Mr. Adams and inform him that I will shortly write to him. Congress have not yet determined on complying with his request to be permitted to return home, but when they shall do so, I  July 22, 1787  will certainly do my endeavor to have Colo. Smith appointed ChargÃ© des Affairs at the Court of London, if such shd. be the plan fixt on. My compliments if you please to Colo. Smith. I hope to hear from you e'er long, because I am always happy to do so, being with the most unfeigned affection and the truest regard my dear Cousin, Yours forever, Richard Henry Lee. P.S. July 30. The want of 9 states prevents a determination on Mr. Adams's business by this packet, so that we do not know the future arrangement. I enclose you my dear Cousin a letter for our relation the Bishop of Chester. It may bring you acquainted with a Learned and worthy Man---;farewell. R.H.L. Remember me to Dr. Cutting.

 Sir, New York July 22. 1787 We do ourselves the honor to inclose a report of the Treasury Board, upon the Governors letter of the 18th of April, upon the subject of the Indents for 1786.(1) The same disposition to the ease of the people which induced Congress at the time of making the requisition, to admit Indents in payment of such part of it, as is for the Interest of the domestic debt, must, doubtless, now induce a favorable ear to the complaint of a State, that those facilities are withheld by the Executive officers of the United States. In pursuance of this disposition the complaint of Virginia was referred to the Treasury Board for their answer. This is composed of a statement of facts, drawn from the Acts of the State; the information of the Loan Officer; and actual experiments upon some of the Acts, in former requisitions: the result of this Statement is, that the funds appropriated for the payment of the requisition, are greatly deficient. Neither Congress, nor the delegation of the State, are in possession of sufficient knowledge of the productiveness of those funds, for ascertaining the propriety or unpropriety of this report; nor is it to be expected that Congress will supercede it, without evidence of its being wrong. Conceiving it to be our duty, to procure an opportunity for this to be done on the part of the State, we have obtained, and now transmit, this Copy of the Report.(2) Should the Executive find it practicable to oppose to it sufficient evidence of the adequacy of the Funds, we shall be ready to lay it before Congress, and are convinced  July 22, 1787  it will have due weight with that body. The Statement of the Treasury Board does not comprehend all the Funds appropriated to the requisition, but what they have omitted, would add but little to the result of their calculations. Anxious to be immediately instrumental in removing this difficulty, we have attempted a calculation upon these funds, and could we have brought them to any thing like the necessary sum, we should have endeavoured to obtain a reliance upon them; but of this, we have fallen far short, our statement is enclosed for your inspection. Knowing that our information upon the subject must be very imperfect, we have not communicated this Statement to, either Congress, or the Treasury Board, that both may be fairly open to receive that which, the more perfect knowledge of the Executive, may produce. The Executive must readily perceive the extensive mischief that would arise to the honor and credit of the United States, from an order of Congress for the issuing of Indents in Virginia, before the establishment of the adequacy of her funds to the requisition, as it would necessarily lead to the gratification of all the States, and, thus, an enormous addition would be made to that Mass of unfunded paper which already overwhelms us: in the mean time We have the pleasure to assure you, Sir, of the perfect impartiality of the Treasury Board upon this subject---;all the Acts for complying with the requisition are reported by the loan Officers to be defective in funds, and the Indents are accordingly withheld from all the States. We also have the honor to enclose an extract of a letter from Mr. Hopkins to the Treasury Board, informing them that the Executive have ordered all payments for federal purposes to be suspended, until the Indents for 1786 be issued, or those of 1785, admitted in discharge of the requisition of 1786. This determination must, we conceive, have been founded either upon an apprehension that the indents now in the Treasurers hands, are not payable upon therequisitions of 84 & 85, and, that unless the Treasury Board exercise a power supposed to be possessed by them, of directing them to be received for that of 1786, they must sink in the hands of the State, or go to the extinguishment of the requisition of September 1782; or a supposition that the Indents for 1786, are withheld without just cause. To the latter ground of complaint, the above report fully applies---;as to the former, we enclose a Statement of the Treasury Board which shews, not only that the State has the power, but that it is for her Interest, to pay the Indents on hand upon the requisitions of 1784 & 1785. Their remarks upon this point are so full that it is unnecessary for us to add to them: but as to the payment of these Indents upon the requisition of 1786, We beg leave to observe, that the annual requisitions are founded upon the current demands of the public---;that for 86 comprehends one years Interest of the domestic debt, and no more,   the admission, therefore, of indents for 85, in discharge of it, would occasion a deficiency and confuse the systems of finance. You will observe, Sir, that the Indents for 1785 are receivable upon the requisitions of 82 & 84, by special resolutions of Congress annexed to the Statement of the Board, which have been either unknown, or unattended to, by the Loan Officer, and of course escaped the observation of the Committee of Issuance at the last session---;upon general ground the statement of this committee, was a just one, as those resolutions were occasioned by the particular circumstance of the Indents of 85, involving, in many instances, the Interest intended to be covered by the former requisitions. These observations shew, not only that the Treasury Board are unauthorized to admit the Indents of 1785, in payment of the requisition of 1786, but also, that it would be improper for Congress to do so. Our concern in this business arises as well from a sense of duty, as a sincere desire, to preserve between the federal and State administrations, that harmony, which is absolutely necessary to the redemption of our affairs from the ruinous state in which they are, and we are convinced the Executive will give our communications a candid and liberal consideration. As to the stoppage of the payments on federal account, it is not for us to say more, than that it exposes the Interests & credit of the United States, to the most fatal injuries. We have the Honor to be, Sir, with great respect, Your Most Obedt. humble Servants. Willm. Grayson Richard Henry Lee Ed Carrington ""

It was insisted on with great force that it was highly impolitic to attack a part of the confederation, & thereby involve ourselves in a general war, when the public resources were totally inadequate thereto.

 Dear Sir, New York July 25. 1787 I was favoured with yours inclosing a letter for Mr. Jefferson, which I delivered, agreably to your request, to Chevalier Jones(1) ---;his business with Congress is not finished, and therefore he has not gone with the packet, which sailed this morning. No passenger was going whose personal delivery of the letter could be relied upon, and it seems the Capt. could not take it, otherwise than in the Mail. Not knowing it to be matter of indifference with you, whether it should be exposed to inspection or not, it has been determined, in a conference between the Chevalier & myself, that he should keep it until his own departure, which he expects will be in a short time. I recd. by Colo. R H Lee Ninety dollars which, with the sum you was good enough to pay Major Turner for me, sets us even. Your acknowledgement for the 100 dollars is enclosed. We are trying to do something with our Western Territory to make it useful to the purposes for which the United States were vested with it. You have seen in the papers the scheme for the temporary as well as perpetual Government of it. A practicable measure for the sale of it, or rather, by means of it to redeem the domestic debt, remains still to be agreed upon, and I fear the difficulties which have always stood in the way of this great object, are not yet to be surmounted.(2) Colo Lee joins Grayson & myself with great zeal, but what will be the issue of our efforts I know not. Indian affairs wear an hostile aspect, and money must, in all probability, be expended in Treaties with them. A general confederacy is formed of all the Nations & Tribes from the Six Nations inclusive, to the Mississippi under the immediate influence of Brandt. A general Council has been held in form, near Detroit, as long ago as last December, in which have been considered as greivances, our Surveying over the Ohio, the Cessions being made by only parts of the Tribes  July 25, 1787  having rights in the ceded Tracts. Of these injuries or greivances they have sent an United representation to Congress requesting that a general Treaty may be held---;perhaps this business may be directed by an authority higher than that of Brandt, and should our titles to the Land be compleat it will still be better to spend a little money in Treating, rather than expend a great deal in War, which from the generality of the confederacy is seriously to be apprehended. This subject is now under consideration.(3) As to the hostilities upon Kentucky the superintendant of Indian affairs, or in case of his inability to go, Colo. Josiah Harmar, is ordered to proceed immediately to some convenient place for holding a Treaty with the hostile tribes, and by that means restore peace between them and our people if practicable. In the mean time Colo. Harmar is so to post the Federal Troops as to provide the best defence for the Country, and to call for such aids of Militia as he shall find necessary.(4) Should the Treaty not succeed report is to be made to Congress for their further orders as to offensive operations. The state of the general confederacy requires some care in the direction of this business. The desperate state of things in the United Netherlands you see in the papers.

 Dear Sir New York, July 25th 1787. Your Letter of the April last, I received about a Week ago. I wish I had time, by this opportunity, to answer it fully. Some business at present prevents me. I was very fearful that my short address from Savannah had wandered out of its way, and instead of finding its Friend, had got into the hands of an Enemy. It gave me pleasure on the receipt of yours to find that it was in your possession. July 25, 1787  As some material changes have taken place in Virginia, and in America generally, you will no doubt expect much information from your correspondents in this quarter. I cannot, however at present, arrange my materials so as to give you a long Letter. Carrington, no doubt, will give you every information of the Virginia affairs, as to Georgia you know nothing about it and therefore can feel no curiosity about the circumstances of that Country. I will then confine myself to such things as are imediately around me. In January last I took my seat in Congress, and continued untill May, when I met the Delegates from the different States, in Convention, at Philadelphia. After continuing in that Council untill all the first principles of the new Government were established, I came on again to New York, and am now in Congress. The business of the Convention is now going on with some degree of harmony. I dare not communicate any of its proceedings. The affairs of Congress, I imagine, you get regular information about. The most material business that we have lately compleated is the Government of the Western Country, and the direction given to the board of Treasury to sell a large tract of the Western Lands, by which we may probably sink four or five millions of the domestic debt. At present our attention is drawn to the hostile posture of the Indians, but we have concluded on nothing. I enclose you a report of the secretary of War that you may form some idea of our situation.(1) Burwell Starke, and young Mr. Beverley, are in this City on a visit. They both seem much displeased with Virginia. It is perhaps a misfortune that these young Gentlemen have tasted so much of the pleasures of Europe. I ask you my Friend if you think the gaities of France are equal to the tranquil pleasures, and domestic comforts of America? By this question you will find that I have a high opinion of your phylosophy and good Judgment, that you are not caught by trifles, but that you know how to value the substantial mattersof the World. Please to make my respectful compliments to Mr. Jefferson, and believe me to be, Your sincere Friend, Wm. Pierce. ""

 Philada. July 28. 1787. \""I am sorry that I cannot gratify your wish to be informed of the proceedings of the Convention. An order of secresy leaves me at liberty merely to tell you that nothing definitive is yet done, that the Session will probably continue for some time yet,  July 28, 1787  that an Adjournment took place on Thursday last until Monday week, and that a Committee is to be at work in the mean time. Late information from Europe presents a sad picture of things in Holland. Civil blood has been already spilt, and various circumstances threaten a torrent of it. Many it is said are flying with their property to England. How much is it [to] be lamented that America does not present a more inviting Asylum! \""Congress have been occupied for some time past on Western affairs. They have provided for the Governmt. of the Country by an ordinance of which a copy is herewith inclosed.(1) They have on the anvil at present, some projects for the most advantageous sale of the lands. Col. Carrington informs me that Indian Affairs wear a very hostile appearance;(2) that money must in all probability be expended in further Treaties; that a General Confederacy has been formed of all the Nations & tribes from the six nations inclusive to the Mississippi under the auspices of Brandt; that a Genl. Council was held in Decr. last in form, near Detroit, in which was considered as a grievance, the Surveying of lands on the N.W. side of the Ohio, the pretext being, as usual that the Treaties which preceded that measure were made by parts only of the Nations whose consent was necessary; and that a united representation of this grievance has been recd. by Congress. That as to the hostilities on Kentucky the Superintendant of Indian Affairs, or in case of his inability to go, Col. Harmar, is ordered to proceed immediately to some convenient place for holding a Treaty with the Hostile tribes, and by that means restore if possible peace in that quarter. In the mean time Col. Harmar is so to post the federal troops as to provide the best defence for the Country, and to call for such aids of Militia as he shall find necessary. \""The Crops of wheat in this & the neighbouring States, and indeed throughout the Continent as far as I can learn have been remarkably fine. I am sorry to hear that yourcrops of Corn are likely to be so much shortened by the dry weather. The weather has been dry in spots in this quarter.

Farming is a branch of natural philosophy and it is only by experiments that we can hope for success in improving it. A few successful experiments clearly pointed out are better than a whole volume of theory. I am told that some people in the northern parts of this state & in Connecticut have sowed a kind of wheat which they call the white bearded wheat & which baffles the attacks of the Hessian fly. Nay I am informed that small patches of it sown amongst the other wheat have remained uninjured & produced a plentiful crop, while the common wheat around it has been wholly destroyed. I see also mention made in the newspaper that soaking the wheat seed before sowing in a decoction of Alder has preserved the wheat from the ravages of the fly. These experiments are worth attending to, as the fly appears to be advancing into the Country. There are no persons yet in nomination for the Offices you Mention.(2) I shall be sorry if any of the worthy French inhabitants suffer by the article against slavery in the western Country;(3) but I am so much a friend to that article that let the consequences be what they may I would not wish it altered.

Parsons late a Major General in the service of the United States and Associates in Number about nine hundred many of whom have also been Officers and Soldiers, five Millions of Acres of Land situate between the Muskingum and the Scioto at two thirds of a dollar per Acre.(1) Thus the Precedent is established of selling the back Lands in large quantities so that should you still wish to purchase and will come forward with Proposals I have no doubt but they will be equally attended to. These Purchasers mean to settle their Lands without delay---;a Circumstance highly pleasing to all Holders of Western Lands and beside this certain Prospect of Population, the Emigration to the Lands on the Western Waters is very great, as you will see by the following Account which you may depend on; being an Official Return to Congress made by Lieut.

Much has been done (though nothing conclusively), and much remains to do. A great diversity of sentiment must be expected on this great Occassion: feeble minds are for feeble measures & some for patching the old garment with here & there a shred of new Stuff; while vigorous minds and warm Constitutions advocate a high toned Monarchy. This is perhaps a necessary contrast as `all natures difference keeps all natures peace' it is probable the conclusion will be on a medium between the two extremes. \""As secrecy is not otherwise enjoined than as prudence may dictate to each individual---;in a letter to my brother John, of the 28th instant,(1) I gave him (for the satisfaction of two or three who will not make it public) a hint respecting the general principles of the plan of national Government, that will probably be handed out---;which will not be submitted to the Legislatures but after the approbation of Congress to an assembly or assemblies of Representatives recommended by the several Legislatures, to be expressly chosen by the people to consider & decide thereon. \""Great wisdom & prudence as well as liberallity of Sentiment & a readiness to surrender natural rights & privileges for the good of the nation appears in the southern delegates in general and I most devoutly wish that the same spirit may pervade the whole Country that the people by absurdly endeavoring to retain all their natural rights may not be involved in Calamitous factions which would end but with the loss of all....\"" July 31, 1787  \""P.S.

I am pleased with his last letter. I think he begins to improve in his writing. I am anxious to have him write a fair, good, free hand. I hope as he advances in Years he will take a studious turn, because he has an infinity to attend to. I think the habitt is or may be acquired early in life---;unless he is very bookish, like Your Eldest Son, he can never get through all I shall require of Him. I have my fears on the score of application; but it is to be acquired, I am therefore comforted by knowing he will be put in the way to acquire it. I conclude he learns French, and is also under the Dancing Master's hands, which I wish him to be---;other things will come in dueseason. My last letter from Carolina woud inform You of my intended visit to Philadelphia.

 My worthy friend, August 4th, 1787. You have several times, hinted the difficulty of expressing, upon paper, one's ideas of an energetic federal government, altho' convinced of the inadequacy of our present system. Permit me to devote fifteen minuits to this subject; and, as detail or amplification is unnecessary to an informed mind, I shall confine myself to principles.  These principles may be considered under two heads. The first as originating from the confederacy, and directing the various powers that should be exercised by the nation collectively, and by the states individually. The second, as flowing from the nature of civil society, having due regard to the customs, manners, laws, climates, religions, and pursuits of the citizens of the United States. Under this head may be considered the manner of exercising these powers, or the formal government of the nation.  In the first place, whatever respects the citizens collectively, or as immediately relating to the whole confederacy, whether foreign or domestic, must be subjected to the national controul: & whatever respects the Citizens of a particular state, & has relation to them as such, should be directed by the states respectively. But as interferences may sometimes arise, the collective power must decide and enforce. This check would be better placed in the judiciary than the legislative branches. In the second place: The government of the United States should be so modified as to secure the rights of the different classes of citizens. But as these are distinguished by education, wealth, & talents, they naturally divide into Aristocratical and Democratical. It is necessary then to form a Supreme legislative, perhaps as Congress is now formed, to originate all national laws, and submit them to the revision of a Senatorial body, which shall be formed out of equal districts of the United States, by the appointment of the Supreme legislative, &  August 5, 1787  whose commissions shall be so modified as to retain an equal number of old Members in office with the new, who may form a succession. In this body should reside the power of making war and peace. The Execution of the laws, both civil and military, should be placed in an executive council, consisting of a president of the United States, and the Officers of the great departments of War, Finance, Foreign affairs and law, to be appointed by the Senate, & commissioned during good behavior, excepting the President, who should be appointed by both the legislative and senatorial bodies, & commissioned for a term of Years, or for life. All appointments of Judges & other officers civil and military, should be made by the president, by and with advice of the council, & commissioned in his name. These officers should be accountable for their conduct And triable before the respective tribunals before whom their actions would respectively be made cognizable. I think the president should not be liable to any direct prosecutions as in him would reside that part of the sovereignty which displays itself in the etequette of nations.  In this system, the ballance would be secured. Military objects would be directed by the Senate, executed by the president and council, & checked by the fiscal power of the legislative. The subjects of revenue should be few, simple & well defined; & in case of a very uncommon emergency, the States respectively should be called upon from Contingents, which would form an ultimate and never failing check against encroachments upon the political system. I am Sir &c., J M Varnum ""

 Dear Sir, N York. Augt. 8th. 1787. I have made inquiries agreable to your request into the affair of Mr. Low & Mr. K.(1) ---;and find that matters are in the same situation as when you left this. Indeed from the manner in which the business has been conducted by Mr. K. it does not appear to me at all probable that he will ever recover any thing from the heirs of his relations in Santa Cruz. You can therefore judge yourself what your expectations ought to be from that quarter. The family are all well: & live very retired, in as economical a manner as possible. Mr. K. when he was sick in the spring expressed to me his great desire of doing some thing for you, & lamented his inability in very pathetic terms. I fear he has judged of the world by his own heart, & thereby greatly injured his own family. Since my last Congress has passed the Ordnance for the government of the Western country, in a manner some thing different from the one which you drew, though I expect the departure is not so essential but that it will meet your approbation.(2) You will observe that the consent of Virginia is necessary to intitle the people to certain rights, as also that the former Act is repealed absolutely. I am satisfied therefore you will do every thing in your power to get the State to alter her act of cession in such a manner, as will square with the Ordnance. It seems the subject was not taken up last year. The clause respecting slavery was agreed to by the Southern members for the purpose of preventing Tobacco & Indigo from being made on the N.W. side of the Ohio, as well as for sevl. other political reasons. After this Ordnance was passed in Congress, the Eastern Ohio Compy. came for- August 8, 1787  ward, & have agreed with Congress for between 5 & 6 Million of acres lying between the Scioto & the Western boundy. of the seven ranges & extending back into the Country about sixty M[ile]s.(3) On the following terms viz One dollar per Acre, public securities deducting One third of a dollar for bad land & survg. &c. the Compy. to pay half a Million on the signing the contract; half a Million on the line being run by the Geographer & the residue in six half yearly installments with interest in the mean time. The Compy. to lay of[f] the territory in townships of six Miles square. The Compy. to have two sections for religion & education gratis, also two townships for the purposes of an University on the same terms---;three sections in each township to be reserved for the future disposition of Congress. I understand this Company mean to settle this country very thick & without delay; of course the adjacent lands will become very valuable; they send forward a number of families this fall; a reinforcement in the spring & a very considerable number fall come twelve month; the funds of the Compy. were only a Million when they made the contract: Since which they has increased in an amazing degree: so that there is not the least doubt but they will perform their part of the contract in all it's parts: and as their objects are actual settlement & defense, there is every reason to conclude it will be of the greatest advantage to that country: from the great number of inhabitants in the Eastern States & in the Jerseys, I should not be surprised to see them in a very few years extend themselves by additional purchases quite to the Missisippi, & thereby form a compleat barrier for our State, at the same greatly validating the lands on the Virginia side of the Ohio. Since the formation of this contract it has occurred to me, that something very handsome might be made in the mean time by purchasing the rights of the Virginia Officers, & laying them on the Scioto,on good land, immedy. joining the Company's purchase & which would immedy. become valuable from their contiguity to these settlements. If you should think with me on the subject, I would willingly join you & our worthy friend Genl. Weedon & John Monro of Westmoreland in a speculation of about eight or ten thousand acres apiece. I once involved you in a scrape, but you know I got you out of it again. With respect to this matter it appears to me so absolutely certain in it's operation that there cannot be the least doubt of success provided the rights are purchased at a low rate which I understand can be effected witht. difficulty. The public lands do not cost the purchaser more than six pence this money per Acre, i.e., two thirds of a dollar, at one for Eight the current price here for public securities; of course the Virga. Officers cannot well ask a higher price. The reason why I would not recommend a purchase in the Compys. lands is because in the first place they are a Compy. & are subject to certain rules, one of which is that no person can take more than five shares. I would notwithstanding ad-

Weedon to adventure as far as one share which is one thousand dolls. in securities as he may thereby introduce his Military Continental claim, the Company being allowed to discount one seventh part in that way. A Commee. is appointed to draught an Ordnance for the sale of the lands between the Scioto & Great Miami,(4) on the principle of indiscriminate locations nearly: & if the Southern States attend I apprehend it can be carried; this however will not bring any large quantity to markett, as after deducting the claims of the Virga.

It is much to be regretted and I do most sincerely regret, that General Greene did not survive, to receive this farther testimony of the sense his Country had of his services, particularly of the gallant action at the Eutaw. The Memory of it however will be thereby long preserved, and it cannot fail to be very acceptable to his Family; and when the Story is related to his Children, and the design of the Medal explained to them, as it will be, whilst their veneration for their Father is encreased, a sense of Gratitude and Affection for their Country, thus careful to record his Glory, must be raised in their tender Minds, and the generous resolution instantly formed to step forward in its service, in the same honorable Path should it ever be necessary, with the honest hope of meriting like Rewards.

 Dear Sir, New York Augt. 11. 1787 I am favored with yours of the 3d & 8th Instt.(1) The whole delegation have received letters from Mr. Anderson similar to that which he wrote you. I beleive Mr. Maurey has been equally extensive in his applications.(2) I will mention to our Colleagues your suggestion of giving the names and wishes of those Gentlemen to Mr. Jay. I return you Mr. Fitch's letter with a note of the Secretary upon it, which furnishes a satisfactory answer.(3) I received a letter from Major Turner(4) upon the subject of the Secretariship, previous to which I had turned my views for that appointment, upon a Worthy Man, Major Sergeant, of this I informed the said Turner. He has again written me that he will not stand in competition with his freind Sergeant, & will take a chance for a Seat on the Bench.  August 11, 1787  My ideas of his fit[n]ess for such an office are favorable, and it will give me pleasure to be instrumental in placing him there. When these appointments, or any other business will be done, I know not. The departure of No Carolina & Georgia left us only 7 States, and the day before yesterday we lost another in the decampment of Doctor Holton, whose declining State of health obliged him to retrograde. The doctor is tolerably free from localities, and I am sorry to lose him: but on account of the breaking up of Congress, we have but little to regret, unless there had been an early prospect of raising the number of States above 7, for with that number, I think, there will never be a good act passed. All the indian affairs still remain to be acted upon, and many other things of great consequence. The President has been requested to write to the States unrepresented, pressing upon them the objects which require the attendance of their delegations, & urging them to come forward,(5) amongst these Objects is that of the report of the Convention, which, it is supposed, is now in the State of parturition. This bantling must receive the blessing of Congress this session, or, I fear, it will expire before the new one will assemble; every experiment has its critical stages which must be taken as they occur, or the whole will fail. The peoples expectations are rising with the progress of this work, but will desert it, should it remain long with Congress. Permit me to Suggest one idea as to the mode of obtaining the accession of the States to the new plan of government. Let the convention appoint one day, say the 1st of May, upon which a convention appointed by the people shall be held in each State, for the purpose of accepting or rejecting in toto, the project. Supposing an act of the ordinary legislatures to be equally authentic, which would not be true, yet many reasons present themselves in favor of special conventions---; many men would be admitted, who are excluded from the legislatures---;the businesswould be taken up unclogged with any other---;and it would effectually call the attention of all the people to the object as seriously affecting them. All the States being in convention at the same time, opportunities of speculating upon the views of each other would be cut off. The project should be decided upon without an attempt to alter it. You have doubtless found it difficult to reconcile the different opinions in your body. Will it not be impossible then, to reconcile those which will arise amongst numerous assemblies in the different States? It is possible there never may be a general consent to the project as it goes out; but it is absolutely certain there will never be an agrement in amendments. It is the lot of but few to be able to descern the remote principles upon which their happiness & prosperity essentially depend---; the many must be asked to consent to, but not(6) ""

 Dear Sir New York Augt. 12. 1787. I shall be fully agreed in appointing Major Sargent Secretary, &c.(1) but a number of respectable characters are going into the Western Country from the Easten States, among which, I think, some proper characters for Judges will be found. I am but very little acquainted with Major Turner(2)---;but I can in this, and on other occasions place confidence in your opinion. I think it is probable, that no settlements will be made in that Country this fall, and therefore, Congress will for sometime delay the appointment of Officers(3)---;in the mean time several gentlemen may be presented for the vacant offices, and we may consider the characters, and direct the elections as may appear to be most politic and prudent. Much will depend on the directions given to the first settlements in my opinion, and as the Eastern States for the sake of doing away the temporary government, &c. established 1784 and for establishing some order in that Country, gave up as much as could be reasonably expected, I think it Will be Just and proper in them to establish as far as they can, consistently Eastern politics in it, especially in the State adjoining Pennsylvania. You are informed, I presume, of the terms of the Ohio contract---;all circumstances considered I think they are advantageous to the public. Doctor Holten left this place last Friday to return to Massachusetts, which broke up Congress. I wished him very much to have postpone[d] his Journey but we could not prevail upon him to do it---;indeed he was too unwell a man to be here and attend to business. I imagine it will be with great difficulty that he can reach home. I am very sorry he was obliged to leave Congress not only as it leaves the State unrepresented but as it has deprived me of an agreeable Colleague. The Dr. you know is not a man able to do a great deal of business, but he is a polite, agreeable man, and a man of sound good politics. We shall probably have a Congress to morrow, and I believe for  August 12, 1787  the first time not one New England State upon the floor. I wish you would inform me as soon as you conveniently can, what prospect there is of our States be[ing] represented, and when. It depends entirely on your or Mr. Gorham's taking a seat in Congress. There is no prospect of Dr. Holten's returning---;if neither of you can attend for 4 or 5 weeks to come, I think it will be best for me in the entermediate time to make a short visit to Massa. as my private concerns now make it almost absolutely necessary I should. I am now the only member in Congress from the 4 Eastern States. There are now before Congress several objects respecting Indian affairs, &c, respecting Mr. Adam's return to America, and directing in what manner the affairs of our legation at the Court of London shall be conducted after his return, the requisition &c, &c which we never ought to leave entirely to the Southern & Middle States---;it is evidently the object of several gentlemen to put the affairs of our Legation at London in to the hands of Mr. Jefferson.(4) This is a thing we can by no means agree to. As to other foreign matters we have pretty well dispatched them for the present. Instructions are gone to Mr. Jefferson respecting the Consulate, & to Mr. Adams respecting the infractions of the treaty as reported by Mr. Jay nearly. The necessary measures respecting the Morocco treaty have been taken;(5) proper letters to the Empire & the King of Spain, &c, have been sent---;some measures relative to our house at the Hage,(6) prisoners at Al[gie]rs, &c. We have allowed depreciation to the marine as reported by the board(7)---;and finally settled D. Campbell's affairs---;and allowed him the pay of a D quarter master.(8) We have limited the time for bringing claims against the union &c &c.---;measures not deserving any particular notice. Bruce has come forward with Jackson's accounts, and in order to Get the board of Treasury to pay a part of the balance due to him which he says is about10,000 Dollars---;Massa having paid Â£4,000 Law.

 Sir New York [August 13, 1787](1) The want of a due Representation in Congress, so frequently as it has happened, and for a length of time together, has very greatly embarrassed the Affairs of the Union, and given much dissatisfaction to the States which generally keep their Representations up, as well as disgust to the Members who attend from those States. It has been very often complained of, and the States not represented pressed to send their Delegates forward; too often, I am sorry to be obliged to observe, Sir, with very little Effect, although it must be obvious that, independent of the great national Concerns which thereby suffer an inconvenient, at least, if not a disgraceful Delay, their own particular Interests run some risque from public Measures being adopted without the Aid of their Counsels. August 13, 1787  What, Sir, must the Nations of the World Think of Us when they shall be informed that we have appointed an Assembly and invested it with the sole and exclusive power of Peace and War, and the management of all national Concerns, and, during the Course of almost a whole Year, it has not been capable, except for a few Days, for want of a sufficient number of Members, to attend to these matters. Since the first Monday in Novr. last to this time there has been a representation of nine States only thirty Days, and of ten States only three Days. And, as the Representation of most of the States has consisted of only two Persons, no great Business could be done without the unanimous Consent of every individual Member. We are now Sir reduced to six States altho' matters of the highest Importance are pressing for a Decision, and cannot be long delayed without committing the Dignity of the Government, and exposing the Peace and safety of several of the States. Besides, Sir, the national Convention, to which the People look up for much good will soon rise, and it appears to be of great Consequence that, when their Report comes under the consideration of Congress, it should be a full Congress and the important Business which will be laid before them meet with no unnecessary Delay. The Secretary wrote, not long ago to the unrepresented States,(2) but no Effect has yet appeared to follow from it. I must therefore again repeat the Request, and in the most pressing terms, that your Excellency will use every means in your power to hasten forward the Delegates of your State.

In my last letter to your brother of Stratford(2) I mentioned a request to you that I will here repeat, least that letter should not have reached him before you left Westmoreland.(3) I requested him to inform you that when my first quarter ended, which would be on the 13th of September, I should, thro you, forward my Account to the Treasurer of that quarters wages, with an account also, of what should be due at the close of the federal year in November, which will be about Â£112 our currency---;And requesting that you would be so good as make provision for making me a remittance of that sum when you should receive my accounts aforesaid.

But the other No. 681, 679, 682 Being issued by Em. Grant Q.M. And he not having Made his Return and untill he does make his return (that is I suppose renders an account) in this office Nothing can be done. I therefore return you the Certificates With this Information for you or Yates to do as you Judge best. In Respect to Congress this is now About a fortnight there has not been Seven States. I am somtimes not without my suspitions (you know I am a Suspitious Man) that it may give waith to the Measures of the Convention. Mr King was here the begining of the week before last told me the Convention would he supposed Report by the first of September, last week it was reported (in the Congress Room) that a Misunderstanding had happnd In the Convention that they were now so far from Agreeing that it would be a doubt wether they would Agree in time so as that this Congress can take up the Matter. Since I have been informed that there is an Additional Difficulty Ariseing from the Massachusets Members, All Along four have Attended, one of the four (I Suppose a high flier) is gone home the Others Refussing to agree to what was Intended to be reported. These are Information I have Picked up from the Members of Congress and I begin to Suspect that the Secrecy has a Stronger operation  August 29, 1787  upon me (my sentiments being so Well known) as upon others that Differ. Upon the whole I believe you had better not make this public as coming from me but to keep it among the frnds it may be good information to Yates & Lansing. I am well. I wish you All so and Remain your Obedient Humb Srt, Abm. Yates Jnr(4) ""

 Dr Sir N York Augt. 31st. 1787. Inclosed is a Stragling letter which has found it's way to this place.(1) I have recieved your favor & shall pay every attention to the case of Majr. Turner. His chance with respect to the Secretaryship is absolutely desperate; he must therefore be nominated for a Judges seat. This he has agreed to himself as appears by a letter to Mr. Carrington.(2) Judge Symms of Jersey yesterday made an application for All that tract of country lying between the Great & little Miami the East & West line & the Ohio supposed about two millions of acres, on the same terms with the Eastern Ohio Compy. His application has met with the intire approbation of the Members present: & there is no doubt but as soon [as] there is a Congress that this contract will be closed.(3) A Commee. is appointed to draught an Ordnance for indiscriminate locations, but a difficulty has occurred which I fear will destroy the whole affair: the Commee don't know what the deficiency is on the Cumberland river & have figured to their timorous & suspicious imaginations that the Virginia officers & soldiers mean to take eight  September 1, 1787  or ten million of acres, between the Scioto & Miami. The Commee. also contend that the State of Virga. should make proof of the deficiency of good lands on the Cumberland; should ascertain the quantity they want or have a right to on the Northern side of the Ohio; & should then take that quantity in one body. I wish you would speak to our Governor on the subject. Perhaps it may be in his power shortly to obtain information of the quantity claimed by the Officers & Soldiers on the other side of the Ohio.(4) If this fact was known other difficulties might perhaps be got over as I apprehend it is not very considerable.

 My Dear Sir(1) New York, Sept. 1. 1787. Your letter of the 23d of October, 1785, came to hand only a few weeks ago, and it is the only one since that from Hamburg. You may  September 1, 1787  therefore suppose I had almost given you up for lost. Tho' I do not readily despair, yet I had a thousand conjectures---;among these the Extravagant one, that you were gone to Kauskatea, Exploring territory---;another lately, that you might have accompanied your sovereign in her Southern tour. But I am very agreeably disappointed by finding you safe & snug at home. I hope, too, in full possession of an Empress of your own, together with all the Enjoyment that matrimonial connection can possibly afford. The Dutchman brought me Pierce's final Settlement notes, which together with another for arrears I got added, made in the whole 1000---;these I loaned to the State of Pennsylvania, & took her certificate on interest in lieu---;this bore interest, & was regularly paid for two years---;these funded, as they were called, were up at one time to 8s. 4d. in the pound, but lately a hue & cry has been raised that Penna. has taken on herself more than her proportion of the national debt, and of course this funding law must be repealed. Whether it will or not is yet undetermined. But be this as it may, Certificates of this description are now as low as half a dollar in the pound. Still the Continentals, not adopted or funded by any State, are yet lower; they are 2s. 6d. I have therefore determined to sell out of Penna. Stocks & purchase one thousand dollars Continentals; these will purchase one thousand acres of land between the Scioto & Miami on the bank of the Ohio, where a company have purchased 5,000,000 of acres, at one dollar in Certificates; this Company being well organized, and intend actually to make Strong Settlements very soon, I thought it the best mode of investing this sum: there will be about twenty dollars specie to be added for expense of Settlement, Surveying, &c. Genl. Parsons, of Connecticut, is one of the directors of this Company and most of the principals will be officers of the Eastern States. After all the necessary Expenses & investiture I expect tohave remaining of yours in my hands some more than $300,(2) yet funded in Pennsa.---;with these it is probable I should purchase a plantation for you on French Creek, or the Beaver, or some good communication into the West, near the old Settlements. The Yankees talk of moving 5000 strong into their new territory next Spring, in one body. They are proceeding very regularly. This will make your 1000 acres valuable in a few years. I have two patents in your name for you, 200 acres Each, Penna. Donation Land; & there will be 200 added to the thousand in the Compy., your Share from the United States: So that when I make the purchase I intend in Penna. you will have, in the whole, about 2000 acres: then all of your certificates that have come to my hands will be disposed of, & I hope to good advantage in the end---;as the land will increase in value more than the interest of the Certificates in the uncertain State of things. Many persons begin to think of purchasing Western lands: Congress   have proposals now before them for 20,000,000, exclusive of the company already mentioned of which you are to be a member. I hope you have not sent Depreciation Notes as they have not reached me---; nor any other account of them, except what you say relative to your intention of sending them the succeeding Spring, to your letter of the 23d Octr. 1785: there is much danger of their being lost, if you sent them, so much time has elapsed; & yet if they should be as long by the way as the last letter, they will yet turn up: that letter was forwarded & endorsed from London by Jo. Christian Splitgerber & Co. the 18th Feby., 1786; Mr. Matthew Irvine took it out of the Post Office the day it arrived there & forwarded it to me. I cannot procure the discharge you mention from our Service---;but should suppose the Resolution of Congress, authenticated, will be sufficient, I mean that for disbanding the army. With respect to a discharge, the brevet cannot at this moment be procured---;perhaps it may at a future day, not long hence. The loss of the Certificate of your being a member of the Cincinnati, will be amply compensated by the Diploma herewith transmitted: there is no rank mentioned in any, not even the highest---; yours is verbatim with a Major General. As to the Medal & picture you mention, they must be deferred till some future conveyance. There is no vessel at this port for Hamburg, and have just snatched the opportunity to convey this by Commodore Paul Jones, who sails tomorrow for France, & promises to forward this to Hamburg---;or he may probably send it from Denmark, where he has business. Your surprizing me on the banks of the Beaver, I presume is now out of the question, particularly if your matrimonial Scheme has been Effected; but your land in that quarter will be a good reserve for one Son by the time he is of age. By-the-by, when I was in that country last year---; for I was appointed to explore the Donation Lands for the Penna. Line, I searched the Shinango branch ofBeaver half a day for your rifle, without Effect, that was the Creek you struck as you returned, from the (supposed) Cuyahoga. Sundry alterations have been proposed at the General Meetings of the Society of Cincinnatus, referred to the several State meetings---;some adopted entirely, some partially, & some adhered strictly to the original. The General Meeting last May did no business for a variety of reasons, which would be too voluminous to relate in the bounds of a letter; they adjourned, however, till next May. The institution is becoming less obnoxious; indeed, it is more & more forgot daily---;& I would not swear that by saying or seeming to think little about it, a favorable moment may not arrive to Establish it fully without even a murmur against it. The U.S., or the mercantile part of the people have felt severely the cramped or restrained state of trade, for nothing would serve them but they must throw almost the whole into Britain again---; who by acts   of Parliament as well as acts of almost Every individual Briton, who had it in his power, have made their vessels the carriers as well of their goods to America, as well as of the American produce in return. In this situation, a year ago, a Convention was proposed & past, did most in order to persuade & prevail on the several Legislatures to invest Congress with full power to regulate everything relative to trade. They did nothing decisive, but recommended some things; the result has been, that a General Convention has met, & are now sitting at Philadelphia, who are instructed to propose regulations for trade---; not only so, but likewise to revise the Confederation itself---;which, however, they have not power finally to determine on, but only to submit the proposed alterations and amendments, first to Congress---; who, if they approve, are to submit them to the Several States for their final determination. General Washington is President of the Convention---;they have sat ever since the Month of May; it is said they will rise in two weeks from this time. Many are sanguine that a good Government will be framed---;some are determined to oppose, whatever it may be---;but as a great majority seemed convinced, that considerable changes are necessary, I hope some tolerable plan will be accepted. The only danger of miscarriage, I think, is, that the Convention will be for making so perfect a Government, as to leave no room for future amendments---;or, in other words, to alarm too much the great sticklers for liberty. The Eastern States are almost clamorous for strong Executive Government: this may be thought Extraordinary---;but it is nevertheless true. At Boston last winter there were violent commotions, indeed even rebellion, which you have doubtless heard not a little of. There was at one time 7000 insurgents embodied in the depth of winter under a certain Shay---;they had a long string of grievances, among these, oppression of lawyers, Speculators, tax-gatherers, &c. &c.  But themilitia were, after many talks, town-meetings, & consultations, turned out, & headed chiefly by old Continental officers---;among the most conspicuous of these were old Lincoln, Shepherd, & Brooks. There was considerable marching and manoeuvering for two weeks, but the insurgents, at last suffered themselves to be surprized & totally routed---;since which every thing has been perfectly quiet. This was really an exertion of military, against their brethren too, that few people here had an idea of---;and in Europe I dare say, it will be deemed absolutely false. But I assure you it is well authenticated that the Militia under Genl. Lincoln marched thirty miles in nine hours in the night in a severe snow storm---;when many were actually frozen---;& without refreshment rushed on the insurgents with bayonets. It is true, there was little opposition; but I believe it is no less true, that not many militia under similar circumstances, would even make the attempt.  When circumstances render any probable Success in trade, I will answer the queries you put---;in the meantime suffice to inform you that the Ships to the East Indies from America have been remarkably successful. I believe ten have returned. Sloops of 60 tons have gone to the Cape. China produce is plenty & cheap, but green tea is sold here for a dollar a pound. It is now time to tell you how I came to date my letter from New York. Congress sit in this city, & I am in the delegation this year from our State---;so is Genl. St. Clair---;& young Armstrong---;So you see the Cincinnati are not quite laid aside. Direct to me at the old place, Carlisle---;where it is more than probable I shall be buried. I have built a tolerable house there---;not to be buried, but to live in. I will be anxious to hear from you. I make a tour yearly to Fort Pitt, & next Spring I believe I will see Lake Erie pretty high up. I am, dr. Sir, most Sincerely yrs., Wm. Irvine P.S. I am at some loss to know how you manage to receive letters by the old address. Will it be proper to continue that---;or in future by the present proper one---;signify this in your next. Money is very Scarce, but it is more artificial than real; occasioned in a great degree by several of the States issuing paper money, which invariably depreciates, be the funds for its redemption ever so good. In Penna., for instance they made Â£150,000, the whole revenue of the State, pledged by law for the redemption of it---; Â£20,000 to be redeemed annually & burned. This law has been punctually complied with, in all respects, and yet it has depreciated 20 per cent. It has been uniformly taken by the State for lands, taxes, impost, and indeed all debts to the State it was a legal tender---;but not a tender in any other case; no individual was obliged to take it. The holders of public securities, however, tho' not obliged by law to receive it, yet they had no alternative but go without. I mean for annual interest: this was among thereasons for appropriating yours, or converting them into land, which cannot depreciate. Septr. 6th. Commodore Jones being detained longer than he expected, gives me an opportunity to inform you more minutely the State of my negotiations with your property. I have this day sold out part of your stock in the Penna. funds, & purchased 1,000 Continental dollars---;these I have subscribed in the Ohio Company, as your Attorney---;& paid in the necessary proportion of Specie to defray contingent Expenses. When a payment is made into the U.S. Treasury, a new certificate will issue for the Amount of interest due on them---;as nothing but principle is taken as payment for land. How much this will amount to, I cannot exactly say, but suppose something upwards of $100---;this you will have the U.S. for. Then beside that, there will remain in my hands Certificates of Penna. as already mentioned, to purchase the Penna. farm. The interest already drawn from Penna. has  September 1, 1786  augmented the fund so much (which I have also thrown into the Company) as to obtain an addition of 333 acres---;so that your share in the Company, including your right as an officer, 1533 acres, Exclusive of your four hundred acres in Penna, for which I have patents---;200 acres of which I almost forgot to tell you is on a branch of French Creek, & one on Oil Creek---;for these a lottery was drawn---;one No. 1119, the other 1352. As soon as the whole is patented, I will inform you, in order to take your direction whether to Send them to you & by what mode of Conveyance. If Jones should tarry a few days longer, I will probably have something new to add: In the meantime, Mrs. Irvine was well a few days ago, & so were the children. By-the-by, we have another girl, near two years old, more charming than any of the others. We are harrassed by my brother & his wife of Carolina, to let them have Nancy, which we have not yet consented. Saml. McKay of Pittsburg called on me yesterday, with much news from that place---;too much to relate; but this brings to my mind what I am sure you will laugh heartily at---;that is, that the said Sam's mother is married to an old invalid Englishman, whom nobody knows---;but she has to nurse & support him. And Bayard is actually married to Betsey, & takes the new store at the ferry on Monongahela. John Ward married Polly Boyd. Poor Finley remains an old bachelor. John Hughes is rather sickly, but has increased his property surprisingly, & is building a house opposite John Montgomery, which cannot cost less than Â£1,000---;his Betsey is as fat as a wapping landlady, a British sailor would say, or a Flandersman. John Finley sent me a pair of fine mockasons for you a few weeks after your departure---;I am sorry I have them not at this place, or would send them by this conveyance. Sept. 24th. Com. Jones is here yet, which affords me this early opportunity of furnishing you with the sundry enclosures---;some of them will be acceptable.The new Constitution will meet some opposition, but I expect it will work its way in a few months---;it will require years to feel the benefit. You find by the report of the Committee of the Ohio Company, that I could not well throw your property into better hands. You will have a City & out-lot. In haste, W.I. ""

14376,dg024351,1787,Richard Henry Lee to Edmund Randolph,"""Richard Henry Lee to Edmund Randolph
 Dear Sir,(1) New York September 1st. 1787 By a letter and some enclosures (lately received by the Delegates) from our Executive; it appears that in May last our Treasurer tendered Mr. Hopkins(2) Indents for something more than 170,000 dollars upon the requisition of 1786---;That he refused to receive them because they were not accompanied with the proper proportion of specie. By the requisition of Congress, the Loan Officers are expressly bound to do so. In consequence of that refusal, it seems, those indents have remained at our risk, and we continue on the Federal books as delinquent for the large sum of 1,425,767.77 dollars. But I think Sir it will be seen, by investigating this subject with attention, that not only the above sum tenderd and refused, but whatever indents may since have been in the Treasury (and it is probable that by this time a further large sum has been paid in) maybe paid to Mr. Hopkins consistently with the acts of Congress, and thereby be removed from our risk, besides lessening the large ballance that now appears against us. Of the several requisitions heretofore made by Congress, none remain at this time to be considered but that of the 4th & 10th of September 1782, and the three subsequent ones of 1784, 1785, & 1786. The first of these was for 1,200,000 dollars for paying interest on the domestic debt. Of this requisition Virginia was quota'd 174,000 dollars, and she was at liberty to apply as much as should be necessary of that sum to discharge the interest of Continental Loan Office certificates, or of Liquidated debts of the U. States due in the State. Virginia stands on the Treasury book here as having paid of this requisition, nothing. The next in order is the requisition of 1784, where the quota assigned to Virginia is 538,693.47 dollars & ninetieths; of which sum, one fourth part or 134,673.34 dollars might be paid in Certificates of interest by the terms of the requisition: And by a resolve of Congress October the 12th 1785 page 356 of the Journal,(3) theIndents issued under the requisition of 1785 may be paid for the whole of the above sum of 134,673.34 dollars, or one fourth of the said requisition of 1784. Of this requisition Virginia has paid 407,511.30 in Specie, and  September 1, 1787  38,231.25 Indents. By which mode of payment she has paid more of specie than was required by 3,491.17 dollars, and less of Indents than she might, by 96,442.9 dollars. The question now is, whether it will not be advisable to pay Mr. Hopkins Indents to the amount of 96,442.9 dollars and so close the requisition of 1784 completely? Having done this, and sent forward the Account so settled, with the Loan Officers receipt for the 96,442.9 dollars, Virginia will stand on the Treasury books here as having overpaid the requisition of 1784 by 3,491.17 specie dollars. But, at the same time that this account shall be transmitted, notice to the Treasury-board of the Union might accompany it stating, that the above 3,491.17 specie dollars would be carried to the States credit upon the specie requisition of 1785. This will cover two thirds of the sum in Indents agreably to the requisition of 1785. The ballance of all the indents in the possession of our Treasurer above what shall be necessary to close the requisition of 1784, may either be applied, without specie, to satisfy the requisition of Septr. 1782; or they may go (as the Executive shall choose) to the requisition of 1785 which requisition (see journal of Congress Septr. 27th 1785 Page 310) quotas Virginia to 512,974 dollars.(4) Of which sum, two thirds on 341,983 dollars may be paid in Indents, if accompanied by one third, or 170,991 specie dollars. Of this requisition Virginia is credited with sundry specie payments amounting in the whole to 51,596.71 dollars; but she is only credited for having paid 19,095.10 Indents, altho the above sum of specie will warrant the payment of 103,193.52 Indents exclusive of the ballance of 3,441 dollars specie overpaid of the 84 requisition. And this is the more surprising, as it is stated in one of the enclosures from the Executive as before observed, that more than 170,000 dollars of Indents had been, in May last, tender'd to, and refused by Mr. Hopkins. His refusal could only have been founded on these Indents beingoffered for the requisition of 1786, which could not have been so receivd. unaccompanied with the proportion of specie that is directed by the said requisition. Whereas, if those Indents, on a much larger sum of them had been offered upon the requisitions of 1782, 1784 & 1785 they might have been received on Congressional principles, and the State credited therewith. For, if this business had been transacted as is here stated, instead of being credited only for 51,596.71 specie dollars & 19,095.10 Indents upon the requisition of 1785; our credit would be for 55,087.71 specie dollars & 10,175.52 Indents without dispute with the Loan Officer. Proceeding in this manner, there will still be a large ballance due from Virginia to the U. States on the requisition of 1785---;the same being of Indents 231,807.38 and of specie 115,903.2---;Which being added to the requisition of 1782 for 174,000, and the requisition of 1786 which remains   (after deducting 493 dollars paid upon this requisition) 645,350 dollars; and will make the whole of our debt upon the several requisitions of 82, 84, 85 & 86 equal to 1,167,060.57 dollars specie & Indents inclusive---;Which is 258,707.20 dollars less than we now stand charged on the books of the federal treasury, where the sum stated, is 1,425,767.77 dollars as mentioned in the first part of this letter. The difference may arise from our Indents not having been paid, and from a mistake of Office here, in charging us with our full share of the half of 8 millions required in Octr. 1781, without deducting the payments made previous to the requisition of 1784 as Congress has done. See the Journal 27 April 1784.(5) Before I quit this subject, permit me Sir to observe that only so many Indents as were in the Treasury on or before the 1st of Jany. 1787 can be paid on the requisition of 1785 as is directed by that requisition---;So that 130,654 Indents (the sum in the Treasury of the State on the 1st of Jany. last) should be appropriated to the requisition of 1785, and the ballance, whatever it may be, already paid in; may be applied as hath been already mentioned. Pardon me Sir for the long letter that I have written. My only motive being to remove existing doubts, and to prevent such in future as I see are productive of public inconveniences. The account that I have stated will more concisely place in view the ideas herein contended for than could easily be done in writing. I am happy to hear that your business in Convention is near a close. You have had a hard time of it---;And I hope you will be rewarded with the thanks of this and future generations. I have the honor to be, with all possible respect and esteem, dear Sir Your affectionate and obedient servant, Richard Henry Lee. P.S. I have observed that Mr. Hopkins refused the Indents offer'd to him because they were unaccompanied by Specie. He might have urged another reason, that no Indents but those issued under therequisition of 1786 could have been received in discharge of that requisition; and you know that we were not provided with any of those.

It is respecting the domestic Debt. I find many of the States are making provision to buy in their Quota's of the final Settlements, and I most ardently wish that the Towns in New Hampshire may be so far awake to a sense of their Interest as to part with their property freely in order to purchase their several Quota's of the public Securities now in circulation, while they are to be had at the present low rate; which is in this place, at two shillings and six pence on the pound. If they suffer the present opportunity to pass, and we should be so fortunate as to have an efficient Gover[n]ment, they will be obliged to buy them of Brokers, Hawkers, Speculators & Jockeys, at six or perhaps at eight times their present value.

 Dear Sir, New York September the 3d 1787 Since my letter to you of December 1785 from Chantilly in Virginia(1)  September 3, 1787  in answer to the letters that you were pleased to write me on the 26th of August, 6th & 7th of September 1785; I have not been honored with any letter from you. On my arrival here I met with, and read with great pleasure your book on the American governments.(2) The judicious collection that you have made, with your just reflections thereon, have reached America at a great Crisis, and will probably have their proper influence in forming the federal government now under consideration. Your labor may therefore have its reward in the thanks of this and future generations. The present federal system, however well calculated it might have been for its designed ends if the States had done their duty, under the almost total neglect of that duty, has been found quite inefficient and ineffectual. The government must be both Legislative and Executive, with the former power paramount to the State Legislatures in certain respects essential to federal purposes. I think there is no doubt but that this Legislature will be recommended to consist of the triple ballance, if I may use the expression, to signify a compound of the three simple forms acting independently, but forming a joint determination. The executive (which will be part of the legislative) to have more duration and power enlarged beyond the present. This seems to be the plan expected, and generally spoken of---;I say expected, because the Convention is yet sitting, and will continue so to do until the middle of this month. I was appointed to that Assembly, but being a Member of Congress where the plan of Convention must be approved, there appeard an inconsistency for Members of the former to have Session in the latter and so pass judgement at New York upon their opinion at Philadelphia. I therefore declined going to Convention and came here; where we have lately contracted for the sale of six millions of Acres on the N.W. side of Ohio in the ceded territory, for lessening the domestic debt---;And now, another offer is made for two millions more.(3)I hope we shall at least be able to extinguish the domestic debt created by the late war, which is by far the greatest part of the debt. So many of our Members have lately gone from hence to the Convention, that we have had but 5 States in Congress for a month past, which has prevented any determination on your application to return. It seems at present to be very doubtful whether there will be any Resident appointed to the Court where you are---;some being for a Minister, some for a ChargÃ©, and some for neither---;But a Consul only. How it will terminate can scarcely be conjectured yet.(4) Permit me now Sir to entreat your attention and good offices in the following affair. Mr. Thomas Steptoe, concerning whom I formerly wrote to you, dyed on shipboard as he was returning home from the East Indies either in 1784 or 1785, and we are not certain whether he was on a Danish or a Sweedish ship, but it was one of these. Captain Miller who gave me this intelligence by letter, and who is now up the Baltic, was   not certain to which of these nations the Ship belonged. But he said it was supposed that Mr. Steptoe had a considerable property. His heirs in Virginia having heard nothing concerning this property, apprehen'd that it has been secured by the Officers of the Ship wherein he dyed. The want of exact information concerning Mr. Steptoes affairs will render it difficult to procure redress. Perhaps a proper enquiry among those people in London who trade with the East Indies, may furnish some light upon this business. Or an application to the Danish & Swedish Ministers at the Court of London might cause an enquiry to be made in their respective countries, so as that the holders of his property fearing detection, may come forward and honestly deliver up this gentlemans effects---;And inform if he left any Will. It is not improbable that he left a will somewhere, which if procured would regulate the descent of his Virginia estate. I shall be singularly obliged to you my dear Sir if you will interest yourself in this business, and let me know the success of your enquiries.(5) My complements, if you please to Colo. Smith; and affectionate regards to my Nephew Shippen. With every sentiment of esteem and friendship I am dear Sir, sincerely yours, Richard Henry Lee ""

 Philada. Sepr. 4. 1787. \""The Convention has not yet broken up but its Session will probably continue but a short time longer. Its proceedings are still under the injunction of secresy. We hear that a spirit of insurrection has shewn itself in the County of Green Briar. Some other Counties have been added by Report as infected with the same spirit; but the silence of the letters from Richmond on this latter fact, gives us hopes that the Report is not well founded. We understand also that the upper parts of the Country have suffered extremely from the drought, and that the crops will not suffice for the subsistence of the inhabitants. I hope the account is exaggerated, and wait with some impatience for a confirmation of this hope. The crops of wheat in this quarter have been uncommonly fine, and the latter rains have been so seasonable for the corn that the prospect of that crop is tolerably good. The price of good Tobo. here at present is 40/ Virga money. As soon as the tie of secresy shall be dissolved I will forward the proceedings of the Convention.\"" ""

 My dear Sir, New York Sept. 5. 1787 The absence of Mrs. Colden, who went to the highlands about the time you left us, and did not return until a short time ago, occasioned some delay in the formal entry of her, as well as my name, on Major Platts list.(1) This was however done a few days ago for five shares each, but lest some arrangements may possibly have taken place to the Eastward, confining the benefits of the first location, to the subscribers of a given Sum, say that which is mentioned for the first payment in the Resolve of Congress, and having no views of adventuring at all unless we can come into the first location, we have taken the precaution to annex that condition to our subscriptions. We have no particular reasons to suppose this a necessary Step but thought it could do no harm, in case it should not be necessary. We hear your subscriptions fill up fast in Massachusetts, and are flattered with hopes that a respectable settlement will go out this fall. Some wealthy Men, such as McComb, Edgar, Fleming &c. of this place, have subscribed with Platt. These will give weight to the adventure as they will be able to push the settlements. We have never had a Congress since you left us, of consequence no appointments have taken place for the Western Government. Turner, upon being informed that you was his competitor, has declined his pretensions for the Secretariship, nor do I hear of any other who is about to come forward---;such is the effect of your great merit, that all opposition shrinks from before you. Mrs. C---;---; still continues to rest her hopes upon you. I know not how it is, but somehow or other, you have impressed her with an opinion that you are a very honest fellow, and what else she thinks of you I dare not say---;you are already vain enough. When shall we see you in New York? I am my dear Sir, Your Afft. Humbl Servt.,  Ed. Carrington September 6, 1787  ""

 Philada. Sepr. 6. 1787. \""My last was intended for the Augst. Packet and put into the hands of Commodore Jones. Some disappointments prevented his going, and as he did not know but its contents might be unfit for the ordinary conveyance, he retained it.(1) The precaution was unnecessary. For the same reason the delay has been of little consequence. The rule of secresy in the Convention rendered that as it will this letter barren of those communications which might otherwise be made. As the Convention will shortly rise I should feel little scruple in disclosing what will be public here, before it could reach you, were it practicable for me to guard by Cypher against an intermediate discovery. But I am deprived of this resource by the shortness of the interval between the receipt of your letter of June 20(2) and the date of this. This is the first day which has been free from Committee service both before & after the hours of the House, and the last that is allowed me by the time advertised for the sailing of the Packet. \""The Convention consists now as it has generally done of Eleven States. There has been no intermission of its Sessions since a house was formed; except an interval of about ten days allowed a Committee appointed to detail the general propositions agreed on in the House. The term of its dissolution cannot be more than one or two weeks distant. A Govermt. will probably be submitted to the {people of}(3) the {states} consisting of a [President](4) {cloathed} with {executive power}: a {Senate chosen} by the Legislatures, and another {house chosen} by the {people of} the {states} jointly {possessing} the {legislative power} and a regular {judiciary} establishment. The mode of constituting the {executive} is among the few points not yet finally settled. The {Senate} will consist of two {members} from each {state} and {appointed sexenially}: The other, of {members appointed biennially} by the {people of} the {states} in proportion to their number. The Legislative power will {extend to taxation,trade} and sundry other general matters. The powers of Congress will be {distributed} according to their {nature among the several departments}. The States will be {restricted from paper money} and in a {few other instances}. These are {the outlines}. The extent of them may perhaps surprize you. I hazard an opinion nevertheless that the {plan should} it {be adopted} will neither effectually {answer} its {national object} nor prevent the local {mischiefs} which every where {excite disgusts} agst the {state governments}. The grounds of this opinion will be the subject of a future letter. September 6, 1787  \""I have written to a friend in Congs.(5) intimating in a covert manner the necessity of deciding & notifying the intentions of Congs. with regard to their foreign Ministers after May next, and have dropped a hint on the communications of Dumas. \""Congress have taken some measures for disposing of the public land, and have actually sold a considerable tract. Another bargain I learn is on foot for a further sale. \""Nothing can exceed the universal anxiety for the event of the Meeting here. Reports and conjectures abound concerning the nature of the plan which is to be proposed. The public however is certainly in the dark with regard to it. The Convention is equally in the dark as to the reception wch. may be given to it on its publication. All the prepossessions are on the right side, but it may well be expected that certain characters will wage war against any reform whatever. My own idea is that the public mind will now or in a very little time receive any thing that promises stability to the public Councils & security to private rights, and that no regard ought to be had to local prejudices or temporary considerations. If the present moment be lost it is hard to say what may be our fate. \""Our information from Virginia is far from being agreeable. In many parts of the Country the drouth has been extremely injurious to the Corn. I fear, tho' I have no certain information, that Orange & Albemarle share in the distress. The people also are said to be generally discontented. A paper emission is again a topic among them. So is an instalment of all debts in some places and the making property a tender in others. The taxes are another source of discontent. The weight of them is complained of, and the abuses in collecting them still more so. In several Counties the prisons & Court Houses & Clerks offices have been wilfully burnt. In Green Briar the course of Justice has been mutinously stopped, and associations entered into agst. the payment of taxes. No other County has yetfollowed the example.(6) The approaching meeting of the Assembly will probably allay the discontents on one side by measures which will excite them on another.\"" ""

 Sir, Philadelphia September 18th. 1787. In the Course of four Months Severe and painful application and Anxiety, the Convention have prepared a plan of Government for the United States of America which we hope will Obviate the defects of the present FOEderal union and procure the enlarged purposes which it was intended to effect. Inclosed we have the honor to send you a Copy,(1) and when you are pleased to lay this plan before the General Assembly we entreat that you will do us the justice to assure that honorable body that no exertions have been wanting on our part to guard & promote the particular Interest of North Carolina. You will Observe that the representation in the Second Branch of the National Legislature is to be According to numbers, that is to say, According to the whole Number of white Inhabitants added to three fifths of the blacks; You will also Observe that during the first three years North Carolina is to have five Members in the House of Representatives, which is just one thirteenth part of the whole Number in that house and our Annual Quota of the National debt has not hitherto been fixed quite so high. Doubtless we have reasons to believe that the Citizens of North Carolina are more than a Thirteenth part of the whole Number in the Union, but the State has never enabled its Delegates in Congress to prove this Opinion and hitherto they had not been zealous to magnify the Number of their Constituents because their Quota of the National Debt must have been Augmented Accordingly. We had many things to hope from a national Government and the Chief thing we had to fear from Such a Government was the Risque of unequal or heavy Taxation but we hope You will believe as we do that the Souther[n] States in General and North Carolina in particular are well secured on that head by the proposed System. It is provided in the 9th Section of Article the first that no Capitation or other direct Tax shall be laid except in proportion to the Number of Inhabitants, in which Number five Black's areonly Counted as three. If a land Tax is laid we are to pay at the Same rate, for Example, fifty Citizens of North  September 18, 1787  Carolina can be taxed no More for all their Lands than fifty Citizens in one of the eastern States. This must be greatly in our favour for as Most of their Farms are Small & many of them live in Towns, we certainly have, one with another, land of twice the Value that they possess. When it is also considered that five Negroes are only to be charged the Same Poll Tax as three whites the advantage must be considerably increased. Under the Proposed Form of Government the Southern States have also a much better Security for the Return of Slaves who might endeavour to escape than they had under the Original Confederation. It is expected a Considerable Share of the National Taxes will be Collected by Imposts, Duties, and Excises but You will find it provided in the 8th Section of Article the first that all duties, Imposts and, excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. While we were taking so much care to guard ourselves against being overreached and to form rules of Taxation that might opperate in our favour, it is not to be Supposed that our Northern Brethren were inattentive to their particular Interest. A navigation Act or the power to regulate Commerce in the Hands of the National Government by which American Ships and Seamen may be fully employed is the desirable weight that is thrown into the Northern Scale. This is what the Southern States have given in Exchange for the Advantages we Mentioned above; but we beg leave to Observe in the Course of this Interchange North Carolina does not Appear to us to have given any thing; for we are doubtless the most independent of the Southern States; we are able to carry our own produce and if the Spirit of Navigation and Ship building is cherished in our State we Shall Soon be able to carry for our Neighbours. We have taken the liberty to mention the general pecuniary Considerations which are involved in this Plan of Government, there are other Considerations of great Magnitude involved in the System but we cannot exercise Your patience with afurther Detail; but Submit it with the Utmost deference and have the Honor to be, Your Excellency's Most Obedient Huml.

 Philada. Sepr. 20. 1787. \""The privilege of franking having ceased with the Convention, I have waited for this opportunity of inclosing you a copy of the proposed Constitution for the U. States.(1) I forbear to make any observations on it; either on the side of its merits or its faults. The best Judges of both will be those who can combine with a knowledge of the collective & permanent interest of America, a freedom from the bias resulting from a participation in the work. If the plan proposed be worthy of adoption, the degree of unanimity attained in the Convention is a circumstance as fortunate, as the very respectable dissent on the part of Virginia is a subject of regret. The double object of blending a proper stability & energy in the Government with the essential characters of the republican Form, and of tracing a proper line of demarkation between the national and State authorities, was necessarily found to be as difficult as it was desireable, and to admit of an infinite diversity concerning the means among those who were unanimously agreed concerning the end.\"" ""

 Dear Sir New York Septr. 20th. 1787 After so long an Attendance in Convention, the Session of the Assembly comes rather malaprop.(1) I do suppose however, that you will find yourself obliged to give some part of your time to it. I would beg leave therefore to mention to you one matter that I see as likely to come forward---;the Division of the County of Westmoreland.(2) Should that matter be pressed to a conclusion, but which, in my opinion is quite premature, and will not be followed, I am certain, by the Consequences that are expected from it, it will of course be necessary to fix upon some place for holding the Courts in the old County, for either Hannas Town or Greensburgh, very inconvenient at present, must then be out of the Question. I would propose a place on the loyal Hanning, below the mouth of the nine mile run, that used to be known by the name of Dagworthys breast Works. I am interested a little in this place being chosen, as the Land is mine. But were I not cer- September 20, 1787  tain that it is as convenient a place as any in the whole County, both with respect to situation, being very near the Center of what must be left, and every other convenience, as wood, Water, Stone and Coal, and the new laid out road passing through it, I would not propose it. That some little Advantage would arise to me from it I hope will not be an Objection. I am sure it will be a motive to you, and I think it should with some others. I will request the favour of you to mention it to some of our Friends, to whom also I would have written, but I am very ill able to do it, for this is the first time I have taken a penn in hand these six Weeks having been totally disabled in my right Hand by the Gout and even now write in great pain.

 My Dear Sir, New York Sept. 23. 1787 The Gentlemen who have arrived from the Convention inform us that you are on the way to join us(1) ---;least, however, you may, under a supposition that the State of the delegation is such as to admit of your absence, indulge yourself in leisurely movements, after the fatiguing time you have had, I take this precaution to apprise you that the same schism which unfortunately happened in our State in Philadelphia,(2) threatens us here also. One of our Colleagues Mr. R. H. Lee is forming propositions for essential alterations in the Constitution, which will, in effect, be to oppose it.(3) Another, Mr. Grayson, dislikes it, and is, at best for giving it only a Silent passage to the States. Mr. H. Lee(4) joins me in opinion that it ought to be warmly recommended to ensure its adoption. A lukewarmness in Congress will be made a ground of opposition by the unfreindly in the States. Those who have hitherto  September 23, 1787  wished to bring the conduct of Congress into contempt, will in this case be ready to declare it truly respectable. Next Wednesday is fixed for taking under consideration this business, and I ardently wish you could be with us. The New York faction is rather active in spreading the seeds of opposition---;this, however, has been expected, and will not make an impression so injurious as the same circumstance would in some other States. Colo. Hamilton has boldly taken his ground in the public papers and, having truth and propriety on his side, it is to be hoped he will stem the torrent of folly and inequity.(5) I do not implicitly accede, in sentiment, to every article of the scheme proposed by the convention, but I see not how my utmost wishes are to be gratified until I can withdraw from society. So long as I find it necessary to combine my strength and interests with others, I must be satisfied to make some sacrifices to the general accommodation.

 My Dear Son New York 25th Septr. 1787. I return'd here from Philadelphia last Wednesday, & on Sunday your good Mamma arrived in good health from Stratford. She left your Brother & Mrs. Kneeland in good health, Mr. Verplank, Betsy & Gilly having set out on Wednesday on a [vis]it to Mr Verplank at Fish Kill. I send you by this Conveyance several Copies of the Result of the  September 26, 1787  Convention,(1) & you will find two Copies in the Papers of the 21st Inst. which I presume will be sufficient for you & your Friends to amuse yourselves with. It is yet impossible to foresee what will eventually be the Fate of it with the People, we only know that it was very well received on its publication in Philadelphia, & most that we hear in this City, & from Connecticut, & N. Jersey is extremely favourable, but it is known that Parties are forming in almost every State to give it opposition, & it must be some time before we can know the Event. We have put on Board Capt. Dorrall a Bl & Box which Mamma bro't with her for you containing Roots, Garden Seeds, Pickles, & a Pot of Honey. The Roots I fear will hardly pay freight, however it will serve for an experiment. Mamma will send you some Pork as soon as the season for it arrives which is now approaching. I am now to decide with respect to the Presidency of the College here, which I was much pressed to accept of. I am yet undetermined, as the support is very moderate, & I must give up every other prospect, yet as Mamma inclines to it, it seems rather probable I shall undertake it. In this event I shoud be happy to have you or your Brother with me, & Stratford will be vacant for the others as Charles is yet so unpractised in the World it may perhaps be best for him to be yet for some time at least with me, & whether you would think it worth while to accept of Stratford I know not. As the prospect of practice in the Law is so indifferent there at present, I shoud hardly dare to recommend it to you, but shoud our new plan of Government be adopted there is reason to hope it might err long be better. I mention it therefore to you now merely as a matter of speculation which you can think of. I shall let you know my conclusion by the first opportunity, & wish extremely I could have had your Assistance in forming it. We also send you two Bls of Flour, & the News Papers.

 [September 28, 1787] You ask me for such information as I can, with propriety, give you, respecting the proceedings of the Convention: In my letter from Philadelphia, in July last,(1) I informed you that everything was covered with the veil of secrecy. It is now taken off, and the great work is presented to the public for their consideration. I enclose you a copy of it, with the letter which accompanies the Constitution.(2) You will probably be surprised at not finding my name affixed to it; and will, no doubt, be desirous of having a reason for it. Know then, Sir, that I was absent in New York on a piece of business so necessary that it became unavoidable.(3) I approve of its principles, and would have signed it with all my heart, had I been present. To say, however, that I consider it as perfect, would be to make an acknowledgment immediately opposed to my judgment. Perhaps it is the only one that will suit our present situation. The wisdom of the Convention was equal to something greater; but a variety of local circumstances, the inequality of states, and the dissonant interests of the different parts of the Union, made it impossible to give it any other shape or form. The great object of this new government is to consolidate the Union, and to give us the appearance and power of a nation. The inconvenience of the different states meeting on the footing of compleat equality, and as so many sovereign powers confederated, has been severely felt by the Union at large; and it is to remedy this evil that something like a national institution has become necessary. The condition of America demands a change; we must sooner or later be convulsed if we do not have some other government than the one under which we at present live. The old Federal Constitution is like a ship bearing under the weight of a tempest; it is trembling, and just on the point of sinking. If we have not another bark to take us up we shall all go down together. There are periods in the existence of a political society that requireprompt and decisive measures; I mean that point of time between a people's running into anarchy and an anx- September 28, 1788  ious state of the public mind to be rescued from its approaching mischiefs by the intervention of some good and efficient government. That is precisely the situation in which we seemed to be placed. A question then arises, shall we have this government, or shall we run into confusion? It is with the people to decide the alternative. I am well aware that objections will be made to this new government when examined in the different states; some will oppose it from pride, some from self-interest, some from ignorance, but the greater number will be of that class who will oppose it from a dread of its swallowing up the individuality of the states. Local circumstances will weigh against the general interest, and no respect will be paid to all the parts aggregated which compose the Confederacy. Good as well as bad men will probably unite their interest to oppose it, and some small convulsions may possibly happen in some of the states before it is adopted, but I am certain it is the ark that is to save us. I therefore hope and trust it will be accepted. It is a difficult point to concentrate thirteen different interests so as to give general and compleat satisfaction. But as individuals in society (to use an old hackneyed and well known principle) give up a part of their national rights to secure the rest, so the different states should render a portion of their interests to secure the good of the whole. Was this question proposed to each of the states separately, \""What kind of government is best calculated for the people of the United States?\"" there would be as many different opinions as there are different interests. It would be like the decisions of the seven wise men of Greece, who were called on, at the Court of Periander, to give their sentiments on the nature of a perfect commonwealth---;they all judged differently, but they all judged right, in the view each man had of it. Many objections have been already started to the Constitution because it was not founded on a Bill of Rights; but I ask howsuch a thing could have been effected; I believe it would have been difficult in the extreme to have brought the different states to agree in what probably would have been proposed as the very first principle, and that is, \""that all men are born equally free and independent.\"" Would a Virginian have accepted it in this form? Would he not have modified some of the expressions in such a manner as to have injured the strong sense of them, if not to have buried them altogether in ambiguity and uncertainty.  In my judgment, when there are restraints on power, to prevent its invading the positive rights of a people, there is no necessity for any such thing as a Bill of Rights. I conceive civil liberty is sufficiently guarded when personal security, personal liberty, and private property, are made the peculiar care of government. Now the defined powers of each department of the government, and the restraints that naturally follow, will be sufficient to prevent the invasion of either of those rights. Where then can be the necessity for a Bill of Rights? It is  September 28, 1787  with diffidence I start this question; I confess I cannot help doubting the negative quality which it conveys, as some of the greatest men I ever knew have objected to the government for no other reason but because it was not buttoned with a Bill of Rights; men whose experience and wisdom are sufficient to give authority and support to almost any opinion they may choose to advance. I set this down as a truth founded in nature, that a nation habituated to freedom will never remain quiet under an invasion of its liberties. The English history presents us with a proof of this. At the Conquest that nation lost their freedom, but they never were easy or quiet until the true balance between liberty and prerogative was established in the reign of Charles the second. The absolute rights of Englishmen are founded in nature and reason, and are coeval with the English Constitution itself. They were always understood and insisted on by them as well without as with a Bill of Rights. This same spirit was breathed into the Americans, and they still retain it, nor will they, I flatter myself, ever resign it to any power, however plausible it may seem. The Bill of Rights was not introduced into England until the Revolution of 1688, (upwards of 600 years after the Conquest) when the Lords and Commons presented it to the Prince and Princess of Orange. And afterwards the same rights were asserted in the Act of Settlement at the commencement of the present century, when the crown was limited to the House of Hanover. It was deemed necessary to introduce such an instrument to satisfy the public mind in England, not as a bottom to the Constitution, but as a prop to it; and hereafter, if the same necessity should exist in America, it may be done by an act of the Legislature here, so that the Constitution not being founded on a Bill of Rights I conceive will not deprive it at any future time of being propt by one, should it become necessary. A defect is found by some people in this new Constitution, because it has notprovided, except in criminal cases, for Trial by Jury. I ask if the trial by jury in civil cases is really and substantially of any security to the liberties of a people. In my idea the opinion of its utility is founded more in prejudice than in reason. I cannot but think that an able Judge is better qualified to decide between man and man than any twelve men possibly can be. The trial by jury appears to me to have been introduced originally to soften some of the rigors of the feudal system, as in all the countries where that strange policy prevailed, they had, according to Blackstone, \""a tribunal composed of twelve good men, true boni homines, usually the vassals or tenants of the Lord, being the equals or peers of the parties litigant.\""(4) This style of trial was evidently meant to give the tenants a check upon the enormous power and influence of their respective Lords; and, considered in that point of view, it may be said to be a wise scheme of juridical polity; but applied to us in America, where every man stands upon a   footing of independence, and where there is not, and I trust never will be, such an odious inequality between Lord and tenant as marked the times of a Regner or an Egbert, is useless, and I think altogether unnecessary; and, if I was not in the habit of respecting some of the prejudices of very sensible men, I should declare it ridiculous. An Englishman to be sure will talk of it in raptures; it is a virtue in him to do so, because it is insisted on in Magna Charta (that favorite instrument of English liberty) as the great bulwark of the nation's happiness. But we in America never were in a situation to feel the same benefits from it that the English nation have. We never had anything like the Norman trial by battle, nor great Lords presiding at the heads of numerous tribes of tenants whose influence and power we wished to set bounds to. As to trial by jury in criminal cases, it is right, it is just, perhaps it is indispensable, the life of a citizen ought not to depend on the fiat of a single person. Prejudice, resentment, and partiality, are among the weaknesses of human nature, and are apt to pervert the judgment of the greatest and best of men. The solemnity of the trial by jury is suited to the nature of criminal cases, because, before a man is brought to answer the indictment, the fact or truth of every accusation is inquired into by the Grand Jury, composed of his fellow citizens, and the same truth or fact afterwards (should the Grand Jury find the accusation well founded) is to be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve good men, \""superior to all suspicion.\"" I do not think there can be a greater guard to the liberties of a people than such a mode of trial on the affairs of life and death. But here let it rest. The most solid objection I think that can be made to any part of the new government is the power which is given to the Executive Department; it appears rather too highly mounted to preserve exactly the equilibrium. The authority which the President holds is as great as thatpossessed by the King of England. Fleets and armies must support him in it. I confess however that I am at a loss to know whether any government can have sufficient energy to effect its own ends without the aid of a military power. Some of the greatest men differ in opinion about this point. I will not pretend to decide it. It requires very little wisdom or forethought to see into the consequences of the government when put compleatly in motion. You will observe that one branch of the Legislature is to come from the People, the other from the several State Legislatures; one is to sympathize with the people at large, the other with the sovereignty of the states, but the suffrages of the two are unequal; the House of Commons will have sixty-five votes, while the Senate has only twenty- six. Some of the states will have eight and ten Members in the Lower House, some only two or three, but all will have an equal number in the Senate. The Ju  dicial Power is to extend \""to controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state, between citizens of different states, and between a state and the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.\"" And the President is to be Commander in Chief of the Fleets and Armies of the United States, and the Militia of the states when called into the service of the Union. All this taken collectively forms such a power independent of the states as must eventually draw from them all their remaining sovereignty. Whether such a thing is desirable or not let every man appeal to his own judgment to determine. It is clearly my opinion that we had better be consolidated than to remain any longer a confederated republic. I would say something about the Article of Commerce, but it involves in it so much inquiry and calculation that I will reserve it for another letter. I know the most popular opposition in Virginia will be founded on this head, but I think it can be proven beyond a doubt that a uniform regulation of its principles will secure lasting and equal advantages to every part of the empire. If this right had at first been lodged in the hands of Congress we should not at this day be in the condition we are. ""

 Hond. Sir New York Sepr. 30. 1787 By Mr. Blair who left Philada. immediately after the rising of the Convention, I sent to the care of Mr. F. Maury a copy of the New Constitution proposed for the U.S. Mr. Blair set out in such haste that I had no time to write by him, and I thought the omission of the less consequence as your last letter led me to suppose that you must about that time be absent on your trip to Frederick. I arrived here on Monday last. The Act of the Convention was then before Congress. It has been since taken up, & by a unanimous vote, forwarded to the States to be proceeded on as recommended by the Convention. What reception this new System will generally meet with cannot yet be pronounced. For obvious reasons opposition is as likely to arise in Virginia as any where. The City of Philada. has warmly espoused it. Both parties there, it is said, have united on the occasion. It may happen nevertheless that a Country party may spring up and give a preponderancy to the opposite scale. In this City, the general voice coincides with that of Philada. but there is less apparent unanimity, and it is pretty certain that the party in power will be active in defeating the new system. In Boston the reception given to it is extremely favorable we are told, but more will depend on the Country than the Town. The eccho from Connecticut & New Jersey, as far as it has reached us, denotes a favorable disposition in those States. I inclose a few plumb Stones from an excellent Tree.

 Dear Sir N. York Sepr. 30. 1787. I found on my arrival here that certain ideas unfavorable to the Act of the Convention which had created difficulties in that body, had made their way into Congress. They were patronised cheifly by Mr. R. H. L. and Mr. Dane of Massts. It was first urged that as the new Constitution was more than an alteration of the Articles of Confederation under which Congress acted, and even subverted these articles altogether, there was a Constitutional impropriety in their taking any positive agency in the work.(1) The answer given was that the Resolution of Congress in Feby. had recommended the Convention as the best mean of obtaining a firm national Government; that as the powers of the Convention were defined by their Commissions in nearly the same terms with the powers of Congress given by the Confederation on the subject of alterations, Congress were not more restrained from acceding to the new plan, than the Convention were from proposing it. If the plan was within the powers of the Convention it was within those of Congress; if beyond those powers, the same necessity which justified the Convention would justify Congress; and a failure of Congress to Concur in what was done, would imply either that the Convention had done wrong in exceeding their powers, or that the Government proposed was in itself liable to insuperable objections; that such an inference would be the more natural, as Congress had never scrupled to recommend measures foreign to their Constitutional functions, whenever the Public good seemed to require it; and had in several instances, particularly in the establishment of the new Western Governments, exercised assumed powers of a very high & delicate nature, under motives infinitely less urgent than the present state of our affairs, if any faith were due to the representations made by Congress themselves, ecchoed by 12 States in the Union, and confirmed by the general voice of the People. An attempt was made in the next place by R. H. L. to amend the Act of theConvention before it should go forth from Congress. He proposed a bill of Rights---;provision for juries in civil cases & several other things corresponding with the ideas of Col. M---;---;.(2) He was supported by Mr. M---;---;(3) Smith of this State. It was contended that Congress had an undoubted right to insert amend September 30, 1787  ments, and that it was their duty to make use of it in a case where the essential guards of liberty had been omitted. On the other side the right of Congress was not denied, but the inexpediency of exerting it was urged on the following grounds. 1. that every circumstance indicated that the introduction of Congress as a party to the reform, was intended by the States merely as a matter of form and respect. 2. that it was evident from the contradictory objections which had been expressed by the different members who had animadverted on the plan, that a discussion of its merits would consume much time, without producing agreement even among its adversaries. 3. that it was clearly the intention of the States that the plan to be proposed should be the act of the Convention with the assent of Congress, which could not be the case, if alterations were made, the Convention being no longer in existence to adopt them. 4. that as the Act of the Convention, when altered would instantly become the mere act of Congress, and must be proposed by them as such, and of course be addressed to the Legislatures, not conventions of the States, and require the ratification of thirteen instead of nine States, and as the unaltered act would go forth to the States directly from the Convention under the auspices of that Body---;Some States might ratify one & some the other of the plans, and confusion & disappointment be the least evils that could ensue. These difficulties which at one time threatened a serious division in Congs. and popular alterations with the yeas & nays on the journals, were at length fortunately terminated by the following Resolution---;\""Congress having recd. the Report of the Convention lately assembled in Philada., Resold. unanimously that the said Report,(4) with the Resolutions & letter accompanying the same, be transmitted to the several Legislatures, in order to be submitted to a Convention of Delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the Resolves of theConvention made & provided in that case.\"" Eleven States were present, the absent ones R. I. & Maryland. A more direct approbation would have been of advantage in this & some other States, where stress will be laid on the agency of Congress in the matter, and a handle taken by adversaries of any ambiguity on the subject. With regard to Virginia & some other States, reserve on the part of Congress will do no injury. The circumstance of unanimity must be favorable every where. The general voice of this City seems to espouse the new Constitution. It is supposed nevertheless that the party in power is strongly opposed to it. The Country must finally decide, the sense of which is as yet wholly unknown. As far as Boston & Connecticut has been heard from, the first impression seems to be auspicious. I am waiting with anxiety for the eccho from Virginia but with very faint hopes of its corresponding with my wishes.   With every sentiment of respect & esteem, & every wish for your health & happiness, I am Dear Sir, Your Obedient, humble servt.,  Js. Madison Jr. P.S.

 Dear Sir, New York October 1st. 1787 I have waited until now to answer your favor of Septr. 18th from Philadelphia,(1) that I might inform you how the Convention plan of Government was entertained by Congress. Your prediction of what would happen in Congress was exactly verified. It was with us, as with you, this or nothing; & this urged with a most extreme intemperance. The greatness of the powers given, & the multitude of Places to be created, produces a coalition of Monarchy men, Military Men, Aristocrats, and Drones whose noise, imprudence & zeal exceeds all belief---;Whilst the Commercial plunder of the South stimulates the rapacious Trader. In this state of things, the Patriot voice is raised in vain for such changes and securities as Reason and Experience prove to be necessary against the encroachments of power upon the indispensable rights of human nature. Upon due consideration of the Constitution under which we now Act, some of us were clearly of opinion that the 13th article of the Confederation(2) precluded us from giving an opinion concerning a plan subversive of the present system and eventually forming a New Confederacy of Nine instead of 13 States. The contrary doctrine was asserted with great violence in expectation of  October 1, 1787  the strong majority with which they might send it foward under terms of much approbation. Having procured an opinion that Congress was qualified to consider, to amend, to approve or disapprove---;the next game was to determine that tho a right to amend existed, it would be highly inexpedient to exercise that right; but surely to transmit it with respectful marks of approbation. In this state of things I availed myself of the Right to amend, & moved the Amendments copy of which I send herewith(3) & called the ayes & nays to fix them on the journal. This greatly alarmed the Majority & vexed them extremely---; for the plan is, to push the business on with great dispatch, & with as little opposition as possible: that it may be adopted before it has stood the test of Reflection & due examination. They found it most eligible at last to transmit it merely, without approving or disapproving; provided nothing but the transmission should appear on the Journal. This compromise was settled and they took the opportunity of inserting the word Unanimously, which applied only to simple transmission, hoping to have it mistaken for an Unanimous approbation of the thing. It states that Congress having Received the Constitution unanimously transmit it &c. It is certain that no Approbation was given. This constitution has a great many excellent Regulations in it, and if it could be reasonably amended would be a fine System. As it is, I think 'tis past doubt, that if it should be established, either a tyranny will result from it, or it will be prevented by a Civil war. I am clearly of opinion with you that it should be sent back with amendments Reasonable and Assent to it with held until such amendments are admitted. You are well acquainted with Mr. Stone & others of influence in Maryland. I think it will be a great point to get Maryld. & Virginia to join in the plan of Amendments & return it with them. If you are in correspondence with our Chancelor Pendelton, it will be of muchuse to furnish him with the objections, and if he approves our plan, his opinion will have great weight with our Convention, and I am told that his relation Judge Pendleton of South Carolina has decided weight in the State,(4) & that he is sensible & independent. How important will it be then to procure his union with our plan, which might probably be the case, if our Chancelor was to write largely & pressingly to him on the subject; that if possible it may be amended there also. It is certainly the most rash and violent proceeding in the world to cram thus suddenly into Men a business of such infinite Moment to the happiness of Millions. One of your letters will go by the Packet, and one by a Merchant Ship. My compliments if you please to Your Lady & to the young Ladies & Gentlemen. I am dear Sir affectionately Yours, Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Suppose when the Assembly recommended a Convention to consider this new Constitution they were to use some words like these---;It is earnestly recommended to the good people of Virginia to   send their most wise & honest Men to this Convention that it may undergo the most intense consideration before a plan shall be without amendments adopted that admits of abuses being practised by which the best interests of this Country may be injured and Civil Liberty greatly endanger'd. This might perhaps give a decided Tone to the business. Please to send my Son Ludwell a Copy of the Amendments proposed by me to the new Constitution sent herewith. ""

 Dear Sir N. York Octr. 1. 1787. I have received & perused with much pleasure the remarks on the proposed Constitution for the U.S. which you have been so good as to favor me with.(1) They cannot fail I think to satisfy the most scrupulous & jealous citizens, that the Act of the Convention, whatever faults it may have in other respects is not chargeable with a dangerous similitude to real monarchy or Aristocracy. Col. Hamilton happens not to be in the City at present. As soon as he returns your commands with respect to him shall be executed. I take it for granted that the Printers here will of themselves republish these pieces from the Philadelphia Papers. I think it not improbable that the subject & execution of them will attract the notice of the printers in most of the States. To ensure their republication however in Virginia, I will forward the copies, as soon as I discover which of my correspondents will be the most willing agents in a communication with our printers. At present I am a perfect stranger to the sentiments of all of them on the merits of the new System, and have reason to believe that a direct application to the printer from any member of the Convention, would be made use of to disparage the Publication. With great esteem & regard I am, Sir, Yr. Obedt. humble servt., Js. Madison Jr ""

 My dear Sir, New York October 2d. 1787 I thank you very sincerely for your last letter, and its enclosures which are now returned. It is indeed a great addition to my happiness to know that my dear Nephew is so pleasingly and improvingly placed---;for I have not a doubt but that he will make the best use of his situation which being so well contrived to delight the Mind, must necessary render its improvement more certain. I am much obliged by your assurance that you will have the Smallpox directions ready for me. I desired my friend Starr to have the Boots ready for me against my return to Phila. on the 6th of next Month in my way home. But upon further consideration, I shall want the Boots here to travel in to Phila. as the Season will be cool. Will you be so kind as tell him this, and that I desire he will have them made immediately with a pair of proper boot straps fitted to them, so that You or he may take the opportunity of some safe and friendly person coming here who may bring them to me before the 3d of November, or as soon after this as possible, that I may not be disappointed. I have considered the new Constitution will [i.e., with] all the attention and candor that the thing and the times render necessary, & I find it impossible for me to doubt, that in its present State, unamended, the adoption of it will put Civil Liberty and the happiness of the people at the mercy of rulers who may possess the great unguarded powers given. And I assure you that confidence in the moderation or benignity of power is not a plant of quick growth in a reflecting bosom. The necessary alterations will by no means interfere with the general nature of the plan, or limit the power of doing good; but they will restrain from oppression the wicked & Tyrannic. If all men were wise & good there would be no necessity for government or law. But the folly & the vice of human nature renders government & laws necessary for the Many, and restraints indispensable to prevent oppression from those who areentrusted with the administration of one & the dispensation of the other. You will see herewith the amendments that appeared to me necessary,(1) they are submitted to you and my Excellent old friend at German Town.(2) Perhaps they may be submitted to the world at large. My good old friend has made himself better acquainted with Hippocrates than with Plato, and relying upon the goodness of his own heart, witht. reflecting upon the corrupting & encroaching nature of power, he is willing to trust to its fangs more than experience justifies. The malady of human nature in these states now, seems to be as it was in the years 1778 & 1779 with respect to the effect produced by a certain Combination. The Malady that I mean is a temporary Insanity. I wish that the present may subside with as little public injury as it for- October 2, 1787  merly did, altho that was not small in all its branches. Give my love where it is due, and be assured that I am unalterably yours, Richard Henry Lee ""

 Dear Craigie,(1) New York Octr. 4th. 1787 I thank you most cordially, for the few Lines you wrote me announcing your safe arrival in twenty three days. I hope you had an agreable passage to London, and that you found our Friend well.

 New York October 5th. 1787 Having long toiled with you my dear friend in the Vineyard of liberty, I do with great pleasure submit to your wisdom and patriotism, the objections that prevail in my mind against the new Constitution proposed for federal government---;Which objections I did propose to Congress in form of amendments to be discussed, and that such as were approved might be forwarded to the States with the Convention system.(1) You will have been informed by other hands why these amendments were not considered and do not appear on the Journal, and the reasons that influenced a bare transmission of the Convention plan, without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation on the part of Congress. I suppose my dear Sir, that the good people of the U. States in their late generous contest, contended for free government in the fullest, clearest, and strongest sense. That they had no idea of being brought under despotic rule under the notion of \""Strong government,\"" or in form of elective despotism: Chains being still Chains, whether made of gold or iron. The corrupting nature of power, and its insatiable appetite for increase, hath proved the necessity, and procured the adoption of the strongest and most express declarations of that Residuum of natural rights, which is not intended to be given up to Society; and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose. In a government therefore, where the power of judging what shall be for the general wellfare, which goes to every object of human legislation; and where the laws of such Judges shall be the supreme Law of the Land: it seems to be of the last consequence to declare in most explicit terms the reservations above alluded to. So much for the propriety of a Bill of Rights as a necessary bottom to this new system---;It is in vain  October 5, 1787  to say that the defects in this new Constitution may be remedied by the Legislature created by it. The remedy, as it may, so it may not be applied---;and if it should, a subsequent Assembly may repeal the Acts of its predecessors for the parliamentary doctrine is \""quod legis posteriores priores contrarias abrogant\"" 4 Inst. 43.(2) Surely this it not a ground upon which a wise and good man would choose to rest the dearest rights of human nature. Indeed, some capital defects are not within the compass of legislative redress. The Oligarchic tendency from the combination of President, V. President, & Senate, is a ruin not within the legislative remedy. Nor is the partial right of voting in the Senate, or the defective numbers in the house of representatives. It is of little consequence to say that the numbers in the last mentioned Assembly will increase with the population of these States, because what may happen in twenty five or 27 years hence is poor alleviation of evil, that the intermediate time is big with; for it often happens that abuse under the name of Use is rivetted upon Mankind. Nor can a good reason be assigned, for establishing a bad, instead of a good government, in the first instance, because time may amend the bad. Men do not choose to be sick because it may happen that physic may cure them. Suppose that good men came first to the administration of this government; and that they should see, or thing [think] they see, a necessity for trying criminally a Man without giving him his Jury of the Vicinage; or that the freedom of the Press should be restrained because it disturbed the operations of the new government---;the mutilation of the jury trial, and the restraint of the Press would then follow for good purposes as it should seem, and by good men. But these precedents will be followed by bad men to sacrifice honest and innocent men; and to suppress the exertions of the Press for wicked and tyrannic purposes---;it being certainly true that \""Omnia mala exempla exbonis orta sunt: sed ubiimperium ad ignaros out minus bonos pervinit, novum illud exemplum ab dignis et idoneis ad indignos et non idoneos fertur.\""(3) In proof of this, we know that the wise and good Lord Holt, to support King William and revolution principles, produced doctrines in a case of Libel (King against Bear) subversive both of law and sound sense; which his Successor Lord Mannsfield (in the case of Woodfall) would have availed himself of for the restraint of the Press and the ruin of liberty.(4) It would appear therefore, that the consideration of human perversity renders it necessary for human safety, that in the first place, power not requisite should not be given, and in the next place that necessary powers should be carefully guarded. How far this is done in the New Constitution I submit to your wise and attentive consideration. Whether, for the present, it may not be sufficient so to alter the Confederation as to allow Congress full liberty to make Treaties by removing the restraining clauses; by giving the Impost for a limited time, and the power of regulating trade; is a question that deserves to be considered. October 6, 1787  But I think the new Constitution (properly amended) as it contains many good regulations, may be admitted---;And why may not such indispensable amendments be proposed by the Conventions and referred With the new plan to Congress, that a new general Convention may so weave them into the proffer'd system as that a Web may be produced fit for free men to weave? If such amendments were proposed by a capital state or two, & a willingness expressed to agree with the plan so amended; I cannot see why it may not be effected. It is a mere begging the question to suppose, as some do, that only this Moment and this Measure will do. But why so, there being no war external or internal to prevent due deliberation on this most momentous business. The public papers will inform you what violence has been practised by the Agitators of this new System in Philadelphia to drive on its immediate adoption(5) As if the subject of Government were a business or passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration. I shall not leave this place before the 4th of November---;in the mean time, I shall be happy to hear from you.(6) My best compliments are presented to Mrs. Adams, and I pray to be remembered to Gen. Warren, Mr. Lovell & the good Doctor Holten when you see him. I am, with sentiments of the truest esteem & regard, dear Sir your affectionate friend, Richard Henry Lee ""

 My dear friend New York Octr. 7th. 1787. I was yesterday favored with yours of the 30th Ult.(1) and heard with particular pleasure the favorable influence of your journey on Mrs. Randolph's health. I wrote to you shortly after my arrival here, and rehearsed the proceedings of Congress on the subject of the new federal Constitution.(2) I have since forwarded by Mr. Hopkins a large foreign letter for you with some others for the friends of Mr. Jefferson which you will be kind enough to dispose of. I have also delivered to Mr. Constable of this City to be forwarded by water to your care, several volumes in sheets addressed to the University of W. & Mary. They came in a box of books which I received by the last packet, but without a single memorandum on the subject from any quarter. They were addressed to the two Universities of Virga. & Penna. & duplicate sheets being contained in each packet.(3) I know not how the duty in Virga. will be settled. The difficulty was avoided here, by the precaution of entering them for re-exportation. As they are a free gift, are of little value, and are destined for a public institution, I should suppose that no facility consistent with law will be witheld. Congs. are at present deliberating on the requisition. The Treasury Board have reported one in Specie alone, alledging the mischiefs produced by \""Indents.\"" It is proposed by a Committee that indents be recd. from the States, but that the conditions tying down the States to a particular mode of procuring them, be abolished, and that the indents for one year be receivable in the quotas of any year.(4) Sinclair is appointed Govr. of the Western Territory, & a Majr. Sergeant of Masts. the Secretary of that Establishment.(5) A Treaty with the Indians is on the anvil as a supplemental provision for the W.  October 7, 1787  Country.(6) It is not certain however that any thing will be done, as it involves money, and we shall have on the floors nine States one day more only. We hear nothing decisive as yet concerning the general reception given to the Act of the Convention. The Advocates for it come forward more promptly than the Adversaries. The Sea Coast seems every where fond of it. The party in Boston which was thought most likely to make opposition, are warm in espousing it. It is said that Mr. S. Adams, objects to one point only, viz. the prohibition of a Religious test. Mr. Bowdoin's objections are said to lie agst. the great number of members composing the Legislature, and the intricate election of the President. You will no doubt have heard of the fermentation in the Assembly of Penna.(7) Mr. Adams is permitted to return home after Feby. next, with thanks for the zeal, & fidelity of his services.(8) As the Commission of Smith expires at that time and no provision is made for Continuing him, or appointing a Successor, the representation of the U.S. at the Court of London will cease at that period.  With every wish for your happiness, and with the sincerest affection I remain Mr dear Sir, Your Friend, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir. New York October the 8th. 1787. Your esteemd favour, of the 29th of June, reachd my hand, here. It gave me real satisfaction to learn that Mrs. Butler, Yourself & family were well, for indeed no Man wishes You better than I do. You are fortunate in the reestablishment of Mrs Butler's health. I know not what You coud do without Her. My Thomas has his share in the good fortune, for he wou'd feel the loss of Her severely. I join in thanks to God for the recovery of both of You; And I pray to Him to continue You long to Your Family. Your obliging minute information of my Son is very kind, and to me very satisfactory. I shall be thankful to be informed in every letter of the state of his hearing, because, if it does not incline rather to mend, I will have a Consultation with three of the most eminent Surgeons in London, in time, while he is young. I have always had full hopes that he wou'd outgrow the complaint. I find, by Your letter, he is in the Lattin syntax, \""which he reads with a tollerable facility\"" my anxiety puts this construction on the word tollerable---;that he barely progresses. I hope I am mistaken: At any rate, I beg Your opinion freely of the Nature of his parts---;are they quick or slow? are they strong or weak? Is there, or is there not, a good foundation to build on? By this time You can form a judgement of what they will be; and what Culture can make of them. I think he progresses in writing; to which, I am sensible, You contribute in no small degree. After four Months close Confinement We closed, on the 17th of last Month, the business Committed to Us.(1) If it meets with the approbation of the States, I shall feel myself fully recompensed for my share of  October 8, 1787  the trouble, and a Summer's Confinement, which injured my health much. As yet, the System We had the honor of submitting to the States, meets with general approbation. A few designing, Intrigueing, Men, of desparate Circumstances, may be opposed to; but the bulk of the People, I am of opinion, like it. The Change, in my judgement, was well timed. A Body so Constituted as Congress, are quite unequal to govern so Extensive a Country, as the thirteen States. All Ranks of Men saw the Necessity of a Change---;they wisely had recourse to reason, and not Arms, for the Accomplishment of it. In this Instance America has sett a laudable Example to Civilized Europe. It might be well for the United Provinces, and perhaps, France, to follow it; for I think the latter appears to be verging towards a Change. If Our publick Prints speak truth, the former is like to experience the miseries attendant on the very worst of Wars. The hour of their greatness, & perhaps, wealth, in my Judgement, is past; they will, probably, sooner, or later, be swallowed up by the great Empires. If I can hear of any person going to London, I will send You a Copy of the result of Our deliberations; it is not worth the expence of postage, or I woud now enclose it to You. We, in many instances, took the Constitution of Britain, when in its purity, for a model and surely We cou'd not have a better. We tried to avoid, what appeared to Us, the weak parts of Antient, as well as modern Republicks. How will We have succeeded, is left for You, and other Letterd Men to determine. It is some what singular, yet so the fact is, that I have never met with any Dutch Man, who understood the Constitution of his own Country. It is, certainly a very complex, unwieldly piece of business. I have read different Histories of it, with attention, and to this hour, I have but a very inadequate idea of it. Pray give me Your opinion, freely of the One I had some small hand in frameing; after You have read it. In passing judgement on it, You must call to mind,that We had Clashing Interests to reconcile---;some strong prejudices to encounter, for the same spirit that brought settlers to a certain Quarter of this Country, is still alive in it. View the System there, as resulting from a spirit of Accommodation to different Interests, and not the most perfect One that the Deputies cou'd devise for a Country better adapted to the reception of it, than America is at this day, or perhaps ever will be. It is a great Extent of Territory to be under One free Government; the measures and modes of thinking, of the Inhabitants, differing nearly as much, as indifferent Nations of Europe. If We can secure tranquility at Home, and respect from abroad, they will be great points gain'd. We have, as You will see, taken a portion of power from the Individual States, to form a General Government for the whole, to preserve the Union. The General Government, to Consist of two Branches of Legislature and an Executive, to be Vested in One person, for four Years, but Elligible again. The first Branch of the Legislature, to be   Elected by the People, of the different States, agreeable to a ratio of Numbers & wealth; to serve for two Years. The Second to Consist of two Members from each state, to be appointed by the Legislatures of the States, to serve for six Years, One third to go out every two Years, but to be Eligible again, if their state thinks proper to appoint them. A Judiciary to be Supreme in all matters relating to the General Government, and Appellate in State Controversies. The powers of the General Government are so defined, as not to destroy the Sovereignty of the Individual States. These are the Outlines, if I was to be more minute, I shoud tire Your patience. I beg You will present the best regards of my Family to Mrs Butler---; And Believe me to be, Dear sir, Yr Affecte and sincere friend. P Butler. [P.S.] I am Concerned at the fate of the Box Mrs Butler sent by Captain Angus. I hope the Hoghshead of Madeira, that went by the Ship Castle Douglass, for You, will have better luck. It woud hurt me, to have it fall into other hands than Your own, because it is real fine Old Madeira Wine, of the very first quality. It went to the Care of Messrs. Sempson & Davission. ""

 Sir N York Octr 8. 1787. I have now before me yours of the 12 & 27 Septr. I left a Letter with Mr. Hunt with the Advertizements inclosed to go by Tunnel wh I suppose you have recd. I have seen Hill who brought a Load to this Market---;he came to me just after his Arrival but as there were several Shallops laden with Shingles in Port and wh were of a much better Quality than ours there was little Prospect of selling. The Price of these Carolina Shingles, is Â£4 N York Money but as Douglass informs me ours will not sell even at a lower Price they must be yarded. We are intirely cut out of this Trade by the Carolinans owing to the Superiority of their Shingles. I have the best Law Advice relative to the Will of Gl Dagworthy & I think we shall stand justified before any Court in the World for not throwing away the Property of the Estate. You very well know and so do the Court that it is utterly impracticable & has been since Gl Ds Death to dispose of the Lands to pay the Debts as they would fetch nothing, this is evident from the Nature of the Times, and the many  October 8, 1787  Sales wh have been made in your County and in such Cases it cannot be expected nor will any Court direct that Lands should be sold for one half of their Value---;it is inconsistent with common Justice to expect it, and an Indulgence is always given to Executors in such Cases. We are now however proceeding to make the Experiment, the Lands are now for Sale to any Purchaser & will be exposed publicly next Spring if they do not sell before. I have from the Outset had nothing but the Interest of the Estate in View & will continue to pursue it for wh no Court can blame me. No Doubt the Reasons you have offerd occurred to you before I left Indian River & it is somewhat extraordinary that you did not mention & urge them in the same Manner you have done since. Consult Mr Redford at the next Court & he will satisfy all your Doubts---;he is our Counsel in your State & I think you ought to be satisfied with his Opinion. State your Queries to him. I am obliged to you for the Ladder Poles wh I shall take Care of them when I go to Trenton wh will be in about ten Days. You have no Doubt seen the proposed new federal Constitution---;it is in my Opinion & that of almost all those with whom I have conversed a very excellent one & will make us if adopted happy at Home & respectable abroad & when I reflect that the smaller States are admitted to an equal Representation in the Senate with the larger it appears to me a Circumstance much more favorable than I could have expected and ought to satisfy your State in particular. N England from the Accounts recd. from thence will readily adopt it---;even the Insurgents in Massachusetts are for it and all Parties there are pleased with it. N York will be divided but it is thought will come into it. N Jersey I expect will be unanimous. Pennsylva notwithstanding the late Fracas will adopt it. There may be some Difficulty in Maryld & Virginia but the three Southern States I am assured from very good Authority will come into theMeasure. I cannot help flattering myself with the hope of better Times wh will certainly happen if we are wise enough to take the Boon that is offered us. The immense Sums that may be raised by Duties upon our Imports will ease the Farmer & Landholder & make the Burthen light---;particularly when we consider that immense Sums will be sunk of our domestick Debts by the sales of the western Territory. A Company from N England has purchased a Tract on the Ohio payable in public Securities---;it is supposed that 3 or 4 Mills of Dollars will be sunk in this Way---;anoth[er] is forming for the Purchase of a second Tract---;these in Addition to the Lands already surveyed & now selling at Vend[ue] must lessen our domestick Debt considerably. It is said a third Company will come forward ere long. Added to these Expectations we shall derive prodigious Advantages from the Regulation of our Trade with foreign Powers who have taken the Opportunity of our feeble State to turn everything to their own   Benefit---;by playing off one Nation against another we may bring them one after the other to some Consideration for us, wh they have not had for some Years past. They have sacraficed our Interest in every Instance to their own in full Expectation of our Inability to counteract them. You have heard that there were three Members of the Convention who did not sign the Constitution, Randolph, Mason, & Geary. It is said and believed here that the County of Fairfax in Virginia wh Mason represents in the Legislature of that State will instruct him to vote for the Calling of a Convention in Virginia to take into their Consideration the new Constitution & I make no Doubt as Genl Washington lives in the same County that Mason will either not be chosen a Member of the State Convention or, if he is, that he will be instructed to agree to the Adoption of it. I saw Douglass this Morning who informed me that he had not sold more than between 20 & 30,000 Sh[in]gles since I wrote you last. For God's sake be more particular in the Culling of the Shingles.

 My Dear Son New York 8th. of Septr. [October] 1787. I wrote to you soon after my Return here from Philadelphia,(1) since which nothing very material has occur'd. The Assembly of Pensylvania have however, with an opposition of 19 Members who seceded, recommended the new Constitution to a Convention of the People of that State to be assembled in Novr. next. It will be laid before the Assembly of Connecticut this week & the next before that of Massachusetts. What its fate will be we cannot decide. It is highly extoll'd by very many, but we expect strong opposition in many of the States, tho' its friends hitherto appear to be the Majority. Majr. Alden writes you & sends the News Papers since last Conveyance, with the Shoes you wrote for, & I send Meigs's Papers receiv'd from yr. Brother, with a Letter containing, I pres[ume] the Stratford News. Your good Mamma left me on Thursdy. last, & I had the pleasure to hear by the last Post that she had an agreeable Passage, & arrived very well the  October 10, 1787  next Morning, & that Mr. Verplank & Betsey were expected there from Fish Kill on Saturday. Business was so circumstanced in Congress that I could not accompany Mamma to Stratford, nor could she well stay for me, but I hope to join them before the Week is out, & to be at N Haven next Week before the Genl. Assembly decide upon the result of the Convention. I have not yet given the Trustees a positive Answer, but think I shall undertake the Care of the College here at least for this Winter,(2) & bring Charles with me to see what he thinks of trying his Fortunes in this state. Sho'd neither he nor I like our situation, I can resign it & return again to Stratford. I intimated to you in my last, that if we sho'd take this step Stratford would be vacant, & at your service. When we have the pleasure to hear from you again, I shall hope to be inform'd of your Ideas upon this subject, & with the tenderest sentiments of parental Affection remain, Yr. Father & Friend, Wm. Saml. Johnson ""

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 10th. 1787. Yours of the 7th Ulto. came safe to me. I think the New Constitution Stands a fair chance to be accepted in all the States---;tho many sensible men have several objections to it---;they thinking however that it is the best thing which can, probably, be obtained at present, are of opinion it should be adopted. Many parts which, on examination, appear to be rather undefined and some parts unguarded may be amended by attention in organizing the system. If the departments of the New Government, especially in the first instance, shall be filled with men of abilities and honest views, I think it may work very well and make the people of these States happy---;and was the probability of having such men in the administration greater than it is, our prospects would be more pleasant. You have seen, I suppose the resolution of Congress relative to the New Constitution. It was considered as an entire New System, on its passage from the Convention to the people, and altogether extraneous to the powers of Congress---;The warmest friends of it appeared to be extremely impatient to get it thro Congress, even the first day that it was taken up---;they wanted  October 10, 1787  Congress to approve of it, but objected to any examination of it by paragraphs in the usual mode of doing business. Very few members wanted any alterations and after two days debates Congress unanimously agreed the proper measure was to transmit it to the States to be laid before Conventions of the people.(1) Had Congress been of opinion that it was a subject within their Cognisance, and taken time to examine it as so respectable a body ought always to do such important Cases, I think it is highly probable that Congress would have very fully approved of the plan proposed and on the principles which actuated the Convention. The zeal with which the adoption of this Constitution is hurried especially in some Seaport towns, may give it a temporary currincy---;but this to me is very questionable policy. I think the parties in Pennsylvania by their intemperate conduct on both sides are in a fair way to throw the State into the greatest disorder and confusion. I need not add as I hope to see you in Massa. in a few weeks. Your affecta. friend, N. Dane ""

 Dear Sir, New York Octobr. 11. 1787 I was unwilling to interrupt your attention to more important affairs at Phila. by sending there an acknowledgement of the letter that you were pleased to honor me with from that City;(1) especially as this place afforded nothing worthy of your notice. We have the pleasure to see the first Act of Congress for selling federal lands N.W of Ohio becoming productive very fast. A large sum of public securities being already paid in upon the first sales: and a new Contract is ordered to be made with a company in N. Jersey for the lands between the two Miamis that will rid us of at least 2 millions more of the public debt.(2) There is good reason to suppose that by the next spring we shall have reduced the domestic debt near six millions of dollars. And it seems clear that the lands yet to be disposed of, if well managed, will sink the whole 30 Millions that are due.(3) The assiduity with which the Court of London is soliciting that of Spain for the conclusion of a Commercial treaty between those powers, renders it a signal misfortune that we have not been able to get a sufficient number of the States together to produce a conclusion of the Spanish Treaty. The state of Europe, with respect to the continuance of peace, still hangs in doubtful ballance. The finance weakness of France and G. Britain most strongly opposes war, yet the state of things is such as renders it very questionable, whether even that difficulty, great as it is, will secure the continuance of peace. It is under the strongest impressions of your goodness and candor that I venture to make the observations that follow in this letter, assuring you that I feel it among the first distresses that have happen'd to me in my life, that I find myself compelled by irresistible conviction of mind to doubt about the new System for federal government recommended by the late Convention. It is Sir, in consequence of long reflection upon the nature of Man and of government, that I am led to fear the danger that will ensueto Civil Liberty from the adoption of the new system in its present form. I am fully sensible of the propriety of change in the present plan of confederation, and altho there may be difficulties not inconsiderable, in procuring an adoption of such amendments to the Convention System as will give security to the just rights of human nature, and better secure from injury the discordant interests of the different parts of this Union; yet I hope that these difficulties are not insurmountable. Because we are happily uninterrupted by external war, or by such internal discords as can prevent peaceable and fair discussion, in another Convention, of those objections that are fundamentally strong against the new Constitution which abounds with useful regulations. As there is so great a part of the business well done already, I think that such alterations as must give very general content, could not long  October 11, 1787  employ another Convention when provided with the sense of the different States upon those alterations. I am much inclined to believe that the amendments generally thought to be necessary, will be found to be of such a nature, as tho they do not oppose the exercise of a very competent federal power; are yet such as the best Theories on Government, and the best practise upon those theories have found necessary. At the same time that they are such as the opinions of our people have for ages been fixed on. It would be unnecessary for me here to enumerate particulars as I expect the honor of waiting on you at Mount Vernon in my way home early in November.(4) In the meantime I have only to request that my best respects may be presented to your Lady and that I may be remembered to the rest of the good family of Mount Vernon. I have the honor to be dear Sir, with the most unfeigned respect, esteem, and affection, Your most obedient and very humble servant, Richard Henry Lee. [P.S.] If the next Packets should bring us any important advices from Europe I will communicate them to you immediately. ""

 Dear brother N. York Ocr. 11. [17]87. Your favor of the 24 of Sepr. did not come to hand till the day before yesterday. I am glad to find the State of Crops in your quarter not worse. From the general information I had feared that very little Tobo. would be made, and scarce any corn. I am at a loss what to say as to brother Wms. adventurig. into public life. The prospect of service to His Country does not appear to me to call for much personal sacrifice. Nor can the honor, the profit or the pleasure of the undertaking, be any object. At the same time if his inclination is on that side, and his private affairs will admit, I would not be understood to discountenance the measure. I recommend it to him however not to  October 14, 1787  make an attempt without a tolerable certainty of success, and by no means to run into the error of courting it by the usual practices. If he wishes to establish himself in the good will of the County, the only durable as well as honorable plan will be to establish a character that merits it.(1) Congs. have just passed the annual requisition on the States. The interest on the domestic debt is called for in indents which the States are at liberty to procure in any way they please. I presume all of them, excepting such as have or mean to adopt a paper emis[sion] will buy up their quotas, instead of laying taxes payable in paper.(2) We have no public news. The Act of the Convention has in general been pretty well recd. as yet in the Middle & Northn. States. Opposition however begins to shew itself. It is not possible to say now on which side the Majority will finally lie. The present appearance is in favor of the new Constitution. The adversaries differ as much in their objections as they do from the thing itself. Let me know in your next whether my brother Willm. has Sold Forrester, and whether Fancy & Lemon are with foal, & what horse the latter was put to. Remember me affecely to my Sister & all others of the family. Yrs, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 14. 1787. The letter herewith inclosed was put into my hands yesterday by Mr. de CrOEvecuOEr who belongs to the Consular establishment of France in this Country. I add to it a pamphlet which Mr. Pinkney has submitted to the public, or rather as he professes, to the perusal of his friends;(1) and a printed sheet containing his ideas on a very delicate subject; too delicate in my opinion to have been properly confided to the press. He conceives that his precautions against any farther circulation of the piece than he himself authorises, are so effectual as to justify the step. I wish he may not be disappointed. In communicating a copy to you I fulfil his wishes only.(2) No decisive indications of the public mind in the Northn. & Middle States can yet be collected. The Reports continue to be rather favorable to the Act of the Convention from every quarter; but its adversaries will naturally be latest in shewing themselves. Boston is certainly  October 14, 1787  friendly. An opposition is known to be in petto in Connecticut; but it is said not to be much dreaded by the other side. Rhode Island will be divided on this subject in the same manner as it has been on the question of paper money. The Newspapers here have contained sundry publications animadverting on the proposed Constitution & it is known that the Government party are hostile to it. There are on the other side so many able & weighty advocates, and the conduct of the Eastern States if favorable, will add so much force to their arguments, that there is at least as much ground for hope as for apprehension. I do not learn that any opposition is likely to be made in N. Jersey. The temper of Pennsylvania will be best known to you from the direct information which you cannot fail to receive through the Newspapers & other channels. Congress have been of late employed cheifly in settling the requisition, and in making some arrangements for the Western Country. The latter consist of the appointment of a Govr. & Secretary, and the allotment of a sum of money for Indian Treaties if they should be found necessary.(3) The Requisition so far as it varies our fiscal system, makes the proportion of indents receivable independently of specie, & those of different years indiscriminately receivable for any year, and does not as heretofore tie down the States to a particular mode of obtaining them.(4) Mr. Adams has been permitted to return home after Feby. next, & Mr. Jeffersons appointment continued for three years longer. With the most perfect esteem & most affectionate regard, I remain Dr. Sir, Your Obedt. friend & servant, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir N. York Octr. 18. 1787. I have been this day honoured with your favor of the 10th instant,(1) under the same cover with which is a copy of Col. Mason's objections to the Work of the Convention.(2) As he persists in the temper which produced his dissent it is no small satisfaction to find him reduced to such distress for a proper gloss on it; for no other consideration surely could have led him to dwell on an objection which he acknowledged to have been in some degree removed by the Convention themselves---;on the paltry right of the Senate to propose alterations in money bills---;on the appointment of the vice President---; President of the Senate instead of making the President of the Senate the vice President, which seemed to be the alternative---;and on the possibility, that the Congress may misconstrue their powers & betray their trust so far as to grant monopolies in trade &c. If I do not forget too some of his other reasons were either not at all or very faintly urged at the time when alone they ought to have been urged; such as the power of the Senate in the case of treaties,(3) & of impeachments; and their dura- October 18, 1787  tion in office. With respect to the latter point I recollect well that he more than once disclaimed opposition to it. My memory fails me also if he did not acquiesce in if not vote for, the term allowed for the further importation of slaves;(4) and the prohibition of duties on exports by the States.(5) What he means by the dangerous tendency of the Judiciary I am at some loss to comprehend. It never was intended, nor can it be supposed that in ordinary cases the inferior tribunals will not have final jurisdiction in order to prevent the evils of which he complains. The great mass of suits in every State lie between Citizen & Citizen, and relate to matters not of federal cognizance. Notwithstanding the stress laid on the necessity of a Council to the President, I strongly suspect, tho I was a friend to the thing, that if such an one as Col. Mason proposed, had been established, and the power of the Senate in appointments to offices transferred to it, that as great a clamour would have been heard from some quarters which in general eccho his Objections.(6) What can he mean by saying that the Common law is not secured by the new Constitution, though it has been adopted by the State Constitutions. The common law is nothing more than the unwritten law, and is left by all the constitutions equally liable to legislative alterations. I am not sure that any notice is particularly taken of it in the Constitutions of the States. If there is, nothing more is provided than a general declaration that it shall continue along with other branches of law to be in force till legally changed. The Constitution of Virga. drawn up by Col Mason himself, is absolutely silent on the subject.(7) An ordinance passed during the same Session, declared the Common law as heretofore & all Statutes of prior date to the 4 of James I to be still the law of the land,(8) merely to obviate pretexts that the separation from G. Britain threw us into a State of nature, and abolished all civil rights and obligations. Since the Revolutionevery State has made great inroads & with great propriety in many instances on this monarchical code. The \""revisal of the laws\"" by a Committee of wch. Col. Mason was a member, though not an acting one, abounds with such innovations. The abolition of the right of primogeniture, which I am sure Col. Mason does not disapprove, falls under this head. What could the Convention have done? If they had in general terms declared the Common law to be in force, they would have broken in upon the legal Code of every State in the most material points: they wd. have done more, they would have brought over from G.B. a thousand heterogeneous & antirepublican doctrines, and even the ecclesiastical Hierarchy itself, for that is a part of the Common law. If they had undertaken a discrimination, they must have formed a digest of laws, instead of a Constitution. This objection surely was not brought forward in the Convention, or it wd. have been placed in such a light that a repetition of it out of doors would scarcely have been hazarded. Were it allowed the weight which Col. M. may suppose it deserves, it   would remain to be decided whether it be candid to arraign the Convention for omissions which were never suggested to them---;or prudent to vindicate the dissent by reasons which either were not previously thought of, or must have been wilfully concealed. But I am running into a comment as prolix, as it is out of place. I find by a letter from the Chancellor (Mr. Pendleton) that he views the act of the Convention in its true light, and gives it his unequivocal approbation.(9) His support will have great effect. The accounts we have here of some other respectable characters vary considerably. Much will depend on Mr. Henry, and I am glad to find by your letter that his favorable decision on the subject may yet be hoped for. The Newspapers here begin to teem with vehement & virulent calumniations of the proposed Govt. As they are cheifly borrowed from the Pensylvania papers, you see them of course. The reports however from different quarters continue to be rather flattering.  With the highest respect & sincerest attachment I remain Dear Sir Yr. Obedt. & Affecte. Servant, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 My dear friend New York Ocr. 21. 1787. I mentioned in a late letter(1) that I had addressed to your care a small box of books for the University. I now inclose the Bill of lading. Inclosed also is a bill of lading for another Box destined for Mr. W. Hay. Will you be so good as to have it handed to him? I paid two dollars for its freight from France to this port, which he may repay to you. The money you remitted by me to Col. Carrington having somewhat exceeded the amount of his demand, the two dollars may the more properly pass into your hands. I have recd. no letter from you since your halt at the Bolling- Green. We hear that opinions are various in Virginia on the plan of the Convention. I have recd. within a few days a letter from the Chancellor(2) by which I find that he gives it his approbation; and another from the President of Willm. & Mary(3) which, though it does not absolutely reject the Constitution, criticizes it pretty freely. The Newspapers in the middle & Northern States begin to teem with controversial publications. The attacks seem to be principally levelled agst. the organization of the Government, and the omission of the provisions contended for in favor of the Press, & Juries &c. A new Combatant however with considerable address & plausibility, strikes at the foundation.(4) He represents the situation of the U.S. to be such as to render any Govt. improper & impracticable which forms the States into one nation & is to operate directly on the people. Judging from the News papers one wd. suppose that the adversaries were the most numerous & the most in earnest. But there is no other evidence that it is the fact.  October 22, 1787  On the contrary we learn that the Assembly of N. Hamshire which recd. the constitution on the point of their adjournment, were extremely pleased with it. All the information from Massts. denotes a favorable impression there. The Legislature of Connecticut have unanimously recommended the choice of a Convention in that State. And Mr. Baldwin who is just from the spot tells me that from present appearances the opposition will be inconsiderable; that the Assembly if it depended on them would adopt the System almost unanimously; and that the Clergy and all the literary men are exerting themselves in its favor. Rho. Island is divided; The majority being violently agst. it. The temper of this State cannot yet be fully discerned. A strong party is in favor of it. But they will probably be outnumbered if those whose sentiments are not yet known, should take the opposite side. N. Jersey appears to be zealous. Meetings of the people in different counties are declaring their approbation & instructing their representatives. There will probably be a strong opposition in Penna. The other side however continue to be sanguine. Docr. Carroll(5) who came hither lately from Maryland tells me, that the public voice there appears at present to be decidedly in favor of the Constitution. Notwithstanding all these circumstances, I am far from considering the public mind as fully known or finally settled on the subject. They amount only to a strong presumption that the general sentiment in the Eastern & middle States is friendly to the proposed System at this time. Present me respectfully to Mrs. R. and accept the most fervent wishes for your happiness from your Affece. friend, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir, New York Octo 23. 1787 I have been honoured with your favor of the 4th of August.(1) Inclosed you will receive a Copy of the report of our late federal Convention, which presents, not amendments to the old Confederation, but an entire new Constitution. This work is short of the ideas I had the honor to communicate to you in June,(2) in no other instance than an absolute negative upon the State laws. When the report was before Congress, it was not without its direct opponents, but a great majority were for giving it a warm approbation---;it was thought best, however, by its friends, barely to recommend to the several Legislatures, the holding of Conventions for its consideration, rather than send it forth with, even, a single negative to an approbatory act. The people do not scrutinize terms; the unanimity of Congress in recommending a measure to their consideration, naturally implies approbation: but any negative to a direct approbation, would have discovered a dissention, which would have been used to favor divisions in the States. It certainly behoved Congress to give a measure of such importance, and respectable birth, a fair chance in the deliberations of the people, and I think the step taken in that body well adapted to this idea. The project is warmly received in the Eastern States, and has become pretty generally a subject of consideration in Town-meetings, and other Assemblies of the people, the usual result whereof, are de October 23, 1787  clarations for its adoption. In the Middle States, appearances are generally for it, but not being in habits of assembling for public objects, as is the case to the Eastward, the people have given but few instances of collective declarations. Some symptoms of opposition have appeared in New York and Pensylvania; in the former, only in individual publications, which are attended with no circumstances evidencing the popular regard; the Governor(3) holds himself in perfect silence, wishing, it is suspected, for a miscarriage, but is not confident enough to commit himself in an open opposition: in the latter the opposition has assumed a form somewhat more serious, but under circumstances which leave it doubtful whether it is founded in objections to the project, or the intemperance of its more zealous friends. The Legislature was in session in Philada. when the Convention adjourned(4)---;42 Members were for immediately calling a Convention before the measure had received the consideration of Congress, and were about to press a vote for that purpose---;19 Seceded and broke up the House, and although they, afterwards, added to their protest against the intemperance of the majority, some objections against the report, yet it is to be doubted whether they would have set themselves in opposition to it, had more moderation been used. The next morning the resolution of Congress arrived, upon which the 42, wanting 2 to compleat a House for business, sent their Sergeant for so many of the Seceders, who were brought by force, whereupon an Act was passed for calling a Convention in November. The Seceders are from the upper Counties, have carried their discontents home with them, and some of them being men of influence, will occasion an inconvenience, but Gentlemen well acquainted with the Country are of opinion, that their opposition will have no extensive effect, as there is, in general, a Coalescence of the two parties which have divided that State ever since the birth of her own Constitution, in support of thenew Government. From the Southern States we are but imperfectly informed---;every member from the Carolina's and Georgia, as well in Convention, as Congress, are warm for the new Constitution; and when we consider the ascendency possessed by Men of this description over the people in those States, it may well be concluded, that the reception will be favorable. In Virginia there may be some difficulty---;two of her members in Convention, whose characters entitle them to the public confidence, refused to sign the report---;these were Colo. Mason and Governor Randolph, nor was that State without its dissentients, of the same description, in Congress---;these were Mr. R. H. Lee, & Mr. Grayson, but upon very opposite principles---;the former because it is to[o] strong, the latter because it is too weak <<and Colo. H. Lee is by no means an advocate>. The Governor has declared that his refusal to sign, shall not be followed by hostility against the measure(5)---;that his wish is   to get the exceptionable parts altered if practicable, but if not, that he will join in its support from the necessity of the Case. Mr. Madison writes you fully upon the objections from Virginia, and therefore I will not impose on your patience by repeating them; one, however, being merely local, and an old source of jealousy, I will present to your consideration my opinion upon. This is the ability of a bare majority in the federal Government, to regulate Commerce. It is supposed that a Majority of the Union are carriers, and that it will be for the interest, and in the power, of that majority to form regulations oppressing, by high freights, the agricultural States. It does not appear to me that this objection is well founded. In the first place it is not true that the Majority are carriers, for Jersey and Connecticut who fall into the division, are by means such---;and New York & Pensylvania, who also are within that division, are as much agricultural as Carrying States: but, admitting the first position to be true, I do not see that the supposed consequences would follow. No regulation could be made on other, than general and uniform principles. In that case every created evil would effect its own cure. The Southern States possess more materials for shipping than the Eastern, and if they do not follow the carrying business, it is because they are occupied in more lucrative pursuits. A rise of freight would make that an object, and they would readily turn to it; but the Competition amongst the eastern States themselves, would be sufficient to correct every abuse. A Navigation Act ought doubtless to be passed for giving exclusive benefits to American ships. This would of course serve the eastern States, and such, in justice ought to be the case, as it may, perhaps, be shown, that no other advantage can result to them from the Revolution. Indeed, it is important to the interests of the southern States, that the growth of a Navy be promoted, for the security of that wealth which is to be derivedfrom their agriculture. My determination to join in the adoption results from a Compound consideration of the measure itself, the probable issue of another attempt, and the critical state of our affairs. It has in my mind great faults---;but the formers of it met under powers and dispositions, which promised greater accommodation in their deliberations than can be expected to attend any future Convention. The particular interests of States are exposed, and future deputations, would be clogged with instructions and biassed by the presentiments of their constituents. Hence, it is fairly to be concluded, that this is a better scheme than can be looked for from another experiment; on these considerations, I would clearly be for closing with it, and relying upon the correction of its faults, as experience may dictate the necessary alterations. But when I extend my view to that approaching anarchy which nothing but the timely interpostion of a new Government can avert, I am doubly urged in my wishes for the adoption.  Some Gentlemen apprehend that this project is the foundation of a Monarchy, or at least an oppressive Aristocracy; but my apprehensions are rather from the inroads of the democracy. It is true there is a preposterous combination of powers in the President and Senate, which may be used improperly, but time is to discover whether the tendency of abuse, will be to strengthen or relax---;at all events this part of the consti[tu]tion must be exceptionable. But when we consider the degree of democracy of which the scheme itself partakes, with the addition of that which will be constantly operating upon it, it clearly appears to my mind, that the prevailing infractions are to be expected from thence. As State acts can go into effect without the direct controul of the general Government, having clearly defined the objects of their legislation, will not secure the federal ground against their encroachments. A disposition to encroach must, in the nature of the thing exist, and the democratic branch in the federal legislature, will be more likely to cover their approaches, than resist them. The Western Territory belonging to the United States has more effectually received the attention of Congress during this session than it ever did before. Inclosed you will receive the ordinance for establishing a Temporary Government there, and providing for its more easy passage into permanent State Governments.(6) Under the old arrangement the country might upon the whole have become very populous, & yet be inadmissable to the rights of State government, which would have been disgusting to them & ultimately inconvenient for the Empire. The new arrangement depends on the accession of Virginia which there can be no doubt of obtaining. The Offices of the T. Government are filled up as follows. Genl. St. Clair Govr., Winthrop Sargent Secretary, Genl. Parsons, Genl. Armstrong junr. & Genl. Varnum, Judges. Seven Ranges of Townships are surveyed---;they extend nearly to Muskingum and contain about 12 or 15Millions of Acres. About 130,000 Acres have been sold according to the ordinance. The surveys will probably go no further in strict pursuance of the ordinance, but still the System will be preserved in the conditions of contracts for large Tracts of the Country, to companies of adventurers. The first instance of this mode presents itself in an authority to the Treasury Board in August last, to contract with a large Company of New Englanders,(7) for all the Country from the seventh Range, to Sioto, within a due west line to be continued from the Northern boundary of the tenth Township---;the whole of this Tract is supposed to contain about 5 Millions of Acres. The terms are, that the U.S. shall survey & demark the external boundaries, and ascertain the contents of the Tract---;the Company to lay it out at their own expence, into Townships & sections agreably to the ordinance, subject to the reserves therein described except that one of the sections for future   sale, shall be granted for the purposes of religion, and there are also two compleat Townships granted for an University in or near the Middle of the Tract. All other lands good, bad, & indifferent, to be pd. for at ds. of a dollar per Acre in Securities, excluding the interest---;half a Million of dollars to be paid down upon closing the contract, and possession taken so far as such payment will cover. Afterwards payment and occupancy are to go on, pari passu, at certain periods, under certain stipulations of reciprocal ensurance. This contract is now actually closed. Another offer is made by judge Symes and his associates from Jersey, for about 2 Millions between the Miamis upon the same terms, and sundry other propositions are forming, whereupon Congress have authorised the Treasury Board, to sell by Contract any quantity not less than a Million, making the terms of the Eastern Company the ground, with deviations from the grant for an University, and that for Religion, unless the Tract be equally large. This mode of sale will relieve the U.S. of much expence, and the progress of the sales promise to be sufficiently rapid to give our people early relief from the pressure of the domestic debt. I am inclined to believe that some successful experiment might be made for the sale [of] a part of this territory in Europe, and have suggested a trial with a few Ranges of the surveyed Townships. It did not strike Congress as eligible and of course no step was taken in it. I do not suppose it would be worth while to try the project on any but lands actually surveyed and well described.  We have received no accounts from Europe since your August dispatches, of course the state of things there are in considerable obscurity as to us. Your remarks upon the French loan have occasioned some discussion in Congress, but many reasons operate to prevent an assent to your proposition. By some it is supposed it would be found inconvenient to shift from Creditors that will not complain of our delinquency, tothose that will, by others that we have reason to rely upon the indulgence of France in the case of a debt which was contracted for the common benefit of the two nations. My own opinion is that the transfer ought to be made if practicable. I have the Honor to be, with sincere regard, dr. Sir, Your Most Obt. Servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 Dear Sir New York October 23d 1787. I am honored with your very obliging favor of the 13th instant, which affords me great pleasure & relief; for your little boys had hardly scrambled over the dreary district of horse neck, before I was dun'd, in all Companies, for news from Mr. Langdon, and became quite disgusted with the necessary repetition of a negative answer. I am happy to hear your journey was so very agreeable, and believe you will not suspect me of insincerity, when I assure you it gives me great pleasure to hear of your domestic happiness. Not being in the full enjoyment of those delectable pleasures myself I always participate in some degree with those I respect & Esteem. Madison, Irvine, Carrington, Few and Baldwin desire to be remembered. Mrs. Ellsworth and Niece are much pleased with your kind notice and desire their best respects. Gorham & King are in Boston but I assure you Mrs. King and her father will be greatly disappointed if you do not introduce them to Mrs. Langdon in the Course of the fall or winter. If you come on I think there will soon  October 23, 1787  be a Congress and I have no doubt you will be unanimously elected Presidt. as I am often questioned on the subject and believe they will think of no other member. Some matters of importance have past Congress since you left us, in which it was disagreeable to be deprived of a Vote(1) ---;such as a requisition on the States---;The appointment of a Governor (St. Clair), Judges (Parsons, Armstrong & Varnum), Secretary (Sargent) for the Western Country, selling Lands---;Subject of Indian treatys &c &c. From all accounts there is the greatest probability that the new Constitution will be generally adopted. Accounts from General Washington and other eminent Characters in Virginia are much in favor of it---;and all reports agree that the conduct of Mason & Randolph has made them very unpopular in their State. The conduct of the Seceders in Pennsylvania has met the pointed disapprobation of their constituents, though it is agreed the intemperence of the friends to government in that state has been the cause of considerable opposition. Sales of the Western lands are going on very well---;there are applications (including what is sold) for about ten Million acres---;a very considerable part of the domestic debt will be sunk in this way---; yet I really wish the Citizens of New Hampshire would be so far awake to a sense of their interest as to buy in their quota as an appreciation of these securities must in time take place. Pennsylvania & New York are in possession of their Quotas and Massachusetts has purchased a very considerable sum. I really hope our Legislature will assemble without loss of time---;a federal spirit and a speedy adoption of the new plan is generally expected of New Hampshire and certainly no State suffers more through the inefficiency of the present or has more to hope from the adoption of the proposed Constitution. I must beg of you to write me soon and to let me know your determination about coming on and whether there is a Vessel coming from Portsmouthto this place. Please to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs. Langdon. I have a fine warm lower parlour which I shall be very happy to relinquish for her Accommodation previous to your taking the large house in Cherry Street.  With the greatest respect & Esteem, I am, Dear sir, Your Most Obedt. & Humble servant, N. Gilman ""

 500 October 24, 1787 James Madison to Thomas Jefferson Dear Sir New York Octr. 24. 1787. My two last, though written for the two last Packets, have unluckily been delayed till this conveyance. The first of them was sent from Philada. to Commodore Jones in consequence of information that he was certainly to go by the Packet then about to sail. Being detained here by his business with Congress, and being unwilling to put the letter into the mail without my approbation which could not be obtained in time, he detained the letter also. (1) The second was sent from Philada. to Col. Carrington, with a view that it might go by the last packet at all events in case Commodore Jones should meet with further detention here. By ill luck he was out of Town, and did not return till it was too late to make use of the opportunity. Neither of the letters were indeed of much consequence at the time, and are still less so now. I let them go forward nevertheless as they may mention some circumstances not at present in my recollection, and as they will prevent a chasm in my part of [our] correspondence which I have so many motives to cherish by an exact punctuality. Your favor of June 20 has been already acknowledged. The last packet from France brought me that of August 2d. I have recd. also by the Mary Capt. Howland the three Boxes for W.H., B.F. and myself.(2) The two first have been duly forwarded. The contents of the last are a valuable addition to former literary remittances and lay me under additional obligations, which I shall always feel more strongly than I express. The articles included for Congress have been delivered & those for the two Universities and for General Washington have been forwarded, as have been the various letters for your friends in Virginia and elsewhere. The parcel of rice referred to in your letter to the Delegates of S. Carolina has met with some accident. No account whatever can be gathered concerning it. It probably was not shipped from France. Ubbo's book I find was not omitted as you seem to haveapprehended.(3) The charge for it however is, which I must beg you to supply. The duplicate vol. of the Encyclopedie, I left in Virginia, and it is uncertain when I shall have an opportunity of returning it. Your Spanish duplicates will I fear be hardly vendible. I shall make a trial wherever a chance presents itself. A few days ago I recd. your favor of the 15 of Augst. via L'Orient & Boston.(4) The letters inclosed along with it were immediately sent on to Virga. You will herewith receive the result of the Convention, which continued its Session till the 17th of September.(5) I take the liberty of making some observations on the subject which will help to make up a letter, if they should answer no other purpose.(6) It appeared to be the sincere and unanimous wish of the Convention to cherish and preserve the Union of the States. No proposition  October 24, 1787  was made, no suggestion was thrown out, in favor of a partition of the Empire into two or more Confederacies. It was generally agreed that the objects of the Union could not be secured by any system founded on the principle of a confederation of sovereign States. A voluntary observance of the federal law by all the members, could never be hoped for. A compulsive one could evidently never be reduced to practice, and if it could, involved equal calamities to the innocent & the guilty, the necessity of a military force both obnoxious & dangerous, and in general, a scene resembling much more a civil war, than the administration of a regular Government. Hence was embraced the alternative of a Government which instead of operating, on the States, should operate without their intervention on the individuals composing them: and hence the change in the principle and proportion of representation. This ground-work being laid, the great objects which presented themselves were 1. to unite a proper energy in the Executive and a proper stability in the Legislative departments, with the essential characters of Republican Government. 2. to draw a line of demarkation which would give to the General Government every power requisite for general purposes, and leave to the States every power which might be most beneficially administered by them. 3. to provide for the different interests of different parts of the Union. 4. to adjust the clashing pretensions of the large and small States. Each of these objects was pregnant with difficulties. The whole of them together formed a task more difficult than can be well concieved by those who were not concerned in the execution of it. Adding to these considerations the natural diversity of human opinions on all new and complicated subjects, it is impossible to consider the degree of concord which ultimately prevailed as less than a miracle. The first of these objects as it respects the Executive, was peculiarly embarrassing. On the question whether itshould consist of a single person, or a plurality of co-ordinate members, on the mode of appointment, on the duration in office, on the degree of power, on the re-eligibility, tedious and reiterated discussions took place. The plurality of co-ordinate members had finally but few advocates. Governour Randolph was at the head of them. The modes of appointment proposed were various, as by the people at large---;by electors chosen by the people---;by the Executives of the States---;by the Congress, some preferring a joint ballot of the two Houses---;some a separate concurrent ballot allowing to each a negative on the other house---;some a nomination of several canditates [sic] by one House, out of whom a choice should be made by the other. Several other modifications were started. The expedient at length adopted seemed to give pretty general satisfaction to the members. As to the duration in office, a few would have preferred a tenure during good behaviour---;a consider  able number would have done so, in case an easy & effectual removal by impeachment could be settled. It was much agitated whether a long term, seven years for example, with a subsequent & perpetual ineligibility, or a short term with a capacity to be re-elected, should be fixed. In favor of the first opinion were urged the danger of a gradual degeneracy of re-elections from time to time, into first a life and then a heriditary tenure, and the favorable effect of an incapacity to be reappointed, on the independent exercise of the Executive authority. On the other side it was contended that the prospect of necessary degradation, would discourage the most dignified characters from aspiring to the office, would take away the principal motive to the faithful discharge of its duties---;the hope of being rewarded with a reappointment, would stimulate ambition to violent efforts for holding over the constitutional term---;and instead of producing an independent administration, and a firmer defence of the constitutional rights of the department, would render the officer more indifferent to the importance of a place which he would soon be obliged to quit for ever, and more ready to yield to the incroachmts. of the Legislature of which he might again be a member. The questions concerning the degree of power turned chiefly on the appointment to offices, and the controul on the Legislature. An absolute appointment to all offices---; to some offices---;to no offices, formed the scale of opinions on the first point. On the second, some contended for an absolute negative, as the only possible mean of reducing to practice, the theory of a free Government which forbids a mixture of the Legislative & Executive powers. Others would be content with a revisionary power to be overruled by three fourths of both Houses. It was warmly urged that the judiciary department should be associated in the revision. The idea of some was that a separate revision should be given to the two departments---;that if either objectedtwo thirds; if both three fourths, should be necessary to overrule. In forming the Senate, the great anchor of the Government, the questions as they come within the first object turned mostly on the mode of appointment, and the duration of it. The different modes proposed were, 1. by the House of Representatives, 2. by the Executive, 3. by electors chosen by the people for the purpose. 4. by the State Legislatures. On the point of duration, the propositions descended from good-behavior to four years, through the intermediate terms of nine, seven, six, & five years. The election of the other branch was first determined to be triennial, and afterwards reduced to biennial. The second object, the due partition of power, between the General & local Governments, was perhaps of all, the most nice and difficult. A few contended for an entire abolition of the States; Some for indefinite power of Legislation in the Congress, with a negative on the laws   of the States: some for such a power without a negative: some for a limited power of legislation, with such a negative: the majority finally for a limited power without the negative. The question with regard to the Negative underwent repeated discussions, and was finally rejected by a bare majority. As I formerly intimated to you my opinion in favor of this ingredient, I will take this occasion of explaining myself on the subject. Such a check on the States appears to me necessary 1. to prevent encroachments on the General authority. 2. to prevent instability and injustice in the legislation of the States. 1. Without such a check in the whole over the parts, our system involves the evil of imperia in imperio. If a compleat supremacy some where is not necessary in every Society, a controuling power at least is so, by which the general authority may be defended against encroachments of the subordinate authorities, and by which the latter may be restrained from encroachments on each other. If the supremacy of the British Parliament is not necessary as has been contended, for the harmony of that Empire; it is evident I think that without the royal negative or some equivalent controul, the unity of the System would be destroyed. The want of some such provision seems to have been mortal to the antient Confederacies, and to be the disease of the modern. Of the Lycian Confederacy little is known. That of the Amphyctions is well known to have been rendered of little use whilst it lasted, and in the end to have been destroyed by the predominance of the local over the federal authority. The same observation may be made, on the authority of Polybius, with regard to the AchÃ¦an League. The Helvetic System scarcely amounts to a Confederacy, and is distinguished by too many peculiarities, to be a ground of comparison. The case of the United Netherlands is in point. The authority of a Statholder, the influence of a Standing army, the common interest in the conquered possessions, the pressure of surroundingdanger, the guarantee of foreign powers, are not sufficient to secure the authority and interests of the generality, agst. the antifederal tendency of the provincial sovereignties. The German Empire is another example. A Hereditary chief with vast independent resources of wealth and power, a federal Diet, with ample parchment authority, a regular Judiciary establishment, the influence of the neighbourhood of great & formidable Nations, have been found unable either to maintain the subordination of the members, or to prevent their mutual contests & encroachments.(7) Still more to the purpose is our own experience both during the war and since the peace. Encroachments of the States on the general authority, sacrifices of national to local interests, interferences of the measures of different States, form a great part of the history of our political system. It may be said that the new Constitution is founded on different principles, and will have a different operation. I admit the difference to be material. It presents the aspect   rather of a feudal system of republics, if such a phrase may be used, than of a Confederacy of independent States.(8) And what has been the progress and event of the feudal Constitutions? In all of them a continual struggle between the head and the inferior members, until a final victory has been gained in some instances by one, in others, by the other of them. In one respect indeed there is a remarkable variance between the two cases. In the feudal system the sovereign, though limited, was independent; and having no particular sympathy of interests with the great Barons, his ambition had as full play as theirs in the mutual projects of usurpation. In the American Constitution The general authority will be derived entirely from the subordinate authorities. The Senate will represent the States in their political capacity; the other House will represent the people of the States in their individual capacity. The former will be accountable to their constituents at moderate, the latter at short periods. The President also derives his appointment from the States, and is periodically accountable to them. This dependence of the General, on the local authorities, seems effectually to guard the latter against any dangerous encroachments of the former: Whilst the latter, within their respective limits, will be continually sensible of the abridgment of their power, and be stimulated by ambition to resume the surrendered portion of it. We find the representatives of Counties and corporations in the Legislatures of the States, much more disposed to sacrifice the aggregate interest, and even authority, to the local views of their Constituents, than the latter to the former. I mean not by these remarks to insinuate that an esprit de corps will not exist in the national Government or that opportunities may not occur, of extending its jurisdiction in some points. I mean only that the danger of encroachments is much greater from the other side, and that the impossibility of dividing powers of legislation, in such amanner, as to be free from different constructions by different interests, or even from ambiguity in the judgment of the impartial, requires some such expedient as I contend for. Many illustrations might be given of this impossibility. How long has it taken to fix, and how imperfectly is yet fixed the legislative power of corporations, though that power is subordinate in the most compleat manner? The line of distinction between the power of regulating trade and that of drawing revenue from it, which was once considered as the barrier of our liberties, was found on fair discussion, to be absolutely undefinable. No distinction seems to be more obvious than that between spiritual and temporal matters. Yet wherever they have been made objects of Legislation, they have clashed and contended with each other, till one or the other has gained the supremacy. Even the boundaries between the Executive, Legislative & Judiciary powers, though in general so strongly marked in themselves, consist in many instances of mere shades of difference.   It may be said that the Judicial authority under our new system will keep the States within their proper limits, and supply the place of a negative on their laws. The answer is, that it is more convenient to prevent the passage of a law, than to declare it void after it is passed; that this will be particularly the case, where the law aggrieves individuals, who may be unable to support an appeal agst. a State to the supreme Judiciary; that a State which would violate the Legislative rights of the Union, would not be very ready to obey a Judicial decree in support of them, and that a recurrence to force, which in the event of disobedience would be necessary, is an evil which the new Constitution meant to exclude as far as possible. 2. A constitutional negative on the laws of the States seems equally necessary to secure individuals agst. encroachments on their rights. The mutability of the laws of the States is found to be a serious evil. The injustice of them has been so frequent and so flagrant as to alarm the most stedfast friends of Republicanism. I am persuaded I do not err in saying that the evils issuing from these sources contributed more to that uneasiness which produced the Convention, and prepared the public mind for a general reform, than those which accrued to our national character and interest from the inadequacy of the Confederation to its immediate objects. A reform therefore which does not make provision for private rights, must be materially defective. The restraints agst. paper emissions, and violations of contracts are not sufficient. Supposing them to be effectual as far as they go, they are short of the mark. Injustice may be effected by such an infinitude of legislative expedients, that where the disposition exists, it can only be controuled by some provision which reaches all cases whatsoever. The partial provision made, supposes the disposition which will evade it. It may be asked how private rights will be more secure under the Guardianship of the General Government thanunder the State Governments, since they are both founded on the republican principle which refers the ultimate decision to the will of the majority, and are distinguished rather by the extent within which they will operate, than by any material difference in their structure. A full discussion of this question would, if I mistake not, unfold the true principles of Republican Government, and prove in contradiction to the concurrent opinions of theoretical writers, that this form of Government, in order to effect its purposes, must operate not within a small but an extensive sphere. I will state some of the ideas which have occurred to me on this subject. Those who contend for a simple Democracy, or a pure republic, actuated by the sense of the majority, and operating within narrow limits, assume or suppose a case which is altogether fictitious. They found their reasoning on the idea, that the people composing the Society, enjoy not only an equality of political rights; but that they have all precisely the same interests, and the same feelings in every re-  spect. Were this in reality the case, their reasoning would be conclusive. The interest of the majority would be that of the minority also; the decisions could only turn on mere opinion concerning the good of the whole, of which the major voice would be the safest criterion; and within a small sphere, this voice could be most easily collected, and the public affairs most accurately managed. We know however that no Society ever did or can consist of so homogenous a mass of Citizens. In the savage State indeed, an approach is made towards it; but in that State little or no Government is necessary. In all civilized Societies, distinctions are various and unavoidable. A distinction of property results from that very protection which a free Government gives to unequal faculties of acquiring it. There will be rich and poor; creditors and debtors; a landed interest, a monied interest, a mercantile interest, a manufacturing interest. These classes may again be subdivided according to the different productions of different situations & soils, & according to different branches of commerce, and of manufactures. In addition to these natural distinctions, artificial ones will be founded, on accidental differences in political, religious or other opinions, or an attachment to the persons of leading individuals. However erroneous or ridiculous these grounds of dissention and faction, may appear to the enlightened Statesman, or the benevolent philosopher, the bulk of mankind who are neither Statesmen nor Philosophers, will continue to view them in a different light. It remains then to be enquired whether a majority having any common interest, or feeling any common passion, will find sufficient motives to restrain them from oppressing the minority. An individual is never allowed to be a judge or even a witness in his own cause. If two individuals are under the biass of interest or enmity agst. a third, the rights of the latter could never be safely referred to the majority of the three. Will two thousandindividuals be less apt to oppress one thousand, or two hundred thousand, one hundred thousand? Three motives only can restrain in such cases. 1. a prudent regard to private or partial good, as essentially involved in the general and permanent good of the whole. This ought no doubt to be sufficient of itself. Experience however shews that it has little effect on individuals, and perhaps still less on a collection of individuals, and least of all on a majority with the public authority in their hands. If the former are ready to forget that honesty is the best policy; the last do more. They often proceed on the converse of the maxim: that whatever is politic is honest. 2. respect for character. This motive is not found sufficient to restrain individuals from injustice, and loses its efficacy in proportion to the number which is to divide the praise or the blame. Besides as it has reference to public opinion, which is that of the majority, the Standard is fixed by those whose conduct is to be measured by it. 3. Religion. The inefficacy of this restraint on individuals is well known. The   conduct of every popular Assembly, acting on oath, the strongest of religious ties, shews that individuals join without remorse in acts agst. which their consciences would revolt, if proposed to them separately in their closets. When Indeed Religion is kindled into enthusiasm, its force like that of other passions is increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary state of Religion, and whilst it lasts will hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm. Even in its coolest state, it has been much oftener a motive to oppression than a restraint from it. If then there must be different interests and parties in Society; and a majority, when united by a common interest or passion can not be restrained from oppressing the minority, what remedy can be found in a republican Government, where the majority must ultimately decide, but that of giving such an extent to its sphere, that no common interest or passion will be likely to unite a majority of the whole number in an unjust pursuit. In a large Society, the people are broken into so many interests and parties, that a common sentiment is less likely to be felt, and the requisite concert less likely to be formed, by a majority of the whole. The same security seems requisite for the civil as for the religious rights of individuals. If the same sect form a majority and have the power, other sects will be sure to be depressed. Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles. It must be observed however that this doctrine can only hold within a sphere of a mean extent. As in too small a sphere oppressive combinations may be too easily formed agst. the weaker party; So in too extensive a one, a defensive concert may be rendered too difficult against the oppression of those entrusted with the administration. The great desideratum in Government is, so to modify the sovereignty as that it may be sufficiently neutral betweendifferent parts of the Society to controul one part from invading the rights of another, and at the same time sufficiently controuled itself, from setting up an interest adverse to that of the entire Society. In absolute monarchies, the Prince may be tolerably neutral towards different classes of his subjects, but may sacrifice the happiness of all to his personal ambition or avarice. In small republics, the sovereign will is controuled from such a sacrifice of the entire Society, but is not sufficiently neutral towards the parts composing it. In the extended Republic of the United States, The General Government would hold a pretty even balance between the parties of particular States, and be at the same time sufficiently restrained by its dependence on the community, from betraying its general interests. Begging pardon for this immoderate digression I return to the third object abovementioned, the adjustment of the different interests of different parts of the Continent. Some contended for an unlimited power over trade including exports as well as imports, and over slaves   as well as other imports; some for such a power, provided the concurrence of two thirds of both House[s] were required; Some for such a qualification of the power, with an exemption of exports and slaves, others for an exemption of exports only. The result is seen in the Constitution. S. Carolina & Georgia were inflexible on the point of the slaves. The remaining object created more embarrassment, and a greater alarm for the issue of the Convention than all the rest put together. The little States insisted on retaining their equality in both branches, unless a compleat abolition of the State Governments should take place; and made an equality in the Senate a sine qua non. The large States on the other hand urged that as the new Government was to be drawn principally from the people immediately and was to operate directly on them, not on the States; and consequently as the States wd. lose that importance which is now proportioned to the importance of their voluntary compliances with the requisitions of Congress, it was necessary that the representation in both Houses should be in proportion to their size. It ended in the compromise which you will see, but very much to the dissatisfaction of several members from the large States. It will not escape you that three names only from Virginia are subscribed to the Act. Mr. Wythe did not return after the death of his lady. Docr. MClurg left the Convention some time before the adjournment. The Governour and Col. Mason refused to be parties to it. Mr. Gerry was the only other member who refused. The objections of the Govr. turn principally on the latitude of the general powers, and on the connection established between the President and the Senate. He wished that the plan should be proposed to the States with liberty to them to suggest alterations which should all be referred to another general Convention, to be incorporated into the plan as far as might be judged expedient. He was not inveterate in his opposition, and grounded his refusal tosubscribe pretty much on his unwillingness to commit himself, so as not to be at liberty to be governed by further lights on the subject. Col. Mason left Philada. in an exceeding ill humour indeed. A number of little circumstances arising in part from the impatience which prevailed towards the close of the business, conspired to whet his acrimony. He returned to Virginia with a fixed disposition to prevent the adoption of the plan if possible. He considers the want of a Bill of Rights as a fatal objection. His other objections are to the substitution of the Senate in place of an Executive Council & to the powers vested in that body---;to the powers of the Judiciary---;to the vice President being made President of the Senate---;to the smallness of the number of Representatives---;to the restriction on the States with regard to ex post facto laws---;and most of all probably to the power of regulating trade, by a majority only of each House. He has some other lesser objections. Being now under the necessity of   justifying his refusal to sign, he will of course muster every possible one. His conduct has given great umbrage to the County of Fairfax, and particularly to the Town of Alexandria. He is already instructed to promote in the Assembly the calling a Convention, and will probably be either not deputed to the Convention, or be tied up by express instructions. He did not object in general to the powers vested in the National Government, so much as to the modification. In some respects he admitted that some further powers would have improved the system. He acknowledged in particular that a negative on the States laws, and the appointment of the State Executives ought to be ingredients; but supposed that the public mind would not now bear them, and that experience would hereafter produce these amendments. The final reception which will be given by the people at large to the proposed System can not yet be decided. The Legislature of N. Hampshire was sitting when it reached that State and was well pleased with it. As far as the sense of the people there has been expressed, it is equally favorable. Boston is warm and almost unanimous in embracing it. The impression on the Country is not yet known. No symptoms of disapprobation have appeared. The Legislature of that State is now sitting, through which the sense of the people at large will soon be promulged with tolerable certainty. The paper money faction in Rh. Island is hostile, The other party zealousy attached to it. Its passage through Connecticut is likely to be very smooth and easy. There seems to be less agitation in this(9) State than any where. The discussion of the subject seems confined to the newspapers. The principal characters are known to be friendly. The Governour's party which has hitherto been the popular & most numerous one, is supposed to be on the opposite side; but considerable reserve is practised, of which he sets the example. N. Jersey takes the affirmative side of course. Meetings of the people are declaring theirapprobation, and instructing their representatives. Penna. will be divided. The City of Philada., the Republican party, the Quakers, and most of the Germans espouse the Constitution. Some of the Constitutional leaders, backed by the western Country will oppose. An unlucky ferment on the subject in their Assembly just before its late adjournment has irritated both sides, particularly the opposition, and by redoubling the exertions of that party may render the event doubtful. The voice of Maryland I understand from pretty good authority, is, as far as it has been declared, strongly in favor of the Constitution. Mr. Chase is an enemy, but the Town of Baltimore which he now represents, is warmly attached to it, and will shackle him as far as they can. Mr. Paca will probably be, as usual, in the politics of Chase. My information from Virginia is as yet extremely imperfect. I have a letter from Genl. Washington which speaks favorably of the impression within a circle of some extent; and another from Chancellor Pendleton which expresses his full acceptance of the   plan, and the popularity of it in his district. I am told also that Innis and Marshall are patrons of it. In the opposite scale are Mr. James Mercer, Mr. R. H. Lee, Docr. Lee and their connections of course, Mr. M. Page according to Report, and most of the Judges & Bar of the general Court. The part which Mr. Henry will take is unknown here. Much will depend on it. I had taken it for granted from a variety of circumstances that he wd. be in the opposition, and still think that will be the case. There are reports however which favor a contrary supposition. From the States South of Virginia nothing has been heard. As the deputation from S. Carolina consisted of some of its weightiest characters, who have returned unanimously zealous in favor of the Constitution, it is probable that State will readily embrace it. It is not less probable, that N. Carolina will follow the example unless that of Virginia should counterbalance it. Upon the whole, although, the public mind will not be fully known, nor finally settled for a considerable time, appearances at present augur a more prompt, and general adoption of the plan than could have been well expected. When the plan came before Congs. for their sanction, a very serious effort was made by R. H. Lee & Mr. Dane from Masts. to embarrass it. It was first contended that Congress could not properly give any positive countenance to a measure which had for its object the subversion of the Constitution under which they acted. This ground of attack failing, the former gentleman urged the expediency of sending out the plan with amendments, & proposed a number of them corresponding with the objections of Col. Mason. This experiment had still less effect. In order however to obtain unanimity it was necessary to couch the resolution in very moderate terms. Mr. Adams has recd. permission to return, with thanks for his Services. No provision is made for supplying his place, or keeping up any representation there.(10) Your reappointment for three years willbe notified from the Office of F. Affrs.(11) It was {made without a negative eight states}(12) being {present. Connecticut however put in a blank ticket} the {sense of} that {state having been declared against embassies. Massachusets betrayed some scruple} on {like ground}. Every {personal consideration} was {avowed} & {I beleive with sincerity} to have {militated against these scruples}. It seems to be understood that letters to & from the foreign Ministers of the U.S. are not free of postage: but that the charge is to be allowed in their accounts. The exchange of our French for Dutch Creditors has not been countenanced either by Congress or the Treasury Board. The paragraph in your last letter to Mr. Jay, on the subject of applying a loan in Holland to the discharge of the pay due to the foreign officers has been referred to the Board since my arrival here. No report has yet been made. But I have little idea that the proposition will be adopted.(13) Such is the state & prospect of our fiscal department that   any new loan however small, that should now be made, would probably subject us to the reproach of premeditated deception. The balance of Mr. Adams' last loan will be wanted for the interest due in Holland, and with all the income here, will, it is feared, not save our credit in Europe from further wounds. It may well be doubted whether the present Govt. can be kept alive thro' the ensuing year, or untill the new one may take its place. Upwards of 100,000 Acres of the surveyed lands of the U.S. have been disposed of in open market. Five million of unsurveyed have been sold by private contract to a N. England Company, at of a dollar per acre, payment to be made in the principal of the public securities. A negociation is nearly closed with a N. Jersey Company for two million more on like terms, and another commenced with a Company of this City for four million. Col. Carrington writes more fully on this subject.(14) You will receive herewith the desired information from Alderman Broome in the case of Mr. Burke.(15) Also the Virga. Bill on crimes & punishments. Sundry alterations having been made in conformity to the sense of the House in its latter stages, it is less accurate & methodical than it ought to have been.(16) To these papers I add a Speech of Mr. C. P. on the Mississippi business. It is printed under precautions of secresy, but surely could not have been properly exposed to so much risk of publication.(17) You will find also among the Pamp[h]lets & papers I send by Commodore Jones, another printed speech of the same Gentleman.(18) The MusÃ¦um, Magazine,(19) & Philada. Gazettes, will give you a tolerable idea of the objects of present attention. The summer crops in the Eastern & Middle States have been extremely plentiful. Southward of Virga. They differ in different places. On the whole I do not know that they are bad in that region. In Virginia the drought has been unprecedented, particularly between the falls of the Rivers & the Mountains. The Crops of Cornare in general alarmingly short. In Orange I find there will be scarcely subsistence for the inhabitants. I have not heard from Albemarle. The crops of Tobo. are every where said to be pretty good in point of quantity, & the quality unusually fine. The crops of wheat were also in general excellent in quality & tolerable in quantity. Novr. 1. Commodore(20) Jones having preferred another vessel to the packet, has remained here till this time. The interval has produced little necessary to be added to the above. The Legislature of Massts. has it seems taken up the Act of the Convention, and have appointed or probably will appoint an early day for its State Convention. There are letters also from Georgia which denote a favorable disposition. I am informed from Richmond that the New Election-law from the Revised Code produced a pretty full House of Delegates, as well as a Senate, on the first day. It had previously had equal effect in producing full   meetings of the freeholders for the County elections. A very decided majority of the Assembly is said to be zealous in favor of the New Constitution. The same is said of the Country at large. It appears however that individuals of great weight both within & without the Legislature are opposed to it. A letter I just have from Mr. A. Stuart, names Mr. Henry, Genl. Nelson, W. Nelson, the family of Cabels, St. George Tucker, John Taylor and the Judges of the Genl. Court except P. Carrington. The other opponents he describes as of too little note to be mentioned, which gives a negative information of the Characters on the other side. All are agreed that the plan must be submitted to a Convention. We hear from Georgia that that State is threatened with a dangerous war with the Creek Indians.(21) The alarm is of so serious a nature, that law-martial has been proclaimed, and they are proceeding to fortify even the Town of Savannah. The idea there, is that the Indians derive their motives as well as their means from their Spanish neighbours. Individuals complain also that their fugitive slaves are encouraged by East Florida. The policy of this is explained by supposing that it is considered as a discouragement to the Georgians to form settlements near the Spanish boundaries. There are but few States on the spot here which will survive the expiration of the federal year; and it is extremely uncertain when a Congress will again be formed. We have not yet heard who are to be in the appointment of Virginia for the next year.(22) With the most affectionate attachment I remain Dear Sr. Your Obed friend & servant, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Sir(1) (Copy) New York Octr. 24th. 1787 We do ourselves the honor of transmitting to your Excellency for the consideration of the Legislature, the copy of a letter from the board of Treasury to Congress relative to the Loan Office in our state, the large deficiency stated, demands a serious investigation, especially as the state is responsible to the Union for the conduct of the persons employed in that office prior to the 1st of January 1786.(2) We also inclose the Requisition for the Year 1787 by wch. your Excellency will percieve that no demand is made on the state for specie---;the inclosed report of the Board of Treasury will shew their opinion was, that the whole sum should be demanded in specie:(3) in a Country differently circumstanced than ours their idea is certainly a very just one---;but knowing the difficulty of extracting taxes in any manner from the people & believing the collection of them in specie to be impracticable at this time, we thought the mode recommended by the Board of Treasury not the most eligible & consequently that it was our duty to have it changed, hoping that it may be attended with salutary consequences & that the states may avail themselves of the advantages held out to them. It has been the policy of our Legislature not to comply with the demands of Congress for the payment of such part of their requisitions as are called for in Indents of Interest, which now amount as by paper marked A.(4) to 284,011 dollars. This policy we suppose to be founded on the opinion that the state during the War had made greater advances than the other states. Whether this opinion is built on the solid basis of truth, we cannot say, but certain it is that no such thing appears in the Books of the FOEderal treasury---;for altho it appears that Congress in the year 1778 were satisfied that the state had made considerable advances & did in consequence forego the demand made on the state by the requisition of November 1777. Yet from these accounts not being settled noentry to the credit of the state on requisitions of any kind, appears prior to the year 1782---;but that the Legislature may have some facts to proceed by in making up their judgment  October 24, 1787  on the matter, we take the liberty to give them such information as can be obtained on the subjects. Paper marked B. contains the requisitions made on the states in Old Continental Money with the actual paymts.  C. contains the Requisitions made in new emission money & specie prior to Oct. 1781 with the actual payments.  D. contains the specific requisitions.  E. Contains the requisition for sinking the emissions of Continental money. F. the states accot. with the United States for monies advanced. These statements bring the fOEderal finances into View so far as they respect our state, to the commencement of the year 1782---; when a new Ãra of finance commences, as beyond this no demand is made on the states to make up deficiencies---;but from that time they are held to pay up in specie or Indents of Interest according to the respective requisitions made since that period. It follows that our states proportion of the foregoing demands are---; Requisitions marked B 767,996 ditto C 2,361 ditto D 158,939 ditto E 390,900 ditto F 934,722 Amounting in specie to 2,254,018 dollrs. These sums cannot be taken as certain, because the depreciation cannot be absolutely ascertained nor can the proportions of the states be fixed, as the Rule of apportionment is not determined---;but it appears to us that the sum will be rather more than less---;because the advances of our own state & those of others similarly circumstanced are not included, & ours being an increasing state & population being the basis of the rule of apportionments the longer a settlement is postponed the greater our proportion will be---; beside which there is the loan Office deficiency. The present calculations are made on the supposition of the whole number of souls in the United States (excluding two fifths of the blacks) being two millions three hundred thirty nine thousand three hundred & So. Caroa. being 150,000 of that Number. Beside these sums the requisitions forIndents of Intt. amounting to 284,011 dollars form another charge & any deficiency there may be in paying the specie part of requisitions subsequent to 1782 will also be another. The result is that the state should have demands agt. the Union for more than 2,538,029 dollars in specie exclusive of those general charges for Militia services & depreciation of pay to the Army which every State has & which are not yet exhibited for liquidation. If the states demands against the Union are equal to the several charges we have mentioned then the policy is a right one, but if on the contrary   they are not a perseverance in such measures will in our opinion be attended with very ill consequences. Upon a supposition that the state has not demands upon the Union equal to the demands which the Union has against her---;it will be then incumbent on the Legislature to take such measures as will entitle the state to credit. Two modes occur, the payment of specie & the purchasing of the paper issued by the United States---;the latter we suppose the most eligible. By the purchase of old Continental money & Indents of Interest the state may encrease her demand against the Union 674,011 dollars which we suppose may be done with 200,000 dollars in specie---;if this is delayed & a much greater depreciation takes place the states that have already paid will be against admitting the demands of those states who purchase up at such depreciated State. These matters we submit with the greatest defference to the superior Judgment of the Legislature---;it is not our wish to induce them to do anything beyond what the Union have an absolute right to demand & in all such cases we feel a certainty of their ready compliance. One other matter we think it our duty to mention---;the accompts of the state against the United States in another point of view demand in high degree the attention of the Legislature---;under the ordinance of Congress for settling these accts passed the 7th day of May last(5) there is to be appointed a Board of Commissioners whose powers will extend to the admission of all demands of the states against the Union that are equitable altho not supported or sanctioned by existing resolves of Congress---;many States will avail themselves of this equitable jurisdiction to renew claims that have long laid dormant & no doubt our state may have some which came under this description & which in equity ought to be allowed. The War was long in the state the distance of Congress great---;the exigence admitted no delay---; therefore we conclude many cases exist which are notcovered by Resolutions of Congress & which were for the general benefit---; among which may be enumerated Militia services in a variety of cases, such as quelling insurrections of Tories---;Cherokee expeditions & Treaties---;Guarding the sea Coasts & frontiers---;assistance to Georgia---;Florida expeditions---;operating with the army under Genls Lee, Howe, Lincoln, Gates & Greene---;Fortifying Charlestown in 1776, 1779 and 1780, Destruction of buildings at the same times, Galleys & Vessels of War destroyed in the defense of Charleston---; Ordinance & Military stores destroyed & taken by the Enemy---; Raising, mounting, arming, cloathing & equiping Regiments of Cavalry & State troops in 1780 & 1781 and many others which may not have occurred to Us---;but which ought to be exhibited to put us on an equal footing with the other states. With great Respect, We are Your Excellencys Most Ob servants, (signed) John Kean D. Huger  ""

 Dr. Sir Boston 27. Oct. 1787 I intended to have written to you previously to my departure from New York. Mr. Jay has undoubtedly transmitted to you the late Acts of Congress permitting your return to America after the expiration of your Commission to the English Court, and giving you the unequivocal thanks of the U.S. for the diligent, faithful, and able discharge of your various public Duties since your Residence in Europe.(1) No minister of Congress having before received such Testimony of the public Approbation, you will naturally suppose the Truth, that the Partizans of those Ministers who have returned without any mark of public favor, were not entirely satisfied with the ample vote of Thanks in the present instance. This Distinction in my Judgment constitutes the principal value of the vote, since it proves that the measure was not of Course, but the Effect of singular merit. Your last loan in Holland was approved and ratified;(2) and as on your return you will probably take leave at the Hague as well as at London, Congress judged it proper that your Legation to the former, should terminate with your Commission to the latter. There did not seem to be a Disposition in Congress to appoint a successor to either of these Courts at present;(3) Mr. Jefferson's commission is renewed for Versailles, and I intend writing to Col. Smith by this Opportunity in reply to his last letter relative to the London Legation.  Some Difficulties have heretofore taken place in an allowance to Mr. Dana for a private Secretary while at St. Petersburgh; I was very happy in effecting the customary Allowance to Mr. Dana on this point previously to my leaving Congress,(4) and the more so as it will ease you of an Expence incurred for your Son while in Russia.

 My dear friend, New York October the 27th. 1787 Our mutual friend Mr. Gerry furnishes me with an opportunity of writing to you without danger of my letter being stopt on its passage, as I have some reason to apprehend has been the case with letters written by me and sent by the Post. Under this impression it is, that I send you herewith a Copy of my letter to you of the 5th of this month. Major Sergeant delivered me the letter that you were pleased to write me on the 8th instant,(1) by which I see that you supposed me to have been a Member of the late Convention. I did early decline being a Member of that Body, because I was a Member of Congress and the proposed plan stated, that Congress should rev[i]ew, & if they approved, transmit the proposed amendments to the Confederation, (for that was the Idea, and indeed the only idea that the present federal plan admits of, or that the powers delegated to the Convention countenanced) to the 13 States for approbation and ratification. In this view of the business, it appeared to me an inconsistency that the same Men should in N. York review their own doings at Philadelphia. And thus opinion was fully verified when the Members of Convention came to Congress in such numbers with their own plan, that the Votes of 8 States were Convention Votes, & others divided by Conventioners, and conventioners mingled with many other States.(2) It is Sir most obvious, that the Constitution proposed by the Convention could not have a dispassionate and impartial consideration in Congress---;And indeed it had none. In my letter to you of the 5th instant, I sent you the amendments that I proposed in Congress; if they, with my letter should have miscarried, our friend Mr. Gerry can furnish you with them.(3) Mr. Wilson of Phila. has appeared in print with the Convention reasons in support of their profferd plan.(4) How he has succeeded, Mr. Gerry will inform you. The Press has produced such Manly and well reasoned refutations of him and his system, that both have lost groundamazingly in the public estimation. His principal Sophism is, that bills of rights were necessary in the State Constitutions because everything not reserved was given to the State Legislatures, but in the Federal government, everything was reserved that was not given to the federal Legislature. This is clearly a distinction without difference. Because Independent States are in the same relation to each other as Individuals are with respect to uncreated government. So that if reservations were necessary in one case, they are equally necessary in the other. But the futility of this distinction appears from the conduct of the Convention itself, for they have made several reservations---;every one of which proves the rule in Conventional ideas, to be, that what was not reserved was given. For example, they have reserved from  October 27, 1787  their Legislature a power to prevent the importa[tion] of Slaves for 20 Years, and also from Creating Titles. But they have no reservation in favor of the Press, rights of Conscience, Trial by Jury in Civil Cases, or Common Law securities. As if these were of less importance to the happiness of Mankind than the making of Lords, or the importation of Slaves! The essential defects in the construction of the Legislature, and the dangerous blending of the Legislative and Executive powers, so as to prevent all responsibility, are such radical objections, as render this plan inadmissible, in my opinion, without amendments. The Baron Montesquieu says \""that the English is the only nation in the world, where political or civil liberty is the direct end of its constitution.\"" I once thought that our free governments were intitled to the same praise. But the system under consideration, seems to have reversed the above idea. The acquisition of power unlimited, not the security of Civil liberty appears to be the object. Arbitrary government is indeed so carefully intrenched and barricaded against democratic influences, that I am very much mistaken if Civil Liberty does not expire under its operation. The friends of just Liberty here are astonished at the Occlusion of the Press in Boston at a season so momentous to Mankind.(5) It is thought to augur ill of the New Government proposed, that on its being first ushered into the world, it should destroy the great Palladium of human rights. And at Boston too, where first the Presses pointed America to resist attempts upon her liberty and rights; there to find the great Organ of free communication stopped, when that was under consideration, which of all sublunary things demands the freest and fullest discussion: government, upon the goodness or badness of which, almost depends, whether we shall rank among Men or Beasts! When you are pleased to write to me, your letter, by being enclosed to our friend Mr. Osgood of the Treasury here, will be forwarded safely to me inVirginia, for which place I shall set out from hence on the 4th of next month. My best respects to your Lady, & I pray to be remembered to Gen. Warren, Mr. Lovell, & Doct. Holten. I am dear Sir most sincerely and affectionately your friend, Richard Henry Lee ""

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 28. 1787. I have recd. and acknowledge with great pleasure your favor of the 8th instt.(1) The remarks which you make on the Act of the Convention appear to me to be in general extremely well founded. Your criticism on the clause exempting vessels bound to or from a State from being obliged to enter &c in another is particularly so. This provision was dictated by the jealousy of some particular States, and was inserted pretty late in the Session.(2) The object of it was what you conjecture. The expression is certainly not accurate. Is not a religious test as far as it is necessary, or would operate, involved in the oath itself? If the person swearing believes in the supreme Being who is invoked, and in the penal consequences of offending him, either in this or a future world or both, he will be under the same restraint from perjury as if he had previously subscribed a test requiring this belief. If the person in question be an unbeliever in these points and would notwithstanding take the oath, a previous test could have no effect. He would subscribe it as he would take the oath, without any principle that could be affected by either. October 28, 1787  I find by a letter from Mr. Dawson that the proposed Constitution is receivd by the Assembly with a more prompt & general approbation than could well have been expected. The example of Virginia will have great weight, and the more so, as the disagreement of the deputation, will give it more the appearance of being the unbi[a]ssed expression of the public mind. It would be truly mortifying if any thing should occur to prevent or retard the concurrence of a State which has generally taken the lead on great occasions. And it would be the more so in this case as it is generally believed that nine of the States at least will embrace the plan, and consequently that the tardy remainder must be reduced to the dilemma of either shifting for themselves, or coming in without any credit for it. There is great reason to believe that the Eastern States, R. Island excepted, will be among the foremost in adopting the system. No particular information is yet received from N. Hampshire. The presumptive evidence of its good disposition however is satisfactory. The Legislature of Massts. is now sitting, and letters from good authority, say that every thing goes well. Connecticut has unanimously called a Convention, and left no room to doubt her favorable disposition. This State has long had the character of being antifederal. Whether she will purge herself of it on this occasion, or not, is yet to be ascertained. Most of the respectable characters are zealous on the right side. The party in power is suspected on good grounds to be on the wrong one. N. Jersey adopts eagerly the Constitution. Penna. is considerably divided; but the majority are as yet clearly with the Convention. I have no very late information from Maryland. The reports are that the opposition will make no great figure. Not a word has been heard from the States South of Virginia, except from the lower parts of N. Carola. where the Constitution was well received. There can be little doubt I think that the three Southern States will go right unless theconduct of Virginia were to mislead them. I inclose two of the last Newspapers of this place, to which I add one of Philadelphia, containing the report of a late important decision of the supreme Court there. If the report be faithful, I suspect it will not give you a high idea of the Chancery knowledge of the Cheif Justice.(3) I am Dear Sir with sincere affection, Yr. Obedt. friend & servt., Js.

 Dear Sir New York Octr. 28. 1787. The mail of yesterday brought me your favor of the 22d instant.(1) The communications from Richmond give me as much pleasure, as they exceed my expectations. As I find by a letter from a Member of the Assembly,(2) however, that Col. Mason had not got down, and it appears that Mr. Henry is not at bottom a friend, I am not without fears that their combined influence and management may yet create difficulties. There is one consideration which I think ought to have some weight in the case, over and above the intrinsic inducements to embrace the Constitution, and which I have suggested to some of my correspondents. There is at present a very strong probability that nine States at least will pretty speedily concur in establishing it. What will become of the tardy remainder? They must be either left as outcasts from the Society, to shift for themselves, or be compelled to come in, or must come in of themselves when they will be allowed no credit for it. Can either of these situations be as eligible as a prompt and manly determination to support the Union, and share its common fortunes? My last stated pretty fully the information which had arrived here from different quarters, concerning the proposed Constitution. I recollect nothing that is now to be added farther than that the Assembly of Massachusetts now sitting certainly gives it a friendly reception. I enclose a Boston paper by which it appears that Governour Hancock had ushered it to them in as propitious a manner as could have been required.(3) Mr. P. 's character is as you observe well marked by the publications which I inclosed.(4) His printing the secret paper at this time could have no motive but the appetite for expected praise: for the subject to which it relates has been dormant a considerable time, and seems likely to remain so. A foreign gentleman of merit, and who besides this general title, brings me a letter which gives him a particular claim, to my civilities, is very anxious to obtain a sketch ofthe Potowmac and the route from the highest navigable part of it, to the western waters which are to be connected with the Potowmac by the portage; together with a sketch of the works which are going on, and a memorandum of the progress made in them. Knowing of no other channel through which I could enable myself to gratify this gentleman, I am seduced into the liberty of resorting to your kindness; and of requesting that if you have such a draught by you, your amanuensis may be permitted to take a very rough copy of it for me. In making this request I beseech you Sir to un- October 30, 1787  derstand that I do it with not more confidence in your goodness than with the sincerest desire that it may be disregarded if it cannot be fulfilled with the most perfect conveniency.

 Dear Sir(1) New York Octr. 30. 1787. I have been this day favored with yours of the 21st instant(2) & beg you to accept my acknowledgments for it. I am truly sorry to find so many respectable names on your list of adversaries to the federal Constitution. The diversity of opinions on so interesting a subject, among men of equal integrity & discernment, is at once a melancholy proof of the fallibility of the human judgment, and of the imperfect progress yet made in the science of Government. Nothing is more common here, and I presume the case must be the same with you, than to see companies of intelligent people equally divided, and equally earnest, in maintaining on one side that the General Government will overwhelm the State Governments, and on the other that it will be a prey to their encroachments; on the one side that the structure of the Government is too firm and too strong, and on the other that it partakes too much of the weakness & instability of the Governments of the particular States. What is the proper conclusion from all this? That unanimity is not to be expected in any great political question, that the danger is probably exaggerated on each side, when an opposite danger is conceived on the opposite side---;that if any Constitution is to be established by deliberation & choice, it must be examined with many allowances, and must be compared not with the theory, which each individual may frame in his own mind, but with the System which it is meant to take the place of, and with any other which there might be a probability of obtaining.  I cannot judge so well as yourself of the propriety of mixing with the adoption of the federal Constitution a Revision of that of the State. If the latter point could be effected without risk or inconveniency to the former, it is no doubt desireable. The practicability of this will depend on the degree of unanimity with which it could be undertaken. I should doubt extremely whether the experiment could safely be made. Might not the blendingthese two things together unite those who are unfriendly to either, and thus strengthen the opposition you have to contend with? In case the Genl. Government should be established it will perhaps be easy to follow it with an amendment of our own Constitution. The example will have some influence by proving the practicability & safety of such experiments. And if the Convention think fit, they may lay a proper train of themselves for bringing the matter about. The public mind in this quarter seems not finally settled as yet with regard to the proposed Constitution. The first impression has been every where favorable except in Rh. Island. Nor is there any reason to suspect that the generality of States will not embrace the measure. The character of this State has long been antifederal, & is known that  October 31, 1787  a very powerful party continue so. Penna. is also divided into parties, but it is supposed that a majority will pretty certainly on the right side. With great respect & regard I am Dr Sir Yr. Obdt. & hble. servt., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Sir New York October 31st. 1787 I am honored with your Excellencys obliging favor of the 22d of September, which unfortunately did not come to hand untill last evening by post---;but the letter, alluded, in reply to mine of the 18th of August(1) I have not had the pleasure to receive. What devious paths they may have taken or into what unkind hands have fallen I know not---;but consider it very unfortunate that I did not receive them in time, as it has occasioned some delay on my part, and has probably deprived me of such further communications as would have been very satisfactory & useful.  When I had the honor to address your Excellency last from Philadelphia(2) it was not my intention to have taken a seat in Congress this year but as it was conceived important to have a full House on the subject of the new plan of Government I was induced to take a seat; and have continued in Congress in expectation of receiving a small supply of Money and of having a Colleague for the next year. I am unhappy in not having received a line from your Excellency on the subject of the new Constitution. I presume however it will have your support---;and from all accounts from the different States I think there is a great prospect of its being generally adopted. New York (ever Antifederal) will keep back in order to direct her proceedings by the conduct of other states. The intemperence of a number of the members of the Pennsylvania Legislature has made enemys to the new plan---;but not such as to render the adoption of it very doubtful. Virginia has given rise to the greatest opposition; but their delegates inform me that their last letters have removed all doubts of its adoption in the ancient dominion: their opposition arises from an ill founded jealousy of New England  October 31, 1787  on the Subject of Commercial regulations, the power of making which they are unwilling to leave to a Majority of the Legislature; but wish to have it so established in the Constitution, as that the five Southern States may have the power to prevent all such regulations as may, by possibility, operate against their present interest. This is their great objection---;an other of inferior order (and which I believe had a powerful operation on the sentiments of the gentleman from Massachusetts who refused his assent) is the equal representation in the Senate. These are objections of a nature not to be removed; and if the States do not adopt the present plan, notwithstanding its imperfections, I am fully convinced that there is not the remotest probability of gaining the general assent to one less exceptionable---; and in that case (after all our blustering) we shall exhibit to the world nothing new---;but shall probably pursue the track of nations that have gone before us and establish a Government or Governments by the sword and seal it with blood. In the course of conversation with the delegates of Virginia I find they are interrogated by those who have the management of the finances of that State; on the subject of State Speculations in public securities---;and it is recommended by a number of their most respectable Characters to lay all taxes in hard money and impower an Agent to purchase their Quota. They are not in possession of their quota of the old emission Money and have asked me how we would part with ours. I have informed them that probably they might buy it but have evaded all questions respecting a price. Now sir---;if the Virginians are disposed to give a tolerable price for this money would it not be well for us to sell it and purchase the final settlement Notes on the best terms we can? The sale of the western lands is going on very well; what is already sold and applied for will amount to about Seven Million dollars---;and if North Carolina & Georgia should make such Cessions asmight be expected, it is supposed there will be public lands enough to absorb the most, or perhaps the whole of the domestic debt. It will however appreciate as the sum in circulation deminishes---;therefore if our State could adopt the policy of Virginia in buying up a few thousand pounds with hard Money I should think it would prove very advantageous; particularly to the poorer class of people who often become victims to the avarice of the Harpies that are sometimes employed in collecting taxes. Pennsylvania & New York have bought up their quotas of the public securities and Massachusetts has bought in a considerable sum. We have no despatches by the last packet---;but the news paper account of the commotions in Europe is so correspondent to the last official advices that I am inclined to consider it as a tolerable state of facts and enclose it for your Excellencys perusal. As in the course of  November 3, 1787  writing I may insert things of a nature improper for public discussion I must request your Excellency will please to communicate such parts, only, of my letters, as the public good may require. Your letter to Messrs. P. & H.(3) will go on by the morning post. With sentiments of the highest Respect, I have the honor to be, your Excellencys Most Obedient & Most Humble Servant, Nich. Gilman ""

 Sir, New York November 3d. 1787 The requisition for the present year has already been transmitted to the States by the Secretary of Congress;(1) we, however, now do ourselves the honor to inclose it to your Excellency, together with a report of the Treasury Board, and a return of payments by the Several States to the 30th of June, all which we beg the favor of you to lay before the General Assembly, for their more full information upon the Federal resources.(2) The report of the Treasury Board was proposed for the adoption of Congress as a Requisition, and the statements contained in it, form the foundation of the Act which has been agreed to; but it was thought best to reverse the appropriations suggested by the Board, and by that means call for the amount required upon the new Requisition, in facilities instead of Specie, conceiving that the ability of the States to comply with the demand, would be encreased by the extension of the Latitude of accommodation. Upon the same Consideration the restrictions which were imposed upon the issues and payment of Indents, in the former requisitions, are, by a Clause in this, repealed. The way is now open for evidences of Interest to be issued up to the end of 1786, and it is left to the States to obtain, and pay the balances now due upon their respective quota's in such ways as to them shall seem expedient. Virginia is greatly in arrear in the Indents which have been called for upon the several requisitions from September 1782 inclusive. For discharging these balances we beg leave to submit to the consideration of the Legislature, a mode different from that which has hitherto been pursued. Any observations upon the impolocy of the Systems by which Indents have been made receiveable, upon an equal footing with Specie, in Taxes, we conceive to be Unnecessary, as they must be  November 3, 1787  evident to every one who has in any manner been connected with their Operation, they procure little or no Satisfaction to the public Creditor, while they enormously oppress the Laborious Taxpayer, and are productive of undue emolument to intermediate hands, who are not the objects of public provision, and who would be employed in more useful Occupations did not the public create this Scene of Speculation for them. This being the case, a change of System is necessarily called for, and it only remains to be decided what that change shall be. The first object that presents itself in considering this Subject is, justice to the public Creditors, who have a right to expect their interest in full Specie Value; and could Taxes be collected in specie, commensurate to this demand, it would in our opinions, be the duty of the Public to collect the money and pay it to the Claimants; this measure is however impracticable, nor is it material to a decision what other to adopt, to determine whether this impractibility arises from the poverty of the people, the situation of our Commerce, or any other Cause. It is reduced to a Certainty, that in any Operation the Creditor must find the public provision inadequate to his demand, and he must be satisfied to negotiate his claim at a considerable Loss, or let it lay useless by him---;it then behoves the public to make the best provision which the circumstances of the people will admit, and to open the best possible ground of nogotiation, which may be embraced or neglected by the creditor at his own option; but should he determine to Negotiate at a loss, it is highly proper that the loss he sustains, should rather be turned to the common relief, than the emolument of the Collectors and a few other Individuals---;upon these Considerations we beg leave to submit to the wisdom of the General Assembly, whether it would not be best to discard the mode of Collecting Indents in Taxes as has hitherto been done, and to lay as great a Tax as the people can reasonably pay in Specie, tobe applied in the purchase of the Indents---;upon the ground of such a Tax the great speculators would be ready to enter into Contracts for supplying them at Certain prices---;in addition to the prospect of success in this Measure which must now be evident, we have to observe that the repeal of the restrictions upon the Issues of Indents will soon throw into the Market great sums of them, and as it is to be presumed that most of the States will Neglect to make proper provision for their Redemption, there must be a considerable fall in their Value.(3) You will observe Sir, that for discharging our foreign demands, as well as the domestic expences of the Current year, Congress rely upon a Surplusage in the former requisitions, occasioned by many of the Objects for which these requisitions were made, being turned into the liquidated debt, and other Circumstances which appear in the report of the Treasury Board; but as this surplusage exists altogether in the balances now remaining due from the States, and the purposes for   which it is appropriated are indispensible, it remains absolutely Necessary that these balances be fully paid---;our last payments in Europe have been effected by a new Loan of one Million of Guilders negotiated by Mr Adams in Holland, but Congress from motives of Honor and Justice which must present themselves without further explanation have ordered that no farther Loans be negotiated(4)---;it remains therefore with the States to determine whether the Credit and administration of the Union, are to be Supported for another year, or abandoned. The 109,391 64/90ths Dollars appropriated in the hands of the Commissioners of Loans in Holland, is the balance now remaining of the late Negotiation, but it amounts to but a Triffling part of the sum Necessary for foreign purposes. We also have the Honor to enclose to your Excellency the Ordinance for establishing a Temporary Government in the Western Territory, and providing for its passage into state Governments(5)---;a part of this plan depends upon the Accession of Virginia, to which we beg leave to call the attention of the Legislature. The proposed arrangement of the Territory into three States we conceive to be much better than that which was formerly made in Conformity to the Act of Cession. A Division of the Country into many small states would effectually disappoint the design of Virginia, that the inhabitants be admitted into the Federal Government, upon their becoming so numerous as to have reasonable pretentions to such admission, because it might, upon the whole, be very populous, and yet in no one of the described States, contain as many inhabitants as the smallest of the original States; in this situation it could not be expected, they would remain long contented, and the federal Government would be under the Necessity of suffering them to enter into other Alliances, or departing from the stipulated terms of Admission. The proposed arrangement of the Territory into three States will avoid these difficulties, without any eventualinconvenience, from the reduction of the Number---;indeed, if it is thought material to the interest of the southern states, that their scale be strengthened by an accession in this quarter, that object will be better secured by the new, than the old plan, because upon the former there may be an early admission of a state, but upon the latter such an event must be long, or perhaps forever postponed.(6) We are happy in being able to present to the View of your Excellency and the Legislature a prospect of an early and considerable reduction of the domestic debt by sales of Western Territory. Seven Ranges of Townships have been surveyed agreeably to the Ordinance of the 20th of May 1785, containing upwards of one Million of Acres, about one hundred and Twenty thousand Whereof have been sold for somewhat more than the Average price of one dollar per Acre in public securities---;these ranges extend west from the place of beginning directed in the ordinance nearly down to Muskingum. But a mode of   Sale has lately presented itself which promises a more rapid progress, while it will exempt the United States from the greatest part of the expence that would attend a strict pursuance of the Ordinance, without Materially departing from it. Companies of Adventurers have come forward with propositions for large Tracts, and a Contract is actually made with Messrs Sargent and Cutler, in behalf of a considerable Company from the Eastern States, for all the Country between the seventh Range of Townships, and Sciota, from the Ohio North, as far as a due West line to be extended from the Northern boundary of the Tenth Township---;the whole of this tract is supposed to contain about five Millions of Acres. The terms are, that the United States, shall at the public expence, Survey & mark the external boundaries, and ascertain the Contents of the Tract---;the Company to lay it out, at their own expence, into Townships and Sections, agreeably to the Ordinance, subject to the reserves therein described, except that one of the sections for future sale shall be granted forever for the purposes of Religion, and that two Complete Townships shall be granted forever for the purposes of an University. All other Lands within the Tract, to be paid for, without any abatement whatever for bad Land, at the price of two thirds of a dollar per acre in public Securities, excluding interest---;half a million of dollars to be paid upon closing the Contract, and possession taken so far as that payment will cover; and afterwards payment and Occupancy to go on, pari passu, at certain periods, under Certain stipulations of reciprocal assurance. Army Rights for Military Bounties are made receivable in payment of the purchase money, in the proportion of one seventh part, but as Lands are set a part and to be surveyed, for satisfying these Bounties, more to the advantage of the Claimants, it is not likely that many of these Rights will be rendered in discharge of this debt. Another offer is made by Judge Symmes and his associatesfrom New-Jersey, for about two and an half Millions between the little and great Miami's, upon the same terms. Congress have Authorised the Treasury Board to close with this proposition, but it is not yet compleated; upon these two Contracts being carried into full effect they will take up, as may be seen by the statement inclosed, upwards of three Millions and an half of dollars, even upon a supposition that the full proportion receiveable in Bounty Rights, be actually rendered.(7) Two other propositions have been made, whereupon Congress have given the Treasury Board a general Authority to sell by Contract; provided that no tract so disposed of shall contain less than one Million of Acres, making the Terms of Sargent and Cutlers purchase the ground, with deviations as to the grants for religion, and an University, unless the Contract be for an equal quantity.(8) This mode of Sale is calculated to relieve the United States of much expence, and present appearances are, that our people will soon feel the domestic debt considerably lightened, by it.  This great fund for the extinguishment of the National debt, has lately received a probable augmentation, by a Cession from South Carolina of a Tract that will, it is supposed, be eventually within the limits of that state, containing about half a Million of Acres on the Missisippi, upon running the lines lately stipulated in the adjustment of her disputes with Georgia.(9) The Requisitions upon North Carolina and Georgia for liberal Cessions of Territory have recently been repeated by Congress in terms so pressing that we hope these States will not persevere in withholding those Acts of Justice.(10) In pursuance of our instructions we have called the attention of Congress to the subject of the Barbary piracies, and a measure for forming a Confederacy with some of the European powers, who may be disposed to Act against them, had been contemplated, but the desperate prospect of the United States being enabled to comply with their Stipulations in such a Confederacy, has obliged Congress to decline any Overtures towards this desirable object. We cannot however forbear to express our regret, that a measure which appears so practicable, which would be so honorable to the Union, and in which the States are so materially interested, should be neglected because the necessary Contributions for its support cannot be relied upon.(11) The Subject of the great accounts of the Union has this year received its accustomed revision, and is considerably improved. We have the honor to inclose to your Excellency an Ordinance of the 7th of May last for the Completion of this Business, and beg the favor of you to lay it before the General Assembly.(12) The reduced State of Congress in the latter part of the year has prevented the election of the three Superior Commissioners, but as the Subordinate parts of the plan is now in Operation in the districts, the elections may be made by the New Congress in time for every useful purpose. We beg leave to call the attention of the Legislature to the Great Balancewhich stands against the State in the Treasury Books, on account of the old paper emissions; this Balance is nearly twenty Six Millions of dollars(13)---;it is for the Legislature to determine upon the most eligible mode of discharging it, but could funds be provided for obtaining it by purchase we apprehend it could be got at a much lower rate, than that at which, upon a final settlement of the accounts, it will be adjusted. Large sums of this money are in the hands of Individuals in the Eastern States, who would doubtless be disposed to sell; we, however have no principles on which to hazard an Opinion upon the demands that would be made by the holders for it. In pursuance of the enclosed resolution of the 21st of April last a Contract has been made for a Coinage of Copper,(14) from which some aid will result to the resources of the United States---;and we beg leave to call the attention of the Legislature to the Necessity of passing Laws for prevention of Counterfeits.

 Dear brother New York Novr. 8th. 1787. Having mislaid your last favor, I can not acknowledge it by reference to its date. It contained two requests, the one relating to Mr. House's rule of calculating the weight of the Tobacco; the other to my being a candidate in Orange for the Convention. In answer to the first point I inclose the rule exemplified.(1) If this should not suffice, I will send you a calculation in detail for the whole account. In answer to the second point, I am to observe that it was not my wish to have followed the Act of the General Convention into the Convention of the State; supposing that it would be as well that the final decision thereon should proceed from men who had no hand in preparing and proposing it. As I find however that in all the States the members of the Genl. Convention are becoming members of the State Conventions, as I have been applied to on the subject by sundry very respectable friends, as I have reason to believe that many objections in Virginia proceed from a misconception of the plan, or of the causes which produced the objectionable parts of it; and as my attendance at Philadelphia, may enable me to contribute some explanations and informations which may be of use, I shall not decline the representation of the County if I should be honoured with its appointment. You may let this be known in such way as my father & yourself may judge best. I shall be glad to hear from [you] on the subject, and to know what competition there will probably be and by whom. As far as present appearances denote, the N. England States, R. Island excepted, will all adopt the new Constitution. N. Jersey certainly will. So will Penna. according to the best opinions, by a very decided majority. I have favorable information also from Maryland; though it is not improbable that the opposition likely to be made in Virginia will have some effect on that side, as well as on the side of N. Carolina, which in general has been said to be well disposed. Like information has been recd. fromthe two more southern States; but it is too early to pronounce on their disposition. This State (N. York) is much divided. The party in power, are unwilling to surrender any portion of it. The other party is composed of the more respectable citizens, and  November 10, 1787  is warmly attached to the proposed Constitution. Whatever may be the sence of the Majority the State will scarcely have a will of its own, if New England on one side and N. Jersey & Pena. on the other come heartily into the measure. A French packet arrived a few days ago; but brings no decisive information concerning the Dutch. It continues to be uncertain what their fate is to be. A war between Russia & Turkey is said to have been declared by the latter. A great change has taken place in the French Ministry. The Parliament lately banished, has got back to Paris, and it is expected that the new taxes against which they remonstrated, will not be enforced. Provincial assemblies are at length established throughout the Kingdom. The Marquis de la Fayette is a leading member of one of them. The Count de Moustier is appointed Minister to the U. States in the place of the Chevalier de la Luzerne, and may soon be expected here.(2) I have now given you all the news foreign & domestic, and have only to add my dutiful regards to my father & mother, and to request that I may be properly remembered to all others. Yrs. affectly., Js. Madison Jr. N.B. The Almanack & other papers herewith enclosed are for my father. ""

 Dear Sir, New York Nov. 10. 1787 Mr. Madison and myself have done ourselves the honor to write you very fully as late as the 23d ult.---;but as the Chevalier Jones is but now about to sail in a Merchant Man for Holland, from whence he means to go directly to Paris, I just use this additional opportunity to inclose you the papers from the period of our former letters to this date.  November 10, 1787  They contain sundry peices upon the subject of the New Constitution, & and will serve to shew you the sentiments of its opponents, but you are not to conclude from the number of them that they shew the general sense of the people. We have learned from Virginia that several men of considerable influence are in the opposition, amongst whom Mr. Henry is numbered. It appears however, by the papers, that the new project is getting much into fashion in that state. Amongst the papers inclosed you will see the issue of several formal assemblies of the people. The legislature have directed that a convention be held in May, for the purpose of, \""adopting, amending or rejecting\"" the proposed Government. The long postponement was occasioned by unfriendly intentions toward it, but I apprehend the rapidity of the movements of the other States in the business, will, by that time, have brought so many into the adoption, that even its enemies will see the necessity of joining. The Chevalier Jones has been detained much longer in America than he expected at his arrival, owing to a deal of perplexities he has met with in the adjustment of his negotiations in France. The Treasury Board had his papers upwards of two months before they reported. They then proposed that the division which had been made of the prize money, by the Court of France, should be reversed as it respected the Commanders of the Bon homme Richard, & the Alliance, and that they should share upon the common mass of the two ships, instead of each taking upon the mass of his own. This was however disagreed to by Congress, & the division by the court of France confirmed. They also proposed that he should be ordered immediately, to pay up the balance retained by him when he made a payment to you, only deducting 5 per Cent for Com[mission]. This was also disagreed to, & he is allowed still to retain that balance until some future decision shall be made. Some propositions were made which he will shew you with the yeas & nays, from whichthere results a decided sense of Congress, that he ought to retain so much money on some principle, but it could not be agreed whether it should be paid out of the public treasury or deducted from the property recovered. I own that, to me it appeared probable that the money was necessarily expended, & that it ought to be taken from the property of those in whose service the expence was incurred. Whatever might have been the obligations of the Court of France to pay the money, a long & expensive of attendance was nevertheless necessary to obtain it, &, since it had before been tried by Mr. Barclay without success, it is likely that personal considerations, which applied to Jones alone ensured the success he has met with.(1) You will receive some Resolutions upon the Denmark business which reverse those which formerly established the Chevalier Jones as the agent.(2) This was occasioned by several considerations. By some   Gentlemen it was thought that the application to that Court involved a complaint of a breach of the Laws of Nations, which required an immediate diplomatic commission---;and it having been suggested by the Board of Treasury that the security formerly given by Mr. Jones was somewhat impaired by a reduction of the property of those who were bound with him, it was thought by others that in justice to the people concerned, he ought to be called upon for additional security. Upon the whole it was unanimously thought best to shift the ground upon which the business stood leaving the eventual further employment of the Chevalier to you, who must be the best acquainted with his conduct. I find that this brave, and in my mind, honest, Man has his enemies. These may represent him to you in an injurious light, and the statement I make is just intended to shew you how he really stands with Congress. It is expected that you will employ him if, you, do not think him unworthy of being trusted in the business which is to be done. In candor however I must tell you that you will be held accountable for whatever money may be received, but send who you will, I suppose you may draw the money through whatever channel you please so as to keep it out of the hands of the agent, should you not chuse entirely to hazard it in his hands. We have just received notice from Kentucky that, at a Convention held for the purpose, the people of that district have determined upon their separation from Virga. in conformity to the Act of Fall 1785, and a request is made to Congress for their admission, as a New State into the confederation. (3) You have no doubt seen the Act of Virga. The period fixed for the commencement of the separate government is the beginning of 1789. I have the Honor to be with great sincerity, Yr. affectionate Humble Servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 Dear Sir. NYork Nov. 10th. 1787. I have received your favor, for which I am much obliged; the Convention, at Philada. about which I wrote you, have at length produced (contrary to expectation) an entire new constitution; This has put us all in an uproar. Our public papers are full of attacks and justifications of the new system: And if you go into private companies, you hear scarcely any thing else. In the Eastern States the thing is well recieved; the enemies to the Constitution say that this is no wonder, as they have overreached the Southern people so much in its formation. In this State, I believe there is a great majority against it; the reason assigned by its favours is that she derives great advantages by imposing duties on the imports of Jersey & Connecticut. In Jersey, nothing is more popular. There was something singular in the affair which is that the one was determined to adopt & the other to reject the new constitution before it had made its appearance. In Pensylvany matters are warmly contested by the Republicans and Constitutionalists, but from what I have heard lately I think the former will carry their point; by that I mean that there will be a majority in favor of the new constitution. In Delawar & Maryland I hear of little or no opposition, though in the latter some was expected from Chase & Paca. In Virginia there is a very considerable one; Ben. Harrison, Genl. Nelson, Patrick Henry, Thruston, Zane, Rich. H. Lee, & Co., George Mason, most of the Judges of the Genl. Court cum multis aliis of the inferior flanking parties are inlisted as opponents. Genl. Washington however who is a host within himself is strongly in favor of it, & I am at a loss to determine how the matter will be ultimately closed. As to the two Carolinas & Georgia, I have not yet heard much about them; the general supposition is that it will go down very smoothly in those regions; as to the lat- November 10, 1787  ter it is highly probable, as she is at present very much embarassed with an Indian war, and in great distress; and as she will pay nothing under any government it is very immaterial to her how many changes are effected; this latter observation will apply in a great degree to some of her neighbors. With respect to my own sentiments I own I have important objections. In the first place I think liberty a thing of too much importance to be trusted on the ground of implication: it should rest on principles expressed in the clearest & most unequivocal manner. A bill of rights ought then to have preceded. Tryals by jury should have been expressly reserved in Civil as well as Criminal cases. The press ought to have been declared free. I think the fOEderal Courts in the different states wrong. One Court at the session of Congress with appellative jurisdiction in the cases mentioned in the proposed constitution would have been sufficient. The representation in the Senate ought to have been in the same proportion as the lower house, except in a few cases merely of a fOEderal nature where the little States should be armed with a repulsive quality to preserve their own existence. The power of regulating commerce by a bare majority and that of taxing will ruin the Southern States; and the proposed method of making treaties, ie, by two thirds of the Senators present will be the means of losing the Missisippi for ever. Indeed we have had great difficulty to prevent it from destruction for two years past. In these & several other instances which I could enumerate, I think the generarility [sic] will have too much power, but there are points where I don't think they have power enough. In order to face foreign powers properly & to preserve their treaties & their faith with them, they should have had a negative upon the State laws with sevl other incidental powers. Witht. this I am satisfied the new government if adopted will in a year or two be as contemptible as thepresent. Upon the whole I look upon the new system as a most ridiculous piece of business---;something (entre nous) like the legs of Nebuchadnezar's image:(1) It seems to have been formed by jumbling or compressing a number of ideas together, something like the manner in which poems were made in Swift's flying Island.(2) However bad as it is, I believe it will be crammed down our throats rough & smooth with all it's imperfections: the temper of America is changed beyond conception since you were here, & I believe they were ready to swallow almost any thing. Mr. Adams has lately been recalled according to his request, and no provision is made for a successor: indeed according to present appearance not even a ChargÃ¨ or agent will be left there. The indisposition of some States to thank him had for the moment an injurious effect on the reappointment of Mr. Jefferson: however the thing was got over, &   Mr. Adams returns with the intire approbation of Congress. In general I think (between you & me) he and his book are thought of nearly in the same manner in this country.(3) Nobody is yet appointed to Holland; though Mr. V. B.(4) feels very uncomfortable on that head. Mr. Gardoqui continues here, but has done nothing, and matters appear at a greater distance than ever.(5) Since the Convention rose Congress have attended a little to business---;& have done something for the credit of the Nation. They have either made or are about making contracts for Western territory which if complied with will have for their object the extinguishment of near six Millions of dolls of the domestic debt. I heartily wish the rage for terra firma may continue here, & that it may also extend itself to Europe. I have often thought something might be done in that quarter---;& have frequently though in vain suggested the idea to that caput mortiuum of vitriol Congress. They have also done something relative to the settlemt. of the accounts of the different States: an Ordnance is passed constituting a kind of high Court of Chancy. with considerable powers to decide on them in the last resort: The Commrs. however are not yet appointed.(6) I am now on the point of leaving this, my time by the prest. constitution being expired,(7) but shall continue to write you from Virga. The delegates for our State for the next year are already appointed. They are Maddisson, Carrington, Harry Lee, Brown of the Senate & Cyrus Griffin: though I dont expect there will be a Congress till Aprill or May next if then: as It is supposed the States who are for the new Constitution will be very slow in sending on their members. I remain, yr. Affect. frd & hble serv, Willm. Grayson NB. Yesterday We had information that Kentucki had had a Convention which have adopted the idea of independance on the terms proposed by Virga. The Delegates are instructed to effect her admission in the Union.(8) I have a son here abt14 ys. of age well advanced in Latin, Greek, Mathematics & french, & have some notion in a year or two to send him to France: I wish you would let me know your opinion of instruction in that quarter, & particularly the price. yr. W.G. Inclosed are the papers of the day. You are nor suppose I mean to reflect on the members of the Convention: I highly respect the chief of them: but they could not act otherwise so circumstanced.

 My dear Sir New York Nov. 11. 1787 Mine of yesterday to Mr. Jefferson inclosing sundry news papers contained the best information I was then possessed of respecting the new plan of Government, but I am this morning informed that Mr. E. Gerry one of the deputies from Massachusetts in the late Grand Convention, & who refused to sign the project, has submitted his objections to the legislature of his State in such terms as to work some probable mischief, what will be the extent is not known, but the circumstance occasions alarm to the Friends of the measure(1) ---; as my views are not to give to Mr. Jefferson & yourself my own wishes upon this business, but the best possible information how it is likely to be received in the States, I think it essential that this event be communicated with the intilligence that my other letters contain. You will therefore be good enough to give Mr. Jefferson a sight of this letter. The Chevalier Jones has met with inconvenience here from his old Friend Landais---;who persists in his endeavour to dishonor him, but wanting the necessary boldness to face him, he has resorted to falshood for the accomplishment of his views---;he circulated one day in the Coffee House that he had Spit in the Chevaliers face with such confidence that it was believed for several days before (the Chevalier) heard of it---;this however has been so well contradicted as to remove every bad effect from the liberal minded---;the Chevalier will explain the whole to you and it will be enough for me to say that he cannot give it a fairer appearance than it really bears here. The Vessel is about to sail & I cannot be more full. Yr. sincerely, Ed. Carrington P.S. The inclosed paper contains Gerry's objections. ""

 Sir, New-York 13th. Novr. 1787 Having recd. the proceeds of your warrant on the treasury for part of my salary during my service in congress for the year now commencing; I thought it an attention to the duty to give an early attendance: accordingly, I was here by the expiration of the late fOEderal year. Perhaps it may be proper to mention to your Excellency, that as no official information has been given to congress, by our state, of what appointment she has made in her delegation for this year; the secretary urges me to request that the necessary credentials be transmitted by the first convenient opportunity.(1) As yet no Congress has been formed; So Carolina alone being present.(2) While I am writing to your Excellency at a time that all minds, & all conversations are turned towards the interesting question of changing the fOEderal system it may be expected from every one who is honored with the public confidence to shew some attention to that subject. But the gentlemen of the late delegation are so lately returned, as are also those who assisted at the convention, that I conceive it unnecessary to be very particular. Yet, as those who have been the most conversant with the subject appear to me to be the most convinced of the necessity of an efficient fOEderal government; I feel myself disposed to remark, that \""no system could be framed which a spirit of doubt, & jealousy, might not conceive to be fraught with danger: that this over-cautious temper may be pushed to excess, I think I may be excused if I cite our present confederation in evidence.\"" I must in candor confess, that I have regretted that the proposed constit[u]tion was not more explicit with respect to several essentials: but the great clamor is, that no express provision is made for the tryal by jury, and liberty of the press; things so interwoven with our political, or legal ideas, that I conceive the sacred immutability of these rights to be such, as never to have occurred as questionable objects to theconvention. And can it indeed be supposed, that three distinct branches, originating from, & returning to the people, will combine to invade these inviolable first principles? Or would they expect to do it with im- November 17, 1787  punity? The apprehension wears too pusilanimous a complexion. Whatever may be our wish in theory, we find in practice, by our own example, that states in confederacy, like individuals in society, must part with some of their privileges, for the preservation of the rest. In proof of which, it cannot be denied that, for want of attention to, or knowledge of that maxim, these states are now tottering on the brink of anarchy.

 My dear friend N. York, Novr. 18. 1787. I returned hither yesterday from Philada. to which place I had proceeded under arrangements for either going on to Virginia, or coming back as I might there decide. Your very affectionate favor of the 23d Ult.(1) found me in Philada. after travelling to N. York, and I should have answered it before my return, had any matters for communication occurred worth the expence of postage. I did not make any observations on the scheme mentioned in your letter from Bolling-Green,(2) because it had an object which I thought it unadvisable to pursue; because I conceived that my opinion had been fully made known on the subject, and I wished not unnecessarily to repeat or dwell on points, on which our ideas do not accord; and because I considered that part of your letter merely as a friendly communication, and a pleasing pledge of your confidence, and not as a subject on which my ideas were wished. So much indeed was this the case, that at the time of answering that letter, I had not considered the expedient, with sufficient accuracy, as a means of attaining the end proposed, to justify any opinion or remarks touching its fitness. The difficulty which struck me on a subsequent attention to it, and which seemed insuperable was that several Legislatures would necessarily have provided for a Convention, and even adjourned before amendatory propositions from Virginia could be transmitted. I have not since my arrival collected any additional information concerning the progress of the federal Constitution. I discovered no evidence on my journey through N. Jersey, that any opposition whatever would be made in that State. The Convention of Pennsylvania is to meet on Tuesday next. The members returned I was told by several persons, reduced the adoption of the plan in that State to absolute certainty and by a greater majority than the most sanguine advocates had calculated. One of the Counties which had been set down by all on the list of opposition had elected deputies of knownattachment to the Constitution. I inclose herewith sundry letters which came by the French packet just arrived. The letter for Col. N. Lewis, Mr. Jefferson tells me is of great consequence.(3) You will have frequent opportunities during the Assembly, of giving it a safe conveyance. I have myself no public information by the packet, and have not yet learnt that any of moment has been received at the office of Foreign Affairs. The intelligence passing in conversation is that the Porte has declared war agst. Russia, that notwithstanding the advance of the Prussian troops into Holland, it is not certain that an accomodation may not prevent actual hostilities, and that in general it remains doubtful whether war or peace in the Western parts of Europe is to result from the present crisis of Affairs.  November 18, 1787  A great change has taken place again in the French Ministry. The Count de la Luzerne, brother of the Chevalier, succeeds the Marshal de Castries in the department of Marine. The provincial Assemblies throughout are established, and some of them have already met. The Marquis(4) is a leading member in that of Auvergne. The Parliament is returned to Paris, and it is supposed that the Court will not enforce either the Stamp duty or the territorial impost. The Count de Moutier is appointed Minister to the U. States and may shortly be expected. I do not find that a single State is represented except Virginia, and it seems very uncertain when a Congress will be made. There are individual members present from several States; and the attendance of this & the neighbouring States, may I suppose be obtained when it will produce a quorum. With the most sincere & invariable affection, I remain my dear friend Yrs., Js Madison Jr. ""

 Dear Sir New York Novr. 18. 1787. Your favor of the 5th instant(1) found me in Philada. whither I had proceeded, under arrangements for proceeding to Virginia or returning to this place, as I might there decide. I did not acknowledge it in Philada. because I had nothing to communicate, which you would not receive more fully and correctly from the Mr. Morris's who were setting out for Virginia.(2) All my informations from Richmond concur in representing the enthusiasm in favor of the new Constitution as subsiding, and giving place to a spirit of criticism. I was fearful of such an event from the influence and co-operation of some of the adversaries. I do not learn however that the cause has lost its majority in the Legislature, and still less among the people at large. I have nothing to add to the information heretofore given concerning the progress of the Constitution in other States. Mr. Gerry has presented his objections to the Legislature in a letter addressed to them, and signified his readiness if desired to give the particular reasons on which they were founded. The Legislature it seems decline the explanation, either from a supposition that they have nothing further to do in the business, having handed it over to the Convention; or from an  November 18, 1787  unwillingness to countenance Mr. Gerry's conduct; or from both these considerations. It is supposed that the promulgation of this letter will shake the confidence of some, and embolden the opposition of others in that State; but I cannot discover any ground for distrusting the prompt & decided concurrence of a large majority.(3) I inclose herewith the 7 first numbers of the federalist, a paper addressed to the people of this State. They relate entirely to the importance of the Union. If the whole plan should be executed, it will present to the public a full discussion of the merits of the proposed Constitution in all its relations. From the opinion I have formed of the views of a party in Virginia I am inclined to think that the observations on the first branch of the subject may not be superfluous antidotes in that State, any more than in this. If you concur with me, perhaps the papers may be put into the hand of some of your confidential correspondents at Richmond who would have them reprinted there. I will not conceal from you that I am likely to have such a degree of connection with the publication here, as to afford a restraint of delicacy from interesting myself directly in the republication elsewhere. You will recognize one of the pens concerned in the task. There are three in the whole. A fourth may possibly bear a part.(4) The intelligence by the packet as far as I have collected it, is contained in the gazette of yesterday. Virginia is the only State represented as yet. When a Congress will be formed is altogether uncertain. It is not very improbable I think that the interregnum may continue throughout the winter. With every sentiment of respect & attachment, I remain dear Sir Yr. Affect. & hble servant, Js. Madison Jr. ""

 Gentlemen, New York Nov. 20. 1787. When the Southern Army was disbanded in the year 1783, the public property which had been annexed to it, was, from the particular circumstances of the Country, sold upon Credit, and bonds were taken for the proceeds payable on the 1t of January 1784. This mode of sale was adopted by the advice of Genl Greene, & afterwards approved of by Mr. Morris & Colo. Pickering(1) ---;a part of the money was collected before I left the country upon a discount which I allowed for prompt payment, but there still remained unpaid upowards of 20,000 dollars upon Bonds which I left in the hands of Mr. Hext McCall Attorney at Law, to be collected by him.(2) After my return to Virginia, agreably to the orders of Colo. Pickering, I made a Return of the debts due from the department under my direction as far they had then been adjusted, and the probable amount of what remained to be adjusted, for the payment whereof, the proceeds of these Sales, with an addition of 25,000 dollars to be received from Mr. Webb, then receiver for Virginia, were appropriated in my hands. Colo. Pickering & myself have proceeded in the discharge of the debts as far as they have been demanded by the holders of the Vouchers, and are all proceeding, but there still remains due 18,567 29/90ths dollars, as by the Return enclosed. It is also accompanied with the present state of the funds ap[pro]priated. The purpose of this address to your honorable Board is to obtain your opinions as to the most prudent course to be pursued for compleating the collection of the debts still remaining due to the department upon the sales in South Carolina. Mr. McCalls collections have hitherto amounted, as by a late return, to only 8,699 26/90ths dollars; and there is no prospect of his adding to the sum in any considerable degree, unless he is permitted to receive paper money. The paper money as well as instalment Acts, of South Carolina, are already known to your honorable Board and need not be detailed by me. We have but achoice of submitting to the effects of both, or declining to prosecute the claims, and it remains only to be decided which alternative to take. The first may be a means of bringing the business to a close, probably, in the course of three years, with some loss upon the paper money received. The other will occasion it to remain open for many years and in that time the loss by insolvencies may amount to much more than would be sustained in the paper money. Upon these considerations it appears to me that it would be best, to instruct Mr. McCall to proceed, under the existing Laws, to effect the recovery of the debts, and that the paper money which may be received in the operation, be converted into specie, by exchanging it at a discount, or purchasing produce & shipping it to this City or Philada. to be sold, as  November 20, 1787  may from time to time, seem best for reallizing the proceeds of the collections, on the Acct. of the public. But notwithstanding my perfect conviction that this will be the most advantageous mode of proceeding in the business, yet I wish to have it in some measure sanctioned by the advice or approbation of your honorable Board, and should you agree with me in opinion you will very much oblige me, by signifying it in writing. For your better information as to the present State of the paper money I do myself the honor to inclose Mr. MCalls letter upon the subject dated as late as 19th Ult.(3) He will be left at liberty to vary his conduct with any change of circumstance.

I beg leave to return my most grateful Acknowledgments to Mrs. Langdon for her kind wishes---;and hope she will gratify me and many others in this place with an opportunity of testifying our respects in a more pleasing form. In themean time and at all times I am, with the greatest Respect & Esteem, Dear Sir, Your Most Obedient & Most Humble servant, Nich. Gilman. ""

 Sir, New York Nov. 22. 1787 We do ourselves the honor to communicate to your Excellency the European intelligence which we have received to the 22d of September by the last French packet. The Affairs of Holland were at that time in a gloomy state as they respected the Patriots, and it is to be apprehended that before this, they must have been brought to a serious issue: it appears hardly possible that the event can be any thing short of a perfect disappointment of the views of that party. The King of Prussia, urged by England, and incensed by the indignity alledged to have been offered to his Sister, has sent 30,000 Troops into these provinces. This formidable Army, Commanded by the Duke of Brunswic, made its invasion, on the 15th of September, and by the 22d had obtained possession, against little or no opposition, of Utrecht and all the other places which had made an appearance of opposing the Stadtholder, except Amsterdam. This City is saved, for the present, by the inundation of the Country between it and the Enemy. The Patriots have no foreign Aid to expect but from France; she is by no means in a situation to engage two such powers as England & Prussia in their behalf, and a late event still adds to her embarrassments---;This is a declaration of War by the Porte against Russia. As the powers now stand arranged, with a view to this War, the Parties are Turkey & France (perhaps Spain also) against Russia, the Emperor of Germany, Prussia & England: the inequality is so striking, that it would seem madness in France to proceed in it. She might plunge herself into Ruin in an attempt to support the Turks, and must still, eventually, leave them to their fate; in this State of things it might not be difficult for her to determine what conduct to observe were she left to decide entirely with a view to her own present circumstances, but it is not unlikely that the great ascendency which, one of the parties in the War, are about to possess, will excite such apprehensions in this Court, that shewill not be content with barely withdrawing from it. The balance of powers, so essential to the tranquillity and safety of Europe, will be destroyed, and this she will not suffer to take place if she can by any means prevent it. Her only resort must be to such negotiations as may eventually place her in alliance with some, against others, of the powers at present concerned on the other side; the probability is, that in such event, she will be connected with the two Empires, and, consequently, be placed in the scale opposite to the Porte; in short, it must lead to an entire change of the System of Europe. In any event it appears that an extensive and bloody Continental War is inevitable, which will press hard upon the Turks, and may, eventually, drive them out of Europe. November 22, 1787  Should the changes here suggested take place by an early period, the Patriotic Party in Holland may possibly derive advantages from them. France will in every situation continue their Freind, and will not fail to exhibit proof of it whenever she can with effect. It appears that the Emperor will carry into effect his new arrangements in Brabant; He has contrived to amuse his discontented subjects with pretended negotiations until he has established amongst them a sufficient force to compel them to compliance. France is again in a State of tranquillity---;The Parliaments have made such firm opposition against the Stamp-Act and territorial impost, that the King has suspended his efforts to carry them into effect, which is understood as an entire relinquishment. The Parliament of Paris, which was banished to Troyes, is recalled. The Provincial Assemblies are established as recommended by the Notables. Our Freind, the Marquis de la Fayette, is in Auvergne, and a principal Member in the Assembly of that province. This Nobleman is high in the estimation of his Country, and appears to be inspiring all orders of it, with those princples of liberty and equality which, though the growth of his own mind, have been confirmed in the American School. The Revenues of this Kingdom will be greatly increased by a more equal administration of the old system, than was formerly made. The property of the Nobles and Clergy, which were nearly exempted, will now be brought to Contribute to the support of the public burthens. This reform with reductions in the expenditures of the public money, it is hoped, will provide for the relief of our good Ally from the difficulties which now press her. It is much to be regretted that in this hour of her distress the American debt can not be paid. The French Cabinet has undergone nearly an entire change---;the Archbishop of Toulouse being made prime-Minister, the Marechals of Castries & Segur, Ministers of the Marine & War departments have resigned. To the first theCount de la Lucerne (Brother of the late Minister in America), and to the latter Monsr. de Brienne have succeeded. The department of Controul has had a very rapid succession of Tenants---;from Mr. Calonne it passed to Mr. de Fourqueux, from him to Villedeuil, & from him to Lambert who holds it at present. Great changes have also taken place in the foreign appointments. The Count de Moustier is to come to America, and the Chevalier de la lucerne, it is supposed, will go to London---;& Mr. de St. Preist is sent to Holland in place of Mr. de Verac.  We have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Your Excellencies Most Obedt. Servts., Js. Madison Jr Ed. Carrington ""

 My dear Sir,(1) New York Nov. 26. 1787 I am to acknowledge the receipt of the letter you did me the honor to write from Philadelphia---;also that from Richmond inclosing two to be sent by the English packet. These were put into the mail, and I suppose are by this time nearly at their ports of destination. I am happy to find you have safely arrived in Richmond after the various hazards you encountered while in, & after you left, N. York---; that near Princeton must have been alarming as well as mortifying. I know of nothing that so disconcerts a young man, as to be brought up by the heels in cutting a Caper---;in this I have no direct allusion to the catastrophe near Princeton, but it directly applies to your good Freind Sir Jno. Temple, who upon that very day you left this City, and a few minutes after his interview with you at No. 19 Maiden lane was laid at full length upon the ground, in the Act of walking in the Train of the Governor, when he was reviewing the Troops. I would not mention this circumstance to any but a particular freind of the Baronets for the world---;you will doubtless sympathize with him. Your Freinds in N. York often enquire after you with great goodness. Mrs. Colden, Miss Van Berkel and several others on whose minds you have left, at least, favorable impressions frequently regret your departure---;but to pass from great things to small, by the last intelligence from Europe we have reason to suspect that the Patriots in Hol- November 27, 1787  land are in a bad way. The Princess of Orange has done more service to her husband than it is usual for married men to experience, the interruption given her in her passage to the Hague sometime ago, has so incensed her Brother the King of Prussia, as to bring him into more rapid & vigorous movements agst. the Patriots than he probably would have made. The duke of Brunswic at the head of 30,000 Prussian Troops has invaded the United Netherlands and is master of almost every place that was in a posture of opposition to the Stadtholder---;indeed Amsterdam stands alone, & that City is saved, for the present, only by the inundation of the surrounding Country. France cannot assist the Patriotic Party. Terminate this business how it will, there must still be an extensive & bloody Continental War---;the Porte has declared War against Russia, and as the powers now stand arranged it is likely that the flame will communicate itself throughout. The Constitution proposed for the Government of the United States is going on Well in the Eastern States, and as far as the Middle states have acted at all, their conduct is favorable. Present me to our Amiable Freind Mrs. Brent and all our other acquaintances, and believe me to be with great regard, Your sincere freind & Humble servt., Ed. Carrington ""

 Dear Sir(1) New York 27 Novr. 1787 You will about this period agreeably to my promise, expect a letter, and as I have engaged also to write Sister Warren, being under the operations of a very unfertile brain, I must preface by asking your influence, to construe my communications to you, so, as that they may be considered as made to you both, Being in the full perswasion that any thing worthy the attention of either, may with propriety be addressed to both. Having never before been in N York your first enquiry may be, how I like the City; To which I reply that I think the inhabitants of one great City, pretty much like those of another, The polished people  November 27, 1787  have the same views of amusement & ostentation everywhere, The Commercial people the same eager grasp at property & accumulation, The Inference then is not unatural, that liking Boston, I have no prejudice against N York. Indeed I never have seen the place where, if I had my family with me and they were tollerably happy, I could not make life tollerably agreeable; And I am fully convinced without the pleasure of domestic life, Tis no boon, And changing air & Climate, is only changing misery. But viewing myself from the necessity of my affairs, an honorable exile, I am resolved to submit without a murmur. I will not however preclude one observation as true as the oracles of religion, That I had rather plow up a wholsome subsistence upon the highlands of Milton, if that could be done in Character, than subsist upon all the Luxuries of the South, secluded from my family. But I wont repine. Your next probable question will be how go you on in Congress? To which I reply there is no Congress, Nor like to be before Xmas. New Hamshire Mr. Gilman, Massachusetts is represented, Connecticut have chosen but not here, R Island dont know whether chosen or not, N York dont chuse until the next month, N Jersy have no acct of, Pensilvania have chosen and only one Member G Armstrong present, Maryland No Members here, Virginia represented by Mr. Carrington, and Mr. Maddison, Delaware, N & S Carolina & Georgia not represented. Indeed I think some states either from a zeal for New Government, Or indifferent about a longer Confederation upon any plan, voluntarily neglect sending on their Members---;but this upon every principle is wrong. If the confederation ceases, puissant as any state may feel itself, I think its independence is at an end. If they prefer the Confederation upon the old, or rather present, plan they certainly ought to keep up their representation, And if they are zealous for the new plan, They ought to send their delegates to prepare the way, & I had like to have said make thepath straight before it. But I have no expectation of a speedy adoption of the New System. Newhamshr I can give no acct of, Massachusetts & R Island No, Connecticut Yea, N York No, N Jersy doubt, Pensilvania & Delaware Yea, Maryland & Virginia No, No & So Carolina Yea, Georgia No, at least these are my probable conjectures upon each state from present appearances. Virginia have not even called a Convention until May, And will the United states be content with an absolute suspension of Government until after May? My present opinion is that the executives of such governments as are represented, should remonstrate where the legislatures are not setting. For no man with a spark of national pride, Sure no man who is ostensible in the public line, but must feel mortified at the derangment of our public affairs. Seeing your Name anounced as the Land Officer of the western Territory(2) led me to make some conversation with Govr Clinton upon the   subject, Who has been upon the Ground. He thinks we did wrong in not sending Commissioners with the Governers of the two States at the head of the Commission. His reasons are that Interested people have endeavored to impress the Indians with unfavorable Ideas of the Bostonians including N Englanders under that Idea, That our Govr &c going into treaty would have effaced these Ideas, And the Two Executives appearing in Concert would have looked as if they viewed the business in a very important point of light, And would have inducd Brant & the Leessees as well as the Indians that those Leeases were of no avail, Whereas now the Combination will grow more powerful by delay, and give ultimately great charge & trouble. He thinks also it will be our best pollicy to sell only a part at present, as the Indians will sell a part for a moderate compensation but will be alarmed, & Confirmed in their Jealousies if an attempt be made to purchase the whole. By the way, it was reported when I was in Boston that N York was selling @ 3/ facilities inclusive of Indian claims, But this is not true, but that the Yorkers sold their lands at least what they have sold, for three shillings an acre, after they had extinguished the Claims is the fact. I suspect this report sprang from Browne & associates. Upon the whole I find should you proceed to sell withot extinguishing the Indian Claims, the purchasers under that incumbrance would be likely to cheat the Indians, And the York Governmt are or pretend to be justly alarmed least the angry Savage should revenge upon their frontiers the loss of his own acres. These observations may all be the result of N York policy, for they are by no means deficient in matters of land, You will however give them what attention they merit. I have conversed only partially with the Tresury Board upon your accts,(3) And think however no time is lost, And rely upon my attention as oppy offers. The expectation here is of a war between France & England, but theirimmense debt & deranged finances make me doubtful, nor do I think great advantages will result to America should it take place. Love to sister & the family. Conclude yrs Sam A Otis [P.S.] Pray write me all the news, the Speculations upon important incidents, Upon Constitution &c but above all your own reasonings upon things as they occur. ""

 My dear friend New York Decr. 2d. 1787. The period since my last(1) has been so unfruitful of occurrences that I have not thought it worth while to trouble you with a letter and I do it now more to prevent too long a chasm, than for the sake of any interesting communication. Our public letter gave you the latest authentic information from Europe.(2) A general war seems not improbable; a war between the Turks & Russians has actually commenced. The enterprising movements of the Prussian troops have disconcerted the patriotic party & their supporters, and it seems as if the Stadtholder  December 2, 1787  would gain a compleat triumph. What effect this may have on the Government of that Country I can not undertake to foretell. I have never been inclined to think that compleat success to the views of either party would be favorable to the people. If the Stadtholdership were abolished, the Government unless further changes concurred, would be a simple aristocracy. Should the patriots as they call themselves be excluded from the Govt. the Stadtholder would be an absolute Monarch. Whilst both continue they check each other, which is absolutely necessary as the people have no check on either. The consequence of the people arises from the competitions of the two for their favor. In general the lower order have been partizans of the Stadtholder. They are so it is said in the present contest. A British packet arrived here a few days ago but does not bring later information than the last one from France. She has had a long voyage and called in at Halifax, a circumstance which some connect with the probability of a war. We have not more than two or three States as yet attending. It is altogether conjectural when the deficiency of a quorum will be made up.  No recent indications of the views of the States as to the Constitution have come to my knowledge. The elections in Connecticut are over and as far as the returns are known, a large majority are friendly to it. Docr. Johnson says, it will be pretty certainly adopted; but there will be opposition. The power of taxing any thing but imports appears to be the most popular topic among the adversaries. The Convention of Pennsylvania is sitting. The result there will not reach you first through my hands. The divisions on preparatory questions, as they are published in the Newspapers, shew that the party in favor of the Constitution have 44 or 45 vs. 22 or 24 or thereabouts.(3) The inclosed paper contains two numbers of the Federalist.(4) This paper was begun about three weeks ago, and proposes to go through the subject. I have not been able to collectall the numbers, since my return from Philada. or I would have sent them to you. I have been the less anxious as I understand the Printer means to make a pamphlet of them, when I can give them to you in a more convenient form. You will probably discover marks of different {pens}.(5) I {am not at liberty} to {give you any} other {key} than that I {am in myself for a few numbers} & that {one besides myself} was a {member} of {the Convention}.(6) I wish you all happiness and remain my dear Sir, Yr. affecte. friend, Js.

 Dear Sir New York. Decr. 9th. 1787. Your favour of the 17th of Sepr. with sundry other letters and packets, came duly by the last packet.(1) Such of them as were addressed to others, were duly forwarded. The three Boxes, marked IM, G.W. and AD, it appears were never shipped from Havre.(2) Whenever they arrive your commands with regard to the two last shall be attended to, as well as those relating to some of the contents of the first. I have not been able to get any satisfactory account of Willm. S. Browne. Alderman Broom tells me that he professed to receive the money from him, for the use of Mr. Burke. I shall not lose sight of the subject, and will give you the earliest information of the result of my enquiries. The annexed list of trees will shew you that I have ventured to substitute half a dozen sorts of apples in place of the pippins alone, and to add 8 other sorts of American trees, including 20 of the Sugar maple. They were obtained from a Mr. Prince in the neighbourhood of this City, who deals largely in this way, and is considered as a man of worth. I learn from him that he has executed various commissions from Europe & the West Indies, as well as places less distant; and that he has been generally very successful in preserving the trees from perishing by such distant transplantations. He does not use Moss as you pre- December 7, 1787  scribe but incloses the roots in a bag of earth. As moss is not [to] be got, as he says, it is uncertain whether necessity or choice gives the preference to the latter. I inclose a Catalogue of his nursery and annex the price of the sample I send you, that you may, if you incline, give orders for any other supply. I doubt whether the Virga. Red Birds are found in this part of America. Opossums are not rare in the milder parts of New Jersey, but are very rare thus far Northward. I shall nevertheless avail myself of any opportunities which may happen for procuring and forwarding both. Along with the Box of trees, I send by the Packet to the care of Mr. Limozin 2 Barrels of New Town pippins, and 2 of Cranberrys. In one of the latter the Cranberries are put up dry, in the other in water; the opinions and accounts differing as to the best mode. You will note the event of the experiment. The Constitution proposed by the late Convention engrosses almost the whole political attention of America. All the Legislatures, except that of R. Island, which have been assembled, have agreed in submitting it to State Conventions. Virginia has set the example of opening a door for amendments, if the Convention there should chuse to propose them. Maryland has copied it. The States which preceded, referred the Constitution as recommended by the Genl. Convention, to be ratified or rejected as it stands. The Convention of Pennsylvania, is now sitting. There are about 44 or 45, on the affirmative and about half that number on the opposite side;(3) A considerable number of the Constitutional party as it was called, having joined the other party in espousing the federal Constitution. The returns of deputies for the Convention of Connecticut are known, and prove, as is said by those who know the men that a very great majority will adopt it in that State. The event in Massachusetts lies in greater uncertainty. The friends of the New Govt. continue to be sanguine. N. Hampshire from every account, as well as from some generalinducements felt there will pretty certainly be on the affirmative side. So will New Jersey and Delaware. N. York is much divided. She will hardly dissent from N. England, particularly if the conduct of the latter should coincide with that of N. Jersey and Pennsylva. A more formidable opposition is likely to be made in Maryland than was at first conjectured. Mr. Mercer, it seems, who was a member of the Convention, though his attendance was but for a short time, is become an auxiliary to Chace. Johnson, the Carrolls, Govr. Lee, and most of the other characters of weight are on the other side. Mr. T. Stone died a little before the Govermt. was promulged. The body of the people in Virgina. particularly in the upper and lower Country, and in the Northern neck, are as far as I can gather, much disposed to adopt the new Constitution. The middle Country, and the South side of James River are principally in the opposition to it. As yet a large majority of the people are under the first description, As yet also are a majority of the Assembly. What change  December 9, 1787  may be produced by the united influence & exertions of Mr. Henry, Mr. Mason, & the Governor with some pretty able auxiliaries, is uncertain. My information leads me to suppose there must be three parties in Virginia. The first for adopting without attempting Amendments. This includes Genl. W---;---; and the other deputies who signed the Constitution, Mr. Pendleton---;(Mr. Marshal I believe)---;Mr. Nicholas---;Mr. Corbin, Mr. Zachy. Johnson, Col. Innis, (Mr. B. Randolph as I understand) Mr. Harvey, Mr. Gabl. Jones, Docr. Jones---;&c &c. At the head of the 2d party which urges amendments are the Govr. & Mr. Mason. These do not object to the substance of the Governt. but contend for a few additional Guards in favor of the Rights of the States and of the people. I am not able to enumerate the characters which fall in with their ideas, as distinguished from those of a third Class, at the head of which is Mr. Henry. This class concurs at present with the patrons of Amendments, but will probably contend for such as strike at the essence of the System, and must lead to an adherence to the principle of the existing Confederation, which most thinking men are convinced is a visionary one, or to a partition of the Union into several Confederacies. Mr. Harrison the late Govr. is with Mr. Henry. So are a number of others. The General & Admiralty Courts with most of the Bar, oppose the Constitution, but on what particular grounds I am unable to say. Genl. Nelson, Mr. Jno. Page, Col. Bland, &c. are also opponents, but on what principle and to what extent, I am equally at a loss to say. In general I must note, that I speak with respect to many of these names, from information that may not be accurate, and merely as I should do in a free and confidential conversation with you. I have not heard Mr. Wythe's sentiments on the subject. Docr. McClurg the other absent deputy, is a very strenuous defender of the New Government. Mr. Henry is the great adversary who will render the event precarious.He is I find with his usual address, working up every possible interest, into a spirit of opposition. It is worthy of remark that whilst in Virga. and some of the other States in the middle & Southern Districts, the men of intelligence, patriotism, property, and independent circumstances, are thus divided; all of this description, with a few exceptions, in the Eastern States, & most of the Middle States, are zealousy attached to the proposed Constitution. In N. England, the men of letters, the principal Off[i]cers of Govt., the Judges & Lawyers, the Clergy, and men of property, furnish only here and there an adversary. It is not less worthy of remark that in Virginia where the mass of the people have been so much accustomed to be guided by their rulers on all new and intricate questions, they should on the present which certainly surpasses the judgment of the greater part of them, not only go before, but contrary to, their most popular leaders. And the phenomenon is the more wonderful, as a popular ground is taken by all the adversaries to the new Constitution. Perhaps   the solution in both these cases, would not be very difficult; but it would lead to observations too diffusive; and to you unnecessary. I will barely observe that the case in Virga. seems to prove that the body of sober & steady people, even of the lower order, are tired of the vicicitudes, injustice and follies which have so much characterised public measures, and are impatient for some change which promises stability & repose. The proceedings of the present assembly are more likely to cherish than remove this disposition. I find Mr. Henry has carried a Resolution for prohibiting the importation of Rum, brandy, and other ardent spirits; and if I am not misinformed all manufactured leather, hats and sundry other articles are included in the prohibition.(4) Enormous duties at least are likely to take place on the last & many other articles. A project of this sort without the concurrence of the other States, is little short of madness. With such concurrence, it is not practicable without resorting to expedients equally noxious to liberty and OEconomy. The consequences of the experiment in a single State, as unprepared for manufactures as Virginia may easily be preconceived. The Revised Code will not be resumed. Mr. Henry is an inveterate adversary to it. Col. Mason made a regular and powerful attack on the Port Bill; but was left in a very small minority. I found at the last Session that that regulation was not to be shaken; though it certainly owes it success less to its principal merits, than to collateral & casual considerations. The popular ideas are that by favoring the collection of duties on imports it saves the solid property from direct taxes; and that it injures G. Britain by lessening the advantage she has over other Nations, in the trade of Virginia. We have no certain information from the three Southern States concerning the temper relative to the New Government. It is in general favorable according to the vague accounts we have. Opposition however will be made ineach. Mr. Wiley Jones, and Governour Caswell have been named as Opponents in N. Carolina. So few particulars have come to hand concerning the State of things in Georgia that I have nothing to add on that subject, to the contents of my last, by Commodore Jones. We have two or three States only yet met for Congs. As many more can be called in when their attendance will make a quorum. It continues to be problematical, whether the interregnum will not be spun out through the winter. We remain in great uncertainty here with regard to a war in Europe. Reports and suspicions are strongly on the side of one. Such an event may be considered in various relations to this Country. It is pretty certain I think that if the present lax State of our General Gov-  ernment should continue, we shall not only lose certain capital advantages which might be drawn from it; but be in danger of being plunged into difficulties which may have a very serious effect on our future fortunes.

 Dear Sir, New York Decr. 10. 1787 I have this moment recd. a letter from you without date, but which I find by the post mark was put into the Office at Annapolis the second of this Month.(1) So far was I from neglecting the business committed to me, that as soon as Congress met after my return from Philadelphia I brought it before them and your letter was referred to a committee who, reported thereon.(2) When the report was taken up Major Butler, one of the delegates from South Carolina informed the Congress that the Agents for South Carolina had sent you a bill drawn on their governor for one half the expence that this bill you had not returned to them and that he was sure it would be paid immediately on its being presented. From your letter which was before the house & from what you & Mr Goldsborough said to me when in Philadelphia I thought you had returned the bill; But from the information of Mr Butler it appeared you had not; This put a stop to any further proceeding in the business. As there appears to be some misunderstanding in this Affair I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as convenient. At present there is not a sufficient number of states assembled to proceed to business. I wish the delegates from your state could be induced to attend.

 Dear Sir New York Decr. 11. 1787. Your favour of the 26 Ult. was duly handed to me by Majr. Drumgole. However important the object of his errand may have been, it  December 11, 1787  has not been possible to take any step with regard to it. No authority equal to the business exists in the recess of Congress; and the Authority of Congress has been out of existence for some time, and if we are to judge from the present aspect of things, will continue so for some time longer.(1) There seem to be pretty strong symtoms of approaching war on the other side of the Atlantic. Its flames are actually kindled between the Turks and Russians. If the English & French do not follow the example, the forebearance will be more the effect of inability than of disinclination. The fate of the Dutch Patriots is not yet decided here by any authentic communications, but every report and probability is ominous to their cause. A general war in Europe will open a new scene to this Country: a scene which might be contemplated with pleasure if our humanity could forget the calamities in which it must involve others; and if we were in a condition to maintain the rights and pursue the advantages of Neutrality.

 Sir, New York Decr. 11. 1787 We have been honoured with your Excellencies favor of the 24th Ult. together with its enclosures. Congress have not yet Assembled nor have we an early prospect of a sufficient number of States upon the floor for business. In the recess of that body, there is no authority in existence for making the appointment you request with respect to the Cherokee and other tribes of Indians in the Western parts of Virginia & North Carolina. The Indian Ordinance provides for no more than one Superintendant for all the southern Indians---;to this Office Doctor White was appointed by  December 11, 1787  Congress in October 1786, and he has lately resigned. How far Congress may be induced to make a separate or subordinate appointment for the Indians in your Excellencies Contemplation, we cannot Undertake to say. To us the idea appears a good & reasonable one, and We Will submit it to the consideration of Congress as soon as there are Nine States present.(1) Some time must elapse before any Step at all can be taken with respect to the southern Indians, other than what were provided for late in the last session of Congress. A few days before the end of the federal year some Resolutions were passed, for appropriating Six thousand dollars for holding Treaties with the Southern Indians; & North Carolina, So. Carolina & Georgia, are requested to appoint, each, a Commissioner, who are to hold the Treaties.(2) How far these States will act upon these resolutions we cannot undertake to say, having heard nothing from them. In this State of things it must remain with your Excellency to determine what it may be necessary for the Government of Virginia to do. We cannot however encourage any proceedure under an expectation that Congress will recognize the expence, nor have we reason to think, that should the appointment suggested by your Excellency be approved of, Major Drumgole would be the Man elected. Colo. Martin who long acted in this business under the Authority of Virga. & whose communications have eventually reached Congress would probably be prefered. Indian Agents necessarily have the exercise of powers which Congress will not confer on any but Characters tolerably well known. Doctor White is now here and we have conversed with him upon the subject of his late department. He says the State of Indian Affairs in Georgia has been such as to engage his whole time and attention while in Office; this occasioned him to neglect the business as it respected those under your Excellencies consideration, and of course he had no ground of Correspondence with the Government of Virginia. We donot undertake to decide upon the fitness of this Gentleman for the appointment he held, but in justice to him we beg leave to observe that the Sentiments of the Georgians who alone have known him in the execution of his duty, may very possibly be formed upon views intirely opposite to those which would found a wise & just Conduct in the Superintendant of Indian affairs. Had these people conformed to his advice and Agency, it is probable they would have avoided the bloody War in which they are now involved in consequence of their own violations of the Treaties held by the Commissioners of the United States with the Indians. We have the Honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellencies Most Obt. Servts.,  Js. Madison Jr J. Brown Ed. Carrington C. Griffin December 14, 1787  ""

 Dear Sir N. York Decr. 14th. 1787. I was yesterday favored with yours of the 2d inst. and am particularly obliged by the accuracy and fulness of its communications.(1) The mutability of the Legislature on great points has been too frequently exemplified within my own observation, for any fresh instance of it to produce much surprize. The only surprize I feel at the last Steps taken with regard to the New Constitution(2) is that it does not strike the well meaning adversaries themselves with the necessity of some anchor for the fluctuations which threaten shipwreck to our liberty. I am persuaded that the scheme of amendments is pursued by some of its patrons at least, with the most patriotic & virtuous intentions. But I am equally persuaded that it is pregnant with consequences which they fail to bring into view. The vote of Virga. on that subject, will either dismember the Union, or reduce her to a dilemma as mortifying to her pride, as it will be injurious to her foresight. I verily believe that if the patrons of this scheme, were to enter into an explicit & particular communication with each other, they wd find themselves as much at variance in detail as they are agreed in the general plan of amendments. Or if they could agree at all it would be only on a few points of very little substance, and which would not comprehend the objections of most weight in other States. It is impossible indeed to trace the progress and tendency of this fond experiment without perceiving difficulty and danger in every Stage of it. We have received neither confirmation nor contradiction of the Reports concerning war between G.B. and France. The Dutch are prostrate before the prussian arms. The follies and misfortunes on the other side of the Atlantic ought to be lessons of wisdom to this side. I fear we shall not derive from them the profit of any sort, which they are calculated to afford us. We have no Congs as yet; nor any increase of the materials for one. If one were formed, it would only perhaps make thenakedness of the federal situation more conspicuous. The contributions to the trea- December 14, 1787  sury are every where failing. Massts. I am told has lately taken some resolution which effectually diverts the stream to some of her internal purposes.(3) I perceive by the Newspapers that Delaware has decided unanimously in favor of the new Constitution. Penna. has not yet decided. No delay however will diminish the great majority which are on the affirmative Side. The Convention of New Jersey, is meeting or actually met. The vote there will be nearly if not quite unaninous. That of Connecticut will succeed, and will pretty certainly make four ninths of the requisite number. The same cause which has instituted & countenanced the opposition in Virga. excites it in Massts. In one respect there is a remarkable difference. In Virginia we see men equally respectable in every point of character & marshalled in opposition to each other. In Massts. almost all the intelligent & considerable people are on the side of the new Government. The Governor & the late Govr. though rivals & enemies, the Judges and the Bar---;the men of letters---;the Clergy and all the other learned professions, with that part of the Society which has the greatest interest in Good Government, are with but few exceptions in favor of the plan as it stands. The weight of this description of friends, seems to countenance the assurance which that side professes, of success.  I am Dear Sir Yr. friend & servt, Js. Madison Jr [P.S.] I think I have recd. the letter which you suppose had miscarried. ""

I find by letters from Richmond that the proceedings of the Assembly, are as usual, rapidly degenerating with the progress of the Session: and particularly that the force opposed to the Act of the Convention has gained the ascendance. There is still nevertheless a hope left that different characters and a different spirit may prevail in their successors who are to make the final decision. In one point of view the present Assembly may perhaps be regarded as pleading most powerfully  December 14, 1787  the cause of the new Government, for it is impossible for stronger proofs to be found than in their conduct, of the necessity of some such anchor against the fluctuations which threaten shipwreck to our liberty.

 Dear Sir N York 14th Decr 1787 By this time you have a right to expect a line from your old friend, And which I most certainly should sooner have effectd but from a barreness of incident since my arrival. The States have generally elected their members but in expectation that others will not attend those in the vicinity are the most tardy. Congress will however meet in the course of this month and I am informed by the old members that should a new Government be accepted by th[e] people there is several months business for Congress, And surely if there is so great a calamity like to befal the United States as the rejection of the new System, Congress ought to assemble & keep up at least the appearance of Goverment until we are wise enough to adopt the reality. With pleasure I see your name in the list of Candidates for convention and from ten years experience of integrity & abilities, I presume they will be exerted to good effect upon the present occasion. I see brother W(1) is not elected for Millton and hear his election for commissioner was negatived. By advices from several Counties in our State I find hanging is coming into fashion and by all accts the Berkshire Culprits were full ripe fruit for the tree on which they hung, One going so far as to trifle with the Minister who offered him his last prayers. The excision of criminals is a deduction from the force of a state, but until human wisdom makes an effort yet untried, it seems to be the only guard of society against the abandoned. Mr Sedwick & Bacon were pitted against each other upon electing of deligates, Went largely into the merits, to the edification, & conviction of many, who had assembled for all parts of the County, And Sedgwick prevailed 60 to 30.

 Dear Sir, N. York, December 15th. 1787. I should have written some days ago, but waited a private conveyance which at last has disappointed me. I had great difficulty in geting your little matter adjusted with the Treasury Board, because the promise of payment was to Harison only, and because not a shilling was in hand for continental purposes---;however, as being preferable to nothing, You will receive enclosed a warrant upon Thomas Smith for the sum entrusted to my care.(1) I was obliged to accommodate a little affair of my own in the like mode which has occasioned an unexpected inconveniency. For some days past I have been confined with a violent cold and disagreeable affection of the head---;but as nothing very alarming is to be feared I wish my poor little woman to know but little of it. I doubt the family of Mr. Marshall's will give you and your amiable  lady a good deal of Trouble---;but as they are the last few months they will ever spend to the northward I hope it may be forgiven---;for indeed having but little property of my own and scarcely any thing by my wife, I should not be justifiable in spending that little at a distance from my own country even for the purposes of Religion---;yet in the meantime I flatter myself they will ask for any thing that may be wanting, and when the little stock is expended that you were kind enough to take charge of I will endeavor to procure them more. I make free to enclose a letter for your friendly messenger to deliver. There are but four states rep[r]esented in Congress and I see no probability of a majority for weeks to come.

 Gentlemen: 15 December, 1787. We received the commands of the Honourable the General Assembly last evening(1) to lay before you this morning \""The present state and circumstances of the Union,\"" and altho' the time limited to us is  December 15, 1787  short, yet we shall endeavor to make a statement as in our opinion may answer the object of your request. The subject is of great latitude, but we have tried to view it in the most interesting point of light. All the resolutions of Congress, with the letters of your Delegates, have been laid before you,(2) and Mr. Hawkins attended at the opening of the session expressly for the purpose of assisting in arranging of them and to throw such further light on them as might serve to explain any ambiguities, but they were ordered to be committed without a reading. A narrative of transactions, other than the connecting of these papers together, we feel ourselves bound to give, and shall do it accordingly from notes which we must reserve to ourselves. To describe the present state and circumstances of the Union, we may declare in one word that we are at the Eave of a Bankruptcy and of a total dissolution of Government. Since the close of the War there has not been paid into the General Treasury as much money as was necessary for one year's interest of the domestic and foreign debt, and Congress have been reduced to the dreadful alternative of borrowing principal to pay interest. Our efforts at home to this end were ineffectual; abroad where we were not known and where enthusiasm for liberty enrolled us among the most deserving of mankind, we were more Successful. The deception cannot be much longer kept up and unless something can be done before the close of the ensuing year we must cease to be a United Government. Our friends must give us up, and we shall become a laughing stock to our enemies. The annual requisitions are so partially attended to by the States that our foreign and domestic embarrassments have accumulated beyond the possibility of being retrieved by other means than the punctual compliance on the part of the States. Congress, in their persevering desire of doing justice to their Creditors and supporting the Federal Government, have tryed every possible means in their power. Thesale of the Western land has gone and will go a great way in discharge of our domestic debt, but our foreign debt is increasing and the best way of Judging of the possibility of soon discharging of it is by our own exertions in five years. We have made one payment, something less than forty thousand dollars, and the Schedule of requisitions will shew the deficiencies of the States respectively. On the subject of the Treaty, you have every thing necessary to be said in the circular letter accompanying the resolutions of the 13th of April,(3) with which several of the States have complyed. On the settlements of accompts, you have the ordinance of the 13th May, and the subsequent Resolution of the 28th of July,(4) which will wind up the whole expences of the War on principles perfectly equitable. Several of the States are far advanced in their settlement, and we have reason to expect the Commissioner for settling our accompts will very soon give us notice of his attendance.  The subject of the Navigation of the Mississippi is of so delicate a nature that we cannot commit it to paper. We are only at liberty to say that it has been seriously agitated, and that it has claimed and we presume it will continue to claim the serious attention of your Delegates. We can say in general, the conduct of Spain on this subject is not liberal, and we presume it would be very different if they thought us a more formidable neighbour. Having mentioned the western lands we must add that Sales already made will Sink near five millions of Dollars of the Principal of the Domestic debt, and that the States generally, who have ceded Western lands or who claim a share in them, complain pointedly and heavily against North Carolina and Georgia for claiming a part of the lands in the possession of Congress without ceding any part of their claims. To close our remarks, a change of measures for the consolidation of the Union in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety and perhaps our national existence, is so obvious that the whole of the Union, Rhode Island excepted, have appointed their deputies in Convention for that purpose; the result of their deliberations you have had before you, whether the plan adopted by them is the proper one will depend in the sense of a Convention of Delegates in each State by the people thereof. We have the Honor to be, with great respect, your Hbl. Servts, Ro. Burton Wm. Blount(5) Benjamin Hawkins Reprinted from the journal of the North Carolina General Assembly, N.C. State Records, 20:241--;43. 1 For this command to \""the Delegates of this State now in Town,\"" see ibid., p. 228. 2 Ibid., pp. 128--;30. 3 See Charles Thomson to the States, April 13, 1787. 4 Actually the ordinance of May 7 and resolution of July 23, for which see JCC, 32:262--;66, 33:392. 5 Blount also submitted the following petition to the assembly concerning his pay as a delegate to Congress, which was referred to a house committee on December 13and to a senate committee on December 14. N.C. State Records, 20:227, 419. \""William Blount late a Delegate in Congress humbly sheweth that a Resolution passed the General Assembly at Hillsborough in the Spring Session of the year 1784 in the following Words, `Resolved that the Governor be and he is hereby authorized, empowered and required to grant Warrants from Time to Time on either of the Treasurers for the Salaries of the Delegates of this State attending in Congress payable in Philadelphia or in this State at the Option of the Delegates.' \""That at the session of 1786 at Fayetteville, `The Committee to whom were referred the State of the Representation in Congress made the following Report which was agreed to by both Houses, \""`That having examined the present Situation of the Delegates they find that the Salaries allowed is by no Means adequate to the purpose of enabling them to perform the duty which their Country expects and their appointments require of them. They find that the present salary of a Delegate is sixty four pounds per Month, paid by War- December 16, 1787  rants on the Treasury which they often find great difficulty in geting the Mony for, owing to the Want of Mony in our Treasury; when they receive it, it does not pass without the Bounds of the State and for it Specie cannot be obtained under twelve Shillings for a hard dollar or a Deduction of one third from their Monthly Allowance, which reduces it to forty two pounds thirteen Shillings and four pence---;A Sum by No Means adequate to their incidental Expences in the Character they have to support as the Representatives of the Sovereignty of a free and independent State, and We con[c]eive it to be from this Cause that our Representation in Congress has not been so constant nor so full as it ought to have been; nor can we presume that the Public can expect or wish, that any Individual should devote his Time to the Service of the Public and at the same Time be obliged to have recourse to his private fortune for his Support, which has assuredly been the Case with such of our Delegates as have done their duty for these three years past. Your Committee has Leave to state the difference between the Delegates and the other Officers of Government; the former from the Nature of their Office have their duty to perform in another State where their Expences are great and Nothing but hard Mony will pass, at a distance from their property, which generally yields less profit from the Absence of the Owner whilst on the Contrary the other Officers of Government perform their duty within the State where the Mony they receive for their Salaries is the only circulating Medium, and also enjoy the Advantage of superintending their own Affairs and few of them are put to any more Expence by the Office they hold than they would have to bear were they without it. Your Committee highly sensible of the Importance of Keeping up a Representation in Congress, as it not only concerns the Interest of this State but of the United States, are therefore of Opinion that the delegates should recive their Salaries in hard Mony to be paidthem in New-York or wherever Congress may sit, in Payments of one Month's Salary in Advance and in Order that the State may be enabled to persue this Mode of Payment they recommend that his Excellency the Governor be authorized and empowered to make a Contract with some person or persons to make the aforesaid Payments, who shall give sufficient Security for the faithful and punctual Performance of his or their Contract; and that the Governor be enabled to fulfil the Contract in Behalf of the State by drawing Warrants on the Treasury, in favour of the Person or Persons he may contract with.' \""That He (William Blount) for his Services performed in Congress in the two last federal years, hath received only paper Mony at the rate of sixty four pounds per Month equal only to forty two pounds thirteen Shillings and four pence, altho' he applyed by Letter to the Governor for the payment to be made him at Philadelphia agreeable to the first recited Resolution. That He conceives himself entitled in good faith under the Resolutions aforesaid to an additional Payment of Salary of thirty two pounds paper Mony per Month, that is to make his Salary equal to sixty four pounds Specie per Month agreeable to the Aforesaid Resolutions and relying on the Justice of your honorable Body in full Confidence that his Petition will be granted he prays that you will be pleased so to order as that the aforesaid sum of thirty two pounds paper Mony per Month be paid to him in Compliance with the aforesaid Resolutions and he as in duty bound will pray.

It is with pleasure that I look forward to that Period when our friendly intercourse shall no longer be interupted by the remoteness of our situations from each other in a Country where my prospects in life are all center'd & from which my mind is seldom absent.(2) I reached this place about ten days past in company with Mr. Griffin, my Journey was much more agreeable than I expected. At Phila. I met Colo. Grayson on his return to Virginia who informd me that there would not be a Congress for some time, upon which I staid in Phila. two weeks which time I spent very agreeably in Vewing that flourishing City & attending the Debates of the State Convention upon the proposed plan of FOEderal Government. Upon my arrival here I found only the Representatives of four States; & at present there is no reason to expect a Congress before Xmas;(3) this puts it out of my power to give you any information of the Views of that Body relative to Kentuckey. Tho from a change of Delegates in some of the States & also from a Change in some political measures affecting the Interest of some of the Eastern States I think there is some reason to expect that the Rights & Interest of Kentucky will meet with due attention. I am very comfortably fixed in the best Boarding house in this place in company with Madison, Griffin & some other Delegates from the Eastern States, have been chiefly imployed in receiving & returning Visits of Etiquette from & to Foreign Ministers, Consuls, Secretaries, &c. &c.

Not having as yet formed a Congress (only four States being represented) I cannot pretend to say what will be the fate of the Kentuckey address; from present appearances I rather fear that it will meet with some opposition, at least that an attempt will be made to postpone the determination upon that Subject untill the fate of the proposed plan of FOEderal Govt. is known.(1) My Anxiety relative to the event of this Business increases greatly when I rested upon the present alarming & increasing confusion which prevails throughout the whole Political System of the Continent. Some important Change in the United States must necessarily ere long take place; in which case Kentucky in her present dependant connected State would have much more to fear than to hope from the event. Were she independant & had a well advised efficient internal Govt. established, in my opinion her local Situation & internal resources would secure her from many of those calamities to which the Atlantic States might be subjected.

 Dear Sir New York Decr. 20 1787. The packet has been detained here since the date of the letter which you will receive along with this,(1) by some preparations suggested by an apprehension of war. The delay is very unfavorable to the trees on board for you. Mr. {de la Forest}(2) the {consul here called on me a} few days ago and {told me he had information} that the {farmers general & Mr. Morris} having found their {contract mutually advantageous} are {evading} the {resolutions of the committee} by {tacit arrangements for its continuance}.(3) He observed that the object of the {farmers was singly profit} that of the {government twofold revenue & commerce}. It was consequently the wish of the {latter} to render the {monopoly as little hurtful} to the {trade with America as possible}. He suggested as an {expedient that farmers should be} required {to divide} the {contract among six or seven houses French & American} who should be {required to ship annually} to {America a} reasonable proportion {of goods}. This  December 20, 1787  he supposed would produce some {competition} in the {purchases here} and would introduce a {competition also} with {British goods here}. The latter {condition he said} could not be well required of, or executed by a {single contractor}. And the {government could not abolish the farm}. These ideas were {meant for you}. Since the date of my other letter, The Convention of Delaware have unanimously adopted the new Constitution. That of Pennsylvania has adopted it by a Majority of 46 agst. 23. That of New Jersey is sitting and will adopt pretty unanimously. These are all the Conventions that have met. I hear from North Carolina that the Assembly there is well disposed. Mr. Henry, Mr. Mason, R. H. Lee, and the Governour, continue by their influence to strengthen the opposition in Virginia. The Assembly there is engaged in several mad freaks. Among others a bill has been agreed to in the House of Delegates prohibiting, the importation of Rum, brandy, and all other spirits not distilled from some American production. All brewed liquors under the same description, with Beef, Tallow-candles, cheese &c. are included in the prohibition. In order to enforce this despotic measure the most despotic means are resorted to. If any person be found after the commencement of the Act, in the use or possession of any of the prohibited articles, tho' acquired previous to the law, he is to lose them, and pay a heavy fine. This is the form in which the bill was agreed to by a large majority in the House of Delegates.(4) It is a child of Mr. Henry, & said to be his favorite one. They first voted by a majority of 30 that all legal obstructions to the Treaty of peace, should cease in Virginia as soon as laws complying with it should have passed in all the other States. This was the result of four days debate with the most violent opposition from Mr. Henry. A few days afterwards He renewed his efforts, and got a vote, by a majority of 50, that Virginia would not comply until G.B. shall have complied.(5) The Statesseem to be either wholly omitting to provide for the federal Treasury; or to be withdrawing the scanty appropriations made to it. The latter course has been taken by Massachusetts, Virginia and Delaware. The Treasury Board seem to be in despair of maintaining the shadow of Government much longer. Without money, the Offices must be shut up, and the handful of troops on the frontier disbanded, which will probably bring on an Indian war, and make an impression to our disadvantage on the British Garrisons within our limits. A letter from Mr. Archd. Stuart dated Richd. Decr. 2d has the following paragraph \""Yesterday a Boat with sixteen men, was brought down the Canal from Westham to its termination which is within one mile & an half of Richmond.\""(6) I subjoin an extract from a letter from Genl. Washington dated Decr. 7th which contains the best information I can give you as to the progress of the works on the Potowmack.(7)  \""The survey of the Country between the Eastern & Western waters is not yet reported by the Commissioners, though promised to be made very shortly, the survey being compleated. No draught that can convey an adequate idea of the work on this river has been yet taken. Much of the labour, except at the great falls, has been bestowed in the bed of the river, in a removal of rocks, and deepening the water. At the great falls the labour has indeed been great. The water there (a sufficiency I mean) is taken into a Canal about two hundred yards above the Cateract, & conveyed by a level cut (through a solid rock in some places, and much Stone every where) more than a mile to the lock Seats, five in number by means of which when compleated, the craft will be let into the River below the falls (wch. together amounts to seventy six feet). At the Seneca falls, six miles above the great falls, a channel which has been formed by the river when inundated is under improvement for navigation. The same, in part, at Shanandoah. At the lower falls, where nothing has yet been done, a level cut and locks are proposed. These constitute the principal difficulties and will be the great expence of this undertaking.

 Dear Sir New York Decr. 20. 1787. I was favoured on Saturday with your letter of the 7th instant, along with which was covered the printed letter of Col. R. H. Lee to the Governour.(1) It does not appear to me to be a very formidable attack on the new Constitution; unless it should derive an influence from the names of the correspondents, which its intrinsic merits do not entitle it to. He is certainly not perfectly accurate in the statement of all his facts; and I should infer from the tenor of the objections in Virginia that his plan of an Executive would hardly be viewed as an amendment of that of the Convention. It is a little singular that three of the most distinguished Advocates for amendments; and who expect to unite the thirteen States in their project, appear to be pointedly at variance with each other on one of the capital articles of the System. Col. Lee proposes that the President should chuse a Council of Eleven and with their advice have the absolute appointment of all Officers. Col. Mason's proposition is that a Council of six should be appointed by the Congress. What degree of power he would confide to it I do not know. The idea of the Governour is that there should be a plurality of co-equal heads, distinguished probably by other peculiarities in the organization. It is pretty certain that some others who make a common cause with them in the general attempt to bring about alterations differ still more from them, than they do from each other; and that they themselves differ as much on some other great points as on the Constitution of the Executive. You did not judge amiss of Mr Jay. The paragraph affirming a change in His opinion of the plan of the Convention, was an arrant forgery. He has contradicted it in a letter to Mr. J. Vaughan which has been printed in the Philadelphia Gazettes.(2) Tricks of this sort are not uncommon with the Enemies of the new Constitution. Col. Mason's objections were as I am told published in Boston mutilated of that which pointed at the regulation ofCommerce.(3) Docr. Franklins concluding speech which you will meet with in one of the papers herewith inclosed, is both mutilated & adulterated so as to change both the form & the spirit of it.(4) I am extremely obliged by the notice you take of my request concerning the Potowmack. I must insist that you will not consider it as an object of any further attention. The Philada. papers will have informed you of the result of the Convention of that State. N. Jersey is now in Convention, & has probably by this time adopted the Constitution. Genl. Irvine of the Pena. Delegation who is just arrived here, and who conversed with some of the members at Trenton tells me that great unanimity reigns in the Convention. December 20, 1787  Connecticut it is pretty certain will decide also in the Affirmative by a large majority. So it is presumed will N. Hampshire; though her Convention will be a little later than could be wished. There are not enough of the returns in Massts. known for a final judgment of the probable event in that State. As far as the returns are known they are extremely favorable; but as they are cheifly from the maritime parts of the State, they are a precarious index of the public sentiment. I have good reason to believe that if you are in correspondence with any Gentlemen in that quarter, and a proper occasion offered for an explicit communication of your good wishes for the plan, so as barely to warrant an explicit assertion of the fact, that it would be attended with valuable effects. I barely drop the idea. The circumstances on which the propriety of it depends, are best known to, as they will be best judged of by yourself. The information from N. Carolina gave me great pleasure. We hear nothing from the States South of it.  With the most perfect esteem & regard I am Dear Sir Your Affecte. friend & Obedt. servt., Js. Madison Jr ""

 Dr. Sir, New York Decr. 22. 1787 It has just occurred to me that possibly the inclosed Resolution of Congress may not have been so communicated through the papers of Philadelphia, as to be seen by you---;upon this consideration I now do myself the pleasure to send it to you. The measure was adopted with a view to bringing great numbers of the earliest staff appointments to  December 22, 1787  account who have never yet appeared, but is calculated to embrace those of every period.(1) I have gone through my settlement with Mr. Burrel(2) and he is making a Statement of the Accounts---;as soon as that is done, I shall be on my way to Virginia calling on you in my way to compare our transactions when I will shew you the Statement of the Commissioner.

 Dear Sir N York 25th Decr 1787 Had anything of moment taken place I should sooner have done myself the pleasure of writing to you. And even now it is out of my power to inform you of a representation from more than five States, So Carolina, Virginia, Pensilvania, N Jersey & Massachusetts. Delaware is daily expected, and Mr Langdon from N Hamshr would make a representation of seven States. You have probably heared Virginia have in conformity to Massachusetts stoped any farther supplies to the fOEderal chest, And the civil and Military establishments are without the least provision. The old Goverment seems to be in the last stages of Languishment, And yet there is an incessant fire kept up against the new from the antifederal Batteries. Some of them indeed fire only pop guns. But so much fire & smoke altho there are few balls shott, dark & obscure the eyes of the good people, in such manner as I fear those of my dear Country men will not see the things which belong to their political peace. Your heavy artillery I hear has silenced a strong redoubt upon Bacon Hill, And sunk some floating batteries from the  December 25, 1787  Vicinity, And flatter myself you will defend Berkshire.(1) But they want help over the mountains, & beyond the great river, where its dificult conveying your ammunition. Sometimes indeed the foggs & vapours of low & boggy Countries, are dissipated by Lightning, if there is any prospect of success give them a great. But dont let it like Joves thunder strike them dead. But strike conviction. The Georgians & N Carolinans have brot themselves into hott water with the Indians & now want to vouch in the United States. Would it not be a good time to remind them of certain acts of cession which the other States have made? Do write me the State of politicks, how Convention is like to operate. I am very anxious to hear what dear Massachusetts are like to do. Her peace, honor & dignity are near my heart. The dye seems cast on which they are stamped & Heaven forbid it should turn up a blank! Mason & Henry have got Virginia politically d---;---;k [drunk], And are determined they shall never be physically so with anything but peach & apple brandy & whisky, So amongst other feasible projects are agitating a bill for prohibition of all ardent Spirits from Europe, WI & United States.

The Affairs of the Union become every day more and more critical.

I am also informed that the States of Massachusetts and Virginia have diverted to their own state purposes the supplies which were to have come from them into the public treasury, so that Congress is like to be left without the means of keeping up the few troops on the frontiers, or even to support the forms of Government & defray the current expences.

 My dear St. George New York Decr. 28. 1787 You will perceive that the inclosed Letter was intended by Colo. Grayson.(1) My usual Indolence prevented it from being deliver'd to him. I have since had the pleasure of seeing your 3 Sons, & a real plea- December 28, 1787  sure it was. They are all of them very fine promising Youths. Theodorick & John are now in the same House with me, & I suppose you will hear from them. They have given me great Satisfaction by informing me that my dear Sister is getting the better of her late severe Illness. I heartily sympathize in the Anxiety you must have felt on so trying an Occasion, & am extreamly happy both on her & your Account that the Danger, is so fortunately over. I flatter myself that this will find you rejoicing in her Recovery & the Birth of an other fine Child.(2) I have had a great deal of very agreable Chat with the Youths, & they have made me a good deal acquainted with my little Friends in the Family. I arriv'd here about 10 days ago, but find that there are not States enough yet to make a Congress. However, I suppose they will gather soon after the Holidays. The new Constitution seems to go on very well. Three joining States have already agreed to it, & there is no reason to doubt of it's being approved by at least nine. The people of this City appear to be pretty generally for it, & I can't help thinking that it has a pretty good Chance even here.(3) It's Operation will certainly be very extensive & will leave but the bare Shadow of State Government. The President will be a Monarch whilst in Office, & every President will have it in his power to get himself continued in Office for Life. And this will be a great Step towards a hereditary Monarchy. The Senate are the ministerial Agents of the States & at the same time Legislators for the people but free of all Responsibility to either & irrevocably appointed for six Years. The biennial Election of one third holds out an Appearance of frequent Changes, but in fact leaves two thirds always in Office, who by taking the other third by The Hand will be able always to keep them in & will in their Turn receive the same Favor. Life Estates will in time become hereditary Estates. The other House will be a nominalRepresentation merely of the people. The Members must be totally unknown to nine tenths of their constituents, & every Election will be carried by Intrigue among the most unprincipled of the People. It is possible for a Man to be elected by one tenth only of the persons who actually vote, to be unknown to nine of ten of those who vote for him, & to be disliked by the other nine tenths of the Electors. Something like this will be actually the Case as soon as some System of Rule & Influence is establish'd which will enable the Members of both Houses to feel their own Power & Importance. The State Legislatures will dwindle into Insignificance & their Members will in time become the Tools of their Superiors. The Objects of the judicial Department are so numerous that they will exist more or less in every County & Parish of every State & of course the Courts must be multiplied exceedingly. The State Laws will fall into Contempt, for they will not have the Force even of the Bye Laws of a Corporation, the Authority being not derived from the superior Governmt. but retain'd from it, & therefore having it not as a Supporter but as a Competitor ready   to swallow up all Remains of State Power. The State Debts will never be paid & even the Civil Lists will not long be supported. What I have said is at least possible & perhaps not very improbable. But I am apt to think that the People who certainly are not aware of the Extent of it's Operation, will on feeling it make effectual Opposition to it before there is a Force sufficient to keep them in Subjection. Our Grand Children will be better Judges of the Matter than we are, & it might perhaps have been as well for us not to have too much Confidence in ourselves, but to give Power with a sparing Hand only so far as it is absolutely necessary; since more may at any time be given but none can ever be peaceably taken back. My sincerest Regards & good Wishes to my Sister & the Children. Pray, let me hear from you. I have not received a Line from you since you were in New York.

 Dear Sir(1) New York. Decr. 31st. 1787. I thank You for the letter of 30th Sept. and in return will give a general Statement of the politics on the Continent. The report of the Convention affords a fruitful subject for wits, politicians and Law- makers. The presses, which conceived by the incubation of the Convention are delivered from the pangs of travail, & have become prolific indeed. The offspring is so numerous, that the public ear has become deaf to the cries of the distressed, and grow impatient for the christning of the firstborn. The opposition have many Characters of extensive knowledge and great influence---;but their efforts have failed in some of the States, particularly in Philadelphia. The Question was carried in the State Convention 46 against 23(2)---;in Delaware and New Jersey by an unanimous vote(3)---;Connecticut is the next on the list of dates. The Convention meets next Thursday---;of 175 the whole number, 112 are decidedly for the measure---;among the remaining 63 some are undetermined.(4) The good sense and influence of the majority may make some converts among them. Massachusetts assemble the Wednesday following. The event there is very uncertain---;but appearances from the eastern & southern part of the state are favorable. The western counties feel the effects of the late insurrection---;& tho they have been Treated with uncommon lenity, they are not disposed to hear law and reason. New Hampshire meet in Feby. There is not a doubt but they will adopt it, if it is accepted by Massachusetts. Rhode Island has done nothing---;the people are left to do as they please. It is not expected that New York will be among the number of the federalists. The Assembly meets in a few days---;we shall be able to form a more accurate Judgment, when the Sentiments of the Legislature are known. Maryland has appointed their Convention in April. Parties are very high in Virginia, headed by the first Characters of sense and property. They are very much divided, and it is not probable thatthey  January 2, 1788  will subscribe to the measure. Reports from the three southern States are not so favorable as could be wished, but the plan so well accords with the present politics of South Carolina, that it is the prevailing opinion that they will be on the right side. Georgia will follow the majority. If three solid columns can be formed, consisting of the Eastern Phalanx, the southern Light Infantry, & the brave fellows on the banks of the Delaware, no European intrigue or State divisions, can resist the attack or disconcert the movements of so powerful a body---;but if success, equal to the most sanguine wishes attends the present plan, the whole body cannot appear in battle array with the President & General at the head, till this time 12 Months. We must wait with patience & I sincerely hope that we may see it accomplished. The Patriots in Holland are suffering for their ill timed & ill managed opposition. The french Men have behaved in Character. Their conduct towards America did them honor for they persevered to the last---;but they have finessed the poor dutchmen out of their liberty. I am, Dear sir, Yours most Affectionately, R Alden [P.S.] You will receive with this some of the papers of this city. I have not been able to procure all which contain the pieces against the constitution. A Writer under the signature of Publius takes up the matter upon the best grounds---;and is a very fair, candid, sensible advocate upon the federal side. There is nothing personal or scurrilous in his writings---;he only means to convince by plain reasoning---;by arguments drawn from facts & experience. You will hear from Your friends here, respecting the family. I have confined myself to politics, & have said nothing about myself or those I esteem---;but believe when I assure You that You are sincerely loved & esteemed by Yours Affy, RA---;---; ""

 Dear Sir N. York Mar. 3. [17]88. The Convention of N. Hampshire have disappointed much the general expectation. Instead of adopting the Constitution they have adjourned without any final decision until June; this expedient being found necessary to prevent a rejection. It seems that a majority of 3 or 4 members would have voted in the negative, but in this majority were a number who had been proselyted by the discussions, but were bound by positive instructions. These concurred with the federalists in the adjournment, and carried by a majority of 57 agst. 47. It is not much doubted that in the event N. Hampshire will be among the adopting States. But the influence of this check will be very considerable in this State (N. York) and in several others. I have enquired whether June was preferred for the 2d meeting, from any reference to Virga. or N. York, and am informed that it was merely an accommodation to the intermediate annual elections & Courts. I am just setting out for Virga. and shall not write again from this place.(1) I wish you every happiness & am Dr Sir, Yr Affe friend,  Js. Madison Jr ""
