  Dear sir, Philadelphia Jany 1 st. 1782 Congress have Just received intelligence from New York, that Gen. Leslie had wrote to Sr Harry that unless he sent him A reinforcement, he should not be Able to Keep Charles Town, in Consequence an embarkation of about 1100 men had taken place.(1) I have inclosed you the packet of this day. Am in hopes that the Account in the Annapolis paper of St Eustatius And St Martins being taken by the French will prove true. Soon after my Arrival here in the fall I received orders from Mr Mollihon for Some money payable at different periods promising him at the same time that if it Should appear that there was not So much due from him that I would not Call for the payment of those orders, which were payable the 1st this month And the 1st February. Mr. Mollihon was with me this morning and by his Account the State owes him near £500. My relying upon those orders induced us to engage to pay money which I am not able to Comply with. Mr. Carroll I believe is in the Same situation. I hope your Excellency and honors will as Speedily as possible relieve us from so disagreeable a Situation. Tobacco Such as has hitherto been Sent will not net £5 a hhd. Flour of a good quallity if it Could be Sent immediately might Answer.

  Sir Philada.Jany. 1st. 1782  A Letter from Genl Heath (1) who commands the army on the North River, dated the 26th Ulto. informs Congress that an intelligent person from N. York had reported to him that an embarkation of troops was taking place there, that he saw a part of them going on board, and a number of dragoon horses hoisted into the vessels, that he was told by a Captain with whom he was well acquainted that Genl Leslie had written to Genl Clinton that unless he was reinforced with nine hundred men he could not defend Charlestown, that a much larger number than that were to embark, that besides Charleston they were destined to Georgia & Augustine. The person did not know all the corps that were to embark but was informed there were to be some British, some Hessians, & the newraised corps, of which Robinsons (2) & the N. York Volunteers were particularly mentioned. They appeared to be bringing down much baggage to the wharves. It was said they expected to have the whole on board by the Sunday preceding the date of the letter.  Although the general plan of our official correspondence excludes unauthenticated intelligence, the successful enterprize of the Marquis de Bouille agst. the island of Eustatius, is attended with so many marks of reality that we can not well omit it. The article in the inclosed gazette(3) under the Antigua head in particular, is little short of a confirmation of it.

  Sir Philadelpa 2 Janry. 1782 I have been favoured with your Letter of the 22d Novr. and 10 Decr. which I am happy to Acknowledge. I suppose that you have recd. one from me since I left Home.(1)  I can say no more with Regard to the Letters of Mr. Deane which you desire to be informed of than that they are here generally believed to be genuine.  As to the Matter of Imposts which you also mention, I think that a National Revenue is Necessary, my Reasons for this opinion in Regard to the Imports are given in the Report of a Committee which I suppose will be considered the next Session of Assembly. That any Money granted may be misapplied is most certain And if this Principle ought to govern No Money ought ever to be granted for any publick Use, at present so farr as I can judge there is a great Reduction of Expence, by the Conduct of the Superintendant of Finance, in the Expenditure of Such Money as he is possessed of. The single Article of furnishing the Stationary Troops by Contract has reduced the Expence of Rations doubless one half.  The Acts of Congress reducing the Number of the General Staff, except what are necessary for Actual Service, and reducing All Officers commanding several Cores not in the Line of any State, while it relieves them from a Circumstance which can afford no Pleasure, in holding an Office, not accompanied with any proper Command, in which they must find that there Services are not wanted, will make a considerable saving of Expence.(2)  Congress have incorporated the Society for establishing a Bank.(3) Their first Subscription for it is already compleated. Much utility I hope will be derived from it. But without a Revenue such immediate advantages to the Publick cannot be Obtained from it as might otherwise be expected. But the Principles upon which Banks are established is so little understood that I suppose many will object against it.  We have no News from Genl. Greene so late as that published under the N London Head. We may dayly expect to hear from him.  I am Very sorry that Vermont has not complyed with the Proposal of Congress. N York and N Hamshire are remonstrating against them. There recent Claims are I beleive universally rebrobated, and their persisting to make them, will probably invovle them in much Dificulty.(4) JANUARY 2, 1782  My best Complements to Mrs. Adams and my other Friends. You will please to let my Family know that I am well-as it is uncertain wheather I shall be able to Write to them by this Oppertunity. I am Sir with much Regard, your most Obedt.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany. 8th. 1782 I have before me your favor of the 31st Ulto.(1) I regret much the refusal of Mr. J. to become a member of the Virga. delegation, not only as it deprives his country of that particular service, but as I fear it proceeds from a fixed disinclination to all public employments.(2)  Yesterday was opened for the first time the bank instituted under the auspices of Congress.(3) Its principal founder is Mr. R. M who has certain prerogatives wth. respect to it in his quality of superintendant of finance. It is pretty analagous in its principles to the bank of England. The stock subscribed is 400,000 dollars. When the scheme was originally proposed to Congress for their approbation & patronage, a promise was given that as soon as it was ripe for operation the company sd. be incorporated. A few days ago the fulfilment of the promise was claimed. The competency of Congress to such an act had been called in question in the first instance, but the subject not lying in so near & distinct a view, the objections did not prevail. On the last occasion, the general opinion though with some exceptions was that the Confederation gave no such power and that the exercise of it would not bear the test of a forensic disquisition & consequently would not avail the institution. The bank however supposing that such a sanction from Congress wd. at least give it a dignity & preeminence in the public opinion, urged the engagement of Congress; that on this engagement the subscriptions had been made; & that a disappointment would leave the subscribers free to withdraw their names. These considerations were reinforced by the Superintendt. of finance, who relyed on this institution as a great auxiliary to his department, and in particular expected aid from it in a payment he is exerting himself to make to the army. The immediate interposition of Congress was rendered the more essential too by the sudden adjournment of the Assembly of this State, to whom the bank might have been referred for the desired incorporation, which it was the opinion of many would have given them a sufficient legal existence in every state. You will conceive the dilemma in which these circumstances placed the members who felt on one side the importance of the institution, and on the other a want of power and an aversion to assume it. Something like a middle way finally produced an acquiessing rather than an affirmative vote. A charter of incorporation was granted, with a recommendation to the States to give it all the necessary validity within their respective jurisdictions. As this is a tacit admission of a defect of power I hope it will be an antidote against the poisonous tendency of precedents of usurpation.  In the ordinance lately passed for regulating captures, which I JANUARY 8, 1782  presume you have seen, a clause was inserted, exposing to capture all merchandizes produced in G.B. if coming into these States, & within three leagues of the coast, altho the property of a neutral nation. Congress have now recommended to the States to subject them to seizure during the war, if found on land within their respective limits.(4) These measures had become necessary to check an evil which was every day increasing, and which both enabled & encouraged G. Britain to persevere in the war, at the same time that it mortifyed our ally with daily seeing the fruits of his generosity to us remitted in payment to the rival of his nation & the enemy of both.  The success of the Marquis de Bouille agst St. Eustatius is Sufficiently confirmed. About 700 prisoners were taken. As we have good reason to believe strong reinforcements are on the way from France to the W. I. this loss may be considered as a presage of much greater misfortunes.  I am Dr Sir Yrs. sincerely J. Madison Jr.  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Jany. 8. 1782. Your excellency's favor of the 28th Ulto, not having acknowledged the receipt of our dispatches by Capt. Irish, we shall repeat them, unless the next post should announce his arrival.(1)  We cannot but lament the distressing and degrading situation, in which we are placed, from the scantiness and uncertainty of our supplies, in which our own private credit can avail us nothing, and prices are immoderate and ruinous. We beg the attention of the executive to this point, important to ourselves, and perhaps important to our country.(2)  The inclosures (No 1 & 2) were received from a Mr. Murray.3 He has painted his services to Virginia at the Illinois, in strong terms, and his sufferings on her account in stronger. We have therefore  JANUARY 8, 1782  undertaken to transmit to your board his state of both; requesting, that some answer may be given to his application.  Being disposed to advance, on every proper occasion, the views of our ally, and to demonstrate to Great Britain, how practicable it is to renounce her manufactures and produce, we rendered every aid in our power to the resolution, which the president has sent on,(4) recommending more effectual provision against the introduction of British merchandizes. As these considerations were the grounds of the resolution, we cannot doubt, that our legislature will execute the recommendation. It will be remembered, that the late ordinance, respecting captures, which has been forwarded to the judges of the court of the Admiralty thro' your excellency, relates to this species of commodities, when found on water only.  The superintendant of finance is instructed to transmit to the several states copies of the act, incorporating the national bank. He probably will be explicit on the benefits to be expected from such an institution. To him we shall consign this part of the subject.(5)  But some scruples having been entertained as to the authority of congress to grant a charter of incorporation, we cannot forbear to mention the predicament, in which this body stood.  When the establishment of a bank was proposed to congress on the 26th day of May last, its utility was immediately seen. They accordingly approved the plan, and promised to support it in the most effectual manner. Among other things, they stipulated to pass an act of incorporation; altho' objections were suggested against such an engagement. After a vote to this effect, subscriptions were made upon the expectation of a charter from congress, the president and directors chosen, and we were required to fulfil our contract. The same doubts upon congressional power were again urged; but nothing decisive was done, until a committee, appointed to confer with the bank, reported the result of the conference. They informed congress that they had communicated to the bank the difficulties, which occurred in granting a charter; but that they were answered, that the promise of a preceding congress was binding on a subsequent one- that the subscribers would be free to withdraw their subscriptions, unless a charter should pass from congress, and that tedious and expensive arrangements had been made for commencing the operations of the bank. The financier added, that a delay in these operations would injure him in his attempt towards a payment to the army. Pressed as they were by these representations, congress did incorporate the bank; some of those, who voted in the affirmative thinking themselves obliged by the engagement in May, others contending for a constitutional power in these cases, and others assenting to it from absolute necessity. The resolution sub-  joined to the act will therefore, we hope, be complied with by the several legislatures.  We have the honor, Sir, to be with great respect, yr. excellency's mo. ob. servants.

  Sir, Private Philadelphia 8th Janry. 1782 The most important matters which have passed in Congress since my last Letter to your Excellency of the l9th ultimo has been an ordinance incorporating the Society for establishing a National Bank. This had been some time ago promised them, and as their first Subscription was compleated it was thot proper to comply with their Application.  Congress have likewise passed two Acts; The one that the Commander in Chief ascertain to the Secretary of War the Number of General officers necessary for Actual Service-That thereupon the Secretary nominally order that Number into Service-And that the Rest of them shall be considered as having retired upon half pay. The Other Act is that all officers commanding separate Cores not in the Line of any State Shall after the 20 of this month retire upon half pay, their Cores will thereupon be incorporated with the Lines. (1) A Stop for the present is put to any exchange of Prisoners. The Enemy have made it a Preliminary That Ld. Cornwallis (who it is supposed has gone for England) Shall in the first Instance be exchanged. This has not been agreed to, or an Exchange might otherwise have been properly made. What has induced Sr. Harry Clinton to make this an Absolute Condition is a matter of Conjecture only. Our People in Captivity at the Southward will suffer most by this Delay, but the Sanguinary Conduct of Ld. Cornwallis in those Coun- JANUARY 8, 1782  tries induced the Gentlemen belonging there not to desire the Exchange of their People upon such Terms. Perhaps if his Lordship could be considered as divested of a Dispo[si]tion to commit the most wanton Cruelty, no solid objection could lye against his Exchange, on Account of his Military Abilities.(2)  We have no News from the Southward so late as that published under the N. London Head. Probably about ten days ago about 1200 men Embarked from N York for their Southern Posts.  As no official Letter is necessary, I therefore write for your Excellency's personal Information of such matters as have occurred since my last.  I am Very respectfully, Your Excellency's most obedt servant, Oliver Wolcott  P.S. Mr. Law is well.  P.S.

The Accounts due from the U States, to each, to be liquidated by a Commissioner Sent to each State to be Approved by the State to whom sent. This Report will probably be considered in a few days.(3)  The Affairs of Vermont have called the Attention of Congress. Nothing yet has been done in this Affair. Perhaps the former Act of Congress admitting them by Implication as an independent State will be recognized and made explicit-And a Time limited for their Complyance which if not agreed to by them, effectually Steps may be taken to give Peace to the Northern Frontiers.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, January 9th, 1782. Since my last by Mr. Allen we have no European intelligence, but the agreea[ble] news, the reduction of St. Eustatius, St. Martins and Saba, by the marquis Bouille who has reestablished their former government. This enterprise was well conducted and reflects the highest honour on the Marquis and his brave little corps.  The amazing efforts of the British last campaign and the events therefrom, are strong and evident proofs that she cannot prosecute JANUARY 9, 1782  the war with any possible prospect of success. The fleets of [. . .] superior and consequently any distant operations must be very uncertain and distructive.  We have some pretty well authenticated reports that a reinforcement of troops and shiping are arrived from France at Martineque and that some combined operations are daily expected in that quarter-from the State of the belligerent powers, we may safely conclude, that there will be peace this spring, or that the British possessions in the West indies will be divided amongst her enemies, and that she will not have an army in the United States.  The New York paper announces the arrival of Lord Dunmore at Charlestown on his way to his government of Virginia.  The People of Vermont are like to be troublesome to us, they would not accord to the propositions made to them in August last but continued to encroach on the territory of New York and New Hampshire, the consequences were that the citizens of these states armed immediately and they were Like to have had an action, which was in some measure prevented by some of our generals.  Congress have been rather in attentive to the repeated remonstrances of New York and New Hampshire, and some interested members thereof are said to have encouraged the people of Vermont in persevering, in the support of their Claims. We now have this business before us and I fear we have too few States in Congress to bring it to a speedy determination.  Miss Peggy has written as you asked.

  January 9-February 20, 1782](1) The first Step necessary towards a general Liquidation of Accounts between the United States, & the respective States, should be to propose for the approbation of the respective States a Table of Depretiation drawn up by the Directions of Congress upon rational Principles, & referd with the grounds upon which it is framed for the view & final approbation of each Legislature.

  Dear Doctr Philadelphia January 14th. 1782 We are very uneasy, not haveing received a line from you Since you left us. No other Cause than that of the want of an Oppertunity (or perhaps Miscarriage) I hope has prevented it. I wish much to hear how you got home and how you found the family especially little Beck & John.  JANUARY 15, 1782  Your mother has been very unwell almost ever Since you left us 'till within these few days. She begins to be better reconciled to the place and intends to begin tomorrow to return Vissits. Little Kitty is very well and much delighted with the Acquaintance She has made Among the little Girls.  Our national Bank opend Monday last and many notes have been Issued-it seems to be the inclination of all ranks of people to give it all possible Credit-some notes have been brought in by the Farmers to be Exchanged what were instantly paid off in hard money. While others after finding that the money was ready went off with the notes well Satisfyed of their being equal in Value to Gold and silver. The Merchants here are throwing their money into the Bank, and taking out notes, which they find equally Answers their purposes. These notes too will be received in the Continental Treasury in discharge of Taxes. Ten or twelve Vessels are lately arrived here from the Havanna, with a large quantity of Specie, which it is said will all go into the Bank-in short from present Appearances I think there Can be no doubt, but the Credit of the Bank will in a very Short time, be so well established, that it will be in the power of the Directors, to Issue notes to any Amount they please; prudence will dictate to them, not to Issue more than they have Cash in hand, at least for some time. When those notes get Circulated through the Continent, it will be a difficult matter in Case our Enemies (I mean the disaffected) Should have designs Against the Bank, to Collect a number Sufficient to endanger its Credit; and no man or Set of men perhaps would think themselves Safe in making the Attempt. 9 oClock at night post Just arrived and no letter from you. no news from the southward Since the 21st Novr.

  Sir, Philadelphia Janry. 15th. 1782 I lately received an application from the County of Essex, informing me of one Mr Reid (1) having been taken up in New Ark, who had come from New York, and after being bound over to appear at Court, that he was again taken returning from New York. I was desired to call on the Commander in Chief to get all the Intelligence I could of this Man.(2) This I have done and for obvious Reasons think proper to communicate the result to your Excellency, as the Head of the Executive Authority. JANUARY 15, 1782  The Commander in Chief has authorized me to say, that Mr Reid was formerly a deputy Paymaster in the Continental Service. That he was accused of secreting & introducing into Albany, the Men who came from the Enemy to take Genl. Schuyler. That tho' there was no Doubt of his Guilt, yet from some peculiar Circumstances, nothing more could be done with him, than to banish him into New York.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany. 15th. 1782 Your favor of the day of written on the eve of your departure from Richmond came safe to hand by the last week's post.(1) The result of the attack on your administration was so fully anticipated that it made little impression on me.(2) If it had been consistent with your sentiments & views to engage in the new service to which you were called, it wd. have afforded me both unexpected & singular satisfaction, not only from the personal interest I felt in it but from the important aid which the interests of the state would probably have derived from it.(3) What I particularly refer to is her claim to Western territory. The machinations which have long been practised by interested individuals agst. this claim are well known to you. The late proceedings within the walls of Congress in consequence of the territorial cessions produced by their recommendations to the States claiming the Western Country were many weeks ago transmitted for the Legislature by a Capt. Irish. By the same conveyance I wrote to you on the subject. We have the mortification to find by our latest letters from Richmond that this Gentleman had not at the date of them appeared there.(4) As it is uncertain whether that information may not have totally miscarried it will be proper to repeat to you that the States besides Virga. from which the cessions came were Connecticut & N. York. The cession of the former consisted of all her claim west of N. York as far as the Mississippi. That of the latter of all her claims beyond a certain western limit drawn on the occasion. The cession of Cont. extended to the soil only expressly reserving the jurisdiction. That of N.Y. made no reservation. These cessions with that of Virga. & sundry memorials from the Inda. & other land Companies were referred to a Committee composed of a Member from N.H., R.I., N.J., Pa. & Maryld. The ingredients of this composition prepared us for the complexion of their proceedings.(5) Their first step was to investigate & discuss the respective titles of the States to the territory ceded. As this was directly in the face of the recommendation of Congress which professed to bury all such discussions & might prejudge future controversies between individual members of the Union, we refused to exhibit any evidence in favor of the title of Va. and endeavoured though in vain to prevail on Congress to interdict the Committee from pro- JANUARY 15, 1782  ceeding in the enquiry. The next step of the Committee was still more obnoxious. They went fully into a hearing of the Memorialists through their Agents, & received all the evidence adduced in support of their pretensions. On this occasion we renewed our remonstrances to the Committee & our complaints to Congress, but with as little effect as on the first occasion. The upshot of the whole was a report to Congress rejecting the Cessions of Virga. & Cont. and accepting that of N.Y.; disallowing also the claims of the Companies N.W. of the Ohio, but justifying that of the Inda. Compy. The report seems to distrust the doctrine hitherto maintained, of territorial rights being incident to the U.S. Collectively which are not comprehended within any individual State; substituting the expedient of recognizing the title of N.Y. stretching it over the whole country claimed by the other ceding States, & then accepting a transfer of it to the U.S. In this state the business now rests, the report having never been taken into consideration, nor do we wish it should, till it shall have undergone the consideration of Virga.  In whatever light the policy of this proceeding may be viewed it affords an additional proof of the industry & perseverance with which the territorial rights of Virga. are persecuted, & of the necessity of fortifying them with every precaution which their importance demands. As a very obvious & necessary one we long since recommended to the State an accurate & full collection of the documents which relate to the subject. If the arrival of Capt. Irish had taken place before the adjournt. of the Assembly & during your stay with it we flattered ourselves that this recommendation wd. have been attended to & that the task wd. have fallen on you. As this was not the case we have no hope at present of being enabled from any other sources than the voluntary aids of individuals to contradict even verbally the misrepresentations & calumnies which are daily levelled agst. the claims of Va. & which can not fail to prepossess the public with errors injurious at present to her reputation & which may affect a future decision on her rights. Col. Masons industry & kindness has supplied us with some valuable papers & remarks. Mr. Jones has also recd from Mr. Pendleton some judicious remarks on the subject.(6) We are still notwithstandg. far from possessing a complete view of it. Will you permit me to ask of you such information as your researches have yielded, with the observations which you have made in the course of them. I would not obtrude such a request on you if the subject were not of public importance & if it could have been addressed with equal prospect of advantage elsewhere. Indeed if you cd. prevail on yourself to spare as much time as would Survey the whole subject, beginning with the original charter, pursuing it thro' the subsequent charters & other public acts of the crown thro' the Govs. of Virga., & referring to all the transactions with the   Indians which have been drawn into the question, the public utility I am persuaded wd sufficiently reward you for the labor.(7)  Pray did you ever receive a letter from me inclosing a proposition declaratory of-the coercive power of Congress over the States? It went by an Express while you were at the head of the Exec.(8)  We have not a word of new[s] from Europe. The French are assemblg a force in the W. Indies which presages further calamities to the English. The Spaniards are also in motion, but their object will probably be both a small & a selfish one. I shall cheerfully send you a line as often as I have a subject for it, tho' I shall be so selfish as to hope for some return for it.  I am Dr Sir Yrs sincerely J. Madison Jr.  ""

  Dear Sir (1) Philadela Jany 16, 17[82] As it is now a dearth of News you must not think it amiss that I send you none for indeed this season affords nothing material: it is a long time since we heard anything from Genl Green not since the JANUARY 16, 1782  reinforcements joined him. As we have no Army in the field at this time but his, we have to look to Military enterprize from no other quarter during the Winter unless it is from incursions made by the Enemy into New Jersey, which I think we have reason to fear, tho if they succeed no better than in their late attempt at Brunswick, they had better stay away.  I saw in a late Jersey paper an Acct of Colo Cranes trial of Court Martial in which the Court finds him guilty of trading with the Enemy & encouraging it or countenancing it in others while he commanded at Eliza. Town, and being frequently [saturated?] with Liquor during his commd for which he is adjudged to be reprimanded.(2) Nothing could have reflected greater dishonor on New Jersey than this Trial-only to reprimand an Officer for such a high offence is truly scandalous. I lately heard an officer in a Company of the first Characters of the United States say that Colonel ought to have been hanged and all the Court Martial with him. The affair is severely spoken of generally in this Town. Did Colo Crane know the Opinion entertained of his offence by people of the first Character or had any sense of Shame, he would avoid being seen as much as possible, but he has not a sense of honour enough to know his disgrace or feel his shame, and I suppose this must be much the Case of his judges who appear, at least of the major part of them to be destitute of every principle that Characterizes the man of honour. How is the honour of the Militia bearing this scandalous affair?  I expect by this time the Murderer of Mr. Caldwell has been tried & received his doom but that will not restore our loss which will be long felt in Eliza. Town.(3) I think you had best not be in a hurry in getting another, for few can be found fit to Succeed him that is gone; I have one or two in my mind that might Answer, but think they could not be got till the end of the war, as they are Chaplains in the Army.  I had not the pleasure of seeing you at Philada. as you proposed, and can form no guess when it will be probable I shall see you at home unless I shall return to [Reners?] in the Spring-but know not where to get a safe habitation in our Country. I intended to have hired Mr. Caldwell's house & Land at Turkey if to be let, but that I understand hath been sold. Where I can go is altogether uncertain with me-but shall if I can remove if the Enemy continues at New York.  I am, Dear Sir, most Sincerely yours. Abra Clark  ""

  Sir Philadelpa, 21st Janry, 1782. We have been honoured with your Excellency's Letter of the first instant, and would Observe with regard to the mode of settling the publick Accounts, that the Subject upon a Report has been recommitted, and which has not yet been again reported upon. (1) One great Difficulty which attends this Business is, by what Rate the Certificates given for the old Money shall be Ascertained. A uniform Rule to Operate thro the States when it is well known that the Exchange has been so extremely different, would be apparently unjust, and wheither the schales adopted by the particular States, in Case they had been extended to the Termination of the old Currency, would in all Cases be an equitable one, is not altogether clear. But we Apprehend that when the Principles upon which the Accounts of the several States against the United States shall be Ascertained, one or more Commissioners will be appointed for each State, to liquidate those Accounts. This Measure not only Appears to us to be the most proper one, but, so farr as We can judge by the Observations made upon this Subject, will probably be the opinion of Congress. Another matter has been referred to the same Committee, to adopt a Mode by which the unfunded Debts of the United States shall be Apportioned out to the several States. By the funded Debt is meant all foreign Debts, Loan Office Certificates, and Debts liquidated and entered on the Books of the Treasurer. Wheither this last measure will be agreed to, is uncertain, perhaps it will be tho't that the relative Value of the States, being so very precarious by the operations of the War, it would be too early a Period to ascertain the respective Quotas.  With Regard to what your Excellency mentions respecting specific Supplies being Accepted towards the pecuniary Aid required of the State, We would inform, that the Superintendant of the JANUARY 21, 1782  Finances tells us that he has wrote to your Excellency upon this Subject.(2) But yet it is proper for us to observe that he acquainted us that all the Troops of the United States except the Southern Army, and the Post at Boston and perhaps one or two More, were now fed by Contract, and that he expected to continue to supply them in this Manner, and that he had also got Winter Cloathing for the whole of them-That his Veiws were to furnish all Supplies by Contract, upon what he Apprehended would be an obvious Principle of Ecconomy. He appeared to be clearly impressed with the Conviction that the Fruits of the Industry of this Country, if reasonably Applyed, Might furnish in Specie the Sums called for, and that the owners of Provisions might and could much better turn them into Money than the Publick, But he told us that he would advise the Contractors and Clothiers to take such Supplies of the State as they Should want, in Case they might have them as cheap as they might be otherwise procured. We do not apprehend that it will be in our Power to effect any Alteration as to this general System; if it shall be done it must be thro' the medium of the Superintendant. We shewed him your Excellency's Letter, by which, and our own Observations, he is fully possessed of the Subject.  We also judge it proper to observe to your Excellency, that Mr. Robert Morrice having a few days ago recd. a Letter from Mr. Silas Deane Acknowledging that he had wrote him a Letter of the 10t of June last, which has been printed, wherein Mr Deane said he had fully communicated to him his Opinion in Regard to our publick affairs-Mr Morrice considered it as his duty to transmit the Letter which he had recd. to Congress.(3) Mr. Deane discovered by his Letter a pretty deal of Resentment that his Accounts had not been settled. His Remarks in Regard to the conducting of the American War, were similar to What had been made by him in his published Letters; with this Letter he transmitted his Acco. against the U. States to Mr. Morrice, the Ballance of which according to our Recollection was 343,000 Livres. He informed Mr. Morrice that he could not send the Vouchers, but supposed that at least a considerable Sum might be advanced to him on his Account. The day after this (4) Mr. Morrice sent two Letters of Mr. Deane's to Congress, the one directed to his Brother Barnabas, the other to Mr Thomas Mumford. These Letters Mr. Morrice recd. of a Person who took them of Mr Deane in France, with a Very particular charge to destroy them in Case he should find himself in Danger of being taken by the Enemy But upon his Arrival, finding that Mr Deane's political Character lay under a criminal Imputation, he judged it proper to deliver them to Mr. Morrice. Congress directed the President to break the Seals and if upon Inspection the Letters were of a private Nature to Send them forward, otherwise to communicate them. The Letters were communicated, and thereupon were ordered to be retained by   the Secretary of Foreign Affairs-And such Communications made of them as might most effectually Obviate the Mischeif which it was supposed Mr Deane might be inclined to do the United States. Upon this Measure's being agreed to, and which We think was a proper one-We supported a Motion that the Secretary of Foreign Affairs should be directed to send Copys of those Letters with the Prooffs of their Authenticity to your Excellency.(5) Our veiw in this was that as there was not only Matters in those Letters which respected the particular Interests of the Gentlemen to whom they were directed and who ought therefore to be Acquainted with them, But also as Mr. Deane belonged to the State and had fallen under suspicions of a most criminal Nature, it was proper that the State should be able to judge of the Evidence to justify an Imputation of this kind. We shall observe nothing more upon this disagreeable Subject, than that the Determinations of Congress in Regard to those Letters were made without either Passion or any Dissension.  We think it not improper to mention to your Excellency an affair which altho it does not immediately respect the State, yet as some seasonable advice to the People of Vermont to attend to a Conduct consistent with their own Wellfare and the publick Peace,(6) instead of pursuing Measures which immediately lead to the Disturbances of both, might have a happy Effect, We beg leave to Observe that the non Complyance of these People with the Act of Congress eventually acknowledging them as an independent State was as unexpected to Congress, as the Reasons which they gave for their Refusal was unsatisfactory. These People consider themselves under an Obligation, as they Say, to have an adjudication Of the Claims of the People with whom they have lately connected themselves. But they would have done well to have considered that Congress have explicitly guaranteed these recent Claims to N. Hamshire and N. York-And that if a People may as by Right claim an Exemption from a jurisdiction under which they have been long settled, till such Claims can be adjudicated, it will at any Time be in the Power of a few factious People to produce the utmost Confusion and Dismemberment in those States. Congress have had it in Contemplation to recognise their former Act in their Favour, and to declare that if the People of this District shall within two Months accede to the Confederation upon the Terms proposed, That then they shall upon their signing the Confederation be admitted into the Union, and that in Case they shall Refuse that they shall be reduced under one or more of the confederate States. Wheither this Measure as proposed will be adopted is uncertain. But doubtless Measures to put matters upon a different footing in the Northern Frontier will be judged necessary. It Appears Very strange that this People will not now Accept of what they have for a long Time been endeavouring to obtain. This Perseverance in a Mode of Conduct which is considered as so Very im-  proper may, unless immediately rectified, subject them to Difficulties which they do not seem in the least to apprehend. We have no News of any Importance to communicate to your Excellency. We are, with the highest Respect and Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedient Servants. Oliver Wolcott.  Richd Law.  P.S. Your Excellency's Letter incloseing that of Mr Bills' we immediately on Receipt thereof lay'd before Congress, who Referrd the Same to Comtee appointed to take up that Subject and to confer with General Washington thereon, who have the same now under Consideration & as soon as they shall report thereon will acquaint you therewith.(7)  ""

The circumstance you relate of [ . . . ] at Todd's bridge in great number [ . . . ] guard or any person, who had the least charge of them is really very extraordinary & unaccountable. I communicated that part of your letter to the Secretary at War. He informd me that the Virginia Militia had been indeed extremely inattentive to them; & that in consequence of their neglect many had escaped; but that measures were now taken to put a stop to that spirit of desertion, which at the beginning prevail'd among them.

  Dear Sir Philada. Jany. 22d. 1782 The post having not yet come in I have not the pleasure of acknowledg[in]g yours which I make no doubt he brings for me.  Congress are much occupied & perplexed at present with the case of Vermont. The pretensions of that settlement to the character of an independt. State, with the grounds on which they are made & the countenance given them by Congress are I presume pretty well known to you. It has long been contended that an explicit acknowledgment of that Character and the admission of them into the federal Union was an act both of Justice & policy. The discovery made through several channels & particularly by the intercepted letters of Ld G. Germaine(1) added such force to the latter of these considerations that in the course of last summer preliminary overtures [were] made on the part of Congress for taking them into the confederation, containing as one condition on the part of Vermont that they sd. contract their claims within the bounds to which they were originally confined, & guaranting to N.Y. & N.H. all the JANUARY 22, 1782  territory without those bounds to which their encroachments had been extended. Instead of complying with this condition they have gone on in their encroachments both on the N.Y. & N.H. sides & there is at this moment every symtom of approaching hostility with each of them. In this delicate crisis the interposition of Congress is again called for, & indeed seems to be indispensable; but whether in the way of military coercion, or a renewal of former overtures, or by making the first a condition of a refusal of the last, is not so unanimously decided. Indeed with several members & I may say States in Congress a want of power either to decide on their independence or to open the door of the confederacy to them is utterly disclaimd,(2) besides which the danger of the precedent, & the preponderancy it wd. give to the Eastern scale deserve serious consideration. These reasons nevertheless can only prevail when the alternative contains fewer evils. It is very unhappy that such plausible pretexts if not necessary occasions of assuming power should occur. Nothing is more distressing to those who have a due respect for the constitutional modifications of power than to be obliged to decide on them.  We have nothing fresh from Europe. We are informed by the way of N.Y. that the Earl of Dunmore has arrived at Charleston to claim from Earl Cornwallis the fulfilment of his promise. No individuals in his Suite are named.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Jany 23d. 1782 I had the Pleasure of receiving your Favor last Saturday. I conclude it was lately wrote, tho' without Date. I am mortified, that I have not had the good Fortune to receive the Letters you mention to have written. The three several Matters you desire me to attend to, I shall do with the greatest Satisfaction & I must acknowledge, that at present I am doubtful of having any Success with Respect to two of them. The first is the Bond given to the Treasurer of the united  JANUARY 23, 1782  States by Capt Hanadan. We had an Application if I do not misremember from Mr. Morton last Fall of a similar Nature, & the Bond was refused. I will examine the Journals of Congress as to the Case you men[tion] as well as the other of Mr. Morton's.(1) The next is the Case of Mr. Bingham. I have had some Conversation [with] him upon the Matter; he seems very much [dis]satisfied alledging that he has suffered considerably in his Property attached in Boston; & that as he was but a mere Instrument acting in this Matter only by the Express Orders & Direction of the Governor of the Island he seems to think the Suit is vexatious & that he ought to have Damages of [them] that commenced it.(2) As to the united States discharging the Debt at this Time I fear it is improbable if not impossible. I shall call on the Financier who acts with Dicision in his Business & if he says he cannot discharge it otherwise than by Security I apprehend it will not be done. If upon farther Examination I should find a more formal Application will be necessary in either of the Matters I shall immediately inform you of it. I have enclosed you a Letter which I have had laying by me since November last.(3) The Subject of it is respecting the Bank & myself. The national Bank having been incorporated on the 31st of December last, there are many Things in that Letter superfluous-those that respect myself are of some Consequence because I now find myself here without money & in this Situation I cannot remain. I find no Difficulty in disposing of Draughts upon the State-my fear is that they will not be discharged. I shall draw on the State for about twelve hundred Dollars in the Course of the year & with that Sum I find it is almost impossible to live in any Kind of Fashion so exorbitant is the Price of every Thing in this City.  I cannot doubt of your or Deac[o]n Davis's Friendship in this Matter should it be needed.  The Bank Notes succeed beyond our most sanguine Expectation. People seem to be fully satisfied with & fond of them-a large Sum of them is in Circulation & they do not bring them in for Payment in that Quantity which might have been expected. Many Gentlemen have diposited their Money in the Bank-& I think it is probable that Merchants of Interest will not only find it safe but very convenient to lodge all their Money with the Bank & negociate their Business thro' them. The Directors meet about Two Hours every Tuesday Evening to examine the State of the Bank & to make such Rules and Regulations as they find necessary.  I am, Dear Sir, with Sentiments of the highest Esteem, your most humble Servt. Samuel Osgood  ""

  Sir Philadelphia Jany. 24. 1782. The minister plenipotentiary of France communicated to us this afternoon the inclosed extract from a letter of Count de Vergennes.(1) We are happy to find, that the supplies, which your excellency negotiated with the minister, are ready for transportation to our country. Being informed, that the last letter, which you received from Mr. Luzerne on this subject, threw a damp on the prospect of obtaining them, we conceive that no particular steps have been taken for the forwarding of them.(2) Fearing too, lest a delay in sending them on might prove injurious, if not fatal, to Virginia, we answered the communication by the inclosed letter.(3) We trust, that, howsoever we may have passed beyond the bounds of our authority in this matter, it is justified by the present situation of things: since it is probable, that, unless the Hermione, which is now ready to sail from Virginia, should be the bearer of some direction for the conveyance of these stores, they may be witholden from us for a twelvemonth, and the express cannot wait, or indeed call at Richmond for an answer from the executive.  If, however, we have counteracted any scheme, which your board may have adopted in this business, it is possible, that the mischief may be corrected, by contradicting our dispatches, in a letter, addressed to count de Vergennes and sent by the Hermione.(4)  We have the honor, sir, to be with great respect, your excellency's mo. ob. servts.

  Sir Philadelphia January 24th. 1782 We have taken into consideration the Communication which you were pleased to make us this afternoon of that part of his Excellencys Count de Vergennies late Letter which relates to the mode of forwarding the supplies furnished by his Court to the State of Virga.(1) Being Sensible of the difficulties under which our Country labours from the want of Military Stores, we cannot do otherwise than recommend that those which our generous Ally has directed for the use of Virginia, should be forwarded in French bottoms Without delay. We are confident that every measure tending to the secure transportation of these Stores will be adopted, and particularly that they will be sent under a convoy of a convenient force, if it be practicable.  We shall inform the Governor of Virginia of the Steps, which we have now taken, and doubt not that they will prove acceptable.  Altho' Mr. Harrison who negociated these Supplies with you mentions in his Letter of the 29th of May last, the propriety of sending them to the Delaware, yet we beg leave to refer you to his preceding Letter of the 17th of Feby in which he observes \""that it would add greatly to the obligation if the Stores could be transported in a Frigate to York Town in Virginia.\"" The latter Letter having been written at a Season when our ports were infested by British vessels we conceive that the former suggests, for our present circumstances, the most convenient & advantageous plan.  But should the position of the Enemy make it unsafe to enter Chesapeake bay, we are convinced that due precaution will be taken.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia January 26th, 1782 I hear you left Stanton yesterday & proceeded on your Journey southward. I fear you will have had many a disagreeable hour before you receive this. I find the regulation last made with regard to Promotions goes farther than I imagin'd when I mentioned it to you. It dissolves the Classes of States by districts, which was injurious to some of those who were linked together like the living & the dead in the Poet. The Two parts were combined that the one might carry through the other, tho' the whole stroke was intended meerly to clear the way for a favorite promotion: it has not been since pushed but we expect it daily.

  [January 28-March 1, 1782](1) I have been silent, and wished to continue so-to give every chance to the advocates for the admission, but as the matter is press'd, I should deem silence Treason against my Country- America. The Gentleman of Jersey(2) bold if his faith in all things is equal to that of Politicks. He would make a good Catholic. If I could believe that Power in the Confederation, I should find no difficulty in believing Transubstantiation &ca.  Political necessity is ever the Tyrant's Plea-it made Parliament Triennial-Septennial. The same plea may make Congressional representation not annual but perpetual-it has made Parliament venal. It may abolish all accountability of Delegates, by abolishing yeas and nays or by sinking them when printed for public Inspection. Confidence of the Congress is lowered. Political necessity has established apparently a Temporary Convenience, probably a future destruction of thousands. There have been Dupes to one kind of Paper-there may be Dupes to another.  The Argument of (Cornell) of the Gentleman from Rhode Island JANUARY 28, 1782  would make us believe that we have a very formidable power to contend with.  Answer. Britain within our Bowels. There was a time when 48,000 men were not thought so Terrible-tho' America then stood single and unallied.  A Threat has been used of withdrawing the Southern army.  Answer. I will agree with the New England States to league and guarantee the Independence of Vermont.  For my part let the Force of the Union be tried, if questions in which the public weal is concern'd are to be external, let it be declared.  The Gentleman from Jersey has labour'd [....](3) he cannot bring forth Conviction. He has quoted many Extracts from the Justificatory memorial.(4) I beg leave to observe that tho' that memorial was very proper for the occasion intended by it-yet I apprehend the reasonings should never be applied to the proceedings between Congress and Vermont. The memorial speaks of America being defacto in possession of Independence. Does it say that Cause of Opposition to Great Britain was such defacto possession-or rather does not the Gentleman remember that the American revolution was declared to be set up de Jure.  I shall ask the Gentleman a few Questions. Does the Justificatory memorial say anything of a 14th State-does it not expressly mention the No. 13? In the Directions to the Commissioners for Peace are not the States said to be 13?(5) Do not the Boundaries laid down include these Lands within the 13 States? Does not the Argument defacto justify any revolt or Insurrection of the People? Nay; may not the Enemy, or British Prisoners take hold and plead it? May it not be pleaded in Charles Town, in New York, &ca?  State of Vermont (6) Better to hold Sacred the Articles of Confederation than the 10 Commandments-the one is mischief to the Individual, the other to the public.  They are formidable as the people of the land explor'd by Joshua to whom the Izraelites were like Locusts-and they are made formidable for the same purpose. Query.  The people of Vermont will be content to be divided between the Neighboring States (Postliminium).(7) They are adverse to the British (undue secrecy of the Leaders), adverse to Independence because they are sensible of the Expence of Government. Smith (8) says 2/3 are against Independence. He is a New England man and [ .... ] Boudinot's Informant says 2/5 are for Postliminium, 2/5 Indifferent, 1/5 for Independence.  Maxims we should find expedient for standing still without Harm, when we cannot go forward to Advantage.  Fundamental Constitutions should never be changed but in a regular, uniform manner. This is the security of civil liberty.  Public liberty is precarious when the sup[erintending?] power dispenses, restrains, extends general Laws.  Good uses may be made of Prerogative by them (Case. V.) there is no power.  The Articles of Confederation by Limiting the power of admission into the Union, supposes that after having established an equality of Votes between the large and small states, a fear in the Larger, that the small states might in future wish a partition of the large states.  Arb[itrary?] power lodged can never be delegated. (a m.) Commissn.  The Exercise of power anticonstitutional, is abuse.  The Solidity of an Institution must come from a strict adherence to original Principles.  Too close a union of the [leaders?] of the body politic becomes dangerous to the common Interest by becoming independent of the great body or Mass of the people.  Congress has nurs'd [. . .] Checking the Bus[iness?] by advising New York and New Hampshire to supineness.  Therefore Prov[ided?] that it had better [....]I should have been stropt. I am sure I should have deserved it.  Mr. Boudinot's astonished at the Information that Policy guided the Votes of Congress to gain time.  Invitation to make a Southern State to [gain] equilibrium.  Soldiers will not fight against Brothers.  They [hold?] it our possession of Independence de facto. (denied by New York). The British are de facto possessed of New York and Charles Town.  The Officers of the Army have Lands granted-(turn their own policy against them) by making the Grants good.  They are formidable-equal the British-the abundance in wheat and Beef [. . .] it a strong Country.  Forgot his own account from his Friend-that 1/5 only want Independence.  Beleives the Congress has a Power to admit. The only [person?] who has roundly Asserted his Beleif of such a power. He will say with Mr. Pitt-if it is not it should be there.  The Commander in Chief says next Campaign must make us free or subjugate us to Great Britain (query if so).(9) Bewail'd the states would entail themselves by not giving Independence.  New York cannot conquer Vermont.   The General trembles for the Consequences.  He gives his opinion that he may not have part in the Mischief.  It will give our Ally a good opinion of us.  New York would but Clinton prevented by threat to dissolve the Legislature (we know New 'fork only per their Legislature).  Proposal of a Census.

Nothing can be a more convincing proof of their weakness and hopeless situation, than the base unworthy acts they are practicing and the infamous means they have  JANUARY 29, 1782  recourse to, in order to support themselves in their diminishing Conquests and distress us. But I hope every practicable measure will be adopted to defeat their wicked designs.

I hope Mr Bier will not think of prosecuting him for Stealing his horse. If he should pray endeavour to pursuade him from it. Would rather make him Some Satisfaction for his trouble and Expence in Sending after him-if he is prosecuted tho' he should be Acquitted, a great deal of his time must be lost.(1)  It gave us great pleasure to Know you had got Safe home, and found the Children well. The approaching Spring will I hope prove favourable to you in your present disorder, which I would fain hope from the Opinion of all the Doctors you have Consulted, is not at all dangerous, and that with proper Care you will in a few months be restored to your former health.

JANUARY 31, 1782  Smith, by way of memorial enclosing a kind of affidavits gave Congress information, which with some other that was at the same time received from another quarter, appeared to alarm some of our members who before that affected to disbelieve that they, the Vermontiers, had formed any connexion with the enemy.(3) But this put it beyond a doubt.  Upon which Congress committed the Report as it then Stood with the concurrent Resolves of our Legislature on that Subject: the information then rec'd. with all other papers that related to that business to a Comttee. of one member from each State; that Committee has had it under consideration, and I was in hopes that yesterday or this day it would have determined on the principle (for which reason I detained Smith two days) but something happening which has prevented the Committee from doing it,(4) I have thought proper not to detain him any longer.  Congress appear to be sensible of the necessity of coming to some positive determination with respect to the business, but what they will agree to finally I cannot tell.  As nigh as I can judge, the States stand thus; N. H. would have them independent, but would rather they were not, if those on the East Side of the Mountain could be annexed to them, and those on the West Side to N.Y.-Mas., R.I., and Connecticut are full for making them independent, at all events right or wrong, just or unjust; New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland have been full for their independence; but some of them appear to be staggered since the late information. Pennsylvania has been rather favoring their independence, but now appear to be at a Stand what to do; N.C. and S.C. and Georgia and Virginia, are much in our favor. But what will be determined I am not able to say. Whether Congress will declare them an independent State, or oblige them to return to the State of New York, or whether they will oblige them to go partly to New York and part to New Hampshire. A few days I think will determine it, as something must immediately be done on the subject.  With respect to the distressed circumstances of our State and the settlemt. of our Agent's accounts, a Committee has had them for many weeks and have not reported, tho' I am constantly pressing them; and they are as often promising to report in a day or two.  The concurrent Resolves of our Legislature respecting Colo. Van Schaick I have laid before Congress and they say that they can do nothing in the matter as it now stands, that they understood that he was tired of the service, and was about to resign, that he was not superseded for any misconduct in him.(5)  Enclosed herewith is a copy of Chittenden's letter to the President in answer to the Resolves of the 20th of August last, it is Jesuitical and will bear different construction.(6)  Forgive me, Sir, when I press the sending on some one of my colleagues, for 'tis an intolerable omission, or neglect, when questions of the utmost consequence Should be agitated and determined without our being able to give a vote on them.  The means of support is another matter I shall stand in need of, and would beg that whoever comes on may bring me some, for 'tis not possible that the State can expect that I can bear my own expenses long in this place.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Feby. 2d. 1782 Since writing you last; (1) I have look'd over the Journals of Congress for 1777 & 1778, Page by Page & cannot find the Case you refer to, respecting Mr. Hughes; (2) I cannot learn of any Member of Congress that a Bond of the like Nature has ever been given to the injured Party. This seems to be a prevalent Opinion, that where a  FEBRUARY 2, 1782  Citizen of the united States has been injured as in the Instance you mention, if Damages cannot be recovered at common Law which is the first Course to be taken for Want of Property in Case Judgment goes against the Captn. then the united States ought to constitute some Person to institute a Suit upon the Bond & that the injured Party should receive his Damages therefrom; & in Case the Damages do not amount to the Penalty; the Overplus will be at the Disposal of Congress. I am so little acquainted with Law, that I don't know what is the best Mode of proceeding in this Case; But will hazard my Opinion, & wish your Sintiments upon it. Congress should direct Mr. Hillegas to empower some Person to institute a Suit for & in Behalf of him, as Treasurer of the united States, & in Case Judgment is recovered, the Amount should lay in the Hands of the Sheriff untill the injured Party had in some Mode, which may be pointed out, made to appear the reasonable amount of his Damages, & then the Sheriff should be empowered to discharge the same; & the Remainder, should there be any, subject to the Orders of Congress. However it is strongly insisted upon by some, that the united States ought to be benefitted in Case of a Breach of such Bonds. This opinion seems to me to be neither consistent with Reason or the Design of requiring Bonds which undoubtedly has in View the Preservation of the Peace of the united States with other Nations.  We have had this Day (3) laid before Congress a Letter from Genl. Heath to Genl. Washington inclosing a Letter from Captn. Wales & Mr. Davis. The Subject of Genl. Heath's Letter is respecting the Cloathing our State has furnishd the Army, or that Part of it belonging to said State.(4) This matter is undoubtedly of considerable Importance & deserves mature Deliberation. The Financier has procured Cloathing enough for the whole Army & he says it was a Matter well known in Boston, as it was principally there. I find he has some Uneasiness about it. I understand the Delivery of it is prohibited at present. But should it be delivered; what is to be done then? Do the State intend to make a present of it to the Soldiers, or to deduct the Value of it out of their Pay when a Settlement is made or to charge the whole Amount thereof against the united States to remain for future Adjustment? The first I think will not be adopted; the second upon the present Plan of the Financer cannot: and the third will at least be a doubtful and uncertain Charge. Several Things have been suggested here of late, which give some Degree of Pain to the Financier. It is said the State does not intend to comply with the Requisition of Congress for Money; & that many People are dissatisfied with the Conduct of Mr. Morris especially as to his Mode of supplying the Army with Provisions & Cloathing as it will have a great Tendency to make Philadela. the Center of all the hard Money on the Continent. Several Things which I do not recollect Mr. Morris told me. Were it needful I should undertake to say a  great Deal in Favor more especially of the present Mode of supplying the Army with Provisions. But as Genl. Lincoln & Mr. Lovell are both very lately from here, & the former is particularly acquainted with the Army, I doubt not he will be able to give such substantial Reasons in Favor of the present Mode, as to convince any unprejuced Mind, that it is the only System of Economy that can be devised. I can but flatter myself that it will save the united States an immense Sum of Money. I was soon after I arrived at this City, appointed one of the Board of Treasury, who continued in Business nearly three Months, whilst Mr. Morris was making his Arrangements: And it is my serious Opinion that Congress could have scarcely gone thro the past Campaingn, if that Board had managed the Finances: there was neither Decision, nor Industry to be found there. From what few Observations I have made, I think Mr. Morris is very well calculated for his Office, perhaps no Man in the united States is better qualified, & it is my Opinion, that it is of the utmost Consequence that the States should give him every possible Assistance. I need not say much on any of these Subjects as I am sure it is impossible for Genl. Lincoln not to enforce them with a Zeal & Earnestness becoming their Importance.  Surely the Successes of the last Campaign must convince the People, that our Commander in Chief & our Ally, have done every Thing in the Field, that can be done, to drive the Enemy from this Country. We do not yet hear what Effect the Capture of Cornwallis has produced the other Side of the Atlantic; & unless this Event which is undoubtedly very contrary to their raised Expectations, produces a very considerable Change in their Sentiments, we may be well perswaded that the British Court has no pacific Intentions. We may certainly depend upon it, that Nothing but absolute Necessity, & a thoro' Conviction of the Impracticability of reducing us to their Subjection, can ever induce them to think of quitting us. This parting Tho't is Death to them. I scarely need to draw this Consequence from our present Situation; That to be in a Capacity to act with Vigour & decidedly next Spring, & that as early as possible, will be of the last Consequence to the united States.  If we should turn our tho'ts upon a Failure of Success, & what in our present Situation would probably disenable us entirely from establishing Independence, I cannot conceive of any Thing, but the Want of even a reasonable Quantity of Money. Our Finances are certainly in a much better Train than they have ever heretofore been; & Economy is much more attended to; We have an exceeding good Secretary of War; & Congress have empowered him to reduce the Expences of the Army capitally by reducing the Number of General Officers, who have been an unreasonable as well as unnecessary Burthen to the united States, He has also lately made some other saving Regulations. We have also a Quarter Master General   whose Economical Disposition & Integrity cannot be called in Question; I wish his Popularity equall'd his Merit.(5) Whatever our Exertions may be the ensueing Campaign, I flatter myself, that the Heads of Departments are so well established, & Business will be conducted with so much Method & Decision, that our Expences will be much less, than they have been in any former Campaign. If it is queried, why, upon this View of Matters, Eight Millions of Dollrs. are required; I apprehend that those who make this Query, have not calculated the absolutely necessary Expenditures of an Army of 35,000 Men; & that this Sum is but about half as much as has been required upon an Average for three years past in real Value. There are Two Questions that naturally occur upon this Sum; one is, whether the People can bear the Collection of it: The other, which is of no small Consequence, is, whether in our present Situation the united States can, with Safety, require a less Sum. If they cannot, as is generally agreed, it is a Duty Congress owe to their Constituents to let them know it.  I cannot learn that you are disposed to give to Congress the Duty of 5 per Ct. We are now & then attacked upon that Head; & I suppose if our State does not comply, she alone will be charged with being the Cause of a Failure-As I believe all the other States (excepting Rhode Island, which has informed Congress pretty plainly that they shall wait to see what their Neighbours do,) have passed Acts for the Purpose.  It did not appear to me at first to be an equitable &Just Tax; But I have since doubted whether my Opinion was well founded. It is a material matter with our State, to be well satisfied whither it would, or not, injure her Commerce. I am doubtful whether we are Justified by Observation or Fact in saying that it would, especially when the Duty is so general that no one State can take the Advantage of any other; If ever an Impost takes Place it is necessary that it should be general. But I apprehend from the Length of Time the State has had this Matter under Consideration they still continue to be opposed to it. I do not pretend to determine but the Objections against it, are important and well founded-& here I must leave the Subject & I believe you will think it high Time so to do. I must beg your Excuse for troubling you so much and can assure you that I would not have sent this Letter in its present Form if Time had permitted me to Copy it.  I am, Dear Sir, with Sentiments of the highest Esteem, Your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

Congress have not yet Determined any thing on the Business of the Grants, the Committee have met on it, and had Allen & Fay, Before them.(1) Allen as I imagined, was previously Informed that Congress had got pretty full Information with Respect to their Conduct with the British, therefore it would be his best way to give to the Committee a full Relation of the whole affair which he did in his own way, and from his own account it appeared to me that he acted the Character of a Consummate Villain and the Reasons which he gave for doing it, I must Confess had not the least weight with me, But that their Conduct was Directly against the United States and in favour of our Enemies; and Yet they have in Congress many friends who will Excuse them for their Conduct and wish to make them Independent. I was in hopes that by this post I Should have been able to given you the Result of Congress on the Subject But it appears as far off as when I wrote you last, tho' Every member Seems to See the Necessity of having Something Decisive Done in the matter.

  Dr. Sir Philada. Feby. 7th. 1782 The post has been very irregular for several weeks past & this week the Mail South of Annapolis has failed altogether; by which means I lose the pleasure of your alternate favor.  A vessel from France informs us that the frigate freigted with the event at York had arrived there in 22 days.(1) We are hourly & anxiously expecting the echo of it from Europe & particularly from England. Unless some revolution in the councils of the latter should result from it, our last intelligence with respect to them justifies our suspicion that they will continue to be as bloody as ever.  Congress are still occupied with the thorny subject of Vermont. Some plan for a general liquidation & apportionment of the public debts is also under their consideration, & I fear will be little less perplexing. It is proposed that untill justice & the situation of the States will admit of a valuation of lands, the States should be applied to for power to substitute such other rule of apportioning the expenditures as shall be equitable & practicable, and that Commissioners be appointed by the concurrent act of the U.S. & each State to settle the accts. between them. The scheme is not yet matured and will meet with many difficulties in its passage thro' Congress.(2) I wish it may not meet with much greater when it goes down to the States. A spirit of accomodation alone can render it unanimously admissible; a spirit which but too little prevails, but wch in few instances is more powerfully recommended by the occasion than the present. If our voluminous & entangled accts. be not put into some certain course of settlemt. before a foreign war is off our hands it is easy to see they must prove an exuberant & formidable source of intestine dissentions.

Allen, Fay & Curtis are here, a large comtee. of Congress sat almost every day last week.(2) On Saturday we sat from 11 to 3 of Clock and finally after much debate concluded to recommend to Congress to make one more offer to Vermont equal to that in Augt. last which you have seen. And to send them an agent to explain and inforce it: with this alternative that unless they comply; it shall be recommended to New Hampre. & N York to divide them at the heighth of land & to pass acts of indemnity & confirm the grants made by Vermont in cases of no prior grant, also to confirm the grants of NH. & NY, under certain equtable conditions, so as to make all partys easy, as far as possible. I confess I like this, in case they will not comply with the Resolutions of Augt last. But whether congress will agree to this or any thing else I know not. It will be opposed by one party that would make them independent on no Condition at all: and by another that would indulge them in every thing they can ask to the ruin of NH & NY both.

We have no proof his going into N.Y. as your letter says.(3)  Enquiry shall be made about the fortune of your tickets and sent as soon as possible.

And when they are satisfied that we have not only viewed the Subject as they do; but also have used all the Endeavors that we could to get Congress to adopt some Plan which would give them Relief we confidently beleive that we shall at least be acquitted of any criminal Negligence.  By examining the Journals of Congress it will appear that the Letter from the Committee of our Legislature upon that Subject was immediately laid before Congress & committed.(1) The Committee reported; that Report was referred to the Financier, from whom we have never been able to get a Report in Point; tho' he apprehends that we have. His Report which is for a general & final Settlement of the Accounts of the several States with the united States might possibly answer the Purpose. This has been debated & committed several Times & is now with a Committee of thirteen. It is attended with a great many Difficulties & perhaps the pressing Call for a general Liquidation of Accounts will only induce us finally to agree to any Plan to be recommended to the States for their Approbation: There is not a State represented in Congress who are not fully sensible that this Adjustment concerns them very nearly. They are therefore very attentive and critical about it. The Financier perhaps from the best of Reasons, is determined upon a final Adjustment to about the Time the Confederation was fully ratified & confirmed. That the Quotas of the respective States shall be ascertained from year to year so that the Adjustment once made shall never be called into view again. Whilst the Requisitions of Congress have all gone out upon the Plan that in some future Time an Adjustment of FEBRUARY 12, 1782  Quotas should be made, it affords every State an Opportunity of saying & probably of beleiving that their Quota is too great And will have a great Tendency to prevent the Necessary Exertions to comply with the Requisitions which otherwise would be made if the Quotas were not to be varied from. I am of Opinion that this will place the Financier upon better Ground than he now stands-And if he is not, in other Respects besides this, the bad Consequences will be numerous & very dangerous.  Is it possible upon the present Mode of supplying the Army which I am perswaded will not be so expensive by nearly one half, as heretofore, that the Financier should remain in his Office long, if there is not an absolute Certainty in the Funds on which he places his whole Dependence; otherwise his own Credit as well as the Impossibility of his answering the Expectations of the public, or of Individuals will oblige him to leave his Office. An Event which I hope will not take Place at least till the War is closed. This Office well managed & supported is one of the cardinal Points on which the Independence of America depends.  For Want of Time I must omit Observing any Thing farther till the next Post When I will do myself the Pleasure to write you more fully as to the old Currency & the Request of Congress that they may be empowered to Levy a Duty of 5 per Ct.(2) Massachusetts not having complyed with this, prevents in a Measure the Relief in the Case of old Money. At present I am very doubtful whether the Constitution will admit the Legislature to comply fully with that Recommendation .  I am Dear Sir, very respectfully, your most humble Servant, Samuel Osgood  ""

  Dear Doctr. Philadelphia Feby 14th 1782 The Spanish fleet have at length left the Havanna. By advices from Cadiz of the 17th Octo, three ships of the line had arrived there, they left the fleet by order of the Commander about 100 Leagues to the Eastward of Bermudas. The Treasure on Board this fleet is Computed to between 22 & 23 Millions of Dollars-a Considerable Expedition was preparing at Brest, and at Cadiz were also preparations made, to embark 4000 Troops, destined probably for the Conquest of Jamaica. The Seige of Fort St Philips would Shortly Commence, the french Troops sent to Minorca were probably Ar- FEBRUARY 14, 1782  rived, and when Joined to those of the Spaniards, the army would Amount to 20,000 men, yet it was thought the Seige would be long and very important. The disturbances in Spanish America were Excited by the imposition of heavy Duties, the manner of Collecting them, and the great number of officers appointed for that purpose. The defeat and Capture of the Chief Insurgents in Peru, had Scarcely quieted the Apprehensions of the Court, when advices were received, that the Inhabitants of Santafe, had taken Arms, and maltreated many of the Kings Officers, but they have been in some measure Appeased, by the promisses of their Bishop, to procure the abolition of offices and Duties, which have been Complyed with. The Court of Spain have nominated a person to Treat with Mr. Jay, which may be looked upon as a tacit Acknowledgement of that Gentlemans public Character-this being done previous to their being Acquand. with the Capture of Cornwallis And his Army, and our other Important Successes, the last Campaign, Shews a friendly disposition, and when the glorious advantages we have gained over the Enemy, Comes to their Knowledge, it will in all probability urge them to a speedy decission in our favour. The republican party Continues to gain ground in Holland-they are makeing great Efforts to have a formidable fleet the next Campaign. Their Stadtholder will probably be obliged to Consent to the Augmentation of the Marine, without insisting on increasing the Land force which he has hitherto done-it may still be feared, the disunion in that republic will prevent its openly Avowing the Independance of America untill it is Acknowledged by Spain. A general negotiation for peace is at presant but little talked of in Europe. Britain has refused the Mediation of the Courts of Prussia and Vienna in favour of Holland. This may not prove unfavourable to us. The horrid, Cruel, and unjust treatment the Dutch have met with from the English, Compaired with the generous behavour of the French in restoreing to them, the Islands of Statia and St Martins which the English had so meanly wrested from them, must if they have the least Idea of national honor, if they have a Single Spark of resentment, or possess the least degree of gratitude, make them hold the one in abhorence and incline them strongly in favour of the other; and I have great hopes, if we act with Vigor the next Campaign to improve the Advantages we have gained over the Enemy in the last, our Independance will in the Course of a few months be Acknowledged by both Spain & Holland.  A Vessel is just Arrived here from the West Indias by her we have the agreeable intelligence of the French haveing landed on the 12th ult. a Body of Troops on the Island of St Kitts-that the Inhabitants immediately Capitulated, but that the Troops of the Enemy had retired to the Castle, on Brimstone hill, about 1500 men-that Count de Grasse with 30 or 32 Sail of the line was in possession of  the Harbour-that he had taken there upwards of 100 Sail of Vessels-that the British fleet Consisting of only 22 Sail of the line, was too weak to attempt any thing for the relief of the Castle, which it was Expected woud not be able to hold out long-this Account is not only given by the Capt. of the above Vessel but is Confirmed by letters, particularly by one from a french officer at Martinique to a french Gentleman of distinction in this place.(1)  I received yours by Capt Richardson and am this day favoured with one of the 3d Instant by the post-nothing Could have given me greater pleasure than the information it Contains respectg your health. I have got Doctrs. Morgan and Jones's Opinions on your Case (no abscess they think)-the old walnut Tree has not delivered me His.

Neds Tools are in his Chest which may be broke open if you think it best to set him to work-but I should be inclined to Sell him if a good price Can be had (£200). Perhaps Lawrance Oneal would be glad to purchase him as it would be a means of Contenting his wench Neds wife.

  My Dr. Sir, Philadelphia Febry 18. 1782. I recd your Favour per Post, and am obliged to you for your Care of my little affairs. I know of no way of estimating the Hay in the Barn, but getting my old Friend Judge Staples & Mr Rickey to adjudge what they think it will hold out.  I know not what to say about your proposal relating to Johnny. I fear it is too late in the Day for him to think of dragging out five long Years at the Study of the Law, wch must be done before he can get a Licence-unless he can get a Diploma & then it will deduct but one Year from that Number. It can do him no harm to spend his time this winter in reading the 3d Vol of Blackstone, which may be of service to him in any Profession whatever-but I doubt not the Spring will bring both of you to this City. I have no hope of Peace under two Years at least, and then it is uncertain.  We are advised this day, that the Spanish Fleet of 41 Sail of the Line & 16 Frigates with 4000 Troops sailed on the 3d Janry. from Cadiz. They were to cruize in Lattitude of Madeira till they were joined by Count de Guichen who sailed on the 11th Decr from Brest with 19 Sail of the Line & 15000 Men. The destination of this Armament is a secret, but generally supposed to be the west Indies & America. It is reported that the Count has had a Battle with 13 English Ships under Admiral Kempenfelt previous to his junction with the Spanish-the Issue not known. 6000 Hanoverians coming out early in the Spring.  I wrote you concerning the taking of St. Kitts by Capt Shaler.(1) Since which, we are advised that Count de Grass has engaged Sir Saml.

10729,dg018346,1782,South Carolina Delegates to John Rutledge,"""South Carolina Delegates to John Rutledge
  Sir, Philadelphia, 18 July [i.e. February] 1782(1) We wrote you on the 27 ulto. by Mr. Hall from which we have not received any of your Excellency's favors nor had any direct accounts from Carolina.  The Governor of Virginia about 10 days ago transmitted to Congress the copy of a letter of the 27th Dec. from Genl. Green to him,(2) informing of his having received accounts from Charleston of a large reinforcement they expected there from and New York and calling on every one for assistance which he says they have it not in their power to furnish-this intelligence was referred to a Committee of Congress who had several conferences with the Commander-in-Chief and the result has been to order in all the levies from this State southwardly as fast as possible together with the Duke De Louzon's Legion of French troops-this last to halt on the War Oak and wait Genl. Green's further directions, the superintendent of Finance has engaged to furnish a supply of corn and salt. We flatter ourselves that the General will still be able to keep possession of the Country as the enforcement from New York did not exceed 700 men and by the last advices from England no troops had sailed from there tho it was said a reinforcement of five regiments would go out in the spring-this being previous to the news of Cornwallis capture reaching there, we hope that, together with subsequent events in the West Indies will prevent further succour going to Carolina. We hoped much to have the French troops or a part of them to join Genl. Green, but could not succeed the Genl. says. Count Rochambeau's orders are not to divide his infantry, and the sending, on the whole, would break in upon plans already fitted for the ensuing campaign which would be entirely deranged thereby- but this at the particular desire of the Genl. should not be made  FEBRUARY 18, 1782  publick. We have no official advices from Europe later than the Eighteenth October and these contain nothing material, no reply had been then given by the mediateing power to the answers of the courts of France and Spain accepting their offer of mediation nor had they received accts. of any answers being given by the Council of London to said Offer at that time. It was supposed they waited to know the event of the campaign-the siege of Minorca still continued but that of Gibraltar was considerably [ .... ]  The fleets had returned to their respective ports, and a large amount of 10 or 12 Sail of the Line and from 8 to 10000 troops sailed from Brest the beginning of December to join Count de Grass in the West Indies, they were not arrived when the last advices were dated viz the 22nd Jany tho daily expected. Nevertheless the Count had sailed with his whole force and taken possession of St. Kitts except one post on Brimstone Hill which was invested and was thought could not hold out long. The Count had 30 Sail of the Line with him and Admiral Hood with 19 Sail of British was at Barbadoes. When the reinforcement from France arrives, he will have a force sufficient to crush the remaining power of the British in that quarter And whether they will still help their garrison of New York and Charlestowne doing nothing, and leave their West Indies possessions at the mercy of the French and Spaniards time alone must evince.  In consequence of your Excellency's letter of the 22nd day of November last we gave notice to our fellow citizens of the provisions ordered for such of them as would immediately proceed to Carolina and draw orders on Mr. Ross in favor of Doct. Rudd, Messrs Hall and Muirhead for 200 dollars cash (payable at 4 months sight by Mr. Ross' desire) which he accepted. A few days after we drew on him in favor of several more which to our great surprise he refused accepting. Since this a number of others have applied but as Mr. Ross says he is largely in advance already, and cannot sell any of the Indigo but at a great loss-we have stopped our Draughts. This has been a great disappointment to a number of our unfortunate countrymen who being without the means of subsistence were preparing to return home, and are now in the greatest distress how to act, or in what way to support their families. We mentioned to Mr. Ross your having signified to us that he would advance a sum out of monies he ought to have of yours in his hands but his reply was that he had not a shilling on that account. As we suppose he has wrote fully on the subject we doubt not he will explain to your Excellency the motives for his conduct which we wish may be satisfactory.  Several passengers who sailed with Commodore Gillon from Holland, are arrived at Boston, they say when they left Spain he was preparing to sail again and they imagined he put to sea in Decbr. This day is fixed on by Congress for taking up again the affair of  Vermont when we expect it will be finally determined whether or not they are to be declared an Independent State and received into the Union. This we mean to oppose as greatly detrimental to our State by weakening the Southern Interest and throwing too great a weight into the opposite scale. We are in daily expectation of advices from Europe which we shall not fail to communicate by the earliest opportunity.  We are with great respect Sir, Your Ex Most ob serv.  ""

  My Dr Brother Philadelphia Febry 20t 1782 I wrote you some time since but have not heard from you since I left home. There having been an entire dearth of News, otherwise should have wrote you oftner. We have lately been advised that Count de Grass has taken Possession of St. Kitts. The Garrison have taken to the Fortress on Brimstone Hill. It is supposed the Enemy must have capitulated before this.  We are also informed that a large Spanish Fleet consisting of 41 Ships of the Line & 16 Frigates & 4000 Men have sailed from Cadiz-19 Ships of the Line & 15000 Men from Brest, both to join in the latitude of Madeira.  I imagine the Truth is, that 19 Ships from France & 15000 Men are actually sailed for the West Indies-That 4000 Men & 4 Men of war have sailed for the same Purpose from Cadiz-That these last FEBRUARY 20, 1782  have been escorted to a certain Lattitude by the Grand Fleet of Spain.  There is not the least prospect of Peace, or scarcely a possibility of it-on the other hand, every Measure is adopting in England to send over a large body of Hanoverians and some English Regimt. early in the Spring. The Com in Chief Expects the next Campaign is to be the most important of any that has been or will be in America this war-Alass! We are distressed with the languor & Inactivity of the States.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Feby. 20th. 1782 I postponed sending the Letter dated Feby. 12th being then doubtful whether it was best or even prudent for me to write at all upon that Subject or the several Matters herein mentioned as I have not had Time to weigh them well; But as I am sure of your Candour & that these Matters will rest with you alone, upon my particular Request, I hesitate no longer.  The Plan of the 18th of March, (which I think the Feelings of Massachusetts will not permit them to forget very soon) was productive of Burthens which your Citizens now groan under on Account of the old Currency. But there are three Ways by which the suffering Individuals might yet be releived-Tho I cannot flatter myself that either will be adopted at present. One is a Permission to Loan it. This the Financier will not consent to because he has no permanent Funds to discharge the Interest & you have not agreed to the Duty of five per Cent, till this is done all your Exertions will be considered in a different Point of Light from what they ought to be. FEBRUARY 20,1782  Portrait of Samuel Osgood FEBRUARY 20, 1782  The Second is Liberty to discharge the Requisitions of Congress. This probably would afford more immediate Relief than the other & I don't know how Congress could reject it if you should collect it for your Deficiencies on the past Requisitions excepting those for hard Money, it might possibly create some Difficulties but Congress has no compulsory Power over the State & I beleive they would finally do that which would be right respecting it. The third is, that the Resolutions of March 18th so far as they Respect calling in the old Money should be immediately complyed with by all the States therein mentioned. This alone seems at present to comport with the Ideas of the Financier. If Congress had any Authority at all & could enforce a Compliance from the delinquent States in any reasonable Time, it would be the most advantageous Relief to the present Holders of that Money. But you know their Authority. From all the Conversations I have had with the Financeir, I am perswaded he is most anxiously concerned that Justice should be done to the several States in the Settlement of their Accounts with the united States and that they should be adjusted as soon as possible. By his Letters to the State I think you approve in general of his Ideas respecting the Matter. His Situation is certainly very uncertain & precarious-we have either very little need of such an Officer; or it is, in Case he is needful, absolutely necessary to support him. If by the Confederation the several States are to feed, pay & Cloath their own Troops then the Office of a Financier cannot be of any great Consequence but if those matters are to be brot into a continental View the Office becomes exceedingly important & it requires great Consideration to know what is the most equal as well as sure Plan of supporting it. Congress have supposed, & the Financer is warm in the Opinion that it is a Duty on imported Articles. As yet Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, South Carolina & Georgia have not complyed with the Recommendation of Congress. The Necessity of adopting this Plan or some other seems to be very great when it is considered that there is no Kind of Certainty in the Requisitions. The Financier is so determined upon the Plan of a Duty that I apprehend he thinks it is impossible for him to continue in his Office unless it is complyed with. He espouses & maintains the Justice, Equality & Policy of the Plan with great Warmth yet as it is not a prerogative of Congress by the Confederation every State is at Liberty upon mature Deliberation to adopt or reject it as they may think expedient.  I am very unhappy to find that my Ideas do not coincide with the Financiers upon this important Matter. It has ever appeared to me that such a Kind of Tax would be far from operating equally when the Extensiveness of the Country is considered & their exceeding different Modes of living & supplying themselves. I would most willingly impute it to my contracted Notions of the Matter if I found Men of Discernment almost universally against me. The Certainty   of the Fund has appeared a much better Argument in Favor of the Duty, to me, than that drawn from its operating equally. If by equal is meant that every one should pay in Proportion to his real Ability surely they will not. I know it is said that a Duty of five per Cent will have no Tendency to raise the Price of Country Produce; but this is far from being certain & should it be otherwise it would operate very unequally in the State in which it is collected as well as between the united States. But it is said the Consumer finally pays it. This is undoubtedly true. But do not those who live in Cities & Seaport Towns generally consume of imported Articles three to one more than People that live in the Country & of equal Ability. And even in Cities do not Men of very large Fortunes live like Misers? Ought they to be placed in a Situation that they may almost entirely escape Taxation? If a Miser's Hoards are very dear to him why should he pay less for the Protection of them than other Men? But it is said this Kind of Tax is paid insensibly & voluntarily, & that the Experience of other Countries teaches us that it is the best Mode as it excites the least Uneasiness in the Community at large: That this is good Evidence as to the Wisdom & Equity of the Mode. However plausible this Argument may appear it is not in my Opinion conclusive; because it is found necessary to enforce the Collection & payment of this Tax to have very severe Penalties. And notwithstanding the Action or Payment is voluntary it is no greater Evidence of the Chearfulness with which it is done-Than it is an Evidence of the Goodness of a Mans Intentions who to avoid the disagreeable Confinement of a Goal voluntarily takes an Oath of Allegiance to a Sovereign that he would not otherwise acknowledge. Where a Person has but a Choice of Difficulties he necessarily chooses that which appears to him the least. But granting that it is a certain & expeditious Way of collecting & upon the whole tolerably equal-Is it certain that this Mode is best adapted to promote the present & future Welfare of a free People? Will the Monies arising therefrom be so well accounted for as when a known & certain Sum is called for from the People, have not the Laws to enforce the Payment thereof always been evaded in numberless Instances by Men who would not like to be called dishonest in other Respects; yet they are not so sensible of moral or political Obligation in this Matter as to prevent their evading of it with a safe Conscience if they can do it with Safety to their Interests. It has a Tendency to habituate the People to the Idea of Bribery & Corruption for they have & ever will be practiced with great Ingenuity where Interest is so nearly concerned. But if it should finally be tho't expedient to comply would it not be wise that some Articles should pay a much heavier Duty than others. But, perhaps there may be one Matter to be settled which did not occur to me till now, before any Arguments need be adduced in Favor of, or against the Question; That is whether by the Constitution the Gen-  eral Assembly is vested with Power to grant this Duty & that it shall be placed to the Credit of the united States in the first Instance. I am doubtful whether they have any such Authority upon a fair Construction of the Paragraph that Respects Imports & Duties & the Appropriation of the Money arising therefrom.  If this is no Hindrance I have another objection which I wish to have fairly weighed. It is this, in Case all the States agree to it & the Payment & Collecting of the Duty is enforced by Ordinances of Congress-What Assurance has one State in the Union that the Laws will be alike & equally executed & if not where is the Power of Compulsions will Congress have any or the States that are injured but an Appeal to Arms? For Instance if an officer is appointed to collect the Duty in Massachusetts we must be sensible that the Ingenuity of hundreds will be employed to Bribe him as well as to evade the Law entirely. In Case of Complaint where & by what Court is the Tryal to [be] had?-undoubtedly within the State & by the Judicial Authority thereof. But will not the whole State be a Party against the other States? & is it not possible that they may be very deeply interested in the Decission so that a fair one can scarcely be had? Will not the State whose Trade shall apparently encrease be ever suspected of conniving at & secretly favoring a Breach of the Law? The States being free & independent Sovereignties will naturally be Jealous of each other & this may possibly be a direct Means of encreasing it. It is said that Farming out the Duty will prevent any Difficulty of this Kind-But I am not certain that it will. If there is great Probability that the Difficulty which I have started will take Place, for the sake of Justice let us deprecate a Repetition of the 18th of March or something worse.  I am very much in Favor of permanent & certain Funds. They must be established, or if the War is continued our Union, Independence & every Thing relative thereto after all the Blood & Treasure we have lavished to support them will be in very great Danger of being lost entirely. It is apprehended that another Campaign will determine us to be free & independent States if we exert our Selves properly, a due Proportion of which Exertion I have no doubt but Massachusetts will make notwithstanding all the Difficulties she labours under.  I think it is absolutely necessary that you should inform Congress as soon as possible that you agree to the Duty as recommended or that you do not-or that you will only agree to it conditionally, provided the State is credited for the Amount of the Duty.  Thus have I with Freedom opened my Sentiments, pray let them not rise up in Judgment against me.  I am, Sir, with great Respect, Your most humble Servant,  Samuel Osgood   N.B. I have enclosed a late Letter of the Financiers to Congress.(1) I was obliged to Copy it very hastily I cannot assure you it is perfectly correct. As Congress may possibly agree to forward this Letter to the States it may probably be better to keep it safe: & as the Subject Matter is also before Congress. I have also enclosed an Act of the State of Delaware for your perusal.(2) This you will see was lately pass'd.  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, Feby. 20th, 1782. Nothing of importance hath passed Congress since we last had the honour of addressing your Excellency.(1)  The affair of Vermont; a plan for settling the accounts between the several states and the individuals thereof with the United States; an amendment of the ordinance concerning captures on water; instructions to captains of private armed vessels; measures for effectually bringing into port and securing sea-prisoners, in order to exchange them for our unhappy fellow-citizens condemned to loathsom prison-ships, and for their comfortable support and accommodation on shore; a report for establishing a mint, and a circular letter to the States, founded on communications from Europe and a letter from the Superintendent of Finance, are upon the carpet. When Congress shall have decided thereon your Excellency will be seasonably furnished with their decisions.  We take this earliest opportunity to transmit to your Excellency the Speech of the British King; on which we take leave to make this single observation; that although it is as temperate as might be expected; yet it appears that he is determined to prosecute the war.(2)  We heartily congratulate with you on our allies having taken FEBRUARY 20, 1782  possession of the Island of St. Christophers, and hoping that we shall soon have occasion to rejoice with you on their further success, we are, with the highest sentiments of respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. servants, William Ellery  Ezekiel Cornell ""

I fear tricks are played with my Letters at Baltimore-you had best write to Miss Goddart about it. I am happy to hear you Continue to mend-have waited till now in Expectation that Capt Richardson would Call on me on his return, by whom I thought it would be Safer to send the Doctrs. Opinions, than by the post-but I suppose he is gone without thinking it worth while to Call on me. You now have them inclosed and wish they may be Satisfactory-but I hope you will Continue your present plan, as you have found so much benefit by it. Do with Ned Barnes as you please. Boyer is not I am pursuaded to be softend, if He thinks Circumstances puts it in his power to Exact-dont indulge him-if he prosecutes and should be able to get Evidence to Convict him, I should make no doubt, for Such an offence, of procuring a pardon-it may not be amiss to Satisfy Ned that he is in no danger. I have not the least inclination to purchase Mr Bowles's Hand. Sall I am pursuaded will be very easy without him-if she wants to be Sold I have no objection to let Mr Bowles have her, at £100 (not less). Bond on Interest for the money will do. I observe Mr Lee, Mr Addison, and J Hanson, have Advertised their negroes for Sale. I was Surprised at it. I did not Know the motive, And wish their plan may Succeed. If there was no other risque, than that of the goods they may purchase, falling before they Coud be disposed of, on Account of peace takeing place, they would be perfectly Safe-be assured there is no prospect of that Event takeing place dureing this year-nor Shall we have peace in my Opinion untill we Can drive the Enemy from N york & Charles Town. You will See Some Account in the papers of An Action between the French and British fleets off St Kitts, which is all we have yet received. Various are the Conjectures as to the Issue, for my  FEBRUARY 23, 1782  part I am Strongly inclined from the great Superiority of the French to Conclude, that they have gained the Advantage. In a few days it is probable we Shall have the particulars in Such Away, as may be depended on-if the Action has proved favourable on our Side. St. Kitts must be in the hands of the French before this time. A 's news with Respect to Detroit is absurd, no French Force has ever been imployed against it.

  Dear Sir Philada. Feby. 25th. 1782 The irregularity of the post has again left me two of your favrs. to acknowledge at once, the first of which is of the 28th Ultimo & the other of the 11th instant. My two last it seems have miscarried altogether. (1)  You have been misinformed I find with respect to that article in the scheme of the bank which claims for it the exclusive privilege of issuing circulating notes. It is true Congress have recommended to the States to allow it such a privilege, but it is to be continued only during the present war. Under such a limitation it was conceived FEBRUARY 25, 1782  both necessary to the success of the scheme, & consistent with the policy of the several States; it being improbable that the collective credit & specie of the whole wd. support more than one such institution, or that any particular State wd. during the war stake its credit anew on any paper experiment whatever.  We have letters from Cadiz as late as the 7 of Jany which impart that a Spanish fleet composed of 41 Sail of the line sailed from that port on the 3d of the same month which had under their convoy transports with 4000 troops supposed to be destined for the Havanna. It was said the fleet was to cruize off Madiera & to await the junction of the Ct. de Guichen who had sailed from Brest on the 11th of December with 19 ships of the line convoying 15,000 troops wch. with a part of the fleet it was supposed would also proceed for the W. Indies. It was reported however that an action, the issue of wch. was unknown, had taken place between de Guichen and a British squadron of 13 Ships under Admiral Kempenfeldt. This it was apprehended might disconcert the arrangement with the Spaniards. Nothing definitive had happened at Minorca, but the reports continued to be flattering.  The fate of Brimstone Hill the only remaining post on St. Kitts is not yet known here. A flag which came in a few days ago, with prisoners from Antigua confirms a preceding rumor of an engagement between Hood & de Grasse the former of whom had made an essay to relieve St. Kitts. An Antigua paper labours to make it probable that Hood had succeeded & that the French had lost a ship of the line, but the private information reverses the probability. The next post I hope will remove the uncertainty in which this must leave you.  The inclosed papers will at length gratify you with the Speech of the British King & the address of the two Houses of Parliament. The debates to which they must have given birth are either not arrived at N. York or they are backward in publishing them. The amendment proposed to the Address in the Upper House could not well fail to have produced an interesting skirmish between the oratorial combatants.  The Gentleman from this place(2) who reported the certain evacuation of N. York was an impudent liar. There has not existed here a whisper to palliate his offense.

  Sir Phila. 25th February 1782  We have your Excellencys favor of the 9th of this month.(1) Since our last the plan for the final settlement of the public accounts from the commencement of the War to the 1st of January 1782, which we formerly mentioned to be under consideration has been adjusted and agreed to by Congress and will be fully explained to your Excellency by the superintendant of finance to whose department it properly belongs.(2) The want of the rule prescribed by the articles of Confederation and which from the particular situation of some of the States could not now be obtained rendered the adoption of any mode very difficult. The one proposed when the variety of circumstances and interests to be combined upon the occasion are considered will perhaps be found as free from exception as any that could be devised and will it is to be hoped meet the approbation of the States.  We have reason to believe it has not proceeded from partiality to the Eastern and Middle States that contracts for the southern department have not been proposed, as previous to the receipt of your Letter we had shewn attention to this business, and found the Financier disposed to take that course for supplying the southern department so soon as Taxes were laid and likely to be collected in those States to enable him to comply with such engagements as he should enter into for that purpose. If any preference appears to have been given to the State of Pennsylvania in the benefit of Contracts we are assured it has proceeded from the money supplied by that State to enable the superintendant of Finance to fullfil them. This money was supplied in commutation for the specific requisitions due to the united States. It may with truth be said that the States as Virga. which supplied the specifics did their duty as much as Pennsylvania wsh.  commuted for money, but unhappily the latter mode only has put into the hands of the superintendant the means of fullfiling future contracts.(3) We must beg leave to refer to the inclosed paper for the news and are very respectfully, Sr., yr.

I omitted writing to your Excellency by last post Expecting that before this day Congress would have Come to Some determination on the Vermont Business, and that I might by Now, have been able to have given you fully the Sense of Congress on that Subject. But notwithstanding every Effort which Mr. Scott and myself have been FEBRUARY 26, 1782  able to make, we have not been able to bring it to a Question. The Report has been fully Debated and I believe that Nothing Now Can be said for, or against the Report, but yet we Cannot Get the Question. The Reasons as I imagine which hinders are, that there being Seven if not Eight States, for giving them Independance within their original Claime, and as it is one of those Questions which Requires nine States; they are puting it of in Expectation of Obtaining one or more in their favour. Your Excellencys Letter of the 5th Instant (1) with the Intelligence from New York Came to hand in time, Even while we had the Matter under Consideration which I Read to the house, and which Corresponded Exactly with what we had Recd. from new York through another Channel; this put it out of Doubt in the mind of Every Gentleman in Congress that they have Entered into Such Treaty, but those who wish to befriend these Traytors to their Country, Endeavour to Extenuate their guilt by Saying that they only meant to Deceive the Enemy and that nothing Real was Intended.(2)  The Difference between us in Congress on this Question is, whether We Shall again offer these people Independance or not. 7 or 8 States are for the Question, yet I believe there are so many Opposed to it that they will not be able to get nine States. Under these Circumstances I am afraid that Nothing Effectuall will be Done very Soon.  We have no late accounts from Genl.

  Sir, Philadelphia, 1st March 1782. It is the pleasure of Congress that I inform your Excellency and the Council of Massachusetts, that matters of public concern and the pressing necessity of making provision for the ensuing campaign have hitherto prevented them from attending to a subject, which, though it respects an Individual, may have an influence on the public affairs of these United States.(1)  The suspicions and Jealousies excited by Mr. John Temple's return to America in 1778, and the Reports currently circulated in England relative to his Mission, are notorious. The time and manner of his coming to America, as well as the person accompanying him, who is now resident in, and a subject of Great Britain, gave great force to the suspicions then raised. These suspicions instead of being allayed were increased by Mr. Temple's return to England, and by the rumours and publications respecting his intercourse and conferences with the British Ministry. His coming again to America, without explaining his views and, as far as is come to the knowledge of Congress, without any leave previously obtained, and this at the very time when the enemy entertained the fond hope of having subdued the Southern States, cannot fail to excite new Jealousies and a suspicion of his being employed as an Emissary from the British Crown.  I am directed further to inform your Excellency and the Council, that, although Mr. Temple was the Bearer of some letters from the honorable John Adams, at Amsterdam, yet the subject of the letters with which he was intrusted and of those which Mr. Adams chose to send at the same time by another conveyance, sufficiently evince that he had not the full confidence of that Minister; and that the letter which Mr. Adams took the trouble of writing respecting Mr. Temple did in no wise account for his past conduct or explain his future views or designs. Therefore, as the United States ought to be  MARCH 2,1782  on their guard, as well against the secret arts as open force of their subtle and inveterate enemy, it is the wish of Congress that your Excellency and the Council would enquire strictly into the conduct, views and designs of Mr. Temple, and, if you are not fully convinced of the uprightness of his intentions, or if you have any apprehensions that he has, in his visits to America, been countenanced or employed by, or has acted in concert with, the British Ministry or their Agents, that you take such measures respecting him, as may put it out of his power to injure the cause of these United States.  Such is the evident magnitude and importance of the investigation above recommended, and so essential is it to the happiness and political salvation of the Citizens of these States that the secret machinations of our enemy be guarded against, that I rest asured your Excellency's and the Council's attention will, without delay, be directed to this necessary business.

Which sum he was so kind as to advance: and at the same time told me he had a letter from Col Langdon, informing him that my former bills wd. not be paid untill midsummer. I confess it gave me some anxiety for myself, as drawer of the bills, and some (but this I Leave you to judge of) as a member of that state on which the bills were drawn. I wish some meathod could have been hit upon to have satisfied Mr Langdon without exposing our poverty to so great a degree. And that my bills may meet with such payment as will not dishonour the state. But as the subject is painfull to me, to dwell on, and will doubtless be so to you, I shall proceed to the old story of Vermont, and that is worn a little thread-bare. Yesterday, after several days debate on the subject, a resolution was passed to strike out of the report of the Comtee.

Thus we cannot make them independent: we cannot obtain a Vote to reduce them to Subjection to any of the Claiming States. The natural Inference seems to be that they must remain as they now are if they are contented to be so. I wish the Consequences may not be dangerous  You will find that Congress have come to a determination on the Report respecting Mr. Temple,(3) which has been postponed from Time to Time, as you well know.  We have recd. no Kind of Intelligence respecting him & could not with much Reason request a farther Delay. I have in a former Letter requested you to inform me of his Situation with Respect to the MARCH 2, 1782  Government & I doubt not I shall by the next Post receive some Anecdotes from you on this Head.  Mr. Bond informed me this Day that the Journals of Congress for last Year are printed to September last & that the Printer is going on rapidly. This is a Matter of great Consequence to Congress as well as the States-as we are frequently at a Loss to know what we have done. Tho we may possibly by the Assistance of Charles,(4) get at a Knowlege of it, yet the States are totally in the Dark; where perhaps some of our Resolves ever ought to remain.

  Sir Pha. March 4th. 1782 I did myself the pleasure of writing a few lines to you by last post, & inclosd a Letter to Mr Mullahon.(1) When he left this City, he informed me that from the Considerable advances he had made to MARCH 4, 1782  the Maryland Delegates over and above the proceeds of the State Tobacco he found himself in such a Situation that he coud not return without some assistance, and I agreed to enter into a note with him for £167-payable in 30 days to a Mercht upon his promise to remit the money from Baltimore or Annapolis at farthest, and his engagement on his honor that the note shou'd not be discounted at the Bank. I have been exceedingly mortified in not hearing from him, and more so in being informd this evening that the Mercht to whom the note was given had discounted it at the Bank, & to morrow or next day I shall be calld upon to discharge it; The Consequence of a failure on my part will be that no note with my name to it will in future meet with a credit there. This will take the £100 Mr Morris is directed to pay me & every shilling I can raise, so that I shall remain without a farthing to pay my board, and several urgent demands upon me. I am realy sorry that the principal subject of my Letters should be on this disagreable to pick, but I am now reduced to the necessity of entreating you to have something done to releive me. Altho Mr. Mullahon has accounted to you for £595.12.4 by my receipt on my paying the £167 on his acct, there will be that sum Comeing to me for last year payable in Pha which I wish the Honble Council woud stop in his hands, if they can immediately supply me with an order here for the amt, or that [you] will send this letter with a few lines to Major Jennifer who writes to me that he was to set out for St. Marys, that he may do the needful with Mullahon-at any rate under these circumstances yr Excellency and the Council will I flatter myself see the necessity [ . . . ] of furnishing me with a further supply, at least for [what] is due for the present year, if it cannot be done on [ . . . ] last years Accts.

  Sir,(1) Philadelphia March 4th 1782.(2) We have not been honor'd with any of your favours since the 22d Novr. last-nor have we receiv'd any Advices from Carolina which may be depended on, either respecting the Proceedings of the Legislature, or the Operations of the Army since General Greene moved down the Country, & forced the Enemy to evacuate their Post at Dorchester; We cannot but be anxious on both those Subjects, at a period so critical to the Interests of our Country, and are in daily Expectation of Intelligence, which we flatter ourselves will prove agreeable. It is with pleasure we acquaint you of our having, after much uneasiness on his Account, receiv'd a Letter from Commodore Gillon, dated the 30th January, informing us of his Arrival at the Havanna on the 13th with five Prizes of Considerable Value. He incloses Inventories of the Cargoes &ca and a Letter for your Excellency. We have answer'd his Letter & shall send Copies by the earliest Oppertunties from hence. We have advized him to the best of our Judgments, and according to our Ideas of the management which would be most advantageous to the Country as it is at present circumstanced; We inclose you Copies of our Letters to him, & hope will meet with approbation.  Congress have had Accounts, through a good Channel, of the sailing of 19 Transports from NYork on the 18th ulto. under Convoy of the Lion of 64 & the Rotterdam of 50 Guns. They were said to be bound for Charles Town; various Conjectures are formed of the Intention of the Enemy by this manoeuvre; some suppose they MARCH 4, 1782  mean to evacuate the Southern Posts, & to remove the Garrisons back to New York, as it is reported they are building additional Barracks there, and the Transports were dispatch'd empty, immediately upon the arrival of the Narcissus from England; we cannot flatter ourselves with any thing so favourable to our wishes as the Evacuation of Chs. Town, a Circumstance which would be very agreeable, tho' not equally so with that of their being disgraced by Capture in a Country so long harrass'd by their cruel & iniquitous proceedings. We are rather apprehensive that their design is to remove the Slaves & valuable property they may have collected, to some place of supposed greater security, as they must have reason to conclude that a Cooperation of our Ally is not improbable, in which Case a Fate similar to that of Cornwallis must be expected by them, & tho' they cannot save themselves, they may wish to make sure of their Plunder-a short time will discover their Views.  In our last we mention'd our Difficulties with respect to Mr Ross & the Indigo;(3) they still continue, & many of our Countrymen are much distress'd, which gives us a good deal of uneasiness, as we have no private funds to supply their Necessities, nor any prospect of obtaining them Assistance elsewhere. We earnestly request to hear from you upon this subject as soon as possible. We contriv'd to obtain a Loan of 200 Dollars for Mess. Wm. & Stephen Lee, (who were about to set off in a most distress'd Situation), by pledging our Names for the repayment of the money in Two months; We are well dispos'd to contribute every possible aid to our fellow Citizens, but this is a mode which our Circumstances do not permit us to repeat.  Reports are circulated here, & carry the face of probability, that the French are in entire possession of the Island of St. Kitt's, & that in a Sea Engagement the British lost 3 Ships, & the French one, we daily look for a Confirmation, & hope to hear that the Forces of our Allies are pursuing the blow, & making a rapid progress in that Quarter. Admiral Rodney was to sail from England in Decemr. with 10 ships of the Line to reinforce Admiral Hood in the West Indies, but we trust they will not arrive time Enough to embarrass the proceedings of the French. Congress have acceeded to the proposal of the Exchange of Lord Cornwallis, upon certain Conditions, among them That of the Liberation of Col. Laurens-we used our Endeavours to prevent his Lordship's Exchange, but without Effect. You will have heard of the Exchange of Genl. Moultrie, & Col. Pinckney before this reaches you.  An Attempt has been again made to have Vermont declared independent, & admitted into the Union; but it receiv'd a Negative- only 6 states voted for it. We have No further News foreign or domestic; nor has any thing in a publick Line Occur'd.worthy of Communication.  We are, &Ca.  MARCH 5, 1782  P.S. Since writing the above respecting Commodore Gillon, Captain Jackson is arrived here, who transmits Col. John Laurens by this Conveyance a particular Acct. of his, Commodore Gillon's Transactions, which if true appear to us of a very serious nature, and require Explanation. We submit whether a fast sailing Vessel, (if to be got) being dispatched from George Town to the Havannah will not be the most expeditious way of forwarding your Orders to Commodore Gillon.  ""

  My dear Madam. Philadelphia March 5th 1782 It was not among the smallest Pleasures received by a Letter from Graeme Park, that my good Mrs. Ferguson was satisfied with the reasons assigned for my disappointing her at so critical a period. It gave me real uneasiness to find that you failed in the intended Sale, (1) not because I think the Consequences will prove very disagreeable, but because I know you had set your heart on it, and I do not wish to have the smallest addition to the Afflictions of the Afflicted.  I cannot possibly approve of any Sale that will separate the long House from the Mansion House, unless it should be during the Time necessary for the Purchaser's building a proper farm House. I have spoke to Mr. Meade, and we mean to insert the substance of your Advertisement in the Books of the Several Land-brokers in this City. Many People who are Speculating apply to these offices, who never look at a News Paper. If this wont do, another attempt about the first of Aprill to sell at Vendue perhaps may answer the Purpose-tho' as I shall then be in Jersey it would suit me best about the Twenty fourth of March. This is supposing a Sale to be necessary. But would it not be a better Scheme to get some friend to undertake the leasing out the farm, with proper Covenants and restrictions, for a number of years, subject to all Taxes. I think this would fix your Income to a certainty and secure your Capital during Life. If you wanted a principle sum for to discharge arrears, this certainly may be raised by collateral methods, which would not injure the Capital or render your future Subsistence uncertain or MARCH 5, 1782  subject to diminution. But as I determine to see you if possible before many weeks, I shall defer the Subject.  The enclosure of Mr. Young's Letter gave me great Pleasure, as it was at once a further Evidence of the friendship & confidence of my amiable friend. I greatly pity this young Gentleman and heartily wish he had followed the solid advice of his valuable Aunt, who certainly judged very rightly of his affairs, but I still hope his apparent good sense will yet enable him to surmount all his difficulties & strike out into some important Scene of Life. To avoid the Stage would be an evidence of his Judgment & Prudence, as it can promise him no good unless his abilities were uncommonly great, and even then the substantial reward is inadequate to the risque of every other good.  My dear Miss Stedman is very obliging to be grateful for a remembrance that yields so great a Pleasure in the Exercise. I was really elated during the reading of several Lines of your Letter, but alass! the Mountain brought forth a Mouse without a Metaphor.  Mrs. Jackson made me promise to make her acknowledgments for your politeness in remembering her slight civility to you when in Brunswick.  I must beg an Excuse for this scrawl, as I write with two or three Ladies chatting in the Room.  Mrs. Boudinot & Susan wish most earnestly to be considered as attached to the friendly Circle at the Park, and present their best wishes for every real happiness to attend them.  I am my dear Madam with the greatest respect & Sincerity.  Yours most Affectly Elias Boudinot.

  Sir, Philadelphia, March 5th. 1782. On Thursday the 14th last, Congress proceeded to a consideration of the Report of their Committee on the subect of the New Hampshire Grants, a copy whereof we have the honor to enclose you,(1) and for the purpose of shortening the debate they agreed to take up first in order the second resolution. Because the others evidently depended on it, and would necessarily in a great measure  MARCH 5, 1782  become nugatory, should that be negatived; it was debated till the adjournment of that day without putting the question, and resumed and debated again on Thursday last, and on the day following on a motion made by one of us, seconded by the other, for striking out the Resolution the question was put, shall the clause stand? On this question the yeas and nays were called for, and the State of them was as follows: to wit, New Hampshire unrepresented, Mr. Livermore for that State, No. Connecticut divided, not on principles agt. the independency held up by the clause, but because Mr. Wolcott, one of the Members wished, for obvious reasons, that the limits of the New Hampshire Grants should be undefined. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania (except Col. Atlee), Delaware and Maryland, Ay. The rest of the States-No. So that even had seven States been sufficient to carry the question in the Affirmative, the clause was necessarily lost. A motion was then made (with a view to substitute something in lieu of the rejected clause) for recommitting the residue of the report and on the yeas and nays being called for, the motion was lost. So that the Report stripped of its principal resolution yet lies before Congress; and will not we suppose be moved on again except by us, who intend shortly to prepare another set of resolutions for the introduction of which we must necessarily move for postponing the rest of the Report. The States who were with us in negativing the clause are strongly against declaring the independency of the Grants either on supposition of the want of authority in Congress so to declare them, on principles of political expedience, or because they conceive that the admission of the Grants as an Independent State into the federal Union would be prejudicial to the United States. What alteration may happen in the sentiments of those States from a change of members we cannot say. But to guard against such an event we shall endeavor to bring Congress to some final determination on this momentous subject as speedily as possible.(2) In the transactions above related Congress have fully evinced their Settled departure from the ground of submission established by their Resolutions of the 24th September, 1779, which exclude the interested States from voting. For upon no other principle could they have admitted New Hampshire and New York to a vote.  The Secretary for Foreign Affairs yesterday read to us a passage in a letter from a correspondent at Boston which positively asserts that General Sullivan had marched with 1000 men to reduce to obedience to their government the revolters on the East side of Connecticut River.(3) It were to be wished we could do the like on our part; and also fully inform the inhabitants of that territory of the secret overtures of Ira Allen and a few others to subject it to the Crown of Great Britain. This Allen confessed before the Committee of Congress in terms nearly in substance similar to the copy you did  us the honor to enclose to us; which, together with such parts of your letter as were proper to be made public we read in Congress; but he added to his confession that the overtures were only intended to prevent an expected inroad from Canada into their country.  Our most sanguine views will not flatter us with a hope that Congress can possibly be brought to any thing more than to give an express guarantee to us up to the 20 mile line and to New Hampshire to Connecticut River, and perhaps to support that guarantee by the arms of these United States. But this is doubtful. In this view it is evident that some State measure must be taken to secure the interjacent country. What we propose is, that the line of partition between us and New Hampshire, held up by one of the Resolutions in the Report, be settled by concurrent Acts of the two States. We are the more anxious for this measure, because as it will take nothing from us as a State which in point of soil or jurisdiction is worth our possessing, so it will add vastly in both to New Hampshire, and probably induce them to make common cause with us in reducing the revolters to obedience by arms. This measure we conceive may without breach of faith be adopted by the two States, as it is evident that Congress will not determine the controversy on the ground of submission held up by this aforesaid Resolution, and confirmed by the Acts of the two States. Be assured, Sir, that we shall be unwearied in our endeavors on this and every other subject to promote the interest of the State we have the honor to represent, and that we are, with the greatest respect your Excellency's most obedient humble servants, Jno. Morin Scott.  Wm. Floyd.  ""

  Dear Varick, Philadelphia, March 5th, 1782. The Secretary for foreign Affairs has on Leave, determined to go home for a few weeks. This Leave he obtained in a Letter to Congress, assigning three Reasons for his request, to wit, the sitting of the Legislature, the Business of the Court of Chancery, and the  MARCH 5, 1782  necessity of attending to his own private affairs.(1) On reading the Letter, many Members expressed their disapprobation of the 1st & 2d Reasons declaring that in their Opinions his Acceptance of his appointment under Congress had determined his Office as Chancellor. Unluckily I was balloted in as one of the Committee on the Letter, & being first in the order of Choice, was of course Chairman. Thus placed in a delicate situation, I determined to act frankly & candidly with Mr. Livingston. I accordingly at a private Interview with him on the subject, acquainted him with my Opinion as well as that of many of the other Members, upon which he requested that our report might be so framed as to pass over his 1st & 2d Reason unnoticed. This was accordingly done.(2)  I expect that on his Arrival at Poghkeepsie he will make a formal Resignation of the Chancellorship.(3) If he should not, the Council of Appointment may perhaps conceive the office already vacant, and proceed to a new appointment.  Tho' I have too much spirit to beg for an office; yet that same spirit will ever be mortified when I am slighted in the disposition of an office. I am the eldest in the profession; and yet the Office of Chancellor was heretofore given to another. I hope that in the next disposal of it, I shall not be treated with the same affrontive neglect. Should it be offered to Me, I should have no Objection to accept of it; provided the Secretaryship could be secured to my son. This provision for both would in my humble Opinion be no more than an Act of Justice to one who has done and suffered so much in the Cause as I have.  I am, With great sincerity and affection, Dear Varick, Your friend and humble Servant, Jno. Morin Scott.  P.S. Be pleased to communicate this Letter to the Govr.(4) It is reported this Moment as from the Minister of France that the Enemy were preparing to evacuate the S. States.

I hope you will Excuse my not writing by the last post and that you will impute it to no other Cause than that of the want of time, which was realy the Case. I received yours of the 22d ult.-for which I am obliged to you. We are Anxiously waiting for the particulars of the Engagement said to have been between the French and British fleets, in the West Indias, Various are the reports respecting that matter, but none to be depended on; about ten days ago, we were Amused with an account, given by two Sailors, who Came out in a Vessel from St Thomas's, and had only Eleven days passage, this Vessel belonged to this place, And was taken off Egg harbour, by a Refugee Boat from N York, and the men all put on Shore. The above two, Came to Philadelphia, and reported that the day before they left St. Thomas's, two Vessells Arrived from St. Kitts, and brought an account that the two fleets had had an Engagement, that the British had 3 74s Sunk, and the French one, And that Brimstone Hill had Surrendered. There has been no Arrivals here, for upwards of three weeks, nor to the Eastward that we Know of. There is not the least probabillity of truth, in the Account Extracted from Rivingtons paper, respecting that Engagement. I have seen the N. York paper of the 4th Instant, which is entirely Silent on that Head, which is a proof, that they have no particular Account of the Engagement; or that the Issue has been unfavourable to them. Intelligence from the southward, and which I think may be relyed on-is that General Green had got Possession of the Enemys post at the Quarter House, which is within five miles of Charles Town, And Cuts of the Communication between the Town and Country. That in Consequence of a Detachment from Gen. Greens Army, sent into Georgia, the Enemy had Called in all their outposts, in that state, to Savannah; so that they have now, only that post left in Georgia, and Charles Town in South Carolina, neither of which it is to be hoped will Continue long in their possession, if the French proves Successful in the West Indies. The assembly of this State are now Sitting, and have unanimously passed their Supply Bill for raising the Quota of money required by Congress, the whole to be paid in hard money, or Bank Notes. (1) This Exertion is the more pleasing, as it is to  MARCH 12, 1782  be feared, most of the other states will be greatly deficient. If it was Expected by our assembly, that the Financier would take off our Specific Articles, I am afraid they will be disapp[ointe]d. He will it is more likely require, that the money should be paid in to the Treasury, in order to discourage Taxes being received in specific Articles in future. I wish the Assembly may meet Agreeable to your expectation-there Can be no objection to receiveing Bank Notes in discharge of Taxes, as these notes will be received equal with gold & silver in the Continental Treasury; indeed it seems to be the wish of the Financier, that these notes should be paid in to the Treasury, in preference to hard money, as he has orderd his receivers to purchase up Bank notes with gold or silver, as fast as they receive it. This Seems to be an Excellent plan, and Cant fail of giving most Effectual Credit to the Bank-for if a man Can, within his own State, at any time, Exchange a Bank note, for hard money, he Can have no good reason, for refusing Bank Notes, for anything he may have to Sell, or in discharge of Any debt that may be due to him- And it ought to be the Business of every State, to encourage the Circulation of those notes as much as possible; for that state which possesses the largest sum in Bank notes, will be in the least danger, of haveing the hard money Carried out of the state, to discharge their Debt, with the Continental Treasury.  I have inclosed the papers And wishing you health and happiness, Am, My Dear sir with perfect Esteem, Your most humble Servt.  John Hanson ""

  Gentn. [ante March 12, 1782](1) It is now more than Years since the Citizens of these united States have committed the direction and superintendance of their political Interests to Congress. The burthen of this important charge can only be concieved of, by comparing the extreme weakness & destitute Situation of these States, with the established Power & ample resources of the Enemy, with whom we had to Contend. The means in our power, were no ways adequate to the Magnitude of MARCH 12, 1782  the Object in View. Happy indeed was it for the Citizens of America, that this Object in its full Extent did not open at once to their sight, but gradually increased as the dawning Light. It is not a matter of Surprise that amidst a variety of complicated difficulties pressing with equal force on every hand, that the Act of Confederation, uniting so many States of various Characters, Interests & Opinions, should not provide for every possible Circumstance that might attend the Body politick, as it increased into national importance or advanced towards the conclusion of a successful War. By this Means, your Affairs have been at times embarrassed and the measures necessary for the common defence greatly clogged & delayed.  It has become the duty of Congress frequently to apply to the several States in their individual Capacity, for those Powers & Aids which were indispensable in the great work of our Independance. The present period loudly calls on Congress to a repetition of this Duty. From a concurrence of Circumstances, it is the most critical and important, that has yet happened to these States. Congress concieving that your essential Interests if not your political existence are intimately blended with the Events of the ensuing Campaign, and fearing lest Languor & want of decision in the several States as to the preparations necessary for ensuring them to be successfull, may prove destructive to your happiness, Congress think(2) it their indispensable duty to rouse your attention to a consideration of the present moment founded on the reflection of past Events.  When the peaceable Citizens of these States, were reduced to the necessity of uniting in their common defence, they had neither Arms, Ammunition or Money for the purposes of war. The same necessity forced Congress to the dangerous Expedient of using Paper Credit, as the only possible Mean of supporting the arduous Contest. The Consequences of an undue tho necessary Increase of this paper Medium, have been too severely felt, to need a further Explanation. Congress in order to prevent those fatal Effects made many timely Efforts to call your attention to this important Object. After many earnest Applications on the Subject of the public Exigencies, On the 18th Apl. last Congress transmitted to the Legislature of the several States, an Estimate of the Expences for the current Year, and the supplies on which they relied for defraying those Expences. As the distresses of the Army for want of provisions, and their uneasiness & disatisfaction for want of pay, were then great & notorious, so also the clamours of public Creditors grew louder & louder; it was therefore judged necessary to state the Measures which Congress had before pursued and the many Steps they had taken to support the war, to provide for the public Exigencies, and to guard against the Dangers & embarrassments with which they were then threatened, for want of timely supplies of Men & Money. To this Statement Congress beg leave again to refer. The   recapitulation of past Transactions, so well known to the Legislature of every State, it was hoped would not only convince them of the faithful & strenuous Endeavours of Congress to maintain the Comon Cause, by providing for the present defence and guarding against future ills, by calling on the States for Aid & support but would also awaken them to a Sense of the public danger and engage them to a more liberal & punctual Compliance with the requisitions then made, as the only means of saving our Country from impending Calamity. It gives us pain to observe that our hopes and expectations have been again disappointed, and that by the backwardness & dilatoriness of the States to grant the necessary Supplies, the well laid plans of our General have been disconcerted and the designs of Congress to give ample relief to the public Creditors have been again frustrated. It is necessary to observe that the Operations of War do not admit of delay. There are times & Seasons which must be watched and which if suffered to pass unimproved, cannot be again recalled-that secrecy in planning & vigor in executing are the only means of ensuring Success. We may now inform you, that relying on the States for their quotas of Men & Money called for, measures were concerted for the attack of New York. The States were pressed in the most earnest manner, to have their Troops ready in the Field, and to furnish the necessary supplies of Money to carry on the Operations. The Moment for Action arrived, but the General found his Ranks so thin, and even the small Force he had collected so ill supplied, that it became imprudent to proceed, by which a very large Expence in preparation was accrued in vain. Had it not been for the aid of Money granted by our generous Ally-for the providential arrival of his Fleet in the Chesapeak and almost a miraculous coincidence of fortunate Circumstances, which by the blessing of God, were happily improved, our public Affairs must now have been in the most distressing Circumstances. This inattention in the States has almost endangered our very existence as a People, and indeed it is to the overruling providence of the great Governor of the Universe, that we must ascribe our political Salvation at this Day, amidst so many Tryals, difficulties & distresses as have been struggled with in this complicated & bloody War with one of the first Powers in the Universe. It is true that the most brilliant Successes have attended our Arms & those of our illustrious ally, the last Campaign. We are now providentially in a Situation, from which we may hope for the most happy termination of the War, if not wanting in our own Exertions and in timely drawing forth those resources which are within our Power. Our Work is but fairly begun, and the special & peculiar Circumstance of the present Moment, requiring the most vigorous preparations for an Early Campaign, would render our silence criminal did we not urge you on this Occasion to activity & decision.  It is our duty to cry aloud, well knowing that if we loose the present golden Opportunity, such another may never return. And we mean by this address not only to rouse you to Action, but to justify ourselves to our Constituents, to the World and our own Consciences. Experience has fully evinced that the Enemy are bent upon our destruction or Subjugation; and from their pride, Obstinacy & Malice it is very apparent that the War will be of much longer continuance than was at first apprehended, and must therefore be conducted not by temporary expedients or desultory Measures, but by a regular & systematic plan. This could only be affected by restoring public Credit-by checking Waste-& introducing (Economy in the public Expenditures; Congress therefore judged it necessary to intrust the Management of the Finances of these States and what related to the preparations for War, in the hands of single Persons in whose Judgment, fidelity & Abilities, (under the Controul of Congress) they could with the greatest Confidence rely. The Benefit resulting from their Arrangements are already very conspicuous. But with the most economical Savings without the Aid & vigorous Support of the individual States it is impossible finally to succeed. The Situation of one of these departments, makes it especially necessary that many circumstances relative to it, should be known & attended to by the Several States in the Union, and as this cannot be done better than by Extracts from the Superintendant of Finance his Letter to Congress of the 9th of Feby instant, we shall refer you to his own Words. \""It gives me pain &c\"" (3) Print Letter.  Thus we have endeavoured to give your State the fullest Ideas of our present Circumstances, and do conclude with intreating a speedy & strict attention to this important Business. The requisitions of the Current Year both as to Men & Money punctually complied with can only give us hopes of Success in this all important Campaign-will satisfy the public Creditor-silence the Clamors of the Soldiery-add Vigor, discipline & Decision to the Army, and finally Crown your long and laborious Struggle with an honorable & lasting Peace.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia March 12th. 1782.  Am much obliged by the Papers sent-they were just right and am glad you kept back the money. As to the appointment I mentioned to you,(1) it is for the purpose of settling and adjusting the Accts. of the department for which it is made up to the last day of Decr. 1781 & no farther. I can't imagine it can take above two Years at most, and there is little or no Prospect of Peace in that Time. The Evacuation of Charles Town appears probable, in order to bring all the Force to New York. I hope to see you the first week in Aprill, as I shall set off the first day of that Month. I must beg the Favour of you to put in some of the comon Seeds for me-such as Sallad-Cabbage &c &c. Will you be so good as to mention to Mr. Morton that I recd. the Papers he sent me, but that nothing can be done, without the Soldiers discharge which was not sent. There is no news but a few successful Skirmishes both from Genl. Green's Army and Genl Heaths. The British are closely hemmed in at Charles Town & Savanna. Their Troops have been on Johns Island, in the Harbour of Charles Town. Every Thing from Europe looks like a vigorous Campaign. If Rivington is right abt. the affair of Kempenfelt, I think Count De Guichen will come off by the Lee.  Patty has been here this Morning & is very hearty-Her Aunt had done every thing necessary about her Affairs some time ago. Will you be so good as to direct Josey to have the Orchard trimmed-and to get half a Doz. or a Doz.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 12th March 1782 I am honourd with yours of the 23d ulto, which I shall immediately lay before Congress.  I am sorry the subject had not been divided, so as to bring into view, first the quota of eight million: and afterwards redress for five million old Continental, that died in your hands. However I shall do the best I can with it.(1) As to Vermont, a rumour prevails here, that they have agreed to comply with the Resolutions of Augt., that is, to relinquish their late encroachments, &ca: if this be true, the hurly burly is done.(2) The papers they laid before Congress were chiefly copies of such things as they had formerly laid before the Assembly of Newhampshire, with a pretty long memorial of theirs, drawn up in their usual style. I should have sent you copies, if they had appeard interesting: but I will revise, & if any thing appears new, you shall have it. As to the sense of Congress, it appears to me, that N York, Virginia, N & S Carolina & Georgia are against receiving Vermont into Confederation, or allowing independence. Massa., Rd. Island, Cont., N Jersy, Pensa. & Deleware & Marild. favr. them. So you see 7 for it 5 against it. But it requires the assent of Nine states, by articles of Confederation. Some of the states may change their delegates, or delegates may change their minds. My own private opinion would be (seeing the matter is brought to what it is) to give them independence, & receive them into confederation, if that would end our troubles upon the subject, which I suppose it would; but I shall never vote for it without instructions from the state (as I think myself bound by instructions to the contrary). Perhaps the case may be much the same wth. the delegates of N.Y: but this I cant affirm. Genl Scot & Col Floyd are gent of candour, & discernment; but they are governed by instructions. If nothing else will do let N H MARCH 12, 1782  & N Y by acts of legislature appoint commissioners to Settle the boundarys (at the heighth of land). This proposal comes from the delegates of N Y. If N H must go to war they may as well claim to the heighth of land as to the river & perhaps as easily conquer one as the other.  If Mr. Langdon shd. decline which I shd. be sorry for, I wish the other delegates may be sent to relieve me by first of May or sooner.(3) I have the honr. to be Your most obedt.

  Dear Sir Private Philadelphia 12th March 1782. Your favour of the 30th Octo. demands my particular and gratefull acknowledgement. I am sorry for the causes that you alledge have impelled you to a determination of resigning your place of Chief Justice.(1) And at the same time must beg leave to suggest, at least as important, a reason for your resignation, which would give your friends pleasure instead of pain: I mean the new arrangement of officers in the state, which will doubtless soon take place, wherein the place to be assigned to you will doubtless be incompatible with the office of CJ. Your wishing me to be at home when the court is filled up, intimates a farther wish in my favour, which, knowing your candour, it wd. be impossible for me to mistake. I ought to have answerd your letter sooner; but have been prevented meerly by expectations of communicating orally what could not be quite so well communicated by letter.  I must now proceed to a subject which nothing but your candour and friendship wd. induce me to trouble you with. A court of appeals has been instituted by Congress, to hear all appeals from the maritime Courts, in cases of capture: to consist of three judges, any two to make a quorum: To sit once a year, in an eastern, middle,  MARCH 12, 1782  & southern district. Two judges have been appointed and have acted. Another judge is wanted. In the begining of Jany. I was in nomination & had the vote of six states: but Rd Island was against me: so I missed the election, as nothing is valid without seven states. There were then but seven states represented. The affair being brought on next day an objection was started, that no member of Congress could be appointed, according to articles of Confederation. The election was then put off for my time in congress to expire (the 18thJan). My reappointment frustrated this plan. No Judge is yet elected.(2) If I should leave Congress in the spring, perhaps my friends would get me appointed. In that case tis probable I shd. be inclind to accept. But should my friends in NH wish otherwise I wd. drop every thought of this matter. I am not anxious about it. Tis true I might have suppressd my reappointment 'till Congress had come to a choice of a judge: but it seemd to me uncandid, & might disappoint the wishes of the State. Now I should be glad of your free and candid opinion upon the subject, only promising that this new arrangement may throw the authority of the state into such hands as I might be ambitious to serve under or rather amongst: but it may be in such hands as might fill me with contrary sentiments. But I have troubled your patience long enough.  I am Dear Sir, with the highest sentiments of esteem & friendship. Your most obedt humble servant, Samuel Livermore  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 12th. 1782 We were yesterday honored with the Receipt of your Excellency's Letter of the 2d instant by some private hand. It gave us great Pleasure to find not only that the Legislature were disposed to continue firm in the same Spirit which dictated their concurrent resolutions of October last, but that the people at large were greatly incensed at the perfidy of the Leaders of the inhabitants of the Grants, so fully evidenced by their Negociations with the Enemy. Their Conduct in this Instance will we hope leave them without a Friend in the State; and ought to operate as a most cogent Reason with Congress to blow up their Fabric of Independence. We see clearly however that interested and political Motives have such an Influence on a Majority of Congress; that from those Negotiations strong Arguments of political Expedience are drawn in favor of a declaration of their Independence and their Admission into the federal Union, as the most effectual Means to prevent such Negotiations in future. Whereas every disinterested person must clearly see that by establishing the Independence of the Grants & admitting them into the Union, the Influence of their wicked Leaders will be rendered permanent, and endanger the Safety of these united States, by admitting so many Serpents into our Bosom to poison our Councils, divulge our Secrets and give an easy Admission to the Enemy into the Heart of the American Empire. Yet however evident the danger, the Majority appear so fixed that nothing but their Inability to increase their Number to nine States, can prevent the Execution of the dangerous plan & the arbitrary dismemberment of our unhappy State.  No New maneouvres have taken place since we had the honor of writing to You officially by Mr Paymaster General Pearse.(1) Before the receipt of your Letter we had information that the Grants had lopped off their Wings; and that agents were on their Way hither, to make the preliminary Relinquishment required by the Resolutions of Augt. last.(2) We shall endeavor to Prevail on Congress to defer taking up the Business on this Ground 'till we shall be further honored with the Instructions of the Legislature which We are  MARCH 12, 1782  determined shall in every Instance be the invariable Rule of our public Conduct. We beg that not a moment may be lost in conveying them to Us; and at the same Time we wish to be furnished with directions whether we are to keep our Seats or Leave them till further Order from the State, in Case an arbitrary Majority should force the detested independence upon Us. Permit Us Sir to assure You & the Legislature that in this and every other Instance we shall devote ourselves to the promotion of the true Interest of our State as it stands connected with the real welfare of those united States; and that We shall be punctual in our official informations on this & every other Subject.  With respect to Colonel Willets affair, the prospect is very discouraging.(3) His restoration to his Rank seems almost impossible on the present Plan of military Arrangements. We have, as You advised, conferred with the Commander in Chief; who while he pays particular Attention to the Colonel's military Merit, seems to be of Opinion that should the Door be opened for his restoration it would be productive of so many similar Applications, which could not be complied With, as would prove injurious to the public by giving great & just Cause of discontent. Of the same opinion is the Assistant Secretary of War; who if we may judge from our Conversation with him, can never be induced to recommend it to Congress to restore the Colonel to his Rank. He gave also the fullest Reason to believe that General Lincoln will be of the same Opinion. However Sir to convince You and Colonel Willet, that we shall leave no Method unessayed to serve him & the State in this Instance We shall apply to the Secretary of War immediately on his Return from Boston, which is hourly expected.(4)  We have the Honor to be, with the greatest respect, Your Excys. most obedt humble servts.  P.S. Mr. Scott begs Leave to remind Your Excellency, that he wishes, if it is the Intention of the Legislature that his Attendance in Congress should be of any considerable duration that the Supply of Cash mentioned in his Letter to You may be specie.  The Concurrent Resolutions of the Senate and Assembly Respecting Colo. Van Schaicks Supercedure was laid before Congress before Mr. Scott arrived But as they Could not be prevailed on to do any thing in his favour at that time,(5) we Intend as Soon as the Secretary at war arrives from Boston to See whether we Cannot get him to Report Something that will do him Justice.(6)  ""

  Gentn. Philadelphia March 14th. 1782. My Time having been so much taken up with several public Matters before your departure, I was prevented complying with your desire; but I hope it is not now too late, as what I can say, will not be wanting till you enter into the negoctiation.(1)  I was appointed Comy. Genl. of Prisoners in Aprill 1777, when I found the department in great Confusion for want of a Head. As soon as I could spare time, my Attention was turned to the unhappy Prisoners in New York from whom the most pitious Complaints were received by almost every-Opportunity. By the Affidavits & Examinations of several Persons of Reputation, it appears that from MARCH 14, 1782  the Month of Septr. 1776 till the month of Janry 1777 there was not the least attention paid either to their Food, Convenience or their Health. The Provisions dealt out to them was of the worst kind, and did not exceed 4 oz of Pork and as much rotten Biscuit per Man per day and often no more for two Days together. The Places of their Confinement were so extremely small for their Numbers, that they could not all lay down at a Time, and not a stick of Wood was allowed them during that Period, tho you will find it regularly charged. Neither Hospitals or Medicines were allowed to the sick, but when an attempt was made to obtain these either for money or Favour, they were told orders had been given to the Contrary. By these and other Means one half if not three fourths of those unhappy Men perished, and many of the Survivors were forced at the Intreaties of officers sent among them for that Purpose, to inlist in the Enemy's Service, to put a period to their intense Sufferings.  The Fall of Genl Burgoyne, produced a different Treatment of our Prisoners, tho' it was by no means remedied in a proper manner. The Complaints from the Provost, where about Twenty odd of our Officers & Citizens of rank were confined, daily distressed every friend of humanity. The Treatment complained of was such as could not have been expected from the Hottentots.  What I have here related, was not of my own Knowledge, but I have ample Testimony of it, in my Possession.  The first Thing I did in order to relieve them was to send in a depty Comy to reside in New York.(2) His remaining in this Capacity was refused, but he was admitted to remain to distribute to the several Places of Confinement, such necessaries as should be sent in for their relief.  Abt the month of Janry. 1778 I went into New York to enquire into the reiterated Complaints of our Prisoners. I was politely treated & suffered to go in Company with an English officer to every Place where Prisoners were Confined, and to examine freely into their Treatment, it being first acknowledged that their Bread had been very bad from necessity. I found their Treatment at the Provost had been worse than represented, and the Provost Martial had the Confidence to acknowledge the Complaints were all just in the presence of the officer and to justify his Conduct from his absolute Authority in that Place.  I found the Privates in general were tolerably well lodged and by the Aid of 3 lb Bread and as much Beef per Man per week which I then allowed them from the Provisions I sent in from Time to Time, which made up what they received from the Enemy a full ration, they lived as Comfortably as could be expected.  The Officers were very well cantoned out on Long Island, on an Agreement I had made for the payment of 2 Dollars per week for their Board & for which I gave my Private Engagement & Credit to   Genl Robertson and the whole of which I discharged from Decr 1777 to June 1778, tho' it has been asserted by Genl Howe in a Letter to Genl Washington that he had paid it, and I have full proof that he never paid a Dollar of it. What was due before Decr. was left to be liquidated with certain Charges of ours for Supplies furnished English Prisoners with us; tho I afterwards heard that my Successor discharged the whole without such liquidation, the Exchanged Officers on Long Island being detained on that Acct.  While the Enemy remained in this Town, every Species of Cruelty was exercised towards them. There are Instances of some of them being kept from 4 to 6 Days without a Mouthful of food, and on receiving a few ounces of raw Pork, it was devoured with so much eagerness that one in particular dropped dead on the spot-others died with Grass in their Mouths, which they had picked up in the State House Yard. In short for a considerable Time, untill Mr. Ferguson under took the Care of them, the Food that our Prisoners did receive, was the effect of the Benevolence & Charity of the Citizens. An Authenticated State of these Facts was sent in to Genl. Howe-he promised redress and I believe detected his provost Martial in selling the Provisions designed for our Prisoners. He then permitted our furnishing the Prisoners with Provisions, which had been heretofore refused, and from this period I found both officers & privates with the principal part of their rations.  In June 1778 I met Mr Loring (3) at German Town in order to liquidate the demand for 1800 Prisoners sent from New York in Janry 1777. We could not agree, till Mr Loring consented to agree to an Exchange of Prisoners then in Philadelphia, and to send in both officers & privates to avoid a Sea Voyage to New York, whereupon I gave up a dispute of 100 Men. Within a few days, I was surprised with an Acct that our People were ordered on Board of Ships. I remonstrated agt this Breach of Faith. Genl Robertson met me on the Lines & was convinced of the impropriety of the Measure, and promised to use his Endeavours to prevent it. However all that could be obtained from Genl. Clinton, was a promise to return them from New Castle in Case some Hessians expected from Lancaster was sent after them. The Hessians arrived in Time, I sent not only to New Castle but to Reedy Island, but all was in vain.  In 1778 The Treasury sent me 19 setts of Bills of Exchange drawn by British Officers for their Board while Prisoners, on their friends in England. Not being able to negotiate them in New York, I sent 16 Setts to London. They are returned protested with Letters wrote by the Drawers desiring their Protest, as they were extorted by rebells. I forgot to mention that at German Town the british Commissary demanded an Allowance for the Men taken at the Cedars. We charged a number of Officers taken in Canada who were returned on Parole. Both these were agreed to be left till farther light on the  subject could be obtained-when both were to be properly settled. I am since informed, that the Cedar Prisoners are exchanged by us, without any allowance for the Canadian Officers.  The Bounds of a Letter prevent my fully explaining these with several other Matters relative to Prisoners in 1777 & 1778. I have given these outlines, in hopes it may throw light on the Accts. that will be exhibited by the Enemy. It was remarkable & what I often complained of, that their vouchers were taken from their own Serjeants instead of ours. Therefore altho' the Provisions were actually delivered to their Serjeant; yet it is no Evidence that a Prisoner ever tasted any of it.  I am Gentlemen with great respect, Your most Obedt Hble Servt, Elias Boudinot  ""

The disappointment which those people must feel from being lopped off by the Grants (If that should be the Case), must in our Opinion irritate them much agt. those who drew them into their present difficulty. We therefore beg Leave to  MARCH 15, 1782  recommend it to the Consideration of the Legislature whether sound policy does not at this Juncture dictate the Expediency of passing an act of Oblivion in their favor with a Limitation of Time within which they shall be required to take the Oath of Allegiance to the State to entitle them to the Benefit of the Act. We feel the more desirous that this conciliatory Method should be adopted because We find it wished for by those States in Congress who warmly espouse our Cause. Our Situation we conceive is too critical to permit our disappointing the Expectations of those Friends by whose Attachment to the Rights of our State the Report in Favor of the Grants was prevented from taking Effect; and we are persuaded that the proposed lenient Step on our part will be extreamly agreable to them. We continue in anxious Expectation of the Arrival of the further Resolutions of our Legislature and hope they may contain full Instructions for our future Conduct on a Subject of such interesting Moment to the State We have the Honor to represent.  We are Sir with the greatest Respect your Excellency's most obedt. Servt. Jon Scott  Wm Floyd ""

  Sir, Private. Phildelpa. 15th. March 1782 The Committee to whom was referred your Excellency's Letter respecting the Pay and Subsistence of the State Troops have not yet made Report.(1) Mr. Law and I have therefore judged that We had no matters of sufficient Importance to write an official Letter upon at this Time.

She has bro't. it said Papers giving Information that Sr. James Lowther had made a Motion in Parliament that the British Troops Should be withdrawn from America and that the Force of the Nation should be concentered against France and Spain-That Ld. North agreed that it was necessary to change the mode of carrying on the War but that it was necessary to retain one or more Posts in America-That upon the Question the Ministry Negatived the Motion by a Majority of forty two Members.

  Dr. Sir, Phil. March 17th. 1782. Immediately upon the receipt of your letter inclosing Genl. Roberdeau's certificate and bills, he wrote you a letter acknowledging the receipt thereof; and upon the same sheet I gave you a line referring thereto, (1) and assuring you that I would do every thing in my power to procure the payment of your loan-office account &c, &c. I accordingly made an extract from your letter of that part which respected that matter, and laid it before the Committee of the week, but finding they would report that it should lay on the table, I took it back, and laid it before the Superintendant of Finance; who told me that he would write to you on the subject of it.(2) Whether any addition will be made to the pay of the Keepers of the Loan-offices I cannot determine; but as it is the design of the Superintendant of Finance that those appointments should be abolished as soon as it can be done with propriety, I believe none will be made. You will most certainly be paid what is due and may become due to you from the public; but perhaps not so soon as you may wish. I think I may congratulate you on the surrendry of Brimstone Hill and the complete reduction of St Kitts, Nevis & Montserrat; which you will see an account in the News paper.(3) You will also see there an account of the disaster of the Brest Fleet, which obliged them to return to Port; whereby every advantage that might have been derived from their having a month's start of Admiral Rodney is lost. However it is a very happy circumstance that the Duke De Bouille should have taken the places beforementioned, before the arrival of Admiral Rodney. You will likewise particularly take notice of the change in the British Ministry. What will be the issue of this change I cannot  MARCH 17, 1782  pretend to predict; nor dare I hazard an opinion upon it, not having had time to make up my mind on the subject. It seems by the speeches of Lds North & Germain that the mode of conducting the war was to be changed; but whether that will be the sentiment of the present ministry you can determine as well as I. I rather think that they will strengthen their post at Newyork for the reasons assigned in those speeches; and, instead of exposing whole armies to be conquer'd as they have done by carrying on an internal war, secure that post and Charlestown if they can, that they may have something to make peace with; and employ their naval, and what land force they may have to spare in recovering the islands they have lost, protecting those which may be in danger; while at the same time their cruising ships will be employed upon our trade. Much depends upon our allies preserving their naval superiority; and I think we have something to apprehend from Lord Howe's being at the head of the Admiralty. His skill and abilities in naval affairs I believe are great, and I don't doubt they will be exerted to the utmost, to increase the strength of the British and lessen that of the French & Spanish Navies. The fort of our enemies used to be and is in their navy. While the combined fleets preserve their superiority we have nothing to fear; if that should be lost we shall have reason to be concerned. The war will I believe be carried on principally upon the water hereafter. While our allies and foes are contending for victory on the ocean, it will be our duty to be active on land. At all events we ought to be early and thoroughly prepared to embrace every opportunity which may offer to make an impression on the enemies strong holds.  Congress have recd. letters from Mr. Dana giving an account of his journey to, arrival at St Petersburg &c. His last letter was dated about the middle of September.(4) I shall keep this letter open and if any thing new should occur before the post goes out I will give it to you. Give my love to your wife & children and accept of my best wishes for your & their prosperity. Yrs W.E.  [P.S.] I find that the account of a change in the British Ministry is rather premature: But it is said that Ld Sandwich had resigned and that Lord Howe had taken his seat at the Admiralty. I have seen the capitulation of Brimstone Hill. W. E.  ""

  Philadelphia March 18th 1782 Dear Doct. 9 oClock at Night.  I have this moment received your letter of the 10th, No 11. I shall in a little time be in great want of money-if you Can get me £100, it will make me easy. I should be under no difficulties if the state would remit but half of what is due me. Your mother has taken some medicine from Doctr. Bond, and I think she is much better. Sunday week, little Kit was seized with a sickness at the stomach, followed by Vomitting which relieved her. The next day, we prevailed on her with some difficulty, to take a dose of powders which Doctr. Bond prescribed. It operated downwards, and she has ever since been very well. A Gent at New York writes to a Gentleman in this City, that a Considerable Change had taken place in the British ministry. Lord Howe was placed at the Head of the Admiralty, in the room of Lord Sandwich, and that Lord Shebourn, and Colo. Barry were taken in-that General Howe was appointed to Command the Forces in Ireland, and that Sir Guy Carlton, who was formerly Governor of Canada, was appointed to the Command of the British Forces in America, in the room of Sir Henry. This day a Vessel Arrived from St Thomas's, the Capt informs that Charles Town was Evacuated the 24th ult.-that one of the Transports from that place put into St Thomass through stress of weather, with part of the Garrison who gave the Account. He further informs that the British fleet under the Command of Sr Samuel Hood were blocked up in Antigua by the French, who, haveing been joined by Some Spanish Ships of the line, Amounted to 40 Sail. This latter intelligence is of the greatest importance. God grant it may be true-if it is, the French may do as they please in the West Indies-And will have it in their power to afford us Any Assistance we may stand in need of the next Campaign. However you will observe this is Ship news, and therefore not much to be relyed on. If it be true, we shall have it Confirmed in a few days.  I think it is beyond a Doubt that Brimstone Hill has Surrendered, and that the whole Island of St Kitts is in possession of the French- the English had Contrived to leave about 600 men on the Island, with intention to reinforce the garrison, but they were immediately  MARCH 18, 1782  attacked by the French, and the whole Killed and taken, upon which the Garrison Surrendered. Ned Barnes perhaps may be lurking about Laurance Oneals, if he is not gone down to H Hanson. I wrote to Hoskins by the last post about him, if he is there I suppose he will inform me-hope you will hear Something about him by the next post. Your mother and little Kit joins in love to you and little Beck and Johnny who I am very glad to hear are well. Our Horses are Still refractorey which puts it out of my power to send for A &B. which I fear will be a very great disappointment. Since writing the above the Capitulation of St Kitts is Come to hand which is inserted in the inclosed paper.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. March 18th. 1782 In my last to you on the subject of the map in the hands of Dr. Smith I informed you of the little chance of getting a copy of it for you.(1) Nothing has since occurred wch. affords the least expectation from that quarter, but I have met with a bundle of old pamplets belonging to the public Library here in which is a map published in 1650 which from this & other circumstances I am pretty confident is of the same impression with that of Doctr. Smith's. It represents the South sea at about 10 days travel from the heads or falls, I forget which, of James River. From the tenor however of the pamphlet to which it is immediately annexed (2) & indeed of the whole collection there is just ground to suspect that this representation was an artifice to favor the object of the publications which evidently was to entice immigrants from England by a flattering picture of the advantages of this Country, one of which dwelt on in all the pamphlets is the vicinity of the S. Sea, and the facility it afforded of a trade with the Eastern World. Another circumstance wch. lessens much the value of this map to the Antiquary is that it is more modern by 25 years than those extant in Purchase's pilgrim,(3) wch. are referred to in the Negociations between the British & french Commissaries touching the bounds of N. Scotia as the first of Authenticity relating to this part of the world.(4) If notwithstanding these considerations you still desire that a copy be taken from the map above described I shall with pleasure execute your orders, or if you wish that a copy of (the Map of) Virga. or of the whole country may be taken from those in Purchase, your orders shall be equally attended to. I much doubt however whether that book be so extremely scarce as to require a transcript from it for the purpose you seem to have in view. MARCH 18, 1782  You will find in the inclosed gazette all our latest intelligence both from Europe & the W. Indies. The Ministerial Speeches in Parliament as well as other considerations render it pretty certain that the system for recovering America will be changed. A peace with Holland & a suspension of the expensive operations in America, are to give their resources full play agst. France & Spain, whilst all the arts of division & seduction will probably be practised on the U States.  Congress have taken no step in the business of the Western territory since the report of the Committee of which I have already given you an account, & which we hear arrived at Richmond on the day of the adjournment of the Assembly.(5) We wish it to undergo their consideration, & to receive their instructions, before we again move in it. Mr. Randolph, by whom this goes,(6) will probably be present at the May Session & will be possessed of every information that may be necessary. I refer you to the interview with him which I hope that occasion will afford you for other congressional intelligence.  I am this moment told that pretty certain information is come to hand of the final reduction of St. Kitts.  With great regard I am Dr. Sr. yr. obt. friend & Servt.  J. Madison Jr.(7) ""

Griffin's Boy, who left this last Week (1)- Since which we have had several arrivals both from Europe & the West Indies. I can only deal in generals-Every Thing on the other Side of the Water looks Favourable. We shall not be deserted there. No hopes of Peace from any Quarter. Brittain talks of changing the War-from an internal to a naval War. The Minority have a Vain hope that if they withdraw their Troops, that we will submit even yet to the dominion of the King of Brittain. We have been amused with a Vague report of the evacuation of Charles Town on the 24th Feby but I believe without Foundation in Truth. The Capitulation of Brimstone Hill is arrived. The French seem to be anxious to reduce the rules of War to some consistency with the Principles of Benevolence. The English Islands will be almost tempted to submit to the Gallic Power, to obtain a happier State than even the british Government allows them. The Island of St. Kitts now enjoys a Right of Trade to all the World both Friend & Foe. As to Mr. Wykoffs Lotts, you must have been misinformed as I know he sold one for £3 per acre.  As to the particular Business you mention, I wish you to make some Agreemt with the Person, if he may be depended on.

  D. Sr. Phila. l9th Mar. 1782 I know not whether it is my turn regularly to answer you this week or not as your Letter was to Mr. Madison (1) but be that as it may I shall take the liberty of troubling you with a Letter. The claims of the MARCH 19, 1782  people of Vermont still remain unsettled, and a change must take place in the opinion of some States, before they can be acknowledged independent and admitted into the Union, even upon the supposition that the consent of nine States is sufficient for the purpose-the fair construction, however, of the confederation seems to require the assent of the whole. The sense of Congress cannot be long delayed on this business, if it be true what we are lately told, that the people of that Territory have disolved their Union with what is called the wings, that is, incroachments upon the States of N. York & N. Hampshire withot. the original demands of those people, and which by resolutions of Congress of the 20th of Augt. last they were required as a preliminary to their Independence and admission into the union of the States to relinquish-this proposition they at first rejected, but it seems they have since relented, if our information is true. Their refusal however is considered by many as an absolution of Congress from the terms then offered and left that Body at full liberty thereafter to abide by or depart from those terms. Motives of policy dictated the measure in August but circumstances have since changed and what appeared to be necessary then, is not now so pressing. In short, incidents have happened since that period which so strongly mark a hostile disposition in some States to invade the rights of others, that, I believe, it will be very difficult to obtain the concurrence of nine to give them independence and the priviliges of the Union, at least before Some great political questions are decided respecting the united States, their individual & general rights.(2)  In your Letter last week to Mr. Madison (3) you seem not to approve our assuming any other rule of proportion on the settlemt. of the public accounts than what has been already taken and that it wod. be better to examine the account and let them lie over for final settlement according to the Confederation. You go upon the supposition that the proposed settlement is not to be final, wherein lies your mistake. It is intended to make a final settlemt. of past expenditure between the individual States and the united States & between Individuals in the States and the U. States to the 1st of Janry last. These transactions laying as it were in a chaotic state, the doubts and jealousies entertained that Congress had no serious design to bring them to settlement, and the relaxation and langour prevailing in consequence of opinions taken up that each had done more than its proportion, rendered it indispensibly necessary to bring all these matters to a close. A plan was therefore proposed by the financier wch. being considered and amended was at length agreed to by Congress. The outline of which is for the States to authorize Congress to assume such principles for determining the quotas of the respective States as from a consideration of all circumstances shod. appear just and equitable having regard to the abilities of the States   from time to time in consequence of the ravages of War. The States are required to furnish the best information to enable Congress to adopt an equitable rule. A Commissioner is to be appointed for each State (not a Citizen of the State) to settle the accounts according to such rules as have been or shall be laid down by Congress-the accounts so settled to be final and conclusive to the above period. Where such confusion exists as in our past expenditures and such a variety of interest were necessary to be combined, it was very difficult to digest any mode likely to give satisfaction and content, perhaps the one proposed is as free from objection as any that could be devised and if approved by the States will ultimately produce very beneficial consequences.  We have a report today that Chs Town was evacuated abt. the 24th of last month and that a transport with some of the Troops was spoken with bound to the W. Indies-this I fear originates in the departure of abt. 30 refugees from Chs. Town for the W. Indies. The inclosed will shew you the terms granted St. Kitts. It is expected a peace will take place between England and Holland under the mediation of the Empress of Russia as those powers have accepted her offer, and it is reported from New York that the preliminaries are settled. This, if it takes place, will be a great relief to Britain, and may, if another account be true, that Ld. Howe is to be at the head of the Admiralty, be the means of more vigorous naval exertions than have lately been manifested by them and render the superiority of France and Spain upon the water more precarious than at present. It wod. appear by the inclosed Newspaper we are to be respited for awhile from offensive operations in the manner heretofore prosecuted upon the land. I wish a change of men and the mode of conducting the War may not prove at length more dangerous to Us than their offensive operations have done. These changes I fear portend no peace to America-they indicate a change of hostile measures but breathe nothing peacefull, and may have the effect, while they effect not to pursue with her usual vengeance the people of these States, to quiet the rising clamors of the British Nation and reconcile them to a continuance of this ruinous war-convinced I am nothing but inability to go on will reconcile Great Britain to relinquish America and she must loose more Islands yet before the necessity for peace will be sufficiently felt. If we can accomplish the arrangement of our finances, wch. we have a prospect of doing, and the States will but make even moderate exertions in furnishing a part of those resources they possess America has but little to fear from a continuance of the War and will have only to lament that the obstinacy of her Enemy compels her to submit to those calamities that are usually attendant on War. If I can procure as much money as will clear me out I shall visit Virga. abt. the last of next month. With real esteem I am, Yr. obt Friend & Servt., Jos. Jones.  ""

Is it possible that self interest should be able to blind so great & good men as members of Congress are? I shall do my utmost however to get justice done. Tis said Charlestown is evacuated-doubtfull-Be that as it will: The debates in the Brittish parliamt. & success of the French in the west indies are much in our favour.  Now for a word about Vermont. If we should extend west of the river to the ridge of mountains, it must be done with the good will of the people living between the river and those mountains otherwise the acquisition would cost N.H. more than it is worth.  Now if that district wish to joyn us, as has been often hinted, and as has been undoubtedly the case heretofore. It would be very agreable; and easy to accomplish.  I suppose the legislature of NY would gladly settle with the legislature of N.H. without the intervention of Congress a line on the ridge of mountains as a boundary line between N.H. & N.Y. and if the people on the east of the mountans approve of it. This would throw us into a state of perfect tranquility. Let NY settle with the people west of the mountans as they can agree, it would not concern us. But on the other hand if the people between Connecticut river & the mountains are against us, and choose rather to divide by the river, let us make ourselves easy without them. I think it is in the power of the people west of the river east of the mountains to turn the Scale for their own benefit and ours. We have been taking pains to serve them as well as ourselves. They will never be allowd east of the river, nor N H west of the mountains. Nature sets the mountains  MARCH 19, 1782  for the boundary: And if Vermont shd be annihilated or rather disallowd as a state, N.Y. will have a share of it, that is, the part west of the mountains.

The capture of Cornwallis and of his Army, has made a great impression on the European Courts in our favor; & the evacuation of the southern parts of the U.S. will probably raise such an opinion of the establishment of our Independancy beyond the power of G.B. to shake, as to incline some of those Courts to an Alliance, that may make our Enemies dispair of ever succeeding against us. The alarm in England is very great.

  Sir, Private. Philadelpa l9t March 1782 I enclose to your Excellency some publick Prints which, Alltho they Discover much Disorder in the british Councils and Nation, yet I do not Apprehend that many of either Party have any Design to yield the Independence of this Country. Ld. Shelburne I believe and his Party imagin that if they should get into Power and offer what they would call ginerous Terms to America, that We would give up our Independence and break our Alliance. It is most astonishing that such a thot. could possibly be entertained at this Period-But I think that Numbers of the Minority still flatter themselves with so strange a Delusion.  The Debt of the british Nation last Aug. was 178 Millions funded and 21 Millions unfunded Debt-Annual Interest rising of Eight Millions.  The present Parliament have it is said granted three Millions and a half for Extra. The supply for this year will not probably be less than 20 Millions. Poor America how much would you have to pay if  MARCH 20, 1782  you should be beat, But blessed be God that We have so little Reason to fear such an Event.  The Court of London has offered to Submit her Dispute with Holland to the Mediation of Russia. The Circumstances of the War-and the divided dilatory Councils of Holland render a seperate Paccification Very Improbable, in the Opinion of almost every gentleman that I have conversed with.

  My Dear Sir Philada 25th March 1782 I am not such an unconscionable fellow as to complain of your not writing to me often enough of Late: but your last Letter gives me greater cause of complaint against you for not writing enough at a Time, than I ever had before. I wished & expected that you had wrote ten times as much-what great events from trivial causes spring? You omitted the Letter y in your Draught of the 30th of January, which I did not discover till the Pay Master informed me that, he had not the Money then, but would have it in his power to draw for it soon, and as it was only for eight Dollars it was not very material. I believe I shall be able to draw the sum that you intended by becoming security that you will rectify the mistake. I received the amount of the other Draught, & sent the Money up by the same Gentleman (James Potts Esqr.) who took the last, To Mrs. St. Clair.(1) I received a few Lines from her along with the Letter which I herewith send you &, I hope that Letter will give you accounts from your family that will greatly relieve the anxiety of your mind.  Congress are certainly blameable, either in granting Money to Gen. Gist or in not granting it to you for similar services; I am rather inclined to think in both, that is, that he was allowed more than he ought to have been-That in consequence of that allowance being made to him, you have made some charges (for Lodging for example) that ought not to have been allowed you. Your Letter is referred to the Superintendant of Finance,(2) & after he shall have had a reasonable time to consider it I will inform myself (by Letter to him or by waiting upon him,) what he has done. You mentioned to me before you left this Place your inclination to resign eventually, & you repeat the same thing in your last Letter to me. I then gave no opinion on the point, nor can I now in the Character of a friend, give you any opinion, if you had asked it. I think I do justice to your feelings when I say that I can form an Idea of them in no very faint colours. Any man at such a Distance from his family as you are, and uncertain of their being supplied with what would render his absence less intolerable, must pass many uneasy anxious moments- what then must you feel? Had you not omitted to take the necessary steps to have had your account passed before you left Town, I could not suppress my indignation at the disagreeable effects of its not being answered according to your expectation, But whether you will resign on that account, deserves some consideration, & I doubt not but you will consider the step in every point of view before you take it; I am not to be told that the ungrateful treatment of your Country on a former occasion, must have left a wound in your mind that can never be radically cured. Kings may be ungrateful-Common MARCH 25, 1782  wealths must be so-says the old apothegm the truth of which you have experienced, but the duty of the Citizen is not extinguished thereby. The Pecuniary distresses of your family seems to be the principal, if not the only motive, that you assign for resigning, but will they be better relieved if you resign than if you continue in the Army? I think not-for, notwithstanding that you have rendered essential services to your Country in the Line of your Profession, yet in that case they would be forgotten by two thirds of those, who at present have a Just sense of them, & your resigning, for a cause which cannot be known by many, & will be allowed by fewer still, will be sure to be remembered to your disadvantage in the way of any desireable appointment in the Civil Line, & give your Enemies cause of triumph. I am not one of those sanguine mortals who think that the war will soon be at an end, nor one of those unthinking ones, who believe that our pecuniary distresses are intirely over; but I think I may assert that they will not be felt to the degree that they have been. Our late System would have brought any nation in the world to ruin in a short Time; but I hope we are taught wisdom by experience-economy is introduced, useless offices & Departments abolished, and such Taxes called for from the States that if they comply only tolerably well, the Army will be better paid than they have been since the third year of the War. The surprise of Posterity will be as great, that we survived the annihilation of Paper Currency, as our distresses have been by that event. I told you in my last, I think, that before your Draughts of the 30th Jany. & 6 Feby. there were 332 Dollars you was intitled to Draw for, exclusive of your Rations, before August (you must Draw for the remainder, on account of your Pay for Jany & February) by that Time the Taxes will be some of them paid in, & I think the prospect is very promising for the Assembly of this State have voted the whole sum required of them, unanimously, and the other States seem to tread in the footsteps of this, I hope they will in this Case particularly.  As you never write any News to me from the Army, you need not expect that I will write any from the City. I have two other reasons, the one of which is, that I take it for granted you are regularly informed of every thing of moment here, by those who are much more capable of the task [than] I am, & the other is, that I know of none of any thing at this Time; I have added a third, which is, that the bearer of this, having nothing el[se to] do, but collect news, can give you full information on the important subject.  Barnard is standing over me--is as d--nd a queer fellow as usual and desires me to assure you that he wishes you well, & faith I believe him and in this I most heartily join him, & am, with much esteem yours sincerely, Thomas Smith (3)  ""

(1) As it appears that these papers were transmitted at the request of the late President, it is proper to apprize you that it was made without any written or verbal sanction, and even without the knowledge of Congress; and not improbably with a view of fishing for discoveries which may be subservient to the aggressions meditated on the territorial rights of Virginia. It would have been unnecessary to trouble you with this, had it not appeared that Colonel Campbell has given a promise of other papers, which if he should fulfil, and the papers contain any thing which the adversaries of Virginia may make an ill use of, you will not suffer any respect for the acts of Congress to induce you to forward hither.

  Sir Philadelphia March 26th. 1782. Yesterday we receivd your favour, covering a Resolution of the Genl. Assembly of the 6 instant, directing their Delegates to solicit Congress to adopt speedy & effectual measures for the relief of American Prisoners.(1)  Congress have not been inattentive to the Distresses of our Seamen who are in the power of the Enemy, and have directed Letters to be wrote to Sr. Henry Clinton remonstrating against his Conduct towards them; & we have now Commissioners gone to Elisabeth town,(2) who are directed, among other things, to endeavour to obtain an enlargement, or at lest a better treatment of our people who are prisoners with the Enemy. Letters have also been wrote to our Ministers in Europe, on the same Subject; if these measures do not answer our purpose, Congress will, we trust, make such Retalliation as will force the Enemy to a more humane Conduct.  MARCH 26, 1782  The Ballance of Marine Prisoners is so much against us, and Still increasing that it is perhaps impossible for us to obtain a full exchange so long at lest as our Privateers are so very inattentive to bringing into port & confining the Prisoners which fall into their hands. Had it not been for this neglect, the evil complained of would have been avoided. However we have ample means in our Power to inforce a better treatment of our Prisoners, & the fault is ours if it is neglected.  You will be pleased to inform the Honl. Assembly that we shall pay Strict attention to their instruction, & contribute what may be in our Power, to obtain the end proposed; but we hope it will be remembered, that unless effectual measures are adopted by the Several States, for bringing in and safe keeping, the prisoners taken by our privateers, we do not see what can be done by Congress which will be effectual for the redemption of our Marine prisoners in the Enemy's hands.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia March 27th, 1782. Having as We heretofore informed You, defeated the Attempt to saddle our State with the Report a Copy of which We some time since had the Honor to inclose You,(1) Matters now remain open for something to be done, on our part. For this purpose We are Anxiously waiting for the Result of the Legislative deliberations of our State on so interesting a Subject, to serve as a Guide to our Steps. Our Opponents in Congress are now Lying perdu, waiting a Change in the Representation of the Southern States, which will soon happen, and We know not but to our disadvantages. I have prepared a set of Resolutions turning on general Principles, and in themselves almost self evident, calculated to stand as a Barrier agt. the next attempt in favor of the Grants, and which I shall move as soon, as I can, after having waited a few days longer for some official Tidings from the State.(2)  We have had several strange Manoeuvres for the promoting of General Knox to the Rank of Major General which have at Length succeeded. By this Step Brigadiers Clinton, Moultrie and McIntosh (his Seniors in Office) are disgraced.(3) I was one of the strenuous opposers to this Promotion; the Particular Movements for and against which You will clearly see, and discover the Tempers of the several Members on the Occasion, from the Journals, a Copy of which, if the Mail does not close too soon I will here inclose You; otherwise I shall send it by the next Opportunity. I am as sensible as any Man living of General Knox's Merit. But in my Opinion no Merit whatsoever can justify the Promotion of one officer in a Way that disgraces another. It is a Measure unjust in itself. It is moreover highly impolitic as it gives general Uneasiness to the Army. In this Case there are three Brigadiers disgraced, and probably three States affronted. But General Knox, it is said, at the Promotion of Brigadier Deportail over his Head was greatly disobliged, and would have retired from the Service had he not been promoted, That his Services cannot be dispensed with, That his promotion therefore became indispensible. All this may be true, but his Promotion however necessary should have been attended with the like Promotion of his Seniors who, as there are already a Surplus of Majors General, might have been honorable retired or been laid aside on half pay.(4)  MS not found; reprinted from Burnett, Letters 6:321-22.  1 See New York Delegates to Clinton, March 4 (not in current volume) and 15, 1782.  2 See New York Delegates to Clinton, March 29; and Scott to Clinton, April 2 and 9, 1782 3 Henry Knox had been promoted to major general on March 22 by a vote of eight MARCH 27, 1782  states to three.

  Sir Philadelphia March 29th. 1782 We were honored with your Excellency's Letter of the 20th instant by Major Hale, and doubt not of your Endeavor speedily to procure one of the absent delegates to supply Colonel Floyd's place; which We beg may be done as early in the next Month as possible. Tho, probably there will be as great difficulty in furnishing him with the necessary Money, as there will be in supplying Mr Scott for his Continuance here. When it is considered how much inferior the allowance made by our State is to that of all the other States, We cannot but think our Legislature ought, if a Representation be necessary, to make every Exertion for a bare decent Support of their delegates; who, tho' they chearfully submit to the Loss and Inconvenience necessarily arising from their Absence from home and Neglect of their domestic Concerns, cannot possibly maintain themselves in the public Service at their own private Expence. When the Jealousy of the smaller concerning the larger States, the political Views of three of the New England States to increase their Weight in the Scale of the Union, by the Junction of a new one, which will closely coalesce with them, and the Influence of the private Interest of Many Members or their Friends, who have been land jobbing under the usurped Government of the Grants are duly considered, we apprehend their can be little cause for astonishmt that Members of Congress, should countenance that usurpation and that Congress itself should suffer persons confessedly their Leaders & Instruments in League with the Enemy, to attend the public Councils & MARCH 29, 1782  depart unmolested. It is not even pretended, to be believed that their Negotiations with the Enemy were calculated to deceive them. But it is alledged that the Difficulty of subduing the Grants by the Arms of the united States, the probability that the Attempt would compel them to take an active part with the Enemy, the immediate danger of our State, in such Case, and the Injury that would thence result to the united States in general, are sufficient Inducements in sound policy to countenance and Establish the Independence of the Grants. In short it is easy for Men to find reasons to justify a Measure suited to their Wishes.  We think, Sir, it would be well were we furnished with proofs of the Original & Progressive Extent & Objects of the criminal Negotiations of the Leaders of the Grants, with the Enemy & particularly of the Countenance given by them for recruiting for the British Service. We might perhaps Use them to advantage. We too well know the understanding, Sagacity & Integrity of your informant to doubt any part of his Intelligence and could wish to have it all minutely detailed in proof. And while we place the greatest Confidence in his Information we heartily join with him in Opinion that conciliatory Overtures such as You mention, followed by a spirited and vigorous Exertion of the civil Authority of the State would produce the most happy Effects, by enabling the Friends to our Govt. to shew themselves and vindicating our public Conduct to the World. These Steps notwithstanding the sinister Views of too many, it is to be hoped would induce Congress formally to pronounce agt. the Independence of the Grants. We are happy to find that our Legislature are disposed to pursue every Measure calculated to restore peace and good Govt. in that Quarter. The Acts You mention meet with our hearty Approbation because they will in our Opinion have the salutary Effects You expect. But we beg Leave to suggest. that perhaps, however justly the Conduct of some may deserve the severest punishment, sound policy may forbid any Exception in the Act of Grace to make it more palatable to some in high Station who have countenanced the Revolt & Treason of the Grants.  We heard of the narrow Escape of Allen & Fay. Laying aside our Just Resentments, it may, peradventure, have been better so, than otherwise.  Having foiled our Adversaries in the attempt to carry into Execution the Report of the Committee of last to establish the Independence of the Grants,(1) within the bounds therein limited we most impatiently wait for the Concurrent Resolutions of our Legislature. For tho nothing has since been attempted agt. Us; yet we know their Advocates only wait for a Change of Members to renew the Attempt. This Change will shortly happen. We therefore wish for those Resolutions & every Conciliatory Step of our Legislature that We may anticipate the renewal of the Subject.   In a Conference with the Secretary at War he advised that the State should exercise the Authority reserved to them in the Articles of Confederation by appointing Colonel Willet to his former Continental Rank which he said had been done in other Instances; & assured us that on being certified of this, he will do every Thing necessary on his part, and will by Letter to the Commr. in Chief (which he flatters himself with take Effect) endeavor to have the Command on our Frontiers so arranged, if it be requested by our Governmt. that Colonel Willet shall have no superior but a General Officer in that department of Service.(2)  Colonel Vanschaick's affair is also in good Train with the Secry.(3) He considers him and several other Officers as greatly injured by the promotion of General Hazen; and tho' he does not much like Brevets, he thinks it in the present Instance but a just Expedient to restore the Colonel to his Rank. These he say are his present Sentiments, that Congress should either thus reinstate him, which can be done without any Expence to the public; or permit him to retire on the expected Emoluments. The latter however we think would be a precarious dependence; because several of the States are determined agt. an half pay establishment; we shall therefore indeavor very shortly to obtain his matured Sentiments on the former; and should they be in its favor, We will move it in Congress. In the Interim we should be glad to be informed whether, if we should not succeed, the Colonel would wish to risk retiring on half pay.  We inclose a Copy of the Journals of on the Subject of promotions to the Rank of Major-General.(4) They speak plainly for themselves; and therefore need no Comment. We wish General Clinton may be immediately informed of them. Brigadiers Moultrie & McIntosh who are both on the Spot are much mortified by the preference they exhibit. They mean speedily as we are informed to signify it to Congress. We think they may be prevailed on to suspend this Step for a short Time, and should General Clinton Incline to make common Cause with them, We wish to be furnished by him without delay with the Means of doing it-a Memorial from him to Congress on the Subject may perhaps be proper.  The new Commissioners from the Grants are arrived (5) and their Accession to the Terms of August last is known, tho' not announced to Congress. It has leaked out that the Changes in that country are favorable for Us; & that their Leaders are held in detestation. A Short Time will perhaps furnish Us with particulars which We shall not fail to communicate.(6)  We are your Excellency's most obedt. and humble Servts. Wm. Floyd.(7)  Jno. Morin Scott.   ""

  Hond Sir Philada. March 30th 1782 Mr. J. Walker has safely delivered to me three letters from you attended with the money therein specified. He has also been so obliging as to undertake the conveyance of the several articles of Medicine you wanted with a gallon keg filled with good Port wine; to all which I add a large packet of Newspapers-and an Almanack. The last packet I sent was by a waggon returning to your neighbourhood which brought me a letter from Mr. W. Maury; By which I sent at the same time a small supply of Bark for my Mother.  I mentioned to you in one of my former letters that I had a prospect of getting on very favorable terms a few scarce books from a library brought hither for sale by Col. Zane. (1) My purchases of him have amounted in the whole to Nineteen pounds three shillings of this currency.(2) As I had not the money here for him, & he could not conveniently wait till it would be convenient for me to pay him, I was obliged to give him a draught on you. I hope you will be able to find means to satisfy it. If it can not be otherwise done than by a deduction from the further supply you have in contemplation for me I must submit to it. How far I shall depend on you for the resources necessary for my expences here not included in the legal provision, and for the arrearages into which I have unavoidably fallen, will be known as soon as the Assembly have finally decided on our accounts & the allowance which is to be made to us. This I suppose will be done at their Session in May next. Unless liberal principles prevail on the occasion, I shall be under the necessity of selling a negro.  I have not time to provide for this opportunity the information relative to the Copper plates.  The newspapers give you in general the intelligence we have from Europe. As far as we are enabled to Judge of the views of the British Cabinet, the misfortunes of one more campaign at least will be necessary to conquer their obstinacy. They are attempting a separate peace with the Dutch & talk of suspending their offensive war agst. us, & directing their whole resources agst. the naval power of France & Spain. If this be their real plan we may be sure they do not mean by it to abandon their pretensions to the U. States but try another mode for recovering them. During their offensive exertions agst. our Ally, they can be practising insidious ones agst us, and if in the first they should be successful, & in the latter disappointed, a renewal of a vigorous war upon us will certainly take place. The best MARCH 30, 1782  security agst. every artifice & every event will be such military preparation on our part as will be sufficient either to resist or expell them as the case may require.

  Dear Sir Philada. April 2d. 1782. The only event with which the period since my last has enabled me to repay your favor of the 25th Ulto.(1) is the arrival of four Deputies from Vermt. with a plenipotentiary commission to accede to the confederacy. The business is referred to a Committee who are sufficiently devoted to the policy of gaining the Vote of Vermont into Congress. The result will be the subject of a future letter.(2)  The thinness or rather vacancy of the Virginia line, & the little APRIL 2, 1782  prospect of recruiting it are subjects of a very distressing nature. If those on whom the remedy depends were sensible of the insulting comparisons to which they expose the State, & of the wound they give to her influence in the General Councils, I am persuaded more decisive exertions would be made. Considering the extensive interests & claims which Virga. has, & the enemies & calumnies which these very claims form agst. her, She is perhaps under the strongest obligation of any State in the Union to preserve her military contingent on a respectable footing, and unhappily her line is perhaps of all in the most disgraceful condition. The only hope that remains is that her true policy will be better consulted at the Ensuing assembly, & that as far as a proper sense of it may be deficient, the expostulations of her friends and clamours of her enemies will supply the place of it.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia March [April] 2d 1782. I am this Moment come from a most animated debate in Congress; which produced an hasty adjournment; and that will probably produce a still more animated debate to morrow. The Subject was this-Yesterday were laid upon the Table and read a Letter from the new Commissioners from the Grants to the President of Congress with a duplicate Commission to them and the Resolutions of the Pretended Legislature of the Grants releasing and relinquishing their Eastern and Western Wings in the Terms prescibed by the Resolutions of Congress of August last. (1) On reading the Letter a Motion was made that the said Letter and papers together with every other paper which had been recd. by Congress Since the 20th Augt. last on this Subject should be committed. Upon this Question the Yeas and Nays were called for by Me; and the Question was carried for the Affirmative. A Committee of five was moved for and carried. And to the dishonor of the Majority four Members were balloted in, who have been avowed favourers, and I may say open Supporters of the Claim of independence by the People of the Grants, and one New Hampshire Delegate-All this with evident design to exclude New York and the Southern States from the Committee. This sinister purpose I mean to endeavor to elude by APRIL 2, 1782  endeavoring to get the Committee enlarged to a Grand Committee to consist of a Member from each State. But to return to the Subject of this day's debate. On reading the Journals of yesterday pursuant to a standing Rule of the House they were found defective in this Instance to wit; that tho' they contained a recital of the Letter from the Commiss'rs yet no other papers referred to by the Motion and resolution were entered on the Journals, Which we contended, as the Motion and resolution were founded not on oral but written Matters and the Yeas and Nays were called for, ought to have been entered in hac Verba; and this Diminution of the Journals was the Ground of the debate. I had these Reasons for insisting on the Insertion of all the Papers referred to, to wit; the abovementioned Letter asserts that the State of Vermont had in every instance endeavored strictly to conform with the Resolutions of Congress; while a Letter from Mr. Chittendon recd. by Congress since the 20th of Augt. last, and a Resolution of their Legislature inclosed therein, and which were omitted out of the Journals, contained an express Rejection of the Overtures made by Congress in Augt. last, By which not only the first abovementioned Letter was falsified, but the Rejection contained in the Second excluded the Grants from the Benefit of their after-Compliance with those Overtures. One of the papers omitted was the Concurrent Resolutions of our Legislature of October last, which have never yet been, and I wish now to have properly inserted in the Journals.(2) My Reason for supposing that to morrow's debate will be still more animated, is, that from the Want of Candor in our Opponents, I fear they will insist that it will be too late to morrow, to rectify the Journals. In short tho' there are a respectable Minority in Congress bent on aiming at securing Justice to our State; yet it is evidently the fixed and setled purpose of the Majority to sacrifice its Rights on the Altar of the Independence of Vermont. As Justice is not to be expected f-rom this Quarter I hope the State will do Justice to itself. Be please[d] to excuse the Want of transcribing as I fear the Mail will be closed. And believe Me tho' in haste to be with not the less Sincerity and Esteem, Dear Governor, Your Excellency's most obedt humble Servt,  Jno. Morin Scott.  [P.S.] Please present my Compliments to Col. Varick and inform him I bro't his Affair before the Committee of the Week this day.(3)  MS not found; reprinted from Burnett, Letters, 6:324-25.  1 Although a letter from the new commissioners from Vermont (Jonas Fay, Moses Robinson, Paul Spooner, and Isaac Tichenor) was received and referred to committee on April 1, there is no entry in Secretary Thomson's journals for April 2. See JCC, 22:157-61; PCC, item 40, 2:273-76; and Walton, Records of Vermont,.2:386-87.   2 The New York delegates attempted unsuccessfully to have the \""Concurrent Resolutions of our Legislature\"" entered on the journals on April 3, but succeeded in their request the following day.

The Strong Outlines you have drawn of the mellancholy real Situation of our Country in all points correspond exactly with what my anxious imagination had formed, whenever reason & reflexion led me to consider an Object allways uppermost in my mind; the picture is easily fill'd up, it is a melancholy one, & I fear with you that nothing but Time & skillfull management can restore that firm, orderly, & composed mode of proceeding so essential to establish the publick Happiness which is or ought to be the wish of all. I have much confidence in the Ability & Integrity of the men chosen to conduct affairs. I think I know the purity of their Intentions & I trust their Councills may yet lead us to prosperity.  Upon mature Consideration of all Circumstances; of the unmerited Sufferings of so many, & of the resentments necessarily rous'd in a people whom I know to be naturally generous & Sensible, I rejoice that matters have been Conducted with so much moderation & Temper; tho' I could have wishd the Idea of Confiscation had been totally abolish'd, or at least put off till entire secure possession [of the] Country had restor'd Tranquillity, & the publick mind was free & open to the guidance of cool dispassionate reason.  Your Sentiments upon the Subject are those of the Patriot & the friend of human Nature, & I wd. there had been more of your way of thinking-upon a thorough Investigation of this mode of Punishment, even in Cases of Treason, I have been & am principled against it; I cannot approve of the inhuman Sentence of visiting the Sins of the Fathers upon the guiltless women [and] Children, notwithstanding the sacred Authority which may be quoted for it. It is a Doctrine suited only to the Climates of Despotism, & abhorrent to the dignified Spirit of pure & genuine republicanism. In the Eye of reason the Individual shd. stand or fall by his own Actions, & those connected should be involved in the punishment no farther, than they have been partakers in the Crime. Banishment of the Individual, & a deprivation of the Benefits of Citizenship & property for life are surely sufficient both as a punishment & a prevention of Crimes, APRIL 7, 1782  without reducing a whole family for the Sin of one to misery & destruction.

I must also trouble you with keeping the Bills themselves for me; that they may be ready to be disposd of, or to draw the interest as hereafter may appear most beneficial.  You will oblige me much, by letting me know, whether, the grant made me by your Assembly has been located, or in what state it rests.(2) It gave me great pleasure to hear, that you & Mrs. Warren were settled so near Boston, & at so beautiful a Seat as that of the late Govr. Hutchinson. It has not always happend in like manner, that the forfeited Seats of the wicked, has been filld with men of virtue. But in this corrupt world, it is sufficient that we have some examples of it for our consolation.  The detection of Mr. Deane, seems not to have drawn any punishment nor even odium on those who countenancd & profited by his wickedness. Among these Dr. Franklin & Mr. R. Morris, are the  APRIL 8, 1782  most conspicuous. The latter was obligd to acknowlege in the Newspapers that he was in partnership with Mr. D. but pretended he thought him a man of honor. The Doctor by Letters of the strongest recommendation endeavord to deceive Congress into a renewal of their confidence in him, with a new & important appointment. There are Letters in town from Mr. Searle, late member of Congress, declaring that he has been repeatedly scandalizd by hearing Mr. Deane utter the abuse against America & France, which is containd in his intercepted Letters, at Dr. F 's table, without any reprehension from the Doctr. Under all these suspicions, Dr. Franklin is appointed one of the Commissioners to negociate a peace, because France wills it; & Congress are complaisant enough to say- they trust in his zeal & integrity, God forgive them!  The Fishery, I am afraid, is the object & will be the sacrifice of this appointment. This question will come on in Congress, & I think your ablest members shoud be here. But Instructions from Congress will avail little, if a corrupt Commissioner is entrusted with them, who certainly never meaning to return to this Country, will feel himself very easy about our reproaches, while he is enjoying in France the reward of his treachery. I know from what passd at the treaties we concluded, that to monopolize the Fishery is the object of France, & I am most sure that Dr. Franklin will be the instrument of effecting it.  The members from your State, & from Connecticut, seem desirous of admitting Vermont into the Confederation; but it appears very doubtful, whether this can be done agreable to the Confederation or consistent with true policy. The small States, upon this precedent, may dismember the great ones; or as they have an equal voice in proportioning the Quotas, may combine together to burthen the larger States with the whole expence. To acknowlege their independence without giving them a voice in Congress woud answer I conceive every purpose of attaching them to our cause, without hazarding our union by admitting them a member of the confederation.  Please to remember me to Mrs. Warren who I hope feels the benefit to her health & spirits, of better Society & a more healthy situation.  I have not time to write to our friend Mr. S. Adams, but be so  good as to assure him that I remember him with unalterable respect & affection. Genl Ward, Mr. Otis, & all our worthy friends have my best wishes.

  Dear Sir Philada. April 9th. 1782 The paper of this morning will make a small but high seasoned addition to the treat afforded you by our last parliamentary intelligence.(1) A French frigate is lately arrived at Rhode Island which has brought despatches for the Chevr. de la Luzerne, the contents of which are not yet disclosed. The Cargo of the Frigate is said to be coin for their army. She was destined for Chesapeak, but unluckily chased into another port.(2) It is added that she sailed from Brest with a large fleet under de Guichen who had repaired the havoc of Kampenfelt & the storm and was proceeding for the West Indies. Our Intelligence from this last quarter seems to authorize an expectation that a powerful descent has before this been made on Jamaica, by the combined armaments of France & Spain.  A more authentic copy of the Capitulation of Brimston[e] Hill supplies an omission which excited some little surprize. The Garrison is expressly restrained from serving agst. the Allies of France as well as against the King himself whose name alone was inserted in the copy first brought hither. Whether this omission was mere mistake in the English Printer or one of those little dirty frauds which they have so often practised is uncertain.  A Flag from N.

I have inclosed to Mr. J. the paper of this morning which contains all the news current without doors. ] Within doors nothing worth particularizing has taken place. The Committee on the affair of Vermont have made no report as yet.  I perceive by a passage cited in the \""Examination of the Connecticut claim to lands in Pennsa.\""(2) that we have been mistaken in supposing the acquiescence of Virginia in the defalcations of her Chartered Territory to have been a silent one. It said that \""at a meeting of the Privy Council July 3. 1633, was taken into consideration the Petition of the Planters of Virginia remonstrating that some grants had lately been obtained of a great proportion of the lands & territories within the limits of the Colony there, and a day was ordered for further hearing the parties (to wit Ld.

His Cash being exhausted he intends to return next Week, as I, for the like Cause, shall be obliged to do in a few days after, And it will be with the greatest Reluctance. To leave the State at this critical Juncture unrepresented is truly distressing. It will give great Pleasure to a prevailing Party in Congress; but it cannot probably be avoided. From the known disposition of the Members to whom the acquiescence of the Grants to the Overtures of Congress of Augt. last was referred I expect a Report declaring that the Grants have complied with those Overtures, and recommending the Reception of their Delegates, now on the Spot, into Congress. Should this Event take place, there is the highest reason to fear that the Overtures our State have in Contemplation with those People will be rejected; that they will immediately receive open Countenance and Support from the New England States; and that Congress will not only abandon Us; but probably reprobate, and perhaps author[it]atively interpose, to prevent our doing ourselves Justice.  APRIL 9, 1782  I have the Honor to inclose to your Excellency Extracts from the Journals on the Receipt of the dispatches from the Grants. The Subject took up three or four days in warm debate. Our friends of whom You have already been informed exerted great Energy in our Behalf. This You will see from the Extracts; which is exclusive of the animated part they took with Us throughout the whole debates. Thro' those they facilitated our Triumph, with which those Extracts are clearly marked.(1)  MS not found; reprinted from Burnett, Letters, 6:327-28.  1 Scott undoubtedly enclosed extracts from the journals of April 1, 3, and 4, for which see JCC, 22:157-58, 161-73; and Scott to Clinton, April 2, 1782.

  Dear Colonel Philadelphia April 9th. 1782  I have been a considerable Time endeavoring to procure the favorable Opinion of Members out of Doors for making a General Rule of Congress for securing the depreciation to Officers whose Cases are not included in former Resolutions of Congress; but to no purpose, as some of the States are unwilling to make good the depreciation. I was therefore obliged last Week to put your Case on its own Bottom, by a Memorial which I drew and signed with your Name. It was referred to the Secretary at War.(1) I yesterday called on him to urge his Report. He immediately drew the draft of it in my presence and would not have delayed it one Moment; but Congress rose before it could be fairly transcribed. It will I suppose come in to day; and when it does will probably be referred to the Committee (of which I am one) to whom Commodore Wyncoop's Memorial on the like Subject is referred. I shall soon be able to inform You of its Result.(2)  I have no News to communicate to You. If the Legislature should be still sitting be pleas'd to present my Compliments to Mr Athetoid & inform him I have received his favor and should have answered it. But understanding, that the Legislature were near rising, and the different Subjects of his Letter being delicate in their Nature, I feared he might be gone home & My answer might miscarry while probably it would at all Events come too late.  I am, Dear Varick your affectionate Friend and very humble Servt. Jno. Morin Scott  [P.S.] This Morning while I was attending on Committee Business in the Committee Chamber the Report of the S. at War came in. In my APRIL 9, 1782  afd. absence a Motion was made to postpone it because it was calculated to provide for his deputy before his principal, but no resolution passed on it. I shall therefore take it up to morrow; & press it with all the force I am able.  ""

A has been up, and laid me under Contribution to the Amount of £60, which I had not to pay. Your mother has received her part £3. Layler promised to have one of his best hats finished for you today, wish he may Comply with it, if he does not, you shall have the hat by the next Opportunity. Would have you write to Mr. L Oneal, that Ned is for sale. If L. gives this out, it may induce Ned to Come in to him. Christian Stouder must Apply to the Land office. I made an application for a warrant for him prior to Jo. Woods Application, which will have preferance. I have Sent the Key of a Trunk which stands in our Room above stairs behind the Door in which are all my papers relative to the office. The Bundles you will find are alphabetical, and you may readily find the Certificates Mr. T. Beatty wants, which you will be pleased to Copy.

You will observe Many of the Bundles are Indorsed \""Certificates to be Copy'd\"" whereever that is the Case, the partys have not had Copies, to which they have a right, without further Charge-but where you find no such Indorsment on the Bundles, Copies have been made out. You will find among the papers, a great number of Certificates which have been made out for the Land office and not returned the fees not being paid, and I think there may be a few in a small Bundle by themselves on which the fees have been paid, but was not sent before I left home but of this I Am not Certain, they should be sent inclosed to the office by the first Opportunity. Should any Certificate be applyed for that is made out and not returned to the office, you will be pleased on receiving the fees to Inclose them and direct to the Land office, and deliver it to the party or send it by some safe Opportunity. The fees are Charged in my fee Book, which is a small Book Covered with parchment and wrote Fee Book on the Back. The fees  APRIL 10, 1782  I think are Charged in Tobacco, and must be discounted at 1216. Interest ought to be Charged from the time the work was done. Whether the Book is in the Trunk I Know not, but you will find it some where about the House. There are many Copys of plats and Certificates made out for the party, which have not been Called for-you will find in Bundles by themselves and which may be delivered if wanting-the fees have been paid.

  Dear Sir Philada. 16th Apl. 1782  Enclosed is copy of a (wise) report drawn by a comtee. on the affair of our quota.(1) This wisdom you may be assured I used my utmost efforts to oppose because it is the wisdom of this world, and savours of the Mammon of unrighteousness. It was largely debated. I made a motion to postpone the report to introduce the following resolution, viz, That 66512 dollers be deducted from the quota of New Hampshire, it appearing said state was overrated that sum. I calld the yeas and nays, but it was determined against me. You wd. have been diverted to have heard the many wise tho very different reasons given against making the deduction. The principal & most oratorical reasoning was this, that the 8 miln. dollers wd. be thereby diminished, unless whatever should be deducted could be aded to the quota of some other state: and no state was willing to take it. I have seen a debate in a genl. Court (to compare small things with great) when a town has applied to get part of its tax taken of, not unlike the present. The affair is not yet settled. Whether the report will be recd. or undergo some alterations or be totally rejected I know not. I intend to act my part properly, if I can. Vermont is not yet settled.(2) As soon as these two things are dispatched one way or another I shall resign my seat in congress to return home as my family and circumstances loudly call for me. The court no doubt will forward the new delegates as soon as they can. Tis probable I shall leave this place by the first of May.  I have the honour to be, Your most obedt Servant,  Sam Livermore ""

  Dear Sir Phila. April 16th 1782 Your favor of the 24 of March (1) with a letter inclosed for Mr. Marbois came to hand yesterday.  I intreat that you will not suffer the chance of a speedy and final determination of the territorial question by Congress to affect your purpose of tracing the title of Virga. to her claims.(2) It is in the first place very uncertain when a determination will take place, even if it takes place at all; & in the next it will assuredly not be a final one, unless Virga. means to be passive & silent under aggression on her rights. In every event therefore it is proper to be armed with every argument & document that can vindicate her title. Her adversaries will be either the U States, or N.Y. or both. The former will either claim on the principle that the vacant country is not included in any particular State & consequently falls to the whole, or will cloath themselves with the title of the latter by accepting its cession. In both cases it will be alledged that the Charter of 1609 was annulled by the resumption of it into the hands of the crown, and that the subsequent grants to Maryland &c. denote this to have been the construc- APRIL 16, 1782  tion of it; that the Proclamation of 1763 has constituted the Alleghany Ridge the Western limit of Virga. & that the letter of Presdt. Nelson on the subject of a New Colony on the Ohio,(3) relinquishes on the part of Virga. all interference with the Authority of the Crown beyond that limit. In case the title of N.Y. should alone be opposed to that of Virginia, It will be further alledged agst. the latter that the treaties of 1684, 1701, 1726, 1744 & 1754 between the Govt. of the former & the 6 Nations have annexed to it all the Country claimed by those nations & their tributaries, and that the expence of N. York in defending & protecting them ought in equity to be reimbursed by this exclusive advantage. The original title of N.Y. is indeed drawn from the charter to the Duke of York in 1663-4, renewed after the treaty of Westminster in 1674.(4) But this Charter will not I believe reach any territory claimed by Virga.  Much stress will also be laid on the Treaty of Fort Stanwix particularly as a bar to any corroboration of the Claim of Virga. from the Treatys of Lancaster & Loggstown. It is under this Treaty that the companies of Inda. & Vandalia shelter their pretensions agst. the claims of Virga. &c. &c. see the pamphlets entitled Public good & plain facts.(5) As these pretensions can be of no avail unless the Jurisdiction of Congress, or N York at least can be established, they no otherwise deserve notice than as sources of calumny & influence on public councils; in both which respects it is the interest of Virga. that an antidote sd. be applied.  Mr. Randolph during his stay here was very industrious & successful in his researches into the territorial claims of all the States, and will be able to furnish you with many valuable hints. Your visit to Richmond in May will give him an opportunity.(6)  Our information from Europe has been peculiarly defective of late. It seems little probable that any decisive steps have been or will speedily be taken towards either a partial or general peace. The weight of the war will probably fall on the West Indies at least in the early part of the Campaign. Whither it will then be shifted is altogether uncertain.

 Rhode Island Delegates to William Greene Sir, Philadelphia Apl. 16th. 1782 We trust that our silence for some time past will be attributed not to a neglect of duty, but to its true cause, the want of something to communicate to government worthy of its notice.  Our time since we wrote last hath been employed chiefly in attending to private petitions and applications, in defining more particularly the duties of the Secretary of Congress, of the Secretary of war, and of the Secretary for foreign affairs; and in devising ways to reduce the numbers & salaries of staff officers.  Sensible of the burthen under which their constituents labour Congress are desirous to alleviate it by lessning as much as possible the expences of the war; and we expect from the (Economical measures which have been and will be taken a considerable reduction will be made.  The principal matter which hath lately come before us is an Act of the State of Vermont, complying with the resolutions of Congress of August last, and appointing delegates to represent them in that body. It and other papers relative to Vermont were and stand committed. What the final result will be we cannot undertake to say Some States will oppose their being admitted into the federal union; because it might affect the balance of power by throwing an aditional weight into the eastern scale; and because it might be a precedent for augmenting the number of the confederated States already too large.  They will be greatly embarrassed by the resolution of August; but they will endeavour to avoid the promise strongly implied in that resolution, by opposing the former non-compliance of the State of Vermont with the conditions on which that promise is founded, to their present compliance.  The report of a committee on cessions of Western lands to the United States, which is also a matter of importance, and which hath long laid upon the table, is this day taken up; but we believe will not be speedily determined. (1)  Yesterday Congress received a letter from Genl. Green dated at Pon-pon March 11th respecting the state of the army under his APRIL 16, 1782  command.(2) Nothing new had occurred. At the same time they received letters from Europe. One from Dr. Franklin inclosing two letters from a gentleman in Holland;(3) one of them dated Amsterdam, Jany. 7th in which he says, The rage of the English faction hath increased with their ill sucesses in America, That the loan for five million guilders if filled &c. In the other dated the 17th Jany. he mentions that Mr. Adams had demanded a categorical answer to his propositions for entering into a treaty with the U. Provinces, and that the deputies of the States had taken the same ad referendum. That the United Provinces will not make a truce with Great-Britain, nor suspend their preparations for carrying on the war during the negotiations for a peace under the mediation of the Empress of Russia; nor will they make peace with Britain unless they can enjoy all the rights of free trade according to former treaties, and the present armed neutrality.  A letter from Marquiss de Lafayette of the 29th of Jany.4 mentions that Dr. Franklin had made him his political aid de camp, that the King his master had great affection for us; and that he (the Marquis) would do every thing in his power to serve us.  Our Commissioners have met those appointed by the British for settling the terms of a cartel: but we know not how far they have proceded in that business. We have for some time past had under consideration measures for relieving the distresses of our seamen in captivity- but have waited for the result of the conference in order to come to a determination. We have only to add at present that we are with sentiments of the highest respect, Your Excellency's most obedt. servants, William Ellery  Ezekiel Cornell [P.S.] I am told by one of the So Carolina delegates that Genl.

I will not attempt to describe its attack or my manoeuvres to combat them-tis sufficient that I carried my point with but little loss-for which I was principally indebted to the fine Season, the fine weather and good Roads. I found my Bretheren APRIL 19, 1782  deeply engaged in Indiana affairs-but as I thought when with you so I now think, that Virginia has no real cause of Alarm. She stands on firm ground and I do not think an inch of it will be yielded-or can be wrested from her but in the mode she has herself prescribed-she stands on the Ground of the Constitution of the Federal Union-what can shake this foundation but the wrath of an offended Deity. Quirks, Quibbles, shifts (and I assure you they are not wanting on the other Side) will in this age (whatever they may do in another Century) give way to sound reason and common sense. You will find nevertheless on perusing the late Papers and in conversations industriously circulated by the Indiana &c. Claimers and their abettors what unwearied pains has been taken to Cultivate the weak arts of finesse and imposition-the principal aim of which is to catch Credulous Gudgeons with the double view of accumulating money by the sale of shares, and requiring an accession of Interest by interesting a greater number of Proprietors. They have even gone so far as to order an Utopian Patent to be made out to Mr. Paine the Author of some pieces in favor of their Claims (2) in contradiction to which we must in prudence follow them and fight them with their own weapons. I therefore request that you will have inserted in one or both of the Virginia Papers the following Paragraph as coming from the Authority of a (3)  viz Notwithstanding the Impudent assertions, and false state of facts which has been held forth to the Public in various paragraphs of the News papers on this Continent and industriously Circulated by the Lordly claimants of millions of Acres of that Western Territory which Virginia has Ceded under certain restrictions for the Publick Good to the United states, and has steadily refused to grant to a few Individuals, We can assure the Publick-that the Honorable Congress, as a Body, has taken no step to confirm the Unfinished grants of the British King to those politic Individuals who at the expence of Millions yet unborn would erect themselves into petty Sovreigns, and defeat the purposes for which so many brave men have shed their dearest Blood in this virtuous Struggle for equal Liberty.

Dr. Elliot, your very obliging letter of the 28th ult., together with a diploma for an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the university over which you preside with so much deserved reputation.  I beg sir, you will be assured, and that you will assure the visiters and fellows of the university, that I have the highest sense of the honour they have conferred upon me.(1) Laudari a laudatis varis would be flattering to a person infinitely less deserving of praise than I can possibly think myself. It was with peculiar pleasure I read a diploma, conceived in language pure and elegant enough to have flowed from an ancient pen.  Liberty and letters sir, are so inseparably connected, that a lover of the one cannot but see with sincere satisfaction the cultivation and prosperity of the other. It is to the light which literature had diffused that we owe the assertion of our liberties, and to the continuance of the same we must owe their establishment and permanency. The eminent share which the university of Cambridge had in  APRIL 21, 1782  diffusing these salutary lights, by her example and instructions, has made her proportionally respected; and a perseverance in the same course will render her an honour and blessing to these United States. For an institution of such utility it is patriotism to pray, esto perpetua.  The American Academy of Arts and Sciences hath done me great honour in admitting me into their society, instituted for the best of purposes by gentlemen capable of fulfilling them.(2) I entreat you sir, to lay before them the due sense I have of the favour with which they have distinguished me, and to assure them that I shall ever be happy in contributing every thing within the compass of my poor abilities, to promote the valuable object of the institution.  Do me the favour sir, of accepting my thanks for the very polite and obliging manner in which you have signified the proceedings of the university and of the academy, and my best wishes for your health and prosperity.

  My dear friend, Philadelphia April 21st 1782 I cannot lose so good an opportunity as that of Dr Eliot, of enquiring after your health & hoping you are happy.  The Session of the Assembly of Virginia in May, calls me from Congress for a month or two to attend my duty there.(1) Indeed I do not see of what material use my attendance here can be, where I can only lament what I can not prevent, and make vain efforts to redeem an infatuated Majority from the bondage of folly & private interest. For what can be expected from an Assembly in which a Member is allowd to sit, who is avowedly an Agent for the Enemies to our cause & Country, an Insolvent & a profligate Adventurer. I mean Mr. Samuel Wharton.(2) This man, Sir, that in a Petition on the table of Congress(3) declares himself insolvent, not only sits & votes, APRIL 21, 1782  but treats the Members with magnificant Dinners. I am perfectly persuaded that it is the interest of the Companies which this Man is an Agent for and a member of to reduce us to the domination of G. Britain, because their Members being chiefly British & of great influence they woud by that means be secure of obtaining the Lands which it is impossible they shoud do while we are independant. And as these Agents are using every art to seduce us & to sow dissention among the States, I think they are more dangerous than the Enemy's Arms. Every motion relative to Vermont & the Cessions of the other States is directed by the interests of these Companies. I have in vain movd for a purifying declaration, from each member that he is not concerned in them. The Motion was evaded by three days chicane, & remains undecided.(4)  As to Vermont, I am clear we have no power to admit them into the confederation, & I am doubtful of the policy of it, if the power were unquestionable. The small States are already combining to dismember the large Ones. The addition of another will be a dangerous accession, & the disposal of property in quotaing each being by Votes not by interest, it will enable the small States to throw the whole burthen of the war upon the large Ones. But your Delegates do not think with me, which I lament. Sure I am that with the admission of this little State the confederation will end; its present inequality being as much as it can bear.(5)  Please to remember me to Mrs. Adams, to Genl. Ward, Mr. Bowdouin & his Family.  I do not believe your fellow-Citizens will ever part with you again, & therefore dispair of seeing you here.  I am with unalterable esteem & affection, dear Sir, yr. most Obedt. Servt. A. Lee  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia April 22nd. 1782. I applied to the Secretary for your commisns. He told me had sent you some abt. the begining of March, perhaps in answer to your letter;(1) but to remove all doubts, I told him to put up a few more, which are herewith sent.  You have been informed of my desire to leave Philadelphia abt. the begining of May. I was in hopes my intended successors would have been sent on, but your letters, and Col. Langdon's, shew me no probability of that, untill my return. The affair of Vermont is put by for the present, and their agents are gone home. The report concerning our quota of the 8 million dollers is committed to another committee. I hope it will be well considered & set right.(2) If that was got over, I should venture to resign my seat in congress: as there is great necessity of my paying a little attention to my own business. I shall find it necessary to make a small draft on you to carry me home. I suppose as the state has been repeatedly notified, through you, of my desire & intention to return abt. the first of May, there will be no umbrage taken at my resignation. I would be glad to avoid every thing of that kind, which made me so particular with you, and Col. Langdon, upon the subject.  Tis probable you will receive my resignation by next post;(3) And yet I don't know that this is necessary: I dont know the custom in such cases. I wish at all events the delegates to come on as soon as possible.  I have the honour to be, Your most obedt. humble servant. Samuel Livermore ""

  April 23d 1782 It is reduced to a certainty that terms for negociating a general Pacification have been offerd by the Mediating to the Belligerent Powers obliquely including the U.S. but rejected by G Britain in an apologetical Memorial, with which the High Mediators (the two Imperial Courts) do not seem well Satisfied-especially as France has Signified with Singular moderation her willingness to accept them for the sake of Peace, how wise! how Politic! how magnanimous! That nation seems determined to form the most striking contrast to the Character & conduct of Britain with what superior dignity does she rise and lift up America with her as it were to shew her to the astonished World.

  Mr dear Sir, Philadelphia Aprill 23d 1782 On full Consideration, I am clear of opinion that your Presence here will be necessary for the purpose you mention. I will mention my Plan, then you can do as you think best. As I am to tend the Superior Court at Trenton on the 2d Tuesday in May and as I shall want to be at Princeton a Day or two before Court, I shall wish to leave this on the Thursday or Friday before. The Stage leaves Princeton about Nine oClock on every Tuesday & Thursday-and the Coach leaves it at the same hour on Saturdays. From this State I think you had best leave home with the Waggon on the first day of May-leave the Waggon at Princeton & either take Horse or get into the Stage the next Morning and you will be here by Night, by which means you may stay here from Thursday the 2d May till Thursday the 9th. We will then return to Princeton in the Stage Coach all together. The only objection to this Plan is leaving the Horses at  APRIL 23, 1782  Princeton, where they are scarce of Forage. This will be remedied, by getting some Farmer in the Neighbourhood to keep them. Perhaps Colo Morgan who wants Horses, would keep them for their work. You can take the Mare, but Elisha told me at Trenton the Horse was going the way of all Flesh, so I can say nothing about him.  I cannot give you any Encouragement, about the Commodity in Mr F's Hands. Flour may be had for Cost at 14., Tea is 10/ & 12/ by the Box and rising.  I wish you to tell Josey, to have the Dung beat to pieces & spread over the Grass piece by the Barn, and all the Stones picked up. Some place ploughed for Corn to be well dunged very richly in the Hills- either below where the Corn was last Year, or rather over the Bridge where the Rye was Sowed, which will only want furrowing, unless Baird should chuse to sow or plant it to the halves which I promised him last fall-then it must be below the Barn.  I shall retain the Ministers Acct. We were yesterday amused by an Acct. in an Eastern Paper, that a Treaty has been perfected between Holland, France & America. Our letters are recd. so late, but they have a good Complection-Count de Guichen is arrived in the West Indies, 12 Sail of the Line & 10000 Men.  Mrs. B. wants Molly to send by you her white Cloak to ride home in. Mr Baird writes me to know if I will let him have 40 Bushels of Corn from Mr. Rickey. You may give him an order for as much as he wants, provided he first pays you the Cash for it at the Price other People sell at in the Neighbourhood.  Mrs. B. & Susan join in kindest Love to Sister, Mrs. P., Johnny, Molly and the Family.  Mrs Robertson has got into her House & is very well.  Am my Dr Sir, Yours Affectly.

  Dear Sir Philada. Apl. 23d. 1782 We have had here the same reports of the evacuation of Charleston which your letter of the 15 recites (1) but the wished for confirmation is still wanting. That it will take place in the course of the Campaign cannot I think be doubted if the military succours are yielded by the states in any proportion to the call for them & the maritime superiority of our Ally in the W.I. should keep up the apprehensions of the British Garrisons from that quarter. This superiority was for a while somewhat endangered by the arrival of Rodney before the Brest Fleet. It is now said though upon very unauthentic grounds, that the latter with a large reinforcement of land troops is safe at Martinique. This augmentation of the French force with that of Spain, to say nothing of the Dutch which is also said not to be contemptible, must submit every thing that is British in that quarter to the mercy of their Enemies.  We have recd. some communications from Europe, but none of them are of late date. It appears from them that the pride & stubbornness of the British Court had rendered abortive the mediatory purposes of Vienna & Petersburg. Unless therefore the misfortune in Virga. sd. have broken their spirit as well as blasted their hopes, and made them suitors for a renewal of the interposition of these Courts, no immediate expectations can be retained from that quarter. Nothing is said with regard to the separate negociation be- APRIL 23, 1782  twe[en] England & Holland. The recapture of the possessions of the latter with other circumstances has so entangled her with France that it will be very difficult for her to accomplish a separate pacification, even if she should be disposed to it.Vermont & the Western lands are still the themes which exercise our politics within doors. The Committe to whom the last application of the former to be admitted into the Confederacy was referred have according to expectation, reported that the measure is warranted by the Articles of Union & required by the engagements of Congress to them & expedient in itself. The true secret is that the Vote of Vermont is wished for as an auxiliary agst. the Western claims of Virga. Some of the small States may indeed wish for it also as an auxiliary to their party, but no other motive can prevail with D. & M (2) Some of the E. States which are anxious for the admission of Vermont see this and impede the adjustment of Western boundaries on the ground of the Cessions, lest that event should be followed by a secession of those 2 States. The radical impediment however is the influence of the land companies. We have in the course of the week past very sensibly experienced this influence.(3) As no answer had yet been given to the Cession of Virga. & the Legislature is shortly to meet, the Delegates thought it proper & accordingly proposed that the determination of Congress on that subject should without delay be come into. Every artifice that could perplex the case was immediately exerted: and it is extremely contingent, whether we shall be able to obtain an explicit answer to our reasonable request. We shall however continue to press it till Congress take some step which will either directly or indirectly, positively or negatively decide on the case & let the State know on what ground it is to form its measures.  Mr. Lee sets off tomorrow morning in order to be ready for his duty at Richmond. Mr. Jones will follow about a week hence. I regret much that Mr. Randolph's unnecessary return to Virga. will in consequence expose her vote to the risk of division.(4) I shall urge him to face about again & wish for the co-operation of yourself & his other friends. Unless the A-y (5) remove his apprehension of pecuniary distress his past experience will it is little to be doubted render him callous to every argument on that subject. I am Dr. Sir very sincerly yrs, &c.

Until Lee's return on June 27 only Madison and Theodorick Bland remained to represent Virginia. Madison's concern was realized on four occasions when their vote was divided-on another Bland was absent. See JCC, 22:242, 286, 294-95.  In Virginia Randolph wrote a May 16 letter to the speaker of the House of Delegates explaining that \""I should have offered myself to the general assembly for the purpose of information had not my colleague, Mr. A. Lee, been a member of the house of delegates. From him you will learn the posture of public affairs, the prospect of peace, as it is to be found in the temper of our ally, the mediating powers or our enemy, the state of our army and navy, the expenditure of money, the settlement of accounts, subsisting prior to the completion of the confederation, the operations of the bank, the provision made for the discharge of monies loaned, and the erection of a mint. The temper of congress with regard to Virginia and the motives of several resolutions can also be shewn by him.\"" Executive Communications, Vi. Later the same day he explained to Madison that \""I had a decent opportunity for avoiding examination before the house, by substituting Mr. Lee in my stead for every occurrence, which happened after his arrival at congress.

  Dr Sir Philada. Apl. 23d. 1782 I am at length assured of your safe arrival at your destination by your favor of the 11 continued on the 13th.(1) The little necessity I understand there was for your return to Virga. makes me exceedingly regret that you cd. not be diverted from it, as the little occasion there is likely to be according to Mr. Pendleton's idea of yr. continuance there flatters me that it will not be long before you resume your Station in Congress.(2) This duty may be the more enforced upon you, as Mr. Lee leaves us this morning & Mr Jones will follow in a few days. The vote of Virga. will in consequence be in all questions exposed to the chance of division. I am sensible of the plea which may be drawn from the emptiness of the public coffers; but I hope it will not be a permanent one, & that if you can only stay a few months with us you will not think the period unworthy of the expedition.  I informed you in my last that your draught was duly honored.(3) The advance was by no means distressful to me, but the prospect now before me obliges me to prefer repayment here to any other mode. It will not I hope make any difference with you. Mr Morris has recd. & answered your letter.(4) The return of the French Minister without visiting Richmond had no particular cause which I can explain. He expressed doubts on that point you may remember before he set out for Virginia.  Congress have recd from {the minister}(5) some informal communications relative to the issue of {the proposed mediation} of {Vienna  APRIL 23, 1782  and Petersburgh}. The {answer} of {the British court} to {the preliminary articles} is {among them}. It {rejects} explicitly that part of the {plan} which {requires concurrent negotiation between her} and {America} & {guaranties the result} as {incompatible} with {the relation} of {subjects} to their {sovereign} and {the} essential {interest} of {the empire, alleging} at the same time that a {part} of {the people are disposed} to {return} to their {allegiance} & that such a {treaty} wd. {supply the rebels} with {pretexts} for {misleading} them. The {final answer} of {the mediating courts} professes {great impartiality and} delicacy {toward the belligerent partys, adheres} to the {expediency} of the {first} & {hopes} that it may {still become} under more favorable {circumstances the basis} of {a general pacification}.  Another letter has come to hand from {Mr. Dana}. His {proposed rash} step was {probably} taken a {few days after the date} of {it} which was abt. the middle of {October}.(6)  The Committee on the last application from Vermont have reported fully in their favor. The consideration of the Report will not be called for however till the pulse of nine States beats favorably for it. This is so uncertain that the Agents have returned. The recognition of the Independence of Vermont is fully stated in the report as a resolution antecedent ev[en to?] authorizing a committee to treat with them on the terms of their admission.

  Sir, Philadelphia April 23rd, 1782 .... I have the Honor to inclose You a Copy of the Report of the Committee of five, and the Proceedings thereon. (1) Every congressional Step on the Subject of the Grants is marked with the most evident Partiality of a Majority in favor of the Revolters; and against our State. This naturally occasions very animated Debates; in which we are faithfully supported by the friendly States. It really grieves Me that the Want of Money will oblige Me in a few days to abandon a Cause which I have so much at Heart. This however must infallibly be the Case, if a fresh Supply should not speedily arrive. But I have so repeatedly wrote in this Strain, that I shall henceforth be silent on that Head forever; and submit, if I should not be supplied in a few days, to the mortifying Necessity of abandoning my Seat in Congress.  When the Business of the Grants will be resumed I know not. But I am determined if enabled to Stay here, not to let it sleep long. I suppose however our adversaries mean to appear to dream over it, until We rouse them. This Conclusion I draw from the departure of the plenipoes of Vermont who have, without my Knowledge obtained a Copy of the inclosed Report; to enable them, I suppose to make a popular Use of it, in the Country; and excite a revival in the Minds of People, of their declining disposition in favor of Independence.  Since I had last the Honor of writing to You, the long dormant Report on the Proffered western Cessions has been taken up. When the Question shall be put Massachusetts and Connecticut will doubtless be agt. Us, on their ridiculous Claim to extend to the South Seas. When the Report was taken up, we had warm debates, not on that Part of it which concerns our State; (for it reports fully in favor of our Cession) but on that Part of it which respects the Conditional Cession by Virginia. By the Illness of the President of Congress,(2) Maryland is unrepresented, which was not the Case, when the Report was made the Order of the day. For this Reason the Business is postponed without day, to allow Time for the President's Recovery. This delay we thought it prudent to give into; as we have sufficient Evidence that Maryland will vote in favor of that Part of the Report which concerns our State. And I flatter myself that the Result will be an Acceptance of our Cession. I know not, Sir, whether You have ever been furnished with a Copy of this Report. Should it not be the Case, and You would be kind enough to inform Me of it, I will, if my speedy departure should not Prevent Me, do myself the Honor of inclosing a Copy of it for your Use.  APRIL 23, 1782  The concurrent Resolutions of the Legislature of our State came to hand very unopportunely. A Report being then depending on a like Request in behalf of Connecticut, clogged with a Proviso in the Report, that the request be complied with, on Condition of their first filling up their continental Battalions.(3) Their deficiency is great. It amounts to upwards of 1400 Men, by the last returns in the War office; which is but one half of their Quota. They moved for striking out the Proviso, and substituting a Proposition in its stead. In the Course of the debate a Copy of their Act for filling up their Line was introduced, with a round assertion that it had made effectual Provision for filling up their Line; tho' when it came to be examined, it enacted no more than a Fine of £15 for delinquencies, and a draft in the last resort, for a short Service till the fall. This, with other Matters I took some pains to collect, convinced Me that they intended to apply their proposed ten Companies towards filling Up their Line. This was thoroughly seen thro' by the Majority; and the whole Report was rejected. We must therefore bring on some general Plan, which will refer to all the States; as there is no Reason to hope for a special discrimination in our Favor. In the Mean Time, your Excellency's known Zeal and Ardor, in compleating our Line, and providing for the defence of our Frontiers, would render it impertinent in Me, to urge the Necessity of the utmost dispatch as to both....

As soon as one arrives, we shall apprize him of the want of Commissions suggested by you.(1)  The office of the Superintendant of Finance does not contain the information you wish relative to the amount of payments made by the States in the new Continental bills, no regular returns having been yet transmitted thither. As far as the portion of these bills allotted to the use of Congress, shall be unissued, as also as far as the APRIL 23,1782  requisitions made in them on the States shall be unpaid, they will constitute a charge agst. the States respectively. But the rate at which they are to be charged is yet to be determined by Congress.(2)  The Delegates have long had it in charge from the Executive to provide a conveyance to Virginia of certain Stores taken on their passage from France & carried into Boston or if that could not be accomplished, to have them sold. They Iye in the hands of Mr. J. Bradford formerly an agent for the U. States. We have written various letters to him on the Subject, & recd. various answers without being able to fulfill either of the alternatives. The first indeed has been long relinquished. Our last letter requested him peremptorily to sell the Stores & remit the amount. The inclosed paper No. 1. is his answer, on which we shall await the pleasure of the Executive.(3)  We have again endeavored to obtain from Congress some explicit decision on the territorial cession of Virginia that the Assembly may not again be left in uncertainty on that subject. The sickness of the Presidt. which suspended the Vote of Maryland furnished a pretext for postponing the business which we judged it prudent to yield to. As soon as he returns to Congress which will probably be in a few days, we shall renew our proposition and continue to urge it till we obtain in some form or other such evidence of the purpose of Congress as will be satisfactory to the State.  Early in the last year a plan was formed by the Courts of Vienna & Petersburg for bringing about a general pacification under their mediation.

 Connecticut Delegates to Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.  Sir Philadelpa. 29th April, 1782. Your Excellencys Letter of the day (1) of February last inclosing the Acts of the Assembly respecting the paying and Subsisting at the general Expence Ten Companys proposed to be raised by the State was recd. by Congress-Upon which a Committee was Appointed to take the matter into Consideration with an Instruction to conferr with the Commander in Chief. This Committee after a longer delay than might have been expected brot in a Report. That it was the Opinion of the Commander in Chief that the State of Connecticut, was in similar Circumstances to that of N York (who had been allowed militia Regiments at the continental Expence)- And thereupon they reported-That the Ten Companys should be paid and Subsisted at the Expence of the States, but annexed a Proviso that it Should be upon Condition that the State should first fill up their Line in the Army. When the matter came before Congress We observed that the Proviso would defeat (if agreed to) every Benefit which the State might otherwise expect from the Resolution, for if the State should fail of furnishing every Recruit, a Circumstance which it was most unreasonable to expect, as no line since the  APRIL 29, 1782  War, nor any Army Ordained to consist of a definite number ever was compleat. The Proviso therefore might be considered as impossible in the performance. The Propriety of this Objection seemed to be very generally admitted.  But as We were sensible that the Subject would meet with considerable opposition, and that much stress would be laid upon the Increase of officers beyond the Proportion of the Privates And that no Troops ought to be at the general Expence but such as were altogether under the orders of the Commander in Chief, and as We had an intire Confidence in his Wisdom and Justice-We offered an Amendment to the Proviso-That no more officers Should be paid and Subsisted than in Proportion to the overpluss Number, of the Non Commission Officers and Privates computing both those of the Line of the Army and the new Levies-And that the Ten Companys should be under the orders of the Commander in Chief to operate anywhere within the United States. Other Gentlemen offered Amendments to that which we proposed without any Material Variance. On these Amendments which Were essentially the same, Votes were taken but none were agreed to, on one of them the Question was lost by a single Vote of the State which was divided. The Question was then put upon the original Resolution and rejected.  The Objections against the Application were that Should Congress comply with it others of a similar Nature would be made- That if the Lines of the Army were compleat which ought to be insisted upon such extra aid would be unnecessary-That the Condition of the Finances would not Admit of new Demands-That the adoption of such a Measure would seem to exclude the Idea of making the Exertions of particular States for their own Defence an object of publick Charge except in Cases which had been specially provided for by Congress. We observed that if any other State was equally exposed which but Very few were they would merit an equal Protection-That our Experience must compel Conviction that the Lines would not be full and that We proposed No Expence in support of officers but in proportion to the Number of Privates- That the State exposed as it was Ought not to be considered as able to furnish the pecuniary Aid required in Case she must be at the sole Expence of her own Protection-And that the Question was not wheither All the Expence of individual States for their Defence should be made a common Charge but who in the present Case ought to pay it in the first Instance. We represented the Condition of the State, and compared its Situation and the protection it recd with those of others But were sorry to find that our Efforts to support a Measure which to us appeared reasonable, was not attended with more success.(2)  We have no material News to communicate to your Excellency. The great naval Armament in the West Indies lead us to expect that   Events of an interesting Nature will take Place in that Quarter. We might perhaps mention what your Excellency may not have been fully informed of, that the Court of London has refused the Mediation of the Emperor and Empress, upon the Condition that America shall be an Object of the negotiation, so that the Business of Peace will be deferred till after another Campaign.  We feel ourselves disappointed that the other Gentlemen in the delegation are not here to relieve us. Mr. Wolcott is about to Return.(3) Mr. Law has so depended upon messenger Browne's being here before this Time, that from an Accident depending upon that circumstance, he will be compelled to tarry a little longer. We hope that your Excellency will Accelerate the Other Gentlemen to come forward, as the State ought to be represented.

10852,dg018469,1782,James Madison s Observations,"""James Madison's Observations
  May 1 st. 1782. The two great objects which predominate in the politics of Congress at this juncture are I. Vermont. II. Western territory.(1)  I The independence of Vermont and its admission into the Confederacy are patronised by the Eastern States (N. Hamshire excepted) 1. from antient prejudice agst. N York. 2. the interest which Citizens of those States have in lands granted by Vermont. 3. but principally from the accession of weight they will derive from it in Congress. N. Hamshire having gained its main object by the exclusion of its territory East of Connecticut River from the claims of Vermont, is already indifferent to its independence, and will probably soon combine with other Eastern States in its favor.  The same patronage is yielded to the pretensions of Vermont by Pennsylvania & Maryland with the sole view of reinforcing the opposition to claims of Western territory particularly those of Virginia and by N. Jersey & Delaware with the additional view of strengthening the interest of the little States. Both of these considerations operate also on Rhode Island in addition to those abovementioned.  The independence of Vermont and its admission into the Union are opposed by N. York for reasons obvious & well known.  The like opposition is made by Virginia, N. Carolina, S. Carolina, and Georgia. The grounds of this opposition are. 1. an habitual jealosy of a predominance of Eastern Interests. 2. the opposition expected from Vermont to Western claims. 3. the inexpediency of admitting so unimportant a State, to an equal vote in deciding on peace & all the other grand interests of the Union now depending. 4. the influence of the example on a premature dismemberment of other States. These considerations influence the four States last mentioned in different degrees. The 2 & 3 to say nothing of the 4 ought to be decisive with Virginia.  II The territorial claims, particularly those of Virginia are opposed by Rhode Island, N. Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware & Maryland. Rhode Island is influenced by her opposition by 1. a lucrative desire of sharing in the vacant territory as a fund of revenue. 2. by MAY 1, 1782  the envy & jealousy naturally excited by superior resources & importance. N. J., Penna., Delaware, Maryland, are influenced partly by the same considerations; but principally by the intrigues of their Citizens who are interested in the claims of land Companies. The decisive influence of this last consideration is manifest from the peculiar, and persivering opposition made agst. Virginia within whose limits those claims lye.  The Western claims, or rather a final settlement of them, are also thwarted by Massachussetts and Connecticut. This object with them is chiefly subservient to that of Vermont, as the latter is with Pennsylvania & Maryland to the former. The general policy and interests of these two States are opposed to the admission of Vermont into the Union, and if the case of the Western territory were once removed, they would instantly divide from the Eastern States in the case of Vermont. Of this Massachussetts & Connecticut are not insensible, and therefore find their advantage in keeping the territorial Controversy pending. Connecticut may likewise conceive some analogy between her claim to the Western Country & that of Virginia, and that the acceptance of the cession of the latter, would influence her sentiments in the controversy between the former & Pennsylvania.  The Western claims are espoused by Virga., N & S Carolinas, Georgia & N. York, all of these States being interested therein, S. Carolina is the least so. The claim of N. York is very extensive, but her title very flimsy. She urges it more with the hope of obtaining some advantage, or credit, by its cession, than of ever maintaining it. If this Cession should be accepted, and the affair of Vermont terminated, as these are the only ties which unite her with the Southern States, she will immediately connect her policy with that of the Eastern States; as far at least, as the remains of former prejudices will permit.

10853,dg018470,1782,James Madison to Edmund Randolph,"""James Madison to Edmund Randolph
  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, May 1, 178[2]. The case of the vessel captured within North Carolina was some time since remitted to Congress by Governor Harrison.(1) I am glad to find your ideas correspond so exactly with those I had advanced on the subject.(2) The legislative power over captures, and the judiciary in the last resort, are clearly vested in Congress by the Confederation. But the judiciary power in the first instance, not being delegated, is as clearly reserved to the Admiralty Courts of the particular States within which the captures are made. Captures made on the high seas must fall within the jurisdiction of the State into which it shall please the captor to carry them. It will be sufficient, I believe, to insert in the instructions to privateers, a clause for preventing the grievance complained of by North Carolina. The anger of Mr. Burke was erroneous in its principle, as well as intemperate in its degree. The offender being an officer of Congress,(3) and not of Virginia, Congress, and not Virginia, should have been resorted to for redress.  On a consultation before Doctor Lee left us, it was determined that we ought to renew our attempts to obtain from Congress a decision on the cession of Virginia, before the meeting of the Legislature. The attempt was accordingly made, and produced all the perplexing and dilatory objections which its adversaries could devise. An indisposition of the President, which suspended the vote of Maryland, furnished an argument for postponing, which it was prudent to yield to, but which is now removed by the arrival of Mr. Wright, a new Delegate from that State. We shall call again on Congress for a simple answer in the affirmative or the negative, without going into any unnecessary discussions on the point of right; and should the decision be postponed sine die, we hope the State will consider itself at liberty to take any course which its interest shall suggest.(4) It happens very unluckily that Virginia will only have two Representatives present during the interesting business. Mr. Jones cannot be prevailed on to wait the event.(5) Colonel Bland thinks the validity of charters unimportant to the title of Virginia, and that the title of the natives militates against the claims of the companies. Is not my situation an enviable one?  A letter which I received a few days ago from Mr. Jefferson gives me a hope that he will lend his succor in defending the title of Virginia.(6) He professes ignorance of the ground on which the report of the committee places the controversy. I have exhorted him not to drop his purpose, and referred him to you as a source of copious information on the subject. I wish much you and he could unite your ideas on it.(7) Since you left us I have picked up several MAY 1, 1782  pamphlets which had escaped our researches. Among them are the examination of the Connecticut claim,(8) and the charter of Georgia, bound up with that of Maryland and four others.(9) Presuming that a better use will be made of them, I will send them by Mr. Jones, requesting, however, that they may be returned by the hands of him, Dr. Lee, or yourself, as the case may be.  A further communication from the French Minister informs us, that the court of France laments the weakness of our army; insinuates the idea of co-operation in expelling the enemy from the United States; apprehends attempts to seduce the States into separate negotiations, and hopes measures will be taken to frustrate such views. I believe, from this and other circumstances, that the Court of France begins to have serious suspicions of some latent danger. It is extremely probable, that as the enemy relax in their military exertions against this country, they will redouble the means of seduction and division. This consideration is an additional argument in favor of a full representation of the States. In a multitude of counsellors there is the best chance for honesty, if not of wisdom.  The subject of Vermont has not yet been called up. Their agents and those of the land-mongers are playing with great adroitness into each others' hands. Mr. Jones will explain this game to you. Colonel Bland is still schismatical on this point. I flatter myself, however, that he will so far respect the united opinion of his brethren as to be silent. Mr. Lee entered fully into the policy of keeping the vote of Vermont out of Congress.  The refugees from New York have lately perpetrated one of the most daring and flagrant acts that has occurred in the course of the war. A captain of militia of New Jersey, who unfortunately fell a captive into their hands, was carried to New York confined successively in different prisons, and treated with every mark of insult and cruelty; and finally brought over to the Jerseys, and in cold blood hanged. A label was left on his breast, charging him with having murdered one of their fraternity, and denouncing a like fate to others. The charge has been disproved by unexceptionable testimony. A number of respectable people of New Jersey have, by a memorial, called aloud on the Commander-in-Chief for retaliation; in consequence of which he has, in the most decisive terms, claimed of Sir Henry Clinton a delivery of the offenders up to justice, as the only means of averting the stroke of vengeance from the innocent head of a captive officer of equal rank to the Jersey captain. The answer of Clinton was not received when General Washington despatched a state of the transaction to Congress. (l0)  MS not found; reprinted from Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:195-97.  1 See Virginia Delegates to Benjamin Harrison, April 2, 1782, note 1.   2 For Randolph's April 19 letter on the Three Friends case, see Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:159-61.  3 That is, privateer captains sailed under congressional letters of marque.  4 The Virginia delegates moved again this day for consideration of the November 3 committee report on western land cessions, which had been reintroduced on April 16, and Arthur Lee's amended motion of April 18 that all delegates declare whether they were \""personally interested\"" in the claims of any of the land companies. See JCC 22:223; and Arthur Lee to Samuel Adams, April 21, note 4. For the committee's report, which was entered in the journals for the first time this day, see Edmund Randolph to Thomas Nelson, November 7, 1781, note 4. Although the Virginia delegates were able to defeat a motion to postpone consideration of the report, Congress adjourned before providing a \""simple answer\"" on the acceptance or rejection of the state's cession and the following day Theodorick Bland's attempt to obtain a decision on Arthur Lee's motion was voted \""out of order.\"" Despite tactical maneuvering on May 3 to place the report on the agenda, Virginia's opponents succeeded on May 6 in postponing consideration because they lacked the votes necessary for an outright rejection of the state's cession. See JCC, 22:223-37, 240-41; PCC, item 36, 1:293; and Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:198n.6, 203-4, 206-7. The subject did not come before Congress again until July 31 when it was resurrected by a grand committee seeking \""the most effectual means of supporting the credit of the United States.\"" See JCC, 22:243.  5 Joseph Jones had signed the delegates' April 30 letter to Benjamin Harrison and attended Congress this day, but he apparently left Philadelphia before Congress convened on May 2. See JCC, 22:233-34.  6 Undoubtedly Thomas Jefferson's letter of March 24, 1782, for which see Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:119-20.  7 See Madison to Jefferson, April 16, 1782, note 6.  8 For the Rev. William Smith's \""examination,\"" see Madison to Randolph, April 9, 1782, note 2.  9 For a collection of these six charters in the Jefferson Library, see the Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson, comp. by E. Millicent Sowerby, 5 vols. (Washington: Library of Congress, 1952-59), 3:275.  10 Madison succinctly described one of the more poignant and protracted episodes of the war. At the direction of the New York Board of Associated Loyalists, Capt. Richard Lippincott, a New Jersey loyalist \""refugee,\"" hanged a prisoner, New Jersey militia captain Joshua Huddy, on April 12 in retaliation for the death of his loyalist kinsman, Philip White. When reports of Huddy's hanging and demands for Lippincott's punishment were delivered to Washington, he conveyed the demands to Sir Henry Clinton, an action for which Congress declared \""their firmest support.\"" See JCC, 22:217-18. Clinton denied countenancing Huddy's hanging and courtmartialed Lippincott, who was eventually exonerated on the ground that he was only following orders. In the meantime, Washington permitted the selection of a British officer for retaliation if Huddy's executioners were not brought to justice, with the lot unfortunately falling upon Capt. Charles Asgill, a Yorktown prisoner from a wellconnected British family. Faced with an untenable situation, Washington allowed the matter to drag on for months, finally yielding in November to mounting French pressure to free Asgill. For a full treatment of the incident, see Katherine Mayo, General Washington's Dilemma  (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1938). See also Larry G. Bowman, \""The Court-Martial of Captain Richard Lippincott,\"" New Jersey History 89 (Spring 1971): 23-36. MAY 3, 1782

  [May 4-June 11 ? 1782] (1) The Committee to whom was referred the Report of the Commissioners for settling a Cartel &c do report That it appears to your Committee, from the sd. report & other Papers referred to them, that the Commissioners appointed on the Part of his Excellency General Washington met the Commissioners appointed on the part of his Excellency General Clinton at Eliz- MAY 4, 1782  abeth Town on the 31st M[arch] 1782, and mutually exchanged their respective Commissions, with the Competence of which the sd. Commissioners were mutually satisfied.  That after various propositions and a lengthy negotiation of the different subjects of their Mission, General Clinton put an End to the Business, on General Washingtons Commissioners declaring the following propositions made on the part of the Enemy, altogether inadmissible.  1st. The Exchange of Citizens & Seamen for Soldiers.  2d. The ransoming Prisoners of War for money.  3d. The Exchange of Prisoners of War as formerly, without the settlement of the past Accounts.  4th. Permission to british Commissaries for purchasing of Provision in the united States for british Prisoners of War, at the market Price.  And the like declaration on the part of the Enemy's Commissioners to the following Propositions made by Genl. Washington's Commissioners on the part of the united States.  5. The liquidation of all past Accounts or the payment of a Ballance of £200,000 Sterl. in full of all demands on Acct of the subsistence of Prisoners.  6. Immediate Provision for the future subsistence of Prisoners of War.  7. The liberation of American Citizens in all parts of the world when captured by the Arms of Brittain.  It appears to your Committee that Genl. Washingtons Commissioners acted with the greatest Propriety in refusing their assent to the propositions made on the part of Sir Henry Clintons Commissioners.  That the demand of the Exchange of Soldiers trained to & taken in Arms, for the peaceable Citizen taken from his Habitation, without Opposition, would in the opinion of your Committee, not only be absolutely destructive of the comon Interest of these States, but is altogether contrary to the rules of War among all civilized Nations- tend to the encouragement of the dishonorable practice of stealing away the peaceable Inhabitants of the Country, and expose them while employed in domestic & civil employments, to all the Inconveniencies & disadvantages of a Military Life.  That the demand of Soldiers in Exchange for Seamen taken from private Vessels of War or Trade, in the opinion of your Committee is equally inadmissable for similar Reasons. The Seamen of this Class, as soon as exchanged, return again to the general mass of Citizens, and add nothing to the immediate defence of the States or the increase of the Army, and if received in Exchange for Soldiers, would tend to the reduction of the Army beyond any possibility of recruiting. Every Soldier costs the united States a certain Sum of  money, which would be a continual Loss, if those redeemed by Exchange are not to return to the Army from whence they were taken.  It is farther the opinion of your Committee on the fullest Consideration, that the reasons offered by General Washington's Commissioners to those on the part of Sir Henry Clinton, for refusing to admit the other propositions insisted on by them, are sufficient & unanswerable and ought to be adhered to by Congress.  It also appears to your Committee that the demands made by General Washingtons Commissioners & refused by those on the part of the Enemy, are founded on Reason & Justice, except as to the Ballance demanded in full for Prisoners Subsistance, which your Committee have not been able to ascertain with that precision necessary to form a proper Judgment thereon-and also as to the liberation of American Citizens in all parts of the World. It appears to your Committee, that the Powers vested in Sir Henry Clinton, as may be concluded from the Commission set forth in the report, are confined to certain limits lying on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Parties were fully satisfied with the Competence of each others Powers, on the Exchange thereof, therefore in the opinion of your Committee, the objects of the negotiati[on] should not have exceeded the Powers under which the Conferrence was held, unless so far as respected any Prisoners who might have been sent without those limits by the Agency of Sir Henry Clinton-under this Consideration therefore your Committee recommend the following resolutions.  Resolved-That Congress do approve the Conduct of the Commissioners appointed by his Excellency General Washington for settling a Cartel &c with the Enemy, and do order those Proceedings & report to be printed for the information of the several States.  Resolved That Congress do still continue to be sincerely desirous of settling a general & liberal Cartel for the Exchange of Prisoners, as also general Principles for such Support & Comfortable Subsistence of Prisoners of War as will tend to soften the unavoidable severities & sufferings of War according to the usage & Custom of the most civilized Nations.

On the 28th ulto. Congress recd. Communications from Letters of the 24 Decr. & 22d Jany (2) wherein after expressions of Satisfaction upon our Success in Virga. the weakness of our Army is lamented & the incapacity in which it leaves us of pursuing so important a Blow before the Enemy can recover themselves. That tho' the Plan of the ensuing Campaign was not then determd. upon, there was every reason to believe that means would be used to aid us in the Exertions we might make to expell the Enemy from the Continent. It is wished that this Consideration, & the Obstinate adherence of the British to their Plan of subjugating this Country (which is Evidenced by their answer to the Mediators) might rouse the U States to an early &  MAY 6, 1782  animated Exertion. It is observed that the British are much embarrass'd with respect to the measures they ought to pursue-That they still continue to represent America as a weak & divided people, hoping thereby to affect the Powers of Europe, & especially the Mediators-That it is not improbable G Britain will endeavour to make proposals to the States separately, & tho' it is not apprehended they would succeed in such an Attempt by detachg. any of them from the Alliance, yet it may be presumed whilst the Issue is unknown, they might avail themselves of it, to induce a Belief that They still have a considerable Interest in this Country, & that the people at large still wish to be connected with them+That therefore Means ought to be devised frustrate their Designs.)

Conway on the 27 February \""That to carry on any longer an Offensive war in America, for the impracticable Object of reducing the Colonies by force would only tend to weaken our Efforts against our European Enemies & by encreasing the Enmity between G Britain & the Colonies frustrate the hopes & designs of his majesty so graciously expressd from the Throne of restoring to his People the inestimable Blessing of publick Tranquillity.\"" This Motion was carried by a Majority of 19-234 against 215-& an Address to the Motion was carried without a division & said to be presented on the 3d of March, & that on the 5th a Motion was made by the Attorney General for leave to bring in a Bill \""to enable his Majesty to make peace with America\"" & was carried without a Division-that Leave was also given for a Bill to repeal the Prohibitory Act, & the Act of the 12 Charles 2d-That on the 9th March- The Ceres man of war ordered to be got ready to sail with some Officers & persons of distinction for America, who are going over it is said, to hear on what Terms the Congress will agree on a reconciliation with the Mother Country. The Packet left Falmouth on the  16th of March, & brings farther Intelligence that Sir Guy Carleton is coming out immediately to take the Command.(4)  The Dates in the above Paper differ from the Accounts given by the Publick Papers; it serves however to corroborate the Facts; & what respects the Ceres man of War is worthy of notice; we shall make no Comments upon them, but mention them meerly as matter of information. The British Cruizers have lately made great impressions upon the Trade here, by this mode the Enemy seems desirous of distressing the Mercantile Interest into an Inclination for Peace.  A resolution of Congress of the 3d April refer'd the Application for Flaggs to the General, & we have since heard nothing from him upon the Subject.(5) No Blank Comissions can issue-But Genl. Moultrie carried all the Commissions which were necessary properly fill'd up according to the arrangement made here.  The accounts from the W Indies respecting the Fleets are vague & uncertain; we shortly expect to hear of an Attack upon Jamaica by the combined Forces of France & Spain.

  Dear Sir Philada. May [7,] 1782(1)  The letter inclosed (2) herewith came to my hands from the Eastern post. I forward it not knowing how far its contents may interest you.  The parliamentary intelligence published in the gazette of this morning shews that some revolution in the Councils of the Legislative branch has taken place, which will probably have some effect on those of the Executive. But as the delusive idea of a federal if not a political connection with this Country founded on the ruins of its connection with France, still pervades their policy, no conclusion whatever can be drawn from it that will justify the smallest relaxation in our public measures. The efficacy of conciliatory overtures seems to be as foolishly & obstinately persisted in by one party as that of Military coercion has been by the other; and if the former should be indulged in their favorite experiment, it is more probable that their disappointment & vexation will make them converts to the views of the latter, than that both parties will lay aside their prejudices & embrace the terms we hold out to them.  A letter from Mr. Jay & two from Mr. Carmichael were recd. yesterday.(3) They all speak the same language with that recd. from the former a little before you left us.(4) The success of the Spanish arms at Minorca will we are told be followed by redoubled efforts against Gibralter.  We have several times repeated our call for the order on the Western Cessions, and have in every instance experienced a repetition of the same indecent obstructions & evasions of which you were a witness, & which nothing will explain but the cause to which we have from the beginning imputed them.(5) It will neither be consistent with the respect we owe to our own public characters nor with the dignity of those we serve, to persist longer in fruitless applications to Congress for an answer. We shall therefore wind up the business as well as we can in a few days, and transmit a state of it for the G. Assembly, who will certainly be fully justified in taking any course with respect to their Western claims which the interest of the State shall prescribe.  I am Dr [Sr., yr.] sincere frd. & hble sert. J Madison Jr  ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, May [7], 1782.(1) The enclosed gazette details all the information which we have received relative to the parliamentary advances towards a negotiation with the United States. The first reports which issued from the packet which brought them, were of a very different complexion, and raised high expectations of peace. We now find the ideas of the opposition, as well as the Ministry, to be far short of the only condition on which it can take place. Those who are the farthest reconciled to concessions calculate on a dissolution of the compact with France. The Ministry will yield to the experiment, and turn the result upon their adversaries. Our business is plain. Fidelity to our allies, and vigor in military preparation-these, and these alone, will secure us against all political devices.  We have received no intelligence which speaks a danger of a separate peace between the Dutch and Great Britain. Mr. Adams' request of a categorical answer was taken, ad referendum, prior, if I mistake not, to the knowledge of Cornwallis' fate, and it is not likely that after that event they would be less disposed to respect our overtures, or reject those of the enemy.  We have letters from Mr. Jay and Mr. Carmichael of as late date as the twenty-seventh of February. They differ in nothing from the style of the former.(2) The conduct of the Spanish Court subsequent to the date of the letter received the day preceding your departure, corresponds entirely with the tenor of it as therein related.(3) Mr. Jones will inform you of the act of Congress which that letter produced.(4)  We have made no progress in the Western subject. We mean to desist, after one or two more attempts, and state the matter to the Assembly by next post, expecting that they will pursue such measures as their interest prescribes, without regard to the resolutions which proposed the cession.  I beg you to keep me punctually informed of every legislative step touching the Western territory. I suppose the cession cannot fail to be revoked, or, at least, a day of limitation set to it. The condition  MAY 7, 1782  relative to the companies will certainly be adhered to in every event. I find that those who have been against us do not wish to lose sight of the prospect altogether. If the State is firm and prudent, I have little doubt that she will be again courted. Previous to Mr. Jones' departure, our opinions were united on the expediency of making the impost of five per cent. subservient to an honorable adjustment of territory and accounts. I have since discovered that Varnum is left out, the latter having promoted it, and that Chase is inflexible against it. Massachusetts also holds out. The expedient, therefore, would not be efficacious, and clamors would be drawn on Virginia, which it would be best should fall elsewhere.5 Show this to Mr. Jones. He will be with you about the twentieth instant.  MS not found; reprinted from The Papers of James Madison, ed. Henry D. Gilpin, 3 vols. (Washington: Langtree & O'Sullivan, 1840), 1:125-26.  1 Although left blank by Madison, it is clear from the Virginia delegates' letter to Benjamin Harrison, this date, that both were written on the same day.  2 See the preceding entry, note 3.  3 Ibid., note 4.  4 Joseph Jones left Philadelphia on May 2; Madison is referring to Congress' April 30 resolution concerning John Jay's negotiations with Spain, for which see JCC, 22:219 20; and Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 4:189 91.  5 For the Virginia delegates' strategy in making ratification of the 5 per cent impost \""subservient to an honorable adjustment of territory and accounts,\"" and speculation on the reasons for Madison's change of heart, see ibid., p. 221n.11.

  [May 7? 1782](1) You will receive a few Lines which should have been delivered by Col. Motte. They will be out of Date but may serve to shew that I am not as forgetfull as you.  Your favor by Mr. R was delivered to me and I thank you for the information respecting my old friend Steel. As Republicans we are all on a Level at least-[particularly?] as men; the lowest is equally entitled to protection by the best among us and preference is due only to the merits of an Individual, not to Gifts of Fortune-under these [principles?] I shall better myself and use every endeavour to rescue that much injur'd man from insidious Tyrants & oppressors, our obdurate Enemy; it is painfull to be the advocate of (cruelty) severity in any [contest?], but necessity points it out as the only doorway open to humanity when we have to deal with those who have lost the finer feelings of our nature. I wish the practise of returning like for like had been determined at an earlier Period. I am convinsd it would have operated much for our Benefit. MAY 7, 1782  You will see in the public prints an atrocious Affair of Cap. Huddy who was hanged by Refugees. The Genl. has threatned Retaliation upon British Officers if the perpetrators are not delivered up. Congress have resolved to support him and I believe they will be executed and when we have once enter'd the Retaliatory road, no doubt we shall proceed with them passitus equis; therefore let our Enemies beware of improper Conduct, and let our Friends take care how [not to] fall into their hands. The Demand by the General to Clinton is likely to occasion very great & serious differences between the British & the Refugees. I think Mr. Justice P. (2) has acted very incautiously-risquing his pretious Person after what had pass'd. He probably will not retain his fondness for a Featherbed or Mattress; it was not to be expected he should emerge above all the surcets [circuits] like Venus rising from the Sea and reclining on a Bed of Roses. In plain English he should have been damnably switched. I fear he will acquire experience at a dear rate.  I delivered the letter you enclos'd for Mrs. Timothy. Several vague reports have been spread of the ships not being lost but carried into Jamaica and of Mrs. Marshall's being seen at Antigua, but I believe they are all without foundation and we conclude they are certainly lost.  I have [. . .] flatter'd myself by hopes of being able to set out for Southward upon the arrival of Mr. Z-(J R and Ramsay having taken their Seats)(3) but yesterday we received a Paper purporting &c.  Our Accounts from the West Indies are still various & uncertain, but we have every reason to conclude Our Allies hold their Superiority, & that in conjunction with a Spanish Armament they will shortly invest Jamaica, so that we may expect the chief Business of the Campaign would be in that Quarter.

10862,dg018479,1782,Rhode Island Delegates to William Greene,"""Rhode Island Delegates to William Greene
  Sir, Philadelphia May 7th. 1782. In the last letter which we had the honour to write to your excellency,(1) among other things we mentioned that a report on cessions of Western territory to the United States was made the order of the day, and that we hoped it would be postponed.  Since that time the delegates of Virginia have on the one hand urged a decision on their cessions with uncommon art and industry, while on the other the delegates of the R. Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, N. Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland have with equal diligence endeavour'd to cause the whole report to be postponed; and after much maneuvring it was yesterday generally postponed.(2)  Our views in promoting a postponment, were that the Genl. Assembly might be made acquainted with this matter, and give the delegates of the State their instructions thereon. That the United States might have an opportunity of recommending to the State of Virginia, and other States who may have claims or pretensions of claims to Western territory to make unrestricted and unconditional cessions thereof, and to check that rage for securing extensive possessions by sales & settlements which hath seized Virginia, and induced a conduct highly injurious to the interests of the United States.  With a proviso that should secure the claims of the other States and that of the United States to the proposed cession of N. York we believe that a majority would agree to accept that cession; but neither would your delegates, nor the delegates of the States before mentioned accept the restricted cession of Virginia, or guaranty the tract of country claimed by them in their act of cession unless they should be order'd to accept thereof, by the legislatures of their respective States.  Besides that guaranty, the following conditions are annexed to their cession-That the State of Virginia be fully reimbursed her actual expences in reducing the British posts of Kaskaskias and St. Vincents, the expences of maintaining garrisons and supporting civil government there since the reduction of said posts, and in general all the charge she has incurred on account of the country on the Northwest side of the Ohio river since the commencement of the war-That the French and Canadian inhabitants and other settlers on the Kaskaskias, St Vincents and the neighbouring villages who have professed themselves citizens of Virginia shall have their possessions and titles confirmed to them and shall be protected &c by troops at the expence of the United States-That royal grants within the ceded territory inconsistent with the charter'd rights, MAY 7, 1782  laws and customs of Virginia shall be deemed and declared absolutely void and of no effect in the same manner as if the said territory had still remained subject to and part of the commonwealth of Virginia.  We are not informed of the amount of the expenses mentioned in those conditions, nor can we pronounce absolutely how far the proposed guaranty, and a declaration that royal grants inconsistent &c are absolutely void would effect the claims of other States and the rights of the United States in Congress assembled; nor can we tell how far eastward the western boundary of these States may be established by a peace.  This letter will be accompanied by a copy of the report of the Committee on the cessions &c. Copies of the Acts of cession &c will be transmitted as soon as they can be made out.  The Minister of France hath lately through the Secretary for foreign affairs requested a public audience in order to deliver to the President a letter from his royal master to the United States in Congress assembled announcing to them the birth of the Dauphin.(3) The joy of Congress on this happy occasion will be manifested by a discharge of cannon, a display of fireworks, and by an elegant entertainment for the Minister of France.  The audience, exhibitions, and entertainment will be on Monday next. The Secretary for foreign affairs will make the proper communication to the respective States and we are sure that the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations will not be backward in demonstrations of joy on this auspicious event.  Your Excellency will observe the motion of Genl. Conway &c.(4) The British wish to treat with the United States separately from France, and with individual States separately if they could; and would cajole us with ideas of pacification. We are confident that Congress will not recede an inch from the resolutions they solemnly enter'd into upon the proposals made by the last sett of Commissioners; that no one State will attend to any separate propositions that may be made to them; and that our State would answer, if any such should be offer'd to it, as they did formerly to the propositions of Ld Lowe. Nor will, we trust, the exertions of the States be in the least degree relaxed by any resolutions of the British house of Commons not to carry on an offensive war against America; but on the contrary we hope that we shall have such a respectable army in the field, as, with the assistance we may receive from our generous ally, may enable us to operate not only offensively but effectually against our enemies. Finding themselves incapable of subdueing us by force, they are recurring to their old artifices. They are reporting through Europe that we are a weak and divided people in order to influence mediating and other powers against us; and to convince the world that this is the case, and to lull us asleep they are coming   again with the olive branch in their mouth, but it will be not forgotten that under the same peace[ful] dove-like appearance an insidious serpent hath lurked-have lurked strategems and death.  We ask pardon for having extended our observations so far on this peice of intelligence. Even a hint of this sort to a State, so spirited, so sagacious, and so guarded as that of Rhode-Island would require an apology.  Genl. Washington's Commissioners for a cartel are returned without effecting any thing. Sr H. Clinton's Commissioners were not empower'd to settle a general cartel. Indeed, their powers were ostensible only; every thing was referred to him by them. He refused to pay the ballance due for subsisting their soldiers in our possession; and would not advance a farthing for the support of them. He was willing to give seamen for soldiers, or a trifling sum of money for each soldier.  Our commissioners were instructed by the Genl. to insist upon better accommodations for our sea-prisoners. Admiral Digby's powers to their commissioners were much short of expectation. He was willing to exchange seamen for soldiers, and this was all he said that wanted regulation.(5)  The report on the affair of Vermont lies untouched and will not be stirred until it shall appear that some advantage will result from agitating it.  Yesterday Congress recd. letters from Mr. Carmichael of the 18th & 27 Feby. confirming the news of the reduction of Minorca.(6) The garrison capitulated in twenty days after the trenches were open'd. The fortifications are to be levelled, and the port obstructed so as not to admit large vessels, and the troops employed agst Mahon are to be employed against Gilbraltar, the seige of which will be pushed, as the taking of it is a favorite object of his Catholic Majesty.  We have communicated every thing of any moment that we could bring to our recollection, and are with sentiments of great respect, Your Excellency's most obedient servants, William Ellery  Ezekiel Cornell ""

We shall endeavor to obtain it for the next post.(2) The Se[c]retary of Congress assures us that 20 Commissions for armed vessels were forwarded on the 30th Ulto. in consequence of a letter from Mr. Blair on the subject.(3) If that number is insufficient the balance shall be supplied on the first notice.  The enclosed Gazette will furnish your Excellency with all the parliamentary intelligence by which we are as yet enabled to interpret the views of the Enemy. The perseverence of the antiministerial party in the supposed efficacy of conciliatory overtures seems to be no less obstinate than that of the Court has been with respect to military coercion, and as manifestly portends a delay of peace. The path of our duty under these circumstances cannot be mistaken. A scrupulous fidelity to our foreign engagements & a vigorous preparation for expelling the enemy from our Country must press themselves on every attention.  Letters from Spain inform us that the Garrison taken at Minorca consisted of 2600 including every description, but 1500 only of effective troops; and that this success of the Spanish arms would be followed by redoubled ardor on the siege of Gibraltar.(4) Our affairs at {this court make no progress what} ever {toward the allyance sought for}.(5) If it does {not take place} at {all} we shall have at {least the consolation} of {saveing the Mississippi}.  We have been supplied with no news of late from the W.

At the state house he was recd. with military honors, and being met at the foot of the steps by two members deputed for the purpose he was by them introduced to his seat.  The house was arranged in the following Order.(2) The president in a chair on a platform raised two steps from the floor with a large  MAY 13, 1782  table before him. The members of Congress in chairs on the floor to his right and left with small tables before them. The tables were all covered with green cloth. On the left of the chair sat 1. the delegates of Massachusetts, 2. Rhode island, 3d. Connecticut, 4. New York, 5. New Jersey. On the right sat 1. Georgia, 2. S Carolina, 3. Virginia, 4. Maryland, 5. Delaware, 6. Pennsylvania. The whole in a semicircle. Newhampshire & North Carolina were not represented.  Next to the member of Congress on the left of the chair stood the principals of the three executive departments namely the Superintendant of finance, the Secy at War & the Secy for foreign Affairs.  The Secretary of the United States in Congress assembled stood on the right of the president on the first step of the platform. At his right on the floor stood the interpreter behind the chairs of the Members.  The president & council of the state of Pennsylvania stood within the bar on the right as they entered & facing the president.  The rest of the Audience stood without the bar. The doors were opened. Centries were placed at the inner door & none except the minister and his suite were admitted without a ticket which was signed by the Secy of Congress, who furnished each of the members with two, the Super. finance with as many as were wanted for the officers in his department, the Secy at war for those in his department & for such of the general officers of the army as were in town & the Secy for foreign affairs with those wanted for foreigners of distinction, whom he might think proper to be admitted. The President of Congress was furnished with a number to distribute among the citizens. The whole number prepared was 200.  The Minister was conducted into the Congress Hall by the two members who had received him at the foot of the steps of the outward door. As he entered the bar the president and the house rose. The president being Covered, The Minister as he advanced to his chair bowed to the president who took Off his hat & returned the bow. The Minister being uncovered, The Minister then bowed to the members on each side of the chair, who were standing uncoverd, but did not return the bow. The Minister then sat down & put on his Hat. A chair was prepared for him on the floor directly opposite to the president and before it a table covered with green cloth. On each side of his chair was placed a chair for the Members who introduced him. He who was first named of the two took the chair on the right & the other that on the left. The president, the members & the Minister all took their seats at the same time. The Secretary of the embassy stood on the left of the chair of the member at the Minister['s] left.  After about a pause of a Minute the Minister arose & taking off his hat addressed the United States in Congress assembled in a short speech delivered in french. The house sat while he delivered his  speech. The president only being covered. Having finished his speech he sat down. And the Secy of the Embassy coming forward delivered the letter from his most Christian Majesty to the Secy of Congress who advanced to the end of the platform to meet him & having received it carried it back & delivered it to the president who opened it and delivered it again to the Secy who causing the interpreter to advance to the first step of the platform gave it to him open and he read it in the Original to the Audience. The Secy then on the platform read a translation of it & returned the letter to the president. Whereupon the president, the Members & the Minister rose, the president being covered, but the members & the minister uncovered: and the president [on] behalf of the United States addressed the Minister in a short speech After which they all sat down and after a short pause the Minis[ter] rose, whereupon the president & the members rose. The Minister then bowed to the president and the members & withdrew, the members who introduced him reconducting him to the foot of the steps at the outward door.  ""

  Dear Doctr. [May 14? 1782](1)  I thank you for your favour by Mr. J Neil who also delivered two Guineas. It is with pleasure we hear you and the Children are well.  I had prepaired a letter to go by Mr Neil but he was gone. I now inclose you Sundry papers. The Account you will see under the New York head of the Defeat of the French Fleet in the West Indias, is pretty generally discredit here, indeed there are many strong Circumstances against the Credibillity of it. No account is given of what became of the rest of the French fleet and the great number of Ships they had under Convoy; it does not appear how the letter writer to the Antigua printer Came by his intelligence; he Says he had been on board the Ville de paris; Where was She? How Came he on board and how did he get to Antigua where he dates his letter? Nothing of this appears; it is not said that that Ship or any other of the Captured ships, were arrived at Antigua and it Cant be supposed that  MAY 14, 1782  any of them, were Arrived at the time the paper was printed as such a Circumstance would hardly had been omitted. There are Strong Circumstances to induce a belief that Rodney's Letter too is not genuine-it is probable there had been a severe battle and that both fleets have suffered greatly-all at present is Conjecture, but if the French have been able to protect their Convoy and Effect a Junction with the Spanish fleet at Hispaniola, they have obtained their object and the Combined fleets will be greatly Superior to the British.  Sir Guy Carlton has wrote to General Washington for a passport to Philadelphia for his Secretary Mr. Morgan. A Copy of his letter has been transmitted to Congress, who have directed the General not to Comply with the request.(2) This may Occasion Sir Guy, to propose Some other mode of laying before Congress whatever he may have to Communicate in Virtue of his Commission and it is probable we may hear from him shortly. I received yours of the 12th yesterday. Tho the price Ned Sold for is under his Value yet it as much (Circumstances Considered) as I expected to get for him, and shall abide by the bargain. Hope Hoskins will be punctual in the payment. We wish you all health and happiness. Dear Docr. yrs. most affectionately, J H(3)  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 14. 1782 The Ceres man of War we are informed by a New York paper arrived there in twenty five days on the 5th instant having on board his Excellency Sir Guy Carleton, Commander in chief &c., and Commissioner for making peace or war in North America. The intelligence brought by this conveyance is that the vibrations of power between the Ministry and their rivals had terminated in the com - MAY 14, 1782  plete dissolution of the former organization of the latter. What change of measures will follow this change of men is yet concealed from us. The bill for empowering the King to conclude a peace or truce with the revolted Colonies in North America had been brought into Parliament on the 27th of March. The language of it is at the same time cautious and comprehensive, and seems to make eventual provision for our Independence, without betraying any purpose of acknowledging it. The terms peace and truce are scarcely applicable to any other conventions than National ones. And the King is authorised to annul or suspend all acts of Parliament whatever as far as they speak of the Colonies. He can therefore clearly remove any parliamentary bar to his recognition of our Independence and I know of no other bar to his treating with America on that ground. All this is however very different from a real peace. The King will assuredly prefer war as long as his Ministry will stand by him, and the settlements of his present Ministry, particularly of Shelburne are as peremptory against the dismemberments of the Empire as those of any of their predecessors. They will at least try a campaign of negociation against the United States and of war against their other enemies before they submit to it. It is probable that the arrival of Sir Guy Carleton will not long precede an opening of the first campaign. Congress will I am persuaded give a proper verbal answer to any overtures with which he may insult them but the best answer will come from the States in such supplies of men and money as will expel him and all our other enemies from the United States.  We have at length brought our territorial business to an issue. It was postponed sine die on the 6th instant. We have transmitted the whole proceeding to the Governor to be laid before the Assembly.(1)  There are various accounts from the West Indies which render it pretty certain that an engagement has taken place between the two fleets. The circumstances are not ascertained. The issue seems at least to have been so far in favor of our Allies as to leave them free to pursue their course with their Convoy to Hispaniola, where a junction is to be made with the Spaniards. The object of this junction is universally supposed to be Jamaica.  Since I finished the above a letter has come to Congress from General Washington enclosing one to him from Sir Guy Carleton announcing his commission in conjunction with Admiral Digby to treat of peace with this Country, and requesting a passport for his Secretary Mr. Morgan to bring a similar letter of compliment to Congress. The request will certainly be refused and General Washington probably directed to receive and forward any despatches which may be properly addressed to Congress.(2)  A public audience was yesterday given to the Minister of France, in which he formally announced the birth of the Dauphin. It was   deemed politic at this crisis to display every proper evidence of affectionate attachment to our Ally. The Minister was accordingly received with Military honors and the audience concluded with the discharge of cannon and a feu de joi of small arms. A public entertainment followed and fireworks (at night) closed the scene.  The answer reported by the Committee on Mr. Dana's letter (animadverted on his precipitancy and) gave him a cautionary instruction. It afterwards went to the Secretary of foreign affairs and thence I suppose in his dress to Petersburgh.(3) Mr. Jones will give you more satisfactory information on this as also with respect to the answer of Mr. Jay's letter.(4)  Your surmises relative to a revival of paper currency alarms me.(5) It is impossible that any evil can render such an alternative eligible. It will revive the hopes of the Enemy, increase the internal debility of the State, and awaken the clamours of all ranks throughout the United States against her. Much more to Virginia's honor would it be to rescind the taxes, altho' the consequence of that can but be of a most serious nature.  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia May 14th. 1782 I have to acknowledge the Rect. of your Favor of the 2d Instant for which I must beg you to accept of my sincerest Thanks. You inform me that the General Court have still under Consideration the Impost Bill. Before this Time it is probable that the House (or rather General Assembly) is adjourned or prorogued & that the Bill is determined upon. I shall make my myself easy let it be whatever Way it may. I have wrote my Sentiments upon the Matter without Reservation, to my Friends. I have felt myself greatly interested in the Determination of the Question; & now I shall submit with as much Satisfaction, as a Republican always ought to do, in a free Government, to the Voice & Judgment of my Country. However I can but make a few comparative Observations, which were occasioned by reading a Piece signed Argus, in Willis's Paper(1) of the 26th of April. Who the Authur is I cannot divine. He has given the People of Massachusetts his Sentiments upon a coercive Power in MAY 14, 1782  Congress: he seems to be much terrified with the Idea, & therefore without accurately considering what Coercion Means, has resolved it, into an Armed Force. And foresees in Embryo, a Standing Army appointed by Congress. Happy, extremely happy should I be, if Congress or their Financier, knew what to do with the little Army now in the Field, but it is very difficult to provide for them. The States give no Money, Congress can neither make, nor borrow. True it is, that Congress has at least the Power of asking the States to furnish them with so many Men, & so much Money, as may be Judged absolutely necessary to carry on the War. And such Requisitions the Confederation says shall be binding-(As Binding as Religion is upon the Consciences of wicked Men; It's Recompence is principally in another World)-But so extremely cautious are the States in general, least they should multiply the Works of Supererogation, that they will do nothing at all. It is dangerous to give to Congress any Thing, because they will not account for it. It is dangerous, because they may be so free of Debt, & so provident as to lay up Money for their Successors to enable them to subsist a standing Army.  But there seems to be a great Objection against the Financier's having in the several states an Of ficer to receive the Sums of Money, that may be appropriated to the Use of the Continent. It would be much better to speak openly at once, & object to any Kind of continental Tax-As this must be the Foundation of the Objection. For I am clearly in Opinion if the State of Masstts. intend to pay their Quota of 8 Millions of Dollrs., it is a Matter of very little Consequence to the State, & cannot endanger their Liberties & Priviledges, whether the Money is paid to the Treasurer of the State or to an Officer appointed by Mr. Morris-for it never I believe entered into any Body's Mind that if there was a continental Receiver of Taxes, that he should not be subject to the Laws of the State, in all Respects as much as the State Treasurer.  Admitting the Idea of a Continental Treasurer in each state Subject to the Laws of the State, & that the State may annually comply with the Requisitions, (or otherwise as they may see fit) and by Acts of their own, direct, the Payment of the Monies to be made by the Collectors, in the first Instance, to a continental Receiver, instead of the State Treasurer, what Injury can arise? I can conceive of no great Injury-unless it is injurious to the Feelings of the States to furnish the united States with any of the necessary Means, for carrying on the War. Surely it is greatly diminishing the Business of the State Treasurer, & the united States will be as much accountable for the Money, as tho they received it thro the circuitous Channel of States Officers; & render an Account of the Expenditures as expeditiously. We have some Time since directed the Financier to make out an Account of the public Debt, that agreeable to the Articles of Confed-  eration it may be laid before the respective States. Restricted as such an Officer would necessarily be, by the Laws of the State, I think he would not be a very dangerous Creature. But, Sir, an Impost of five per Ct. is a very different Matter, & may, & probably will, if adopted open the Door for every Kind of Venality & Corruption. It is granting to an Amoun[t] that cannot be publickly known. It is granting, if not forever, yet, for as long a Time, as these States continue united. It will undoubtedly furnish Congress with the Means of paying the half pay promised to Officers, in the continental Army during Life, which is a Matter, I think totally inadmissable for more Reasons that I have now Opportunity to mention. But one is very easily suggested, that is that nearly one half of the Officers have had no Men to command for several Years; & have been a dead Weight upon the united States; It would be a very pretty Fancy to give those Officers, half Pay for Life. Perhaps the less is said about this Matter at present the better. But for one, I do not trouble myself about half Pay; because I am perswaded, Nine States will never be in Favor of it. Without you make Congress very corrupt, by giving them the entire Disposal of a great Deal of Money.  I feel very anxious for our State; the Burthens have been & still are very heavy upon it; surely, Sir, you must be sensible that we must have failed in our great Attempt, if Masstts. had not made the most strenuous Exertions-they are still necessary, notwithstanding the thoro' Change in the Ministry of Great Britain; we ought, on no Account whatever, to relax in our Exertions: Our Independence, is not yet acknowledged; And Whether the new Ministry have the Vanity to think, that they shall have Address enough, with us, to induce us to give up our Alliance, Independence &ca is uncertain. But there is some Reason to suppose that this is their Object. If it is (under Providence) I am perswaded that they will be no less disappointed than their Predecessors. Sir Guy Carlton, has wrote a complimentary Letter to General Washington; he expresses his utter Disapprobation of every Kind of Barbarity & Cruelty in carrying on the War; but if it must be continued he wishes it may be, in a Manner most conformable to the Ideas of the most civilized Nations, he says to general Washington \""that we are alike interested to preserve the Name of Englishmen from Reproach\""-A Name that is now become proverbial for the very Thing itself. He has requested a Passport of General Washington for his Secretary to come to Congress with a Complimentary Letter-But Congress, Sir, have a very great Aversion to Compliments, and they will not permit any one to come on such a triffling Errand. If Sir Guy, has any Thing of Consequence to communicate to Congress (which I think is not probable) If properly directed, it will undoubtedly be received. But none of his People, will have the Honor to approach nearer than the Place than may be appointed by General Washington for receiving  Flags. What the Intentions of the New Ministry may be is only a Matter of Conjecture here: some are of Opinion that Sir Guy is instructed to make an Attempt upon the States individually, to draw them of[f] from the Alliance formed with France; I feel no Anxiety about such a Manoevre; because I am perswaded the States Individually would behave with becoming Dignity on such an Occasion. Perhaps the Silence of Congress on this very important Matter, may be very Good Policy; should the States, without the Intervention of Congress, act with a suitable Degree of Firmness, it would have a Tendency to destroy the absurd & groundless Insinuations of the former brittish Ministry, in the Courts of Europe, that a great Majority of the Americans are well disposed to their Sovereign; that the People are only governed by a few Incendiaries.  Mr. Lowell I conclude from the Intelligence I have received is on his way, & that he will be with us this Week; Mr. Partridge determines to Leave us next Week. I shall make myself perfectly easy with my Situation; if the State should have a full Representation I shall return Home this Summer. If otherwise I shall not quit their Service if my Health continues as good as it is at present.(2)  General Lincoln has lately removed his Lodgings, & is now in the House with me, where we are pretty well accommodated. He desires me to inform you that there is a Person in Philadelpa who flatters himself that he has good Reason to expect that you will remember as well as Mr. Partridge to whom you desired me to present your Compliments.  You will be pleased to excuse this long Letter & accept of my sincerest Wishes for your Welfare. I am, Dear Sir, with Sentiments of the greatest Esteem, your most obedient, and most humble Servant,  Samuel Osgood  ""

  Sir Philada. May 14th. 1782 In our letter of the 17th Ulto. we informed your Excelly. that we had called upon Congress for a decision on the report of the Committee on the territorial cessions, a copy of which was inclosed in our letter of the 17th. of Novr last; (1) and that a day had been assigned for the consideration of that report. The extract from the Journals of  MAY 14, 1782  Congress herewith transmitted, shews the progress of the business down to the 6th. of May, when it was postponed sine die.(2)  Our revival of this subject at the time above stated proceeded from the manifest expediency of obtaining from Congress such a decision thereon, as would explain their ultimate views, and enable the Genl. Assembly at their present Session to take such measures as the case required. During a suspension of this decision of Congress, the misrepresentations & fallacies contained in the report supplied to interested persons, abundant calumny against Virginia; and the precautions which her Western interests might dictate, were exposed to be animadverted upon as premature & improper. These considerations were urged upon Congress as equally obliging the State to demand and them to give a definitive answer either in the affirmative or negative to her cession. Congress were reminded too that this cession was proposed not from any interested motives on the part of Virginia, nor even originated with her, but was made at the instance of Congress themselves, who pressed it upon her as a sacrifice essential to the general Interest; that the least therefore that could be expected from Congress was a speedy attention & explicit answer to it. These considerations, weighty as they were in themselves, made little impression, nor were they other wise answered, than by the evasive propositions & unseasonable adjournments stated in the extract from the Journals. The only solid objection of which the case admitted, and which on a former occasion prevailed, was a thinness of the House.(3) But on this occasion there were both at the time of assigning a day for the discussion of the report, & of the vote which finally postponed it, no less than eleven States present, a number which experience has shewn to be greater than can be calculated upon at any given future period. During the course of the business the number was indeed reduced to nine States by the voluntary departure of a member for Connecticut & of another for Delaware; and advantage was taken of that conjuncture, as will be seen in the extract above referred to, to introduce the proposition made by Mr. Clarke & Mr. Ellery on the first instant.(4)  Having pursued this subject to the issue of a postponement sine die, and having found from the temper of a great part of Congress, as well as the repeated declarations of individual members on the floor, that no other issue was to be expected, we thought it inconsistent with the respect due to the State we represent, to other public business, and to our friends in Congress, to persist longer in urging it. We accordingly apprized Congress that such was our determination, and that we should forthwith transmit a State of the whole proceeding to our Constituents, with whom it would remain to take such Steps as it should suggest. What these Steps ought to be we presume not to point out. We are persuaded that they will be the result of mature & temperate deliberation, and that they will equally  tend to the honor of the State & the security of its interests. We only entreat that whatever Duties they shall assign to us may be chalked out in full and precise instructions. Possessed of such instructions we shall not only speak and act with greater confidence & satisfaction to ourselves, but with greater weight and effect with respect to others. Indeed the advantage of being able to speak the declared sense of our constituents is so great that we can not but intimate the expediency of our being furnished with it on all questions which involve their important interests.(5)  Intelligence from the W. Indies renders it pretty certain that an action has lately taken place between the French and British fleets in that quarter. The result is not circumstantially known, but there is reason to believe that it was considerably in favor of the former wch. preserved its convoy and prosecuted its course to Hispaniola. At this place it is universally understood that a junction was to be made with the Spaniards, and that the combined armaments were to proceed from thence agst. Jamaica.  The Gazettes which accompany this will inform your Excellency of the revolution which has taken place in the British Ministry, and of the arrival of General Carlton at N. York in quality of Commander in cheif, and joint Comissr. with Admiral Digby for treating of peace with America. A letter was [received] yesterday by Congress from Genl. Washington inclosing one to him from Genl Carlton in which the latter announces his arrival, his commission, the pacific disposition of G. Britain towards this country, and his personal desire in case the war should be continued, of rendering it as little destructive as possible; and finally requests a passport for Mr. Morgan his Secy. to convey a similar letter of compliment to Congress. Genl Washington's letter is not yet answered, but we run no risk in assuring your Excelly. that he will be directed to refuse the passport to Philada. for Mr. Morgan.  The late proceedings in the British Parliamt. with the avowed repugnance of the New Ministry, particularly of Ld. Shelburne the Minister for the American Department, to a recognition of our Independence and of our Alliance with France, forbid any hope that a peace on that ground is the object of the Commission just mentioned. On the contrary we have every reason to suspect that its object is to seduce us from the latter if not from both of those essential preliminaries to peace. The stile of Genl. Carlton's letter to Genl Washington perfectly coincides with this Suspicion. It gives us great pleasure to be able to observe on this occasion, that the apparent unanimity & firmness of Congress, afford every security to the honor & rights of the U. States wch. depends on their Councils.  A public Audience was yesterday given to the Minister of France in which he announced in form the birth of a Dauphin. The important light in which this event is regarded by the French Nation, and   more especially the present conjuncture of public affairs rendered it proper to testify our satisfaction in it by the demonstrations specified in the Gazette of this morning.  We have been disappointed in procuring the Legislative proceedings of this State relative to the Inhabitants of the district lately in dispute between it & Virga. We are assured that the whole will be printed in time to be sent by the next post.(6) The explanation & apology which your Excelly's favor of the 4th instt. wishes to be made to the Chevr. de la Luzerne shall be duly attended to.(7) We shall also transmit the orders you think expedient with regard to the Stores at Boston.(8)  We have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest esteem & respect Yr.

 Speech in Congres [May 15? 1782](1) Against the Rules of war-if propos'd-Enemy should have notice of it.  Political failure-young placed under the blessings of Capitulation, this was the argument in the case of Cornwallis.  Preamble not agreed to-Grounds of the proceedings should be first laid.  Said it should be secret. I would not steal them-but deal in the open on fair footing.  Against it also because it is a dear mode-each worth £60. We cannot expect retribution for their maintenance.  Because it is dangerous, it is a sword with two Points-one of them against ourselves, not to be trusted in the Field or in Garrison-only good to keep up a show of [might?] at a distance from the Enemy.  Grand argument against it is the Consequences to our fellow Citizens-our Constituents. It will be exposing them to be [forced?] on board the ships-this they have had [to do?] but not avowedly, in no Instance-not by authority.  But they have desired to become Soldiers of the United States- this for the Bounty.  Question. Is not their pay due from the British? which they will relinquish.  Can we pay them punctually? and keep them easy-will they have the patience of natives or those bound to the Country by Connections? It does not appear to me probable.  Document of the Gentleman from New York respecting want of power in Congress is sound and good. The mode contrived to do it away futile. With power to hire foreign Troops-this Democracy by rotation might be converted into perpetual Aristocracy.  Argument of Political expediency not suffer to overset a fundamental rule of Conduct on which public security has so great dependance.  If this measure is adopted I could wish it brought by the Commander in Chief and that Congress should come to no avowal of it.  Sign of weakness in that we cannot or will not fill up our Armies from our own people.  ""

  Hond Sir Philada. May 20th. 1782 Having written a letter (1) and inclosed with it a large collection of Newspapers for you which was to have been carried by Mr. J. Smith, but which I have now put into the hands of Capt. Walker, whose return will be quicker, little remains for me to add here. Our anxiety on account of the West India news published at New York is still supported by contradictory reports and conjectures. The account however to which Rodneys name is prefixed renders our apprehensions too strong for our hopes. Riving[t]on has been very bold in several of his spurious publications, and at this conjuncture might venture as far to serve a particular turn as at any, But it is scarcely credible that he would dare or be permitted to sport with so high an official name.  If Mr. Jefferson will be so obliging as to superintend the legal studies of Wm. I think he cannot do better than prosecute the plan he has adopted.(2) The interruption occasiond by the Election of Mr. J. altho' inconvenient in that respect, is by no means a decisive objection agst. it.  I did not know before that the Letters (3) which Mr. Walker was to have carried last fall had met with the fate which it seems they did. I shall be more cautious hereafter. The papers missing in your list were I presume for I do not recollect, contained in them.  The short notice does not leave me time to obtain the information you ask as to Stills. I have never heard of Iron Stills being cast here, nor do I know the price of Copper ones.  If Continental money passes here at all it is in a very small quantity, at very great discount, and merely to serve particular local & temporary ends.  It has at no time been more difficult for me to fix my probable return to Virga. At present all my Colleagues have left Congress except Col. Bland, and it is a crisis which calls for a full representation from every State. Anxious as I am to visit my friends as long as I sustain a public trust, I shall feel a principle which is superior to it. The State of my finances also unless the Assembly shall make a different provision for the Delegation from what has hitherto been in force, will be a serious bar to my removal from this place. I shall I believe be under the necessity of purchasing a carriage of some kind besides discharging considerable arrears, & where the means for effecting either are to be found is totally without my comprehension.  Capt. Walker tells me you have a [colt?] which you propose to reserve for a Stu[d.] If he be not very fine, I should be exceedi[ngly gra]tified in his being prepared for the saddle.

  Dear Sir Philada. May 21st. 1782 Your favor of the 10th(1) was recd. yesterday. I suspect that I have expressed myself ambiguously with respect to Mr. Jefferson. He does not alledge ignorance of the report of the Committee, but of the title of N.Y. which is the ground on which the report places the controversy with Virga.(2)  I have no addition to make to the European intelligence contained in my last. The answer to the request of Carlton went in the negative as I anticipated. The intelligence published at NY. relative to the action in the W. Indies, has converted our hopes into apprehensions. The evidence recd. of the favorable issue mentioned last week, appeared so clear & satisfactory that full credit was given to it. MAY 21, 1782  It is not even yet totally invalidated, but the opposite scale is fast preponderating.  The final report of our suit to Congress for an answer to the Western Cession was sent by the last post.(3) Mr. Jones can explain every thing relative to it. I feel myself much disburdened by the termination of the business. If it sd. be revived here in consequence of steps taken by the Legislature, I flatter myself it will be under circumstances less embarrassing.  We have recd. a remittance from Mr. Ross which renders it unnecessary for you to go out of the way to remit the small sum I advanced for you.(4)  I am prevented from adding another paragraph by the want of the Cypher which Col.

  Sir, Philadelphia, May 21 st. 1782. I have nothing particular to communicate to your Excellency in an official line. I should not, therefore, at this time have solicited your attention, had it not been to inform you of the necessity of an immediate successor to Colonel Floyd who left us last week.(1) The usual unpunctuality of members in relieving each other now gives us a thin Congress at a critical season, when a full representation of all the States is absolutely necessary. I wish our State may not long lie under the imputation.  I am anxious to hear how our two late Acts have operated on the minds of the inhabitants of the Grants. I have communicated them to several of the members. Our friends think we have been too liberal in one. Others think the Act of Oblivion should have contained no exceptions. I am of both opinions. However, such as the Acts are, I shall this day lay them before Congress. And as the manoeuvres of others have not taught but compelled me to do the like in my turn, I shall follow the reading of them with a motion  MAY 21, 1782  comprehending them verbis, syllabis, et figuris, That they be referred to a special Committee to report thereon. It will perhaps be one of the longest motions that ever was made; but it is the only effectual measure to introduce them on the journals. To attempt this in any other way would probably, for evident reasons, be attended with great opposition. The event of the day on the business, I shall insert before I close.(2)  I find I can get nothing done to purpose on the concurrent Resolutions of our Legislature respecting the levies and the two State Regiments, till I can assure Congress, that our line is full. I must therefore entreat your Excellency to favor me with returns; that I may announce the fact on the floor of Congress. This will probably ensure success to a motion for complying with request contained in the concurrent Resolutions. I am the more impatient for those returns, for reasons which with many other particulars of too delicate a nature to entrust to a stated post, I shall take the liberty of conveying to you more safely by a private hand.  We are in the most anxious suspense concerning the event of the naval action in the West Indies, of the 12th ult. The situation of our minds is such as is always the case, when an important event is presented to their view, by accots. flatly and circumstantially contradictory.  I send the papers of last week and this day to my family with a strict charge that in this and every future instance they immediately transmit them to you.  I have made my motion on the two acts. It has miscarried by a small majority against it. However, I called for the yeas and nays. This will bring the Acts on the Journals with my motion. This is all I expected, considering how thin Congress now is.(3) After this, I think the State will be fully justified in pursuing its own measures.  I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's most obedt. humble servt. Jno. Morin Scott  ""

  Sir Philada. May 22d. 1782 The Navigation of the Delaware being not only interrupted but at present Stoped by the British Cruisers, great Numbers of the Traders it is said are turning their Attention towards New York, from which place they principally expect to procure goods. This therefore ought to take up the first attention of the Legislature of New Jersey, as through that State all the goods must come. On our Legislature at this Time much depends. Money is going from hence to New York to Amounts almost incredible, and if not prevented will soon Drain the Continent of all the hard Cash; we are with hasty strides ruining ourselves by this destructive Commerce, I hope therefore no time will be lost in giving it a deadly blow-trifling measures will not answer, and yet you may do so much as to Spoil all. I wish the measures may be to  1st. Repeal all former Laws so far as not to affect Causes now depending under them.  2d. Make all goods, wares & Merchandize coming from the British Seizable-half to the State & half to the Seizor in all Cases whatsoever-the Condemnation as heretofore.  3d. Persons taken bringing out goods to forfeit to their value.  4th. All Goods Seized to be sold at public Vendue, the purchasers to be restrained from Selling them again or recurring them out of the state unless in Cloathing they wear.  5th. The 4th Article Agreed to will Naturally give place to a Clause to prohibit the sale of British goods in all Stores & Shops, as by the fourth Article it is to be presumed none will buy but for their own Consumption for while British goods are publickly sold in Shops it will be impossible to Stop the trade. As to Prize goods brought in from Sea, we get so few in New Jersey they can be disposed of as Seized goods are.  6th. Except Salt, Subject however to inspection.  7th. Lay fines or Annex punishments for sending any produce to the Enemy (flax seed & Cyder possibly might be excepted). The forfeitures for going into the Enemies Lines must be continued or encreased. Any thing going to the Enemy may be Seized if the fact can be Ascertained but in most cases this will be impossible, and no decision ought to go upon Conjectures, otherwise no man is safe in his property. The most difficult part of the Law will be with respect  MAY 23, 1782  to produce going to the Enemy but you had better be altogether Silent on that head than Countenance Seizures & Judgments founded on Conjectures & Suspicions, as hath frequently happened.

  Dear Doctr. Philadelphia May 27th 1782 I received yours of the 20th by Colo Nichols, with the Cash you mention in your letter, for which I am obliged to you, it Came very opportunely. Our State is rather tardy in remittances to their Delegates.  We are Still under the most disagreable uncertainty respecting the Battle of the two fleets in the West indias. Some Accounts are favourable, while others are not. The Martineque Account Contained in this days paper is I think most probable, and we had little doubt of the truth of it 'till the Arrival of a Vessel from St. Thomas in fifteen days-the Capt of which says that the report there was more unfavourable for the french than even the Account given in the Antigua paper, but Still no accounts had been received there that Could be relyed on, and bets run very high respecting the Issue of that Engagement. This day the Capt of a Vessel from Martineque Arrived here in twenty days who says that the people there were  MAY 27, 1782  under equal perplexity with our selves, haveing no particulars that Could be Safely Credited. Both fleets it was Supposed were gone to Leward, which might have prevented a Speedy information being given. I hope in the end it will turn out that Counte de Grasse has obtained his object by forming a junction with the Spanish fleet at Hispaniola, and tho' he may have Suffered much in the engagement (which I am pursuaded is the Case with both fleets) he has gained a Victory.  The Official Intelligence from Europe is favourable. The Dutch are Slow in their Decissions, and the Spanish much more so, but it is probable, our Minister at the Hague will in a short time, be received by the states General in his public Character, of Course the Independence of America Will be by them Acknowledged. Lippincut the Murderer of Capt Huddy not being given up, General Washington ordered An officer to be taken by ballot from among the British at Lancaster And Capt Coote (1) a Son or nephew to Sir Erie Coote in the East Indias, is Sent to Head Quarters, as a Subject for retaliation, who will undoubtedly be Excuted unless the perpretrator of that Horrid Murder is Surrendered in time-this affair it is to be hoped will encrease the Animosity Allready Subsisting between the British, and the Refugees; If he is given up the latter will think themselves Injuriously treated, And if a British Officer (and especially one of such powerful Connections) is Sacrafised to Save the life of a Refugee, it must excite indignation in the former and occasion Such uneasiness and dissatisfaction in their Army, as will not be easily removed-have inclosed the papers.

Mr. Root & Mr. Montgomery are the Gentlemen who visit our State, with both of whom I think you are personally acquainted, Govr. Rutledge & Mr. Clymer go to the Southward.(2) Dr Franklin inclosed the Minister of foreign Affairs a Letter from Mr. Adams,(3) wherein he informs him of a Conversation he has had with Digges who was introduced to him by Letters from David Hartley which assured Mr. A. that he came from the highest authority, their Conversation was about a Truce or a Peace in very general Terms, but at parting Digges told Mr. A. he had fully answered the Design of his Mission, which was to be assured whether there were in Europe Persons properly authorized to treat of & conclude a Truce or Peace. Mr. A. informed Digges by a Billet before he saw him that he should communicate whatever passed between them to Dr. Franklin & the Count De. Vergennes. Dr. F. informs the Minister of foreign Affairs, that Application has been made to him, the Particulars of which he shall give by the next Opportunity, & that Overtures have been made to the Count De Vergennes to bring about a separate Peace with France, on Terms very favourable & acceptable to that Court, if unallied; the Minister of France has informed several of us of the same Thing & that the Proposition was rejected with Disdain; but why Dr. Franklin omitted to give us by the last Vessell an Account of the Conversation he had held, or why Mr. A. was permitted to communicate to the Count Vergennes his Conversation with Digges, are yet to be accounted for. The french Minister here & his Masters are very evidently greatly alarmed at the Prospect of Overtures from Great Britain to us-But if nothing more transpires than has yet, they may be very easy, for by what has been yet communicated (which is only the Commission of Sir Guy Carle- MAY 28, 1782  ton & a Copy of the Bill you see in Print) they rather seem to intend to insult than conciliate us.

  Dear Sir May [28] 1782 (1) A letter from Docr. Franklin of the 4th of March informs the Superintendt. of Finance that the {court of France had granted an aid of six million of livres to the United States}(2) for the {present year}.(3) It appears {however that this aid has been wholly anticipated} as well as the {aids} of the {last year} by {bills of exchange}, by {supplies} for {the army} particularly those {in Holland, by the debt} to {Beaumarchais} amounting to {two million} & {a half of livres}, by {the interest mony}, by the {deduction} on account of {Virginia computed} at {seven hundred thousand livres} &c. The States {must therefore} by {some means} or {other supply the demands of Congress} or a {very d[ange]rous (4) crisis must ensue}. After the difference between the {modes of feeding the army} by {contracts} & by {the bayonet has been} experienced both {by the army and the people, a recurrence to the latter cannot be too much dreaded}.  {The province of} Friesland has {instructed its delegates in the States general to concur in a public reception of} Mr. Adams. The {city of Dort} has done {the same to theirs in the} provincial {assembly of Holland}.  The above letters came by the Alliance wch. is arrived at Rhode Island. Capt. Barry I am told says the {the marquis}(5) will {come} with {a squadron} for {the American coast} which was {equipping}. If {this be true} Barry is {wrong} in {disclosing it}. I {distrust it}. MAY 28, 1782  A French Cutter is since arrived after a short passage with despatches for the Minister here. He recd. them on Saturday by an express from Salem, and has not yet communicated their Contents to Congress. I {understand through the secry} of {foreign affairs} that {the court of London has lately proposed} to {the court of France a separate peace} as the price of {which she would} place {Dunkirk in} its {former state}, make some {sacrifices in the East Indies and accede to a status quo in the West Indies. The answer of France was dictated by her engagements with the United States}. This insidious step taken at the same moment with the agency of Mr. Carlton will I hope not long be withheld from the public. We have heard nothing from this Gentleman since the answer to his request of a passport for his Secretary.(6)  In order to explain our public affairs to {the states and to urge} the necessity of complying with the requisitions of Congress, We have determined to {depute two members} to {visit the eastern states} and {two the southern}. The first are {Root and Montgornery}. The others {Rutledge and Clymer}. I put this in Cypher because Secresy {has been enjoined by Congress}. The {deputation} will probably set off in a few days.  I find that {the minister of France has been informed by some correspondent in Virginia that the late intelligence from Britain has produced very unfavorable symtoms in a large party. He seems not a little discomposed at it. The honour of the state concurred with my own persuasion in dictating a consolatory answer to him}.(7) For this reason as well as for others I think it would be expedient for {the legislature to enter into a unanimous declaration on this point}. Other {states are doing this and such a mode of} announcing {the sense of the people may be regarded as more authentic than a declaration from Congress. The best form} I conceive will be that of an {instruction to the delegates}.(8) Do not fail to supply me with {accurate and full general? informations} on the whole subject of this paragraph.  A letter from Dr. Franklin of the 30th of March inclosing a copy of one to him for Mr. Adams at the Hague were laid before Congress subsequent to writing the above.(9) By these it appears not only that an essay has been made on the fidelity of France to the Alliance, but that the pulse of America has been at the same time separately felt thro' each of those Ministers. They both speak with becoming indignation on the subject, attest the firmness of our ally, and recommend decisive efforts for expelling the Enemy from our Country. Mr. Adams says \""{ten or eleven cities of Holland} have {declared themselves in favour of} American independence {and} it is {expected} that to{day or tomorrow} this {province} will {take the decisive resolution of admitting me} to {my audience}. Perhaps some {of the other provinces may delay} it for {three or four weeks but the prince   has declared} that {he has no hopes of resisting the torrent and therefore} that {he shall not attempt it. The Duke de Vauguion has acted a very friendly and honourable part in this business without however doing any ministerial act in it.}\"" What was said above of {Friesland} came from Mr. Berkley the Consul. (l0)° Mr. Adams says {nothing of} that {province altho'} his letter is {of later date}. If this sd. find you at Richmond, it will be unnecessary for you & Mr. R[andolph] both to be at the labor of decyphering, the above being copied from his letter. I made this provision for the contingency of your not having proceeded to Richmond. That you may not give me more credit for it than is due, I must confess that you owe it in part to the facility which my letter to him in Cypher afforded for repeating the intelligence to you. I believe I have omitted one paragraph on another subject which he will communicate to you.(11) Whitesides has the means remitted for taking up the note in which I am concerned.

It appears therefrom that {a loan for} the {current year} has been {granted to} the {United States} of- {million of livres} and that {a deduction has been made} of {seven hundred thousand livres therefrom on account} of {Virginia for stores purchased} for that {state} by the {ministry of France} whereby the {state of Virginia becomes debtor to the United States}. This appears to us at present to be {the act of the ministry in France} but from what motive or by whose instigation is not clear to us. When it was {determined to solicit that loan}, we can only find {that Congress authorized} the {minister of the war department}, of {foreign affairs and minister of finance} to explain {to the minister of France the absolute} necessity {of such a supply}.  We hinted to your Excellency in our last,(3) {the distressed and critical state} of {the financees} and the measures which wd. probably be persued by Congress {in hopes of exciting the states} to all {the activity} and {energi} they are capable of in that line. We have not been mistaken in our Conjecture, and congress has deemd speedy {exertions} of {such consequence} to the {welfare of the general cause} that altho there is but {a bare representation left}, they have come to a resolution {to dispatch two} of {their members} to the {southern and two to the eastern states charged} with an {explanation} to the Executives and {such of the [legislature]s} as {may be in session of the true state of our finances} and the {causes leading thereto}. They have also ordered {an exact state} of the {loans, subsidies} and {monies received} to be {laid before them by the minister of finance} together {with an account} of {their application}. Mr. {Rutledge and} Mr. {Clymore are deputed to the south states(4) Mister Root and} Mr. {Montgomery to the northward} the latter {set off tomorrow}. Letters from Dr. Franklin so late as the 30th of March last (5) inform us that England is weary of the War- that she appears to want to get out of it if she knew how, that she is nevertheless making {useless attempts} to {withdraw us from France by secret applications to our ministers} in {Europe} at the same time that {she} is {playing the same game by her commissioner here} and {by secret} tho' {f}rui{tless applications to the court of France} accompanied by great and {advantageious offers to that court} which we are informd from {another quarter France has noble rejected and} has {categorically answerd} by declaring {she will accept no offer but the independence of the United States.} Dr. Franklin also informs us that a Bill is on its passage through the British House of Commons for the Exchange of American Prisoners. It appears that  an emissary has been sent to Mr. Adams at the Hague from the British Ministry to sound him relative to peace and to know whether he had any powers from Congress to conclude a truce. A conference was held between the Emissary and him in the Presence of Mr. Adams Secry.,(6) and terminated as soon as he received information that there were powers lodged in Europe for treating of a Peace which he Said no person in England could ascertain, untill then, altho, he confessd it had been announced in all the Papers of Europe. We have related these facts to you but as many of them are secret in their Nature we trust they will not be divulged, but in such proportion as they may be usefull in opening the Eyes of our Constituents to the Chicane and Duplicity of our Enemy and the firmness and good faith of our Ally-and, as they may stimulate all ranks to Energetic exertion to obtain the desired object, of an honorable peace in Conjunction with our Illustrious Ally, and Independence. Mr. Adams letter to Dr. Franklin of the 26th of March also informs him that ten or eleven of the Cities of Holland, have declared for our independence and that he expects that Province, will determine the next day to admit him to an Audience. He says the Picture of England drawn by the above mentiond Emissary from G Britain is for them a Gloomy one. We have at length obtaind and herewith send you a copy of the Pensylvania Act of Assembly you some time ago requested to have.(7)  We are with the Greatest respect Yr. Excys. most obedt serts.

  Dear Sir Philada. May 29th. 1782. The inclosed letter (1) was put into my hands several weeks ago. As I found by looking into it that it related to a subject decided on in the case of Col. Carrington,(2) and which wd. be communicated by him to Majr. Pierce, I thought is unnecessary to transmit it by the Post. This is the first private conveyance that has offered.  I wrote to you yesterday morning by the post fully & in Cypher.(3) As I am told however the Bearer will probably be in Richmond before the Post, it may not be amiss to repeat to you that we have heard nothing from Carlton since our refusal of the passport to his Secy. and that we have authentic information from Europe that insidious attempts have been made both on Dr. Franklin & Mr. Adams, by British Emissaries, as well as tempting overtures employed to divide our Ally from us. These Machinations have served no other end than to expose the meanness & impotence of our Enemy, and to supply fresh proofs of the indissoluble nature of the Alliance. Mr. Adams begins to advance with considerable speed towards the object of his Mission in Holland.  The Action in the West Indies is still wrapt up in darkness. The inclosed paper contains a specimen of the obscure & contradictory advices which have alternately excited our hopes & our apprehensions.  A Copy of sundry resolutions of the House of Delegates touching the exportation of Tobacco in the Flags, was laid before Congress Yesterday by the Superintendt of Finance, & referred to a Committee.(4) On a review of the Doctrine of the 9th Art. of the Confederation I believe the right of the State to prohibit in the present case the exportation of her produce can not be controverted. The States seem to have reserved at least a right to subject foreigners to the same imposts & prohibitions as their own Citizens; and the Citizens of Virga. are at present prohibited from such an exportation as is granted in favor of the B. Merchants. This is a very interesting point and unless the division line between the Authority of Congress & the States be properly ascertained, every foreign treaty may be a source of internal as well as foreign controversy. You may call to mind one now in negotiation which may be affected by the construction of this clause in the Confederation. Congress have no authority to enter into any Convention with a friendly power which would abridge such a right. They cannot have a greater authority with respect to a Hostile power. On the other side it is equally clear that the State has no authority to grant flags for the exportation of its produce to the Enemy. Armed Vessels wd. not respect them, nor would they be more respected in the Courts of Admiralty. Unless MAY 29, 1782  Congress & the State therefore act in Concert no Tobacco can be remitted to N.Y. and a further drain of Specie must ensue. When the matter was first opened in Congress the impression was unfavorable to the right of the State, and pretty free strictures were likely to be made on its opposition to the Constitutional power of Congress. It became necessary therefore to recur to the law & the testimony which produced an acquiescence in the contrary doctrine. Their sentiments however with regard to the policy & consistency of the Resolutions are very different. The last Resolution in particular Compared with the preliminary doctrines produces animadversions which I need not recite to you.(5) There are several reasons which make me regret much this variance between Congress & Virga. of which a material one is that a great Personage (6) will be touched by it since it originates in his Act, & since in a conference between a Committee, him, & the Superintt. He concurred in the expediency of granting the passports. Gillon is just arrived here with five sail of the Havannah fleet, I have not yet heard whether he brings news or not. Adieu  ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia June 2d 1782 In order to curtail this Epistle I enclose you the latest news papers which contains all the domestic inteligence. Britain has changed her Ministry, and they it seems are disposed to change the system of the War in America, but we see no reason to believe that it is their intention to yield us our Independance or cease to exercise every means in their power to injure and distress us. Finding they cannot by force accomplish their diabolical designs they are now about trying the effect of artifice & Intrigue. An Emmissary has been sent by the British Minister to Mr Adams at the Hague requesting to know if any person from America was vested the power of negociating a seperate peace. About the same time a secret Agent was sent to the Court of Versailles, proposing A seperate peace with France and offering to give them up all their conquests in the West Indes and some advantages in the East Indes, the French Minister answered that any propositions for peace that did not contain the Independance of America was inadmissable.  Thus we see their nefarious schemes subverted and A Contrary effect flow from it, for it will tend more warmly to attack and unite France & America and increase that growing confidence between the two Nations.

  Dear Doct. Philadelphia June 2d. 1782 For intelligence I refer you to the inclosed papers. The Accounts they Contain of the battle between the two fleets in the West Indies, are upon the whole rather unfavourable; however we have Still Some room to doubt of the truth of it. No official Account has been yet received at N York and they are there as uneasy it is said respecting the matter as we are; had the Issue been so favourable to the British as has been represented, it is reasonable to suppose that a Communication of a matter of such vast importance, to their Commander in Chief, would not have been so long delayed. This with some other Circumstances, incline many to believe we Shall Shortly receive a quite different Account. For my part I am willing to hope for the best, but am fearful the french have received So much Damage in the Action, as will prevent the intended Attack on Jamaica for some time. You will see by the papers that the States General have Acknowledge our Independence, Should this be the Case the advantages Arising from it will more than ballance Any disadvantages that may result from Count de Grasse's Defeat, Should that have happened.

  Dear Sir Philada. June 4th. 1782. I found no difficulty in the bill remitted by Mr. F Webb. As it was not made payable to you, even the forms of business did not require your endorsement.(1)  According to your request I send an authenticated extract from the Journals of the vote of Congress on the clause which interdicts British Manufactures.(2) It has however been for some time in print, and will probably have been at Richmond before you receive the manuscript copy. The arguments urged against the measure appear to me in the same light in which you describe them. The policy of G.B. in the capture of St. Eustatius has been constantly reprobated by some of her wisest Statesmen. But whatever her policy might at that period be, it is manifest that a very different one is now pursued. British Goods are issued from the Enemy's lines with greater industry than they have ever been, and as is universally believed, with the knowledge, if not at the instigation of those in power. Indeed they would counteract their new System in doing otherwise. The sense of the Eastern States will appear from the ays & nos on the question. Mr. Adams in his last despatches ascribes much of the late pacific symtoms in the British Nation, and of the facilities which begin to attend his mission in Holland, to our proscription of British Merchandise.  You have not sufficiently designated the papers from {Mr R. JUNE 4, 1782  Morris}(3) from which you wish an extract. I do not recollect nor can I find any letter which contains a {state of the finances} except {his circular letters} which may be found either among the legislative or Executive Archives. If you should be disappointed in these researches, I will on a renewal of your demands, renew my researches. My charity I own can not {invent an excuse for [the] prepense malice} with which the {character and services of this gentleman are murdered}.(4) I am persuaded that {he accepted his office} from {motives which were honourable and patriotic}. I have seen {no proof of misfeasance}. I have heard of many {charges} which {were palpably erroneous}. I have known others somewhat {suspicious vanish on examination}. Every {member in Congress} must be sensible of the {benefit} which has {accrued to the public from his administration}. No intelligent man {out of Congress can be altogether in}sensible {of it}. The {Court of France has} testified {its satisfaction at his appointment} which I really believe {lessened its} repugnance to {lend us money}. These considerations will make me cautious in lending an ear to the suggestions even of the impartial; to those of {known and vindictive enemys} very {incredulous}. The same fidelity to the public interest which obliges those who are its appointed guardians, to pursue with every rigor a {perfidious or dishonest servant of the public} requires {them} to confront the imputations {of malice against the good and faithful one}. I have in the conduct of {my colleague here(5) a sure index of the sentiments and objects of one of my colleagues who is absent (6) relative to the department of finance}.  The Chevr. de la Luzerne tells us he has written to the Govr. on the subject of the transaction between them, and has no doubt that the difficulties which attended it will be removed.(7)  A Letter from Mr. Adams of an older date but recd. since the one mentioned in my last, confirms the article relating to Friesland in the Letter from Mr. Barkley.(8) There are some opinions & circumstances however stated in this letter which its priority will scarcely reconcile with those mentioned in the other. At the date of it which was the 11th of March he was not sanguine as to the unanimity of Holland, and less so as to an early concurrence of the other Provinces. What is singular is that his apprehensions with respect to the first Province were drawn from the conduct of Amsterdam, which has heretofore been the cornerstone of all his expectations. This revolution in the City is the effect he says of a revolution in the Regency.  The Deputies to {the s. states} set off on Sunday last.(9) Congress on a report of the Committee on the Resolutions of the House of Delegates, have authorized them to make such explanations relative to the {flags} as they shall judge expedient.(10) In a letter which I wrote by a private hand since the last post day, I have been pretty   full as to the sentiments of Congress with regard to the Resolutions. I wish to hear whether this extra letter reaches you safe or not. (11)  Your favor of the 21st (l2) came in better season than the preceding one. In the argument relating to the Flags you might have added to the passports for Salt, a case still more directly in point. A Letter from Govr. Jefferson of the 7th of Feby. 81 refers it to the Delegates to obtain permission to send provisions to N.Y. instead of hard money for the subsistance of the Prisoners. (13) The Enemy at that day refused to accept Tobo. but were willing to accept these more necessary articles. Congress refused to give passports for the latter. It may be sd. indeed that this was prior to the ratification of the federal Articles. But it will at least justify Congress & the Viga. Delegates in particular in presuming on the concurrence of the State in the measure in question. As to the simple right of granting flags it is impossible to shake it on any principle. It is a lesser power evidently involved in the major one of making peace. A flag is a partial truce as a truce is a temporary peace. I recollect that when the Committee consulted Genl. Washington & the Superintendt. (14) it was unanimously supposed that a remittance of Tobo. to N. York wd. be less obnoxious to our allies than of the identical money recd. from their generous friendship.  The resolutions of the Assembly agst. insidious negociations are very apropos. (15) I hope all the Legislatures now sitting will enter into similar ones spontaneously & unanimously. It will always be best for Congress to appear to follow rather [than] lead the sentiments of their constituents, & particularly so in the present instance. We immediately sent a copy of them to {Minister of France}.  ""

I shall give him the same provisional authority over the one addressed to you. I fear however from your silence as to your return that he will not have occasion to exercise it. Mr. C. Griffin (3) who got hither on Sunday gives me some hopes on this subject.  Genl Washington has transmitted to Congress sundry informations he has recd. of preparations at N. Y. for expediting from thence, a considerable number of Ships. Whether they are to convey troops & whither, or to bring off troops from other places is uncertain. He has also transmitted to Congress an answer to him from Genl Carlton on a demand made at the instance of the Legislature of S. Carolina of a retransportation of the exiles at the expence of the King of G. B.(4) This demand was instituted not executed during the Command of Clinton, from whom an imperious refusal was calculated upon. In pursuance of the views of the new System, his successor weeps over the misfortunes of the exiles, and in the most soothing language that cd be framed, engages to comply fully with the application. This incident at once mortifies our pride & summons our vigilance. We have no[thin]g further from Carlton on the main point.  The communication expected in my last from M; of F. has been recd. and afforded a very seasonable occasion which was improved, of renewing the assurances suited to the present crisis.

 Virginia Delegates to Benjamin Harrison Sr. Philadelphia June 4th 1782 Our last of the 28th Ultimo informed your Excelly. fully of the State of News at this place, Since which nothing material has happend, except what the enclosed News Paper contains. There yet remains some doubt relative to the event of the Action of the two fleets in the West Indies. Accounts from Martinique by different Channels and of a late date, appearing to render it dubious, whether Rodneys letter is spurious or real, we confess however, we have no expectation of its being the former; Yet there is great room to believe that the remainder of the French fleet will form a Junction with the Spanish at Cape Francois and that the Combined fleets will have a decided Superiority in the West Indies, which will enable them to proceed with the Expedition against Jamaica.  We find-in a Report, the Superintendt. of Finance has made to Congress-the Substance of his letter to you on the Subject of Stores, and have since had a Communication with the minister of France on that Subject, (1) who, informs us he Answerd your letter, to him, relatively thereto, and he hopes satisfactorily, but requested us to acquaint your Excelly., \""that the Misfortune which the Count de Guichens Convoy had met with, rendering it very difficult, for the Ministry to procure transports for the Supply of their own fleets and Armies and to bring out the Supplies orderd for the United states, he feard it would not be practicable to send out those which had been purchased for the State of Virginia in any short time.\"" He gave us to Understand that the transfer of the Debt from the State of Virginia to the United States had been a Misunderstanding of the Ministry, or some of the Under offices, & that it would be revoked and accommodated to all parties. We think however it would not be imprudent in the State of Virginia (if they wish soon to have those Stores[)], to provide transports for them and to obtain the same JUNE 4, 1782  Convoy as those Vessels which are to bring out those belonging to the Un. States.  The Count de Beniousky having, renewd to us, an offer which has been made to Congress-and not accepted as will be seen by the Enclosed papers No. 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 (2)_We thought it a matter of too much Consequence not to transmit to your Excelly. which we have done, with copies of all the Papers, relative thereto, as above mentiond, which have been before Congress. It will rest with your Excelly. to consider the propriety of taking the Sense of the Legislature thereon. The terms offerd in the Paper No. 4 refers to those which have been made to Congress, which Yr. Excelly. will See in the Paper No. 1, and an explanation thereof in No. 2 after having been remarked upon by Genl. Washington. We have only to add on this Subject that the Gentleman who makes the offer does it as an Individual. That he is a Polish Nobleman and a near relation to the late Count Pulasky-That a part of the troops he offers, and many of the officers (as he informs us) are such as have followd his fortunes in the Partition of that Kingdom-That Banishd from his own Country he professes a desire to become (with his followers) a Citizen of some one of these United States that he has recommendations, from the French Ministry to their Minister here and has had his Countenance. The Rejection of his offer to Congress arose from a doubt in two or three of the States concerning the Propriety or policy of their being accepted by Congress. It is his desire that the offer made by him-if not accepted-may be kept as secret as possible, and that the answer thereto may be transmitted, through us, with all possible expedition-as-he will be under a necessity of departing for Europe in the Course of three or four Weeks from this date-either to put himself in a state to Execute his proposals, or to take other steps with his troops, which are now in the Imperial Service, and will shortly be at his own charge. His desire of Secrecy and the Expedition with which Mr. Webb informs us he will travel has induced us to prefer a Coneyance by that Gentn. to one by the Post on this occasion.  Since Writing the above Genl. Washington has informed Congress in a letter read yesterday, that he had received intelligence of some movements of the Enemy at New York which indicate a considerable embarkation, as upwards of 80 transports, under a strong Convoy had fallen down to the Narrows-in order as was supposed to take in a large body of troops-that the whole of the Regular troops had been reviewd-and a very large proportion of them were under Marching orders, for what purpose not known. We Submit to Yr. Excelly whether it would not be prudent, at least to be on our   Guard-notwithstanding the delusive appearances lately held out, at least-not to relax in any preparations for carrying on the War.  The last post brought us no letter from Yr. Excelly. with the most perfect respect we are Yr. Excellency's Most obedt. Humbe Serts Theok. Bland Jr J. Madison Jr.  ""

  Dear Sir. Phila. 4th June 1782. I thank you for your favor by the last Post-my not having received it before Tuesday Noon must plead my Excuse for not writing you by the Return of the Post who was taken ill on the Road up, which obliged the Post Master to send after the Mail which did not arrive Time enough to give an Opportunity to answer Letters.  The Event of the Action between the two Fleets is yet as uncertain as ever, the Reports and written Accounts are so very contradictory that the Mind remains in a State of Indetermination. An Opinion formed on either side is immediately combated by Reasonings and Circumstances on the other almost equally strong, I have my Fears, and Hopes too, and there leave it to Time to settle the Matter.  Capt. Asgill of the Guards is the Officer on whom the Lott has fallen to die for the Sins of his Countrymen in the cruel and barbarous Murder of Capt. Huddy. (1) He came to this City last Wednesday under Guard, and on Thursday went on for Head Quarters where he will most certainly meet his Fate if the real Murderers of Huddy are not delivered up. He is quite a Youth, not more than 19 or 20 Years of Age, but seems to feel most sensibly the Weight of his Misfortunes. A British Officer was some Days a head of him, on his Way to N York to solicit Carleton in his favor. The Situation of this last must be very delicate. The Importunities of the Officers on the one Hand in favor of their Brother, and on the other the fear of disobliging the Refugees by delivering up their Brother Lippencot, must embarrass Sir Guy exceedingly. Clinton got out of this Difficulty very seasonably. JUNE 4, 1782  Not one Word from Sir Guy yet on the grand Business, tho' some Persons are in hourly Expectation of hearing from him. For my Part I have not the least Desire to have any Communications from the Gentleman, if any Propositions are to be made that America can listen to, the Way is open on the other side the Water, where there are persons properly authorized to treat in Conjunction with our Allies, to them let the Applications be made.  Are we to have no other Member of Congress sent in Addition to those who are here? Believe me it is necessary, and particularly so at this Time, to have a full Representation in Congress. Business of very great Importance may come upon the Carpet, which will require the Attendance of all the Delegates. At Present we have only eight States represented, and not more than two Members attending from any one, and for some Time past only seven States were attending; this Circumstance from the nature of our Constitution is productive of very great Delay, as no Motion can be carried into Effect without the concurrence of seven States at the least. Upon the Whole I find the Duty extremely heavy, and the Rewards light. I can't think of remaining long in this situation.  Majr. Jennifer some Time ago directed Colo. Hollingsworth to sell a Quantity of Pig Iron to raise £100 each for the attending Delegates; he did so but I believe he has not received the Money for it altho' the Time of Payment is elapsed. The Colo. has notwithstanding furnished Mr. Hanson and myself with £50 each, which on my Part is nearly expended, and I see but little Prospect of getting any more shortly. The small Allowance we have ought to be regularly remitted to prevent extreme Distress. I Wish the Major wou'd think of another Order before this Supply is quite exhausted. Not one Line from you by this Post.  I am with real Esteem and Regard, yr. very humble Servt.  Turbutt Wright  ""

We have been so little while in Congress as not to be able to  JUNE 6, 1782  transmit to you any matters of Consequence since our Arrival.(1) Your Letters to the President were seasonably delivered & tho Congress seemd to think Dean or his letters in themselves Considered not worthy of Notice yet they seemd highly pleased with your Answer considered in a publick light & ordered the same to the Minister of foreign Affairs.(2) A word has not been said in Congress with respect to the dispute between Connecticut & Pensylvania, tho some Gentn out doors employd by this State have Conversed with us on the Subject & propose a Conference so far as to know each others Concessions to save trouble & expence, & Indeed mention something about our agreement on the Commissioners &c.

  Dear Sir June 6th [1782] Mr. Webb being detained till this morning (1) I enclose you the gazette of it. You will find a singular extract from Lord North's Butchet. The Speech was delivered on the 11th of March. It must have been Mr. Ross's Contract therefore & not Mr. Morris's which supplied this article.(2) I am just told that the Senate have put their JUNE 6, 1782  veto on the Resolutions of the H. of Delegates agst. the latter. If an existing law however prohibits the exportation, and one branch of the Legislature protests agst. the authority of Congress to dispense with it, The Executive will scarcely suffer the Tobo. to be exported. If this matter should terminate in an agreement by Maryland to supply the Tobo. and Virga. should be drained of her money to purchase the Staple of the former, whilst her own Staple is left on her hands . The proviso in the resolutions in favr. of the Contract of the State agent furnishes I find a copious topic for AntiVirginian Critics. It is inconsistent with the laws of the State-with the Ordinances of Congress-with the Treaty with France-with gratitude to our Allies-for Tobo. to be shipped to N.Y by Mr. M. for the advantage of the U.S. But if the identical Tobo. be shipped by Mr. R. for the advantage of Virga. the inconsistency is done away in the eyes of The House of Delegates of Virginia.  A New York paper of the 1st Instant contains so many minute particulars touching the defeat of the French in the W. Indies, taken it is sd. from an official acct. in the St. Lucia Gazette, that Mr.de M s(3) himself says it is in vain any longer to struggle agst. the belief of it.  ""

  Dear Sir, June 9th 1782 Philada. You have laid me under great obligations by your favor of the second of May. A correspondence with you was an event more wished for than expected as I know your constant hurry of business; but, your politeness in beginning the matter has very sensibly affected me.  I have had many anxious hours about the army under your command. It seems to be decreed that you are to have a succession of evils to encounter. No sooner have you confined the enemy to the environs of the capital, than mutiny & discontent make their appearance. I know your army has a long list of grievances unredressed; but, if you had a battle every month, a skirmish every week, there would be less danger of mutiny. We have had a great deal of talk about supplying the Southern army, & I hope some good will result from it. I agree with you that the powers of Congress are too limited. Treason in our governments may be committed by a state as well as an individual. That one which does not contribute its quota in men & money is guilty of treason in the worst sense; for it does that which in its consequences tends to the destruction of the body politic. Thanks to our stars, We learn from the debates in the house of commons, that an offensive war is no more to be prosecuted. This will procure a truce to the planters & the interior parts of our country. I wish it may not be the means of making a truce in our exertions for the expulsion of the common enemy.  After a variety of confused & contradictory intelligence about the fleets we have [at] last settled in the belief that the French lost five or six ships of the line on the 12th of April. I fear that this will ruin the expedition against Jamaica; but, let us hope, that it will give more leisure for an expedition to this continent. A naval war is devoutly to be wished, till at least we are able to do something at sea. We may all join in wishes that a stop should be put to a land war; but, it is questionable whether it is our interest to have peace completely both by sea and land. If the British continue to obstruct our trade it will learn us one of two things either to live without trade, or to continue the means of protecting it.  JUNE 10, 1782  Mr Rutlege is gone to wait on the assemblies of Maryland & Virginia by order of Congress. This is a new & a more effectual method than a circular letter.  Sir Guy Carleton is all good natu[re]. He has granted us flags to send back the inhabitants of South Carolina at the expence of the King of G.B., & adds \""that is in perfect conformity to the Kings benevolent intentions, \"" & talks very largely about ' forgetting the seventies that have imbittered our unhappy divisions.\"" Mr Gadsden never expected such an answer as this when he was so strenuous that the flags should be applied for. We are puzzled what to do-to refuse them would argue inconstancy & would be unkind to our people, to accept them in this moment of concilliation would perhaps be injurious to the united states. Congress will decide upon it in a few days. (1)  Your old friend, & my quondam fellow student, David Howell of Rhode Island college was added to our number last friday. He is a man of sterling sense, & I flatter myself will be a real addition to our body. Mr Ellery from that state is left out, it is said because he does not like Gen. Washington. If the people of America should ever relapse into Idolatry our illustrious commander in chief would be Jupiter, so universally is he beloved, I had almost said adored.  Yours most respectfully, David Ramsay  ""

  June 10? 1782](1)  Hints for a Letter to South Carolina  AEB. Letter has given me particular pleasure from its fullness and sincerity. Your sentiments are generous and bespeak the united position of the Patriot and the Politician. It is not by contracted and narrow motives that a public Official should act, but on large and disinterested conduct only can a free Government be established and [largely?] supported. A Legislature should proceed with caution and coolness not with the heat of a distempered mob. Persecution upon whatever Basis founded may give Life to the opposing Party. The Danger of fixing a Precedent for future Cruelties may affect the posterity of those who are uppermost. I much fear the indiscriminate ruin of the unfortunate with the wicked. The frailties of human nature should be taken into consideration by men to whom submission became necessary from Circumstances. The stigma indelibly affixd by the Vote of Sequestration will be more cruelly felt than the loss of property. Some who have pass'd through Life with the inestimable position of usefull and worthy Citizens must feel the pointed stroke of public indignity whose effects must remain on their Progeny who have conducted themselves with Punctuality and firmness-at the risque of everything they hold dear and valuable. I know the difficulty of stemming the Torrent of public Vengeance which seldom adopts Punishments to Crimes with proper Proportion.

  Sir (1) Philadelphia June 10th 1782 Permit Me, through you, to express my very grateful acknowledgments to the Honorable the House of Representatives, for the high Mark of Confidence which They, in Concurrance with the Honorable the Council of the State of Delaware, have been pleased to place in Me, by appointing Me one of their Delegates in Congress. I am very sensible, Sir, of this distinguished Honor, and it shall be, I assure you, my Study and pride, by every Means in my Power, to show myself worthy of the Appointment. I have requested the Favor of his Excellency the President, to take Charge of the printed Journals of Congress, from the first of January 1781 to the first of April 1782, and in a Short Time, I will forward to you, an Abstract of the essential business, which has since then come before that body.(2) That part of the Instructions to the Delegates, Which directed Them \""to use all Means in their power to obtain immediately an Alteration in the Ordinance concerning Captures\"" engaged their earliest Attention, and you will find, if you will be pleased to look into the Journals now transmitted, page 295, An Ordinance is made for further amending the \""Ordinance ascertaining what Captures on Water shall be lawful\"" And that therein is a Clause obviating the Grievance suggested in the Instructions to the Delegates. This I hope will meet with the Approbation of the Honorable the Assembly.  The consideration of the preliminary article respecting the Recognition of the Territory, called Vermont, and all Transactions relative to that Business are postponed to the last Tuesday in this Month. The Report of the grand Committee, consisting of a Delegate from each State, was made the first of March last, and in the Journals now sent, you will observe Sir, what passed in Congress upon that Subject. The first of April, The Agents for the People of Vermont laid before Congress A Letter dated the preceding Day, informing, That in Consequence of it's Declaration of the 20th of August last, The Legislature of Vermont had passed several Resolutions, expressive of their Compliance with the preliminary Article required by Congress, together with a Duplicate of a Commission to Them, impowring the said Deputys, in behalf of the State of Vermont, to Subscribe the articles of Confederation. This Letter and these Resolutions were referred to a Committee, Who made a Report favourable to the acknowledgment of the Independance of Vermont. A long Debate arose after reading the Report, and it issued in postponing the further Consideration of it, until, as has been observed, the last Tuesday in this Month. The States of New York, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia were averse from the Recog- JUNE 10, 1782  nition of the Independance of Vermont. The first, because it was alleged by Them, That part of the Territory included within the Boundaries of Vermont was the undoubted property of the State of New York, and that State had not a Sufficient Indemnity for it's Loss of Territory; And the three other States (Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia) were against the Recognition, because They were apprehensive, That by establishing a president, of admitting a new State into the Union, There would soon be one, or more new States erected upon the Territory, Westward of the Allegany Mountain. The Delegates of Virginia, a few Days after the Business of Vermont was postponed, moved, That Congress should decide, Whether They would accept the Cession offered by the State of Virginia, of the Lands to the Westward of the River Ohio, upon the Conditions annexed to that Cession. Eleven States being at this Time represented, A short Day was fixed for taking up the Report of the Committee, respecting vacant and unapropriated Lands, at the Commencement of the Revolution. This was accordingly done, and then a Motion was made by two of the Virginia Delegates (Mr. Arthur Lee and Colonel Bland) to this Effect. That each Member of Congress present, previous to the Consideration of the Report of the Committee, should declare upon his Honor, Whether He was, or was not interested in, or claimed any of the Lands mentioned in the said Report. This Motion was ridiculed by all the Members in the House, except those from Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, as it was notorious, There was scarcely a person of any Consideration in Virginia, Who had not taken out Warrants for, or located great Quantitys of Land, within the Country, Westward of the Allegany Mountain, in direct Contempt, and Disobedience of the Resolves of Congress. I thought it necessary upon this Occasion to rise, and say, That there was not a Member upon the Floor, who did not know, I was interested in Lands, Westward of the Allegany Mountain. The Memorials and Remonstrances of my Associates and myself lay upon the President's Table, and had most of Them, been in the Secretary's office, from the Year 1777, and now were connected with, and made part of the Report of the Committee. That when the private rights of my Associates and myself was taken up, and agitated in Congress, I should withdraw from the House; But at all Times, when the Consideration of the Lands, which were vacant and unapropriated at the Revolution, was before Congress, I should to the utmost of my Abilities, vindicate by Argument, and maintain by indisputable Documents, The Right of the United States to these Lands. In the Order of the Report of the Committee, The Cession of the State of New York was the first to be considered, and it was unanimously recommended by Them, That Congress should Accept it. Several Days passed in general and warm Debates upon the Report, and some Members being indisposed, and others obliged to   go to their several States, It was judged adviseable to defer the further Consideration of it, until the States were more fully represented, and Therefore it was postponed sine Die. The Business is to be revived, as soon as there are a sufficient Number of States represented in Congress, favourable to it; And if the affair of Vermont, and the Cession of New York were settled, and accepted, We should be joined by those two States. In short We might then safely reckon upon the following States voting with Us. Vidzt. Massachussets, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, (Delaware) & Maryland. It is of much Importance for Congress to accept the Cession of New York, because it would vest in the united States, all the Lands which the State of Virginia, without a Shadow of Right, now makes pretensions to. To enable the Honorable House of Representatives to form a proper Opinion, upon the Cession offered by the State of New York to the United States, I will take the Liberty of Briefly reciting the History, and Extent of it. The five Nations of Indians, are the unquestionable Propriators of the Country, as far South as Carolina; To the Northward, as far as New England, and as far West as the River Missisipi. A vast country (says Doctor Colden)(3) Which extends Twelve hundred Miles in Length from North to South, and about Six hundred Miles in Breadth. All this Country, in the year 1684 was put Under the protection of the Duke of York. Lord Howard of Effingham, Governor of Virginia, that year by a formal Instrument of Writing recognized and acknowledged the Governor of New York, under the Duke of York, To be the Governor of the five Nations. In 1701 These Nations by Deed of Conveyance placed all their hunting Lands On Ohio &c under the protection of the King of England for their Use, and the said King annexed this Trust, by two royal Instructions to the Government of New York, That it might take due Care of these Indians, and their Country. Those Instructions were produced and read in Congress. In 1722, a Conference was held at New York, between the Governor of that Province, and his Council, The Governor of Virginia and two Commissioners, and the Governor, and two Commissioners from Pennsylvania. The Governor and Commissioners of Virginia then, as appears, by the Minutes of the Council of New York, in the most ample Manner, recognized and acknowledged, That the Goverment of New York, had vested in Them the absolute Right of Jurisdiction over, and pre-emption of the Lands and Country of the five (now Six) Nations of Indians; And an act of Assembly of Virginia made in 1722, previous to the Governor and Commissioners of that colony, going to the above Conference at New York, authorised Them to make the said Recognition and Acknowledgement. Virginia sensible of her Want of right to the Lands, Westward of the Allegany Mountain, produces no Kind of Prooff to support it, But contents Herself with Threats, and vehe-  ment Declarations, Tho' She knows a royal Proclamation and repeated Instructions are ready to be produced against Her, forbidden her in the most explicit Terms to extend her Limits beyond the Mountain. His Excellency will inform the House, what has been done, and is proposed to be done in England, relative to these States, and that the new Ministry of that Kingdom, are mediating Measures, as offensive to the Honor and Happiness of the United States, as their predecessors have done. His Excellency will also explain to the House, the motives of Congress, for sending a Deputation of two of their Members to each of the States, Southward of, & inclusive of Pennsylvania to North Carolina and two other of their Members to the States, from New Jersey to New Hampshire inclusive. The Delicasy of their Mission, forbids Me from descending into particulars. Two Delegates of the State of New Jersey last week mentioned to Me, That They should soon move Congress, in Respect to the Islands in the Bay and River of Delaware.(4) Whenever this Business is brought on, you be assured Sir, That the Delegates will give the utmost Attention to it, and display the Right of the Delaware State. In some of the publick Papers of this City, A Writer has thought proper to mention my Name in opprobious Terms.(5) I have not taken the least Notice of his publications, apprehending it altogether unbecoming One of your Delegates to dispute with anonymous Scriblers. I consider myself wholy accountable to the State, Who has done Me the Honor of appointing Me, One of their Delegates in Congress, and it is for their Satisfaction, I have requested the Favor of his Excellency the President, to take Charge of two Certificates (exclusive of One from his Excellency Dr. Franklin) sent Me by two Gentlemen, who were immediately privy to my Conduct in England, and to These allow Me to add Sir, That I remained there, until the year 1778, at the Instance and express Desire of Doctor Franklin (with an offer from Him, of a handsome allowance from the United States) to furnish Him with regular accounts of the proceedings, and Designs of the British Court.(6) This I did, intirely to his Satisfaction, as He has certified, and the Court of France was so sensible of my Industry, and Fidelity in this Business (as I wrote constantly, through their Courier Once a Week, whilst their Ambassador staid in London, and by the post also, as often, Through the Mails to Calais & Ostend) That when I departed from France, Count de Vergennes, Secretary of State, recommended [me] in warm Terms to the Chevalier de Luzerne, Minister plenipotentiary of France to the United States. I am not ignorant of the Person, who composed the publications in Question, nor of the Original Instigator, behind the Curtain. If I had not exercised my Pen upon the pretensions of Virginia to the vacant Lands, I should have had no unfounded and unjust surmises, insinuated against Me. The secret author of these venemous Calumnys well knows The base Falsity of  JUNE 11, 1782  his own suggestions. He himself had the fullest Evidence to the Contrary; But an Attempt was to be made, from a hope, That possibly the Slander might injure Me, in the Opinion of the Honorable House. I would have paid my personal Respects to Them, But the State would have been unrepresented in my Absence.

  Dr. Tucker Philada. June 11th 1782 By my literary Register I stand indebted to you a letter-not on the general account-for I find one unanswerd-on perusing of it I find the cause of its being so. It containd many important observations, on most of which I wishd to descant freely with you-but the prolixity of the Public letter, and a multiplicity of other Business prevented me. Your Idea of the policy of the British ministry exactly corresponds with ours here, indeed their deceptions are so glaring that they cannot be mistaken by a people emerged, but one degree from Barbarism, accordingly, they seem to have affected several JUNE 11, 1782  Publick bodies-and produced Sentiments as Similar and as uniform, tho at a Considerable distance and without previous concert, as were excited in the time of the Stamp act &c. &c. &c. You will see this exemplified in the Resolutions of Jersey, Maryland, Virginia &c. &c. Those from our State have met with Universal approbation as being clear, sensible and decided, and I have reason to think will have a very Considerable Influence. It is near three Weeks Since I had the Honor to move that Congress shd. come to similar resolutions and publish a declaration to the World of their determination to hearken to no terms of accommodation, but what were strictly consistent with the terms of our alliance, nor ratify any treaty of which independence was not the Basis;(1) such a step will in my opinion give the Mediators a good ground to work upon-and do away all the false and insidious Arguments of the Court of great Britain, used to them, viz that their revolted Colonies are disposed to treat Seperately, and that they have a right to avail themselves of that disposition without the intervention of any power on earth and it will at the same time support the opposite Arguments of our ally with the Mediators-and shew the futility of an attempt in great Britain to undertake a seperate treaty with us in any form. I am happy to be informed by some of my Correspondents that your fears with respect to the fate of the Tax law and some other Business in the assembly will probably soon be at an end. We are led to believe that, the assembly are going on swimmingly on some capital points of finance, or that they do not intend to undo the good they have done. I think their Idea of dividing the tax into two installments, a very good one, it is the middle between two extremes, & will, (at the same time that it affords a test of their being specie,) put what there is into a more rapid circulation, and of course multiply its Quantity so that the specie first paid in will circulate to pay the 2d installment &c. This will not leave a vacuum which shd. be carefully avoided by every wise Government. I know not Certainly who you mean by our F--------d the Br------- but Guess it must be L---- -n-- -his gooses Quil does not appear to me capable of soaring to Eagle Heights-and all the Elevation the Farmer can ever expect, is that which Common sense has given him by weighing him in his own scales. I have performd my promise in introducing common sense in Virginia to his name sake in Philadelphia.(2) You tell me you have heard from Mrs. Bland by letter. I am extremely sorry to find by her letters that you nor any of my Friends, have had any other communication with her since my departure. Tell Fanny, I take it rather unkind that she has neither wrote to her Brother nor visited the part of him left in Virginia. I cannot account for it on any of the principles of Brotherly love-or Christian Charity. I have wrote once or twice to the Old   Gentleman but have Received no answer.

  My Dear sir Philadelphia June 11th 1782 I thank you for your favour of the 7th Instant. I shall rejoice to hear of the passage of a law establishing the 5 Per Ct Duty agreeable to the request of Congress (1) and if it is for a limited time I hope it will be for so long a time as to Effect every purpose.  That the french have lost Six Ships in the late engagement is a fact I fear too well Confirmed, but I Console myself in the hope that the British have Suffered equal damage. The Conduct of the french redounds much to their Credit and honor. They have with an inferior force protected the whole of their large Convoy, and made a junction with the spanish fleet-which was their main object, and which it was the business of the British to have prevented, so that it may with no great impropriety be said that they have obtained a Victory. The Combined fleets are still Superior to the British, and it is probable the Expedition Against Jamaica will go on, God grant it Success. Should the reduction of that important place, be Accomplished, that with their other losses will perhaps incline the English to think Seriously of peace. I believe it is pretty Certain that an embarkation of Troops has lately taken place at New York, but their Numbers and destination unknown. The Continental Treasury is very low indeed, nothing paid in by Any of the States. What will be  JUNE 11, 1782  the Consequence. Should our Bank fail? And what Can Support it if the Taxes are withheld? With the most Sincere Wishes for your health and happiness, I am, My Dear sir, Your most hble servt, J.H.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. 11 June 1782 I have your favor of the 1st instant.(1) I hope you received mine altho you do not acknowledge them. My punctuality has not been intermitted more than once or twice since your departure, and in no instance for a considerable time past.  I have written so fully concerning the flags that I have nothing to add on that subject, but that I wish the Senate may by their perseverence in this occasion exemplify the Utility of a check to the precipitate acts of a single Legislature.  Having raised my curiosity by your hints as to certain maneuvres, you will not forget your responsibility to gratify it. The pleasure I feel at your being included in the Commission for vindicating the claims of Virga. is considerably impaired by my fears that it may retard your return hither.(2)  Great as my partiality is to Mr. Jefferson, the mode in which he seems determined to revenge the wrong received from his Country, does not appear to me to be dictated either by philosophy or patriotism. It argues indeed a keen sensibility and a strong consciousness of rectitude. But this sensibility ought to be as great towards the relentings as the misdoings of the Legislature, not to mention the injustice of visiting the faults of this body, on their innocent constituents.(3)  The fleet said to be preparing to sail from N. York has, I believe certainly left that place with a body of troops on board. The number of men as well as the destination of the fleet is very differently represented. The prevailing conjecture as to the latter is that it will go to Charlestown, and either reinforce the Garrison there, or carry off the Garrison with the troops already on board, to the West Indies.  We have not yet obtained any official intelligence from the French fleet. Concurrent reports make it probable that it has made a junction with the Spanish fleet which awaited it at Hispaniola. Should this be the case, the loss suffered in the action of the 12 of April,  JUNE 11, 1782  ought not one would suppose to frustrate the expedition against Jamaica. No despatches from Europe have come to hand within the week past, nor do any of the proceedings of Congress furnish matter for a paragraph.  Sir G. Carlton still remains silent. The Resolutions which the Legislatures of the States are passing may perhaps induce him to spare British pride the mortification of supplicating in vain the forgiveness of Rebels.  Mr. {Izard},(4) warm & notorious as his predilection for {the Lees} is, acknowledges and laments the opposition made {by them} to measures adapted to the {public weal}.  The letter on the first page of the Gazette of this morning was written by Mr. {Marbois}. In an evening of promiscuous conversation I suggested to him my opinion that the insidiousness of the British Court, and the good faith of our Ally, displayed in the late abortive attempt of the former to seduce the latter, might with advantage be made known in some form or other to the public at large. He said he would think of the matter, & next day {sent me} the letter in question, with a {request that I would revise and translate it for the press}, the latter of which was done. I mention this that you may duly appreciate the facts & sentiments contained in this publication.(5)  If Mr. Jones sd..be at Richmond you will of course let him have a perusal of the inclosed papers &c.

  My Dear Sir, Philadelphia June 12th, 1782 Your kind Letter of the 1st Instt gave me great Pleasure, as it informed me of Patty's recovery, as I greatly feared she might have a bad Fever, when I left her.  It is now beyond a Controversy that the French have been most severely drubbed in the West Indies, Count DeGrasse is actually taken with 4 or 5 Capital Ships. This will greatly derange the prospects of the ensuing Campaign.  Trade in this City is at a Stand-nothing to be done in that way. The Merchts. seem to be very dreary in their prospects.

  Dear Doctr. Philadelphia June 12th 1782 I wrote you a few lines yesterday (1) by the post and inclosed you the paper of that day. That the french have lost Six Ships in the late engagement, is a fact I am afraid is too well Confirmed, but I console my self in the hope that whenever we have an Account of the Damage the British have Sustained (which Account we must not expect to receive from them) it will be found to be equal to that of the french. The Conduct of the French in this engagement notwithstanding the loss of so many of their ships must redound much to their honor & Credit. They have a fleet much inferior to that of the British protected their large Convoy and made a junction with the Spanish fleet, which was their main object, and which it was the designs of the British to prevent and it may with no great impropriety be said that they have gained A Victory. The Combined fleets being still Superior to the British, it is probable the intended expedition against Jamaica will go on, God grant it Success. Should the Surrender of that important place be Accomplished; that with the other losses the British have Sustained in the West Indies and other places would perhaps dispose them Seriously to think of peace, but I am still of opinion that nothing would Contribute to bring about that happy event so much as expelling them totally from this Cont[in]ent. Their present System is to distress us by a presecution of our trade, And to endeavour to Convince us, that it is not in the power of our Ally to give us that protection, and furnish us with the JUNE 12, 1782  supplies we expected, and by that means hope to draw us from our Alliance. It is pretty Certain that an embarkation has lately taken place at new york, and that about 80 Transports have lately Sailed from thence-the number of Troops and their destination is unknown, the most probable Conjecture is that they are going to Hallifax or the West Indies. Sir Guy Carlton Keeps himself very quiet. We hear nothing from him, only that he is disposed to Shew our prisoners every Act of Kindness and to grant every favour to our people that is asked of him. The motive is easily Seen into; had this line of Conduct been pursued four or five years Ago, it might have proved fatal to our liberties, but it is now too late, and must be looked upon as proceding from meaness rather than Humanity.  Our Treasury is lowe. What will be the Consequence if from the Supineness of the States our bank should fail? And what is to support it if the Taxes necessary for its Support should be withheld? Of the last requisition little or nothing has been paid in. I inclose you the papers of today. We are well. Our love to you and the Children, farewell, Yrs. J H  ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia June 12th. 1782 I have Just put pen to Paper tho we have nothing of Importance here-our Fears, on Account of the french Fleet are very considerable. It seems extraordinary here that we have not yet received the french Account of the Engagement on the 12th of last April which is this Day Two Months since. We still hope that, notwithstanding the french have probably suffered very severely, the English also were in that Engagement very roughly handled. I am afraid it will be an unfortunate Matter to the french & Spaniards, as it may have a Tendency to render more impracticable the intended Attack upon Jamaica, if not totally prevent their attempting to execute their Plan. I hope before this comes to Hand you will have recd. a more particular as well as a more favourable Account of the Action than any we have here. I hope in a short Time to have the Pleasure of seeing my Friends in Massachusetts, here I cannot stay; not for Want of Health, which I enjoy in a tolerable Degree at present: But for Want of the Means to continue it. I have been this Week honored with a Draught on the Treasurer made last January returned for non Payment. I should have been very happy to have had a single Line from any Body  JUNE 12, 1782  informing me of the true Reason why it was returned-there can subsist but two Reasons; either I have drawn for two much in the Course of the last Year; or, the Treasurer was not able to discharge it-either of which Reasons are sufficient to make me exceeding anxious to return. Return I must-Because I cannot now ask a Gentleman in this City to take a Draught upon Boston, or rather our Treasurer. And I cannot live here without the Means of living. I wish for no more than a decent support-And the whole Amount of my Draughts are considerably short of that. However I feel perfectly easy because I am entirely willing to be here or at Home, or any where else. I ask no Favors. If I can be useful to my Country it will afford me Pleasure in any Situation. If I cannot I wish to live retired; it is a Life that pleases me most.  I am, Dear Sir, your very sincere Friend and humble Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

Find Congress Composed of an Agreeable set of Gentlemen, affairs goe on with Decency & Harmony tho far from that Croud of Important business which formerly pressed on Congress. The principal Objects are to lessen our Expenditures as far as possible, tho I find the Establishments in many departments much too high which am Informed arose from their being made at a time when the New Currencies of paper bills were to take place tho on one hand Esteem'd as solid Cash in Nomination yet at the time known as a fact that they were not of but half the real Value by which means a high sum was given which they find difficult to reduce even when it must be paid in specie. The regulating the Courts of Appeal &c. are under Consideration, also a Comtee Appointed to make a draught for establishing and Collecting the Impost proposed to be laid, we have recievd the Act from our Assembly, but there are still two or 3 States behind, tho we hear they have passed the Necessary Acts yet they are not transmitted to Congress.  The Action between the French & English fleets in the West Indies has undoubtedly turned out to the disadvantage of the former. The French we believe have lost 7 or 8 Capital Ships among which is the Ville de Paris taken with the Admiral de Grass, tho the Accounts are different as to the Consequences, by some Accounts we are Informed that the French have since made a Junction with the Spanish and thereby will be able to maintain such a Superiority  JUNE 18, 1782  in the West Indies as to proceed in their designd Opperations, but by other Accounts, that they are so disconserted by this Severe blow, as totally to frustrate their designs against Jamaica &c but on the whole no Accounts are as yet receivd from the French Commander or any of that Nation who were in the Action.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia June 19th, 1782 In this dearth of European News, I doubt not the Contents of a private Letter from J.A. in Amsterdam of the 11th Aprill will be agreeable, altho' it is not made public here. \""The rapid revolution in the Minds of this Nation, and the unaccountable Ardour & Unanimity, which has at last seized upon them for connecting themselves with America, have occasioned me so many Visits to recieve and return, and so many Complimentary Letters to answer, as added to other more important affairs, have been more than I could perform. Five Provinces, Friesland, Holland, Zealand, Overyssel & Utrecht, have already decided with an Unanimity that is astonishing; and the two others Guilderland & Groningen it is supposed will determine as soon as they meet, which will be the 16th Current so that I suppose we shall have one ally more in a short Time.''(1) By another Letter, this short time is affixed at the first of May.

  Sir, Philadelphia June l9th, 1782. This is Just to Inform you that I Arrived here the 17th Instt.(1) The Southern Mail was taken, a few days Since in which it was said were many Letters of Importance.  I find great Complaints for want of Money, a very Considerable part of the Specie Imported, is carried to New York to purchase Goods of our Enemies which will have a direct Tendency, not only to drain the Country of Specie, to Assist our Enemies & give Offence to our Friends, but (in my Opinion) to protract the War, The Number of Persons who feel the (private) benefit of this Trade is so great, that it is the Opinion of some any further Attempts to prevent the Same would be Idle. It is said a Vessell was lately Seized going from New Jersey to New York with £14,000 Specie on board. I hope New Hampshire will soon have a Representation in Congress as it is of much Importance not only to them, but to the Union that every State Should be Represented. I believe great Dependance is made on Taxes from the Several States, but you will, without doubt be particularly Informed on this Head, as well as others by the Committee from Congress.

  Sir (Official) Philadelphia June l9th 1782 When I accepted of my last appointment as a Delegate, the Legislature were sufficiently apprised of its being on condition, that I should not spend the summer here.(1) Having by experience found that my constitution will not bear the intemperate heat of this climate, I think it therefore my duty to inform your Excellency that notwithstanding Mr Duane's arrival, which I expect every hour, the State will after a fortnight from this day, be unrepresented, I having fixed that period for my departure from this City, on my return for our State. Tho' I still enjoy my health by paying the greatest attention to it; yet I am convinced it will not continue here thro' the season. I have a Wife who is now infirm and Children and Grandchildren who depend much on me. It is my first duty, however I may absent myself from her, when she is in health, to be present with her in the hour of indisposition. A duty which as far as the will of Heaven will permit, I am determined to perform most religiously. Besides my private concerns, which suffer much by my absence, require my immediate attention. And tho' on this score I by no means regret the sacrifices I have made of them for about 7 Years past on the Public Altar; Yet a continuance of those sacrifices when unnecessary, would be criminal. Out of 28 months I have served 14; and of-this Year more than my proportion. We have two other Delegates (2) who should I continue will not serve one moment of the Year. One has a small family, the other none to provide for. They can therefore be spared from home with less private injury than I can; and I am resolutely determined against doing their duty; especially as I have already done more than my own. They will be obliged to submit only to three months absence. At the time I have fixed for my return I shall have been absent five months. Judge then Sir, if I can deservedly incur censure should I return home without being relieved; or rather whether, if the State should by that means be unrepresented, they would not justly incur it.  With respect to Mr. Benson in particular, I cannot but express my astonishment. Mr. Duane informs me by letter, that this Gentleman has absolutely declined attending; and that by this means he is compelled to it himself.3 Surely Mr Benson has not forgot his positive engagement to both Houses to accept of the honor of their appointment, if they would dispense with his non-attendance till some time in May, lest he should, Sir, be pleased to put him in mind of it; and also that above a month more has elapsed. I believe the Legislature will remember his engagement.  I am informed that you have issued your proclamation for convening them on the 3d of next month. On this occasion reasons of a  JUNE 20, 1782  public conspire with those of a private nature, to call me home. I have many things of public concernment to communicate & some to propose; which I can neither do fully nor safely by letter. I am therefore clearly of opinion, that I have a call of public duty to the Legislature; and I am determined if not providentially prevented to obey it. I have nothing further to communicate to your Excellency to delay subscribing myself, Your Excellency's most obedient humble Servant, Jno Morin Scott  ""

  Sir Philadelphia June 20 1782 I have just heard of this Opportunity by Captain McCleane. I send your Excellency the News papers, and wish to convey a few particulars, which have occurred in Congress, since my last. Sensible of the Pleasure it will afford their Constituents, to have the publick accounts frequently inspected, Congress has resolved, That there shall be standing Committees appointed, as follow.(1) One for the Examination of the Minister of Finances Department; One for the Secretary of Wars; One for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, One for that of the Marine, and One other for the Department of the Post Office. These Committees are to report twice in each year, and it is expected, much Benefit will result to the United States by these stated Checks upon the separate Boards. Yesterday a Letter was read in Congress from Mr. John Adams, dated Amsterdam the 11th of April last to a Gentleman in this City,2 wherein was the following JUNE 20, 1782  Paragraph. \""The rapid Revolution in the Minds of this Nation, and the unaccountable Ardor and Unanimity, which has at last seized upon Them for connecting Themselves with America, have occasioned Me so many Visits to receive, and to return, and so many complimentary Letters to answer, as added to more important Affairs, are the Reasons why I must be brief at present. Five provinces Friesland, Holland, Zealand, Overyssell, and Utrecht have already decided with Unanimity, That is astonishing, and the others, Guiderland and Groningen, it is supposed, will determine as soon, as They meet, which will be the 16th Current, so that I suppose, We shall have One Ally more in a short Time.\"" I very sincerely give your Excellency Joy upon this agreable Event. The Completion of a Treaty of Commerce with the Dutch, if properly conducted, may be productive of immediate, and great Advantages to the United States. It should be the zealous Endeavour of our Minister at the Hague to profit by the Ardor and Unanimity, which He says prevailed in the United provinces, to excite Them into liberal Loans of Money to Us. I am of Opinion, It might be easily done, and in a Way, That would be very distressful to the British. They owe to the provinces, at least Thirty Millions of Pounds Sterling. An immense Sum! A tenth Part of it lent to America would be of unspeakable Use to Us. How wonderful has been the Effect, in active Riches, of the Industry, and Frugality of the United Provinces. Their Citizens have placed in the publick Funds of France since 1769, Twenty Eight Millions Sterling. About fifteen Millions in those of the Emperor, besides, vast Sums lent in Germany, Denmark, Sweden & Russia. The United Provinces, as a Nation, owe a publick Debt to their Citizens of not less than forty Millions. On the whole the moneyed property of the Inhabitants of these provinces is not less, Than One hundred and thirteen Millions, of pounds Sterling, exclusive of their Capital in Trade, the circulating Money, and what is in the great Bank of Amsterdam. Astonishing Riches for a Country, whose population does not exceed Two Millions of People. If Captain McCleane should not leave Town to Day, and any further News, worth your hearing, should occur, I shall trouble you again.

In the Chapter of Accidents, Three persons who met in Europe, are thrown together in one Chamber.(3) One of Them agrees no better Than He did, with Cassius on the other side of the Atlantic, as He (Cassius) acts exactly as He did there, which you may remember, gave occasion to Poor Richard, to say \""If He cannot find a Quarrel wherever He goes, He will be sure to make One.\""(4) He must persue a different Mode of Conduct, than What He does, If He means to become a leading Person. His Predilection is clearly in Favor of the Adverse party. He is strongly attached to it, and will do singular Mischief to our steady, good Friend, If not most diligently watched. There is not the least Doubt of his intire Devotion to a certain insidious Peer, and Where He hates, and would ruin a Cause, He (Cassius) would exert his utmost Efforts to cooperate with Him. Much could be said upon this Subject, But Prudence forbids it. Hints can now only be dropped.

  Sir,(1) Phidelphia June 23 1782.  The very kind concern you have ever discovered for my welfare, from our first acquaintance induces me to write you this Letter. It is intended as an acknowledgement of the past rather than as a Solicitation of future favours.  I find, from a kind & general Invitation from James Pemberton, that I have been named to him by somebody to my advantage; I have not yet been at his House, nor at the House of any other Friend in the City; but I propose to go to see him & others soon.  I am well suited with private Lodgings at Captn. Jos. Anthony's, in Pine Street, betwixt Front & 2d Streets. Directly on the other side of the Street stands a Friends Meeting House. I could throw a Bisquit out of my Chamber Windows into the Meeting House. The plainness of the building & its use being continually before me might suggest proffitable reflections, were my mind in a suitable frame to attend to and retain them; but it is otherwise, my present business engrosses my attention. I have been to Church, Presbyterian & Baptist Meetings; and this day, being the first of the week, I chanced to incline to go to Quaker-meetings. I attended in the forenoon at the House before mentioned & expected to have heard Nicholas Wall, but did not; two men, however, & one Woman spoke in the Meeting, and Spoke the truth; but to me it was like water spilt on the ground: In the afternoon I attended at Meeting in Market Street, but nobody spoke.  Thus you may account for this Letter at this time.  It will be the midst of Hay time before you will receive this; I wish to have my poor little boys kept steady at School, & I desire, as I did at my departure, that some steady hand may have the charge of getting my hay-that Mrs Howell do not worry herself with the care of it, her health will not permit it.

  My dearest Love, Philadelphia June 25th. 1782 Did you imagine that I could have been so negligent, as to have suffered the Post to have returned without a Line, acquainting you how I was. The Pleasure afforded me by indulging myself in writing to a beloved Wife, is so rich a Compensation, that I wait with eagerness for the weekly opportunity, which gives you as often the Trouble of reading my Scrawls.  I was chagrined at the Carelessness of the Post Master in sending my Letters to Morris Town, tho I presume by Mr. Pintards getting his by return of Post, you was not without yours. I also wrote to Susan and believe I enclosed it in yours. The extreme Heat of the weather has relaxed me greatly, but not so much as I expected-but the more I suffer by it, the more I am pleased that my dearest Love is enjoying a freer Air and more Comfort. As I would wish to promote Mollys best Interests, I could not have any objection against her doing every thing for herself that would tend to increase her JUNE 25, 1782  Happiness or future Provision in Life-and should think she ought to embrace the present opportunity was your representation of matters the whole Truth on this Subject. But she must & ought to consider every side of the Question, lest she, should involve herself in greater difficulties than she expects. A Garrison Town is a very improper Place for a young woman, especially where the officers & Soldiers have so much Power & Influence as they have in New York.  Again, there is a great Certainty, of the City's being beseiged in Case of a Fleet coming from Europe, which would render it very dangerous, as I suppose no Women or other Persons would be suffered to come within our Lines, after the Siege is began. And if it should not take Place this Summer, it must be next. Her going at this late Day in the Enemies Lines, would make her hereafter very obnoxious to the americans, and perhaps expose her to be fined or otherways punished in Case we hereafter got the City, to a greater amount than any thing she could earn while she was there. This was the Case with poor Mrs. Keirny, altho' she was forced on us.  It is proper to inform her of the whole Circumstances and then she can judge for herself, and if she determines to go, we must give her every assistance in our Power.  Apropos-Has Martin been consulted-what will he say to it. May not this be a scheme to bring him to an Explanation. I begin to think Molly is a piece of a politician-a good & well laid Plan really-I am diverted with the Idea.  I read your request to Mrs. Risk-she says she has no objection, but then there's her plaging Husband in the way-and he is an ill natured fellow, that wants all to himself.

He talks of writing to you on the Subject, and as the weather is too Hot for any Business of Consequence, there will be time enough for your Answer.  As to the Cows, you must use your own Judgment about pasturing them.  My kindest Love to all Friends, Sister, the Children-Molly-the whole Family &c.

  Dear Sir Philada. 25th June 1782.  The bill which you lately inclosed to me' was duly honored, and the contents of it are in my hands subject to any order which you may wish to give.  A private letter from Mr. Adams of the 11th of April, informs his JUNE 25, 1782  correspondent that Friesland, Holland, Utrecht, Zealand & Overyssel had taken decided resolutions for a treaty with the U. States, and that like resolutions might be expected in a few days from the two remaining provinces. A Leyden paper of posterior date, says that six provinces had concurred in this measure. This revolution ap[pear]s t[o have] been exceedingly stimulated by the [. . .int]erest which apprehended that if the [...] was lost, they might be excluded [. . .]tion from some of the commercial privileges which England may obtain.(2) It is observed in a long memorial from the Merchants to the States General (3) that, the importance of the American trade was experienced by them very sensibly prior to the loss of St. Eustatius, as it has been throughout the war by France; that the Ordinance of Congress agst. British Manufacturers (4) presents a precious season for substituting those of other nations, & that this season ought the rather to be improved as nothing will be so likely to open the ears of G. B. to the demands of the U. S. & to a general Peace, as the prospect of being supplanted in the commercial preference, which she still expects from the habits of America.  The trafic with the Enemy's lines, had increased to so great a degree that it was thought necessary for Congress to renew their exhortations to the States upon this subject,(5) and to summ[on . . .] of the people in aid of the public [. . .] Resolutions will be laid before you [. . .]tive character. We also understand [. . .]cious intercourse with the Enemy is carryed on under collusive captures preconcerted between Vessels from N.Y. & vessels fitted out on the neighbouring coasts. This abuse lies more within the purview of Congress and a remedy for it is now under consideration. If the trade with N.Y. cannot be suppressed by some means or other it will very shortly steal from us all our hard money, and render our taxations abortive.  I am Dr. Sir with much respect, Yr obt friend & servt.  J Madison Jr.  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. 25th June 1782 Your favor of the 17th (1) escaped the accident which befel that of the preceeding week. The loss of the mail is the more regretted as we now understand that a packet from N.Y. to England, which had been intercepted & carried into N. Carolina, made a part of it.  No authentic account of the fleet which sailed from N.Y. is yet come to hand. The prevailing & I fancy the true conjecture now is that it contained a parcel of miserable Refugees who are doomed to exchange the fancied confiscations of their countrymen for the bleak & barren settlement in Nova Scotia or Penobscot.  The illicit trade with N.Y. has under the auspices of the new system of the Enemy, been carried to such an extent, that the interposition of Congress in some form or other seemed to be called for. The only form which seemed to consist with constitutional propriety, was a renewal of their exhortation to the States, to exert their utmost legislative skill in suppressing it by land; & to impress on people the fatal effects of a continuance of it, and the necessity of their patriotic cooperation with the public measures in bringing transgressors to due punishment. This trade is also carried on by water, under collusive captures of Vessels from N.Y. by little vessels fitted out on the neighbouring Coasts. The remedy for this part of the evil is more within the authority of Congress,(2) and an application of it is now agitating. Nothing can prevent the evil by land but a voluntary combination among the people at large to find out & prosecute the authors of it. How far this will take place is uncertain. As it is dictated by the interest of the army, and of the Farmers, who feel the loss of the specie which goes to the Enemy, and by the fair traders who are undersold by the smugglers; as well as by every principle of Duty, some efforts may justly be expected.  Congress have received no letters of very late date from Mr. Adams, but there is a private letter here of the 11th April, in which he informs his correspondent, that all the Provinces except two had with astonishing unanimity & rapidity decided in favor of a connexion with the U.

  Dear Sir Philada. 25th of June 1782 Your favor of the 15th (1) being more fortunate than the preceding one came safe to hand yesterday. The loss of the mail is the more provoking as it is said to have contained a packet from N.Y. which had been intercepted on its passage to England & carried into N. Carolina.  The illicit trade with the British lines has been pushed so far under the encouragement of the enemy, as to threaten a deep wound to our Finances. Congress have renewed their exhortation to the States on this subject and recommended to the people through them, a patriotic cooperation with the public measures. This trade we have also discovered is carried on with considerable effect, under collusive captures. This branch of the iniquity falls properly within the purview of Congress and an ordinance for its excision is in the hands of a Committee.  A private letter from Mr. Adams of the 11th of April informs his correspondent that 5 of the 7 provinces had decided in favor of a Treaty with the U. S. and that the concurrence of the remaining 2 might be expected in a few days. A Leyden paper of a subsequent date, reduces the exception to a single Province. It would seem from a Memorial from the Merchants to the States General, that this revolution had been greatly stimulated by an apprehension that a sudden pacification might exclude their commerce from some of the advantages which England may obtain.  The Memorial appeals to the effect of the American trade on the JUNE 25, 1782  resources of France, & to the short & indirect experience of it, which Holland enjoyed before the loss of St. Eustation, as proof of its immense consequence. It observes also that the Ordinance of Congress agst. British Manufactures presented a precious crisis for introducing those of other nations; which ought to be the rather embraced, as nothing would be so likely to dispose Britain to the Independence of America & a general peace, as the prospect of her being supplanted in the commercial preference expected from the habits of her lost Provinces.  The present conjecture with regard to the fleet mentioned in my late letters, is, that it conveyed a parcel of miserable refugees who are destined to exchange the fancied confiscations of their rebellious Countrymen, for a cold and barren settlement in Nova Scotia or Penobscot.  A Foreign paper has reinstated Hyder Ally in his superiority over Sr. Eyre Coote. Major General Monk is numbered among the slain in the battle which produced this reverse of fortune to the British arms.  I hear nothing from Mr. Jones. Tell him if he is at Richmond that this is the reason why he does not hear directly from me. Instead of the paper of this morning which is uncommonly barren, I send you one of Wednesday last which contains a very curious remonstrance from the disconsolate Loyalists.  ""

  Sir Philada. 25th June 1782. Your Excellency's favor of the 15th came safe to hand yesterday.(1) The loss of the mail of the preceding week is the more regretted, as we understand that a packet from N. York for England which had been intercepted and carried into N. Carolina, made a part of it.  A private letter from Mr. Adams dated the 11th of April informs his correspondent, that Friesland, Holland, Zealand, Overyssell and Utrecht had decided in favour of an immediate connection with the U. States and that Guelderland & Zutphen, it was expected, would follow their example in a few days. A Leyden Gazette of a posterior date says that six provinces had then concurred. Their public concils seem to have been greatly stimulated to this decisive conduct, by the zeal of the Merchants who profess their fears that unless a treaty be speedily concluded with America, a pacification may exclude their commerce from some of the advantages which England may obtain. JUNE 25, 1782  They observe also that the Ordinance of Congress against British Manufactures presents a favorable crisis for introducing those of other nations, and that commercial connection with the U. States, tending to supplant the commerce of Britain will be the most likely means of disposing her to an immediate acquiescence in the American Revolution & to a general peace.  The illicit trade with N. York under the encouragement of the enemy, and the obstruction of foreign trade has increased of late so far as to threaten great injury to the public finances. The steps which have been taken by Congress on this subject will be transmitted to your Excellency by the President. It is also discovered that supplies of British goods are imported under collusive captures concerted between Vessels from N. York and Vessels fitted out on the neighbouring coasts. This part of the evil is more within the jurisdiction of Congress, and a remedy for it is now under consideration.  With great respect, We have the honor to be Yr. Excelly's obt. & hbl. servants, J.

  Sir Philadelphia June 26th. 1782. I wrote you the l9th Instant Informing of my Arrival here on the 17th &c.  Genl. Carletons Commission as a Negociator &c. has been the Subject of much Conversation some time past, Congress have no Information on that Subject Except the Letter which was sent to his Excellency Genl.

Green did not think proper to Enter into so Absurd an Agreement. My Opinion is that all their Propositions are Calculated Merely to Quiet their People in England &c., and with Intention so far to deceive the United States as to produce a Relaxation in their Exertions for Carrying on the War. I mentioned to you in my last something respecting Our State's having a Vote in Congress, and as I think it to be of much Importance hope you will Excuse my Mentioning it again. Besides the General and  JUNE 26, 1782  Obvious Reasons for our having a Vote, I could mention some particular & Important Ones, but as the mails are frequently Robbed prudence forbids it.

Concluding that he would be punctual I preferred that Conveyance to the post; but I have since learned that he has not even yet thought fit to return to his Family, who have so long been looking for him. I know nothing of his Business here but his behaviour is unaccountable.  I had the pleasure of meeting young Mr Le Roy who after many difficulties has at length reached his native Country. He appears to be a decent well behaved young Gentleman and from the Information of a person of Distinction who knew him in Amsterdam sustains a very good Character. He has promised to dine with me this day and only waits to hear from his Friends to set out homeward. He had been unfortunate in trusting to Dr Latham to announce his Arrival.

  Dr Sir Philada. June 30. 1782. I had the pleasure of receiving, by Mr. Izard, your Letter of April 25th. Your & his Accounts of the Condition of the Army, for want of Cloathing & Spirits, are truly deplorable, tho' not worse than I expected. I imagine greater Attention would have been paid, to supplying it with those Articles, but, for an Opinion that C. Town was about to be evacuated. This Opinion I found very prevalent when I arrived here. Indeed many People cannot yet be convinced that an Evacuation will not, very soon, take Place. However, I never could see any reason why, in the present Situation of Affairs, the Enemy should leave it, &, even if they had such a Matter in Contemplation, I fear the unfortunate Issue of the Action between Rodney & Count de Grasse will retard the Execution of the Measure-as the Consequences of that Engagement, & the Lateness of the Season will, in all probability, prevent the Marquis de Vaudreuille from prosecuting an Attack on Jamaica, & put the Enemy from immediate Apprehensions for their W. India possessions, which they will not, therefore, reinforce by the Garrison of C. Town. I wish I may be mistaken in this Opinion. I shall do every Thing in my power towards effecting the necessary Supplies for the Southern Army, & will write to you soon fully on that Head. We have just heard that a Packet from England lately arrived at N. York but the News, (if any,) which she has brought is not yet come to Hand. I have no such Expectations of a speedy Peace as some People flattered themselves with, from the Change of Ministry. Indeed I think a Continuance of the old would have been better for Us than the present Lot. However, a short Time will probably shew us what We are to expect. The new Ministry do not seem to have made up their Minds upon Matters, when Carleton left England. His letter to Genl. Washington, which you see in the Papers, (a very immaterial & unimportant one,) is all that We have had from him. The Dutch have, in all probability, acknowledged our Independence, e'er now. Mr. Adams in his last dispatches, of 26 March, says, that such an Acknowledgment would certainly take place, tho' it might perhaps be delayed for 3 or 4 Weeks-the Prince having declared that he saw no Chance of stemming the Torrent, & therefore he shd. not attempt it. The Irish are likely to obtain further Benefits in Consequence of the JUNE 30,1782  Contest in which G. Britain is involved. I congratulate you on the fortunate discovery of the Plot which some of your Troops were meditating.l Wishing you Health, & every Felicity, I am with great Esteem & Regard, dr. Sir, yr. most obed.

  Sir, Philadelphia July 1st 1782 We early after our Arrival at this place Acquainted your Excellcy of Coll Roots unexpected Departure from Congress before we Arrived((1) when the time for the Appearance of the State of Connecticut in the great Cause between them & Pensylvania was near at hand, we foresaw a Storm arising but were in hopes there would have been so much candor Exercised as not to Urge a procedure in that Cause untill Coll Roots return, but when the day arrived, the Agents from Pensylvania Appeared, & Urged with the greatest Vehemence for an Entry of the nonappearance of the State of Connecticut & that Congress Immediately proceed according to the directions of the Articles of Confederation to Nominate Commissioners & have them Struck of so as to reduce them to the Number Assigned to hear, Judge, & Determine the Cause which must have been done by Pensylvania Agents on the one hand, & our Pensylvania Secretary on the Other,(2) whereby it may very easily be seen what a set of Judges we should be left with to Decide this most Important Controversy; it was Moved by one of the Agents from Connecticut(3) (tho not JULY 1, 1782  Authorised without one of the Others to Appear), that by reason of Coll Roots Absence by Appointment of Congress on business of Importance to the United States that all proceedings in the Cause be stayd till the blank day of July when Coll Roots return might be expected, this met with a surprising opposition, Urging that every State must risque the Conduct of their own Agents, & that Coll Root did not Acquaint Congress with his Agency for Connecticut in their Cause, which if he had they should not have sent him forward, & further that the Assembly of Connecticut was apprised of Coll. Roots return when he appeared before them & ought to have sent Dr Johnson forward or Appointed another, these Debates have taken up 3 or 4 days in Congress & are still debating & undetermined,(4) but rather think they in general rather Incline to have the matter lye without any determination Untill Coll Roots return, & it is without any doubt expected in the mean time that we write in the most pressing manner to hastn on Mr Roots return as soon as possible. Coll Roots return must be hastned without delay after his meeting the Assembly in the State of New York which we understand are to set on the 10th day of this month, he must proceed forward from thence to Congress without returning home.(5) You are sir Sensible that by Confederation the Agents from each State are to indeavor to Agree on Commissioners Antecedent to Congresses Nomination which will take up some time & we cannot expect to delay the matter beyond the 25th at farthest, when Congress will proceed. We have also laid in our Motion, According to Instructions from our Assembly, for postponing the Trial of this Cause till after the Close of the War, especially as many of our material exhibits are in England, but this is & will be Violently Opposed As they urge the Necessity of all Disputes if possible being setled before that time, & Indeavor to Impress Congress with the Ideas that Connecticut wish for delay only to get a more full possession of the Country, &c, &c, & that they are willing to make such Concessions with respect to the Exhibits left in England, & are Originals, as may supersede the Necessity of Obtaining of them from thence, provided we Produce Authenticated Copys of them or otherwise satisfye them of the real Contents, which makes it Necessary for us to be furnished with what Copies or Duplicate Originals we have of those papers, for which purpose I have inclosed a list of such Originals as are left in England which may be of Necessity to be used on the Tryal of said cause, which list if sent to Doctr Gray of Windham Clerk of the Susqh Company he will be able to send Us an Account of what of those papers he is possessed of, or can procure, if directed thereto by your Excellency, he also can make enquiry of the Comtee of the Delaware Company at Norwich for such papers (as minuted in the list) belonging to them, & of what duplicates, originals or Copys they are   possessed of, & An Account of the whole we Wish to have, Transmitted to us as soon as possible.  In one of our former letters to your Excellency we Informed you that the Copy of Mr Deans letter & the Answer approved by our Assembly were laid before Congress;(6) and that the Answer as to the Sentiments & reasonings therein were highly Approved, but we find by Conversing with many Gentn. of Congress, that they wish that the Answer may not by any means be sent or forwarded to Mr Dean. They imagine it was his great design to draw, an answer, if possible from so respectable a person or body as the Governor or assembly of Connecticut, and which if so, may be Improved to purposes very Prejudicial, give him the Importance, Consequence and Advantage he wishes & Intends, beside it is thot it would prove derogatory to the Honor & Dignity of the State. We have reason to Believe Msr. Marbois, Secretary to the Minister of France, to be of the same Opinion, tho he appears well pleased to find the Sentiments & Opinion of our Assembly as Expressed in the Answer, yet Wishes they had appeared to the Publick in the same Manner as has been published from the Assemblys of Virginia, New Jerseys, &c. We beg leave therefore to Submit it to your Excellency wether it will be best to send forward the Answer to Mr Dean, or if allready only gone to some port to be forwarded, whether it will not be best to recall the letter if the Ship has not yet sailed; tho as we were not Attending our Assembly when the Answer to Mr. Deans' letter was proposed we are wholly Ignorant & Uncertain Whether it was ever designed to send the Answer to Mr Dean, but only to declare to the publick what the sentiments & opinion of the Assembly of the State of Connecticut were on the Subject.

  Dear Sir, Private Philadelphia, July 1st, 1782. I lost no time after my arrival to enquire the Exchange of French bills. I find the French Agents sell at 6/6 pr. Dollar and the Sale is dull. I shall, therefore, agreeably to your Excellency's directions return those Bills which you entrusted to my Care by the first safe Opportunity.  We have no late Intelegence from any part of the World. It is observable by the last arrivals that the Dutch were on the point of acknowledging our Independance. Six of the provinces have Instructed their Deputies to that end. Guilderland where the Prince Stadtholder has his Estates and chief Influences, alone had not acceeded. The People in every Quarter cry out aloud to their Rulers to secure for them in Time the Friendship and a share of the Commerce of America, and their Importunity seems to be too great to be resisted. It is, therefore, an Article of my political Creed that we shall soon enter into an alliance with the Dutch. The new British ministry are exerting every nerve to draw that nation into a separate Peace, and the Russian Ambassador has interposed his mediation with a Zeal which is not very pleasing: but it appears to me that if even the Dutch had an Inclination, they have proceeded too far to retract. The papers enclos'd will lead your Excellency to better Reflections on this subject than I can suggest.  General Scott seems determined to attend the Legislature and I fear nothing I can offer will keep him here.(1) Mr. l'Hommedieu will, therefore, be called upon to take his tour unless it should be more convenient to Col. Floyd. I must trouble your Excellency to enforce  JULY 2, 1782  on the Legislature the Justice of returning me the money I advanced for my support in Congress, especially as I borrowed a part of it, for which I am pressed. I am in advance about £800. If I could get half that Sum, it would make me for the present easy with my Friend who has assisted me, and enable me to purchase some necessities with which my Family cannot dispense. I have an Account unsettled, but I only speak now of what is adjusted and actually passed to my Credit at the Treasury. Believe me, it is with pain that I mention this subject: but my past forbearance has reduced me to difficulties from which I ought to be relieved.  Be pleased to make my Compliments acceptable to Mrs. Clinton: and believe me to be, with the utmost Regard, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's Affectionate & most Obedient Servant,  Jas. Duane.

Yesterday Congress received a Copy of the Massachusetts impost Law passed in the manner recommend[ed].(1) It establishes 5 Per Cent Duty on all imported Goods (Salt, and wire for Cotton & Wool Cards excepted), and is to Continue untill the public Debt & Interest is descharged, but is not to take place untill Similar Laws are passed by all the states. Rhode Island is the only State that has not Complyed, but it is said, as Massachusetts have Come into that measure, it will be immediately adopted by that state. I wish our Law had passed without a limitation, it is such a deviation from the general recommendation, And so dissimilar in that respect to the Laws that have passed in the other States, that I am apprehensive it may occasion Some difficulties, those states that may have with reluctance Come into the measure may be glad of Such An Excuse for not Carrying the law into Execution. I believe Congress would be glad to receive the Law passed in our state as soon as may be Convenient. I am Obliged to trouble your Excellency on the score of my allowance.

  My dear Sir Philada. 2d July 1782. The confidential & circumstancial communications in your favor of the 20th of June (1) have afforded me much pleasure. Those which relate to the scheme of {garbling the delegation}(2) were far from surprizing me. In a conversation with Mr. J. before he left Philada.(3) it was our joint inference from a review of certain characters & circumstances that such a scheme would be tried. The prevailing temper of the {present delegation is too little flexible to the factious and vindictive plans of a particular member (4) of it} to be relished by {him and his adherents. No delegate} who refuses to {league with him in the war against the financeir} must {expect to be long at ease in his post. The} disappointment {in the affair of the flags will increase the venom against the minister. The first} conversation {I had with the doctor after his return} clearly {betrayed how much it rankled in his bosom}  No addition has been made to our foreign intelligence in the course of the past week. Some of the republications from the European papers herewith sent throw light however on the general state of foreign affairs. Those which relate to Ireland in particular are very interesting. The Empress of Russia appears by the Memorial of her Ministers to be more earnest in forwarding a reconciliation between England & Holland than is consistent with the delicate impartiality she has professed as Mediatrix, or with that regard which we flattered ourselves she felt for the interests of the U. States.  One article of our late communications from France was that the interest {on the certificates is no longer to be continued} and that provision {must be made} within ourselves. This has caused great commotion & clamour among the class of public creditors, against Congress, who they believe or affect to believe have transferred the  JULY 2, 1782  funds to other uses.(5) The best salve to this irritation, if it could with truth be applied, wd. be a notification that all the States had granted the impost of 5 PerCt. and that the collection & appropriation of it would immediately commence. It is easy to see that the States whose jealousy & delays withhold this resource from the U.S. will soon be the object of the most bitter reproaches from the public creditors. Rhode Island & Georgia are the only States in this predicament, unless the Acts of Virga. & Maryland should be vitiated by the limitations with which they are clogged.  No step has yet been taken in the instructions prepared before your departure. I expostulated a few days ago with D[oct]or W[itherspoo]n on the subject & prevailed on him to move in the business, but his motion only proved the watchfulness & inflexibility of th[os]e who think they advance towards their own objects in the same proportion as they recede from those of Virginia.(6) I have since shewn him the report and he is a confirmed advocate both for the innocence & expediency of it.  We are even at this day without official advice of the naval event of the 12 of April in the W. I. nor have we any advices of late date from that quarter. There is little room to hope that the misfortune of our Ally will be repaired by any subsequent enterprizes.  Congress are much perplexed by the non-appearance of Connecticut at the time appointed for the meeting of her Agents & those of Pennsylvania. We wish to avoid leaving her any pretext to revive the controversy & yet the reasons for her neglect cannot be pronounced sufficient. Her adversary professes a strong jealousy that she means by every artifice to parry a decision during the war; and it cannot be denied that appearances but too well authorize it.  ""

  Dear Varick Philadelphia July 3d . 1782.  I have had your favor by Mr. Duane. In it You desire that your Case on the Report of the Secretary at War may be brought shortly to a Decision.(1 ) It shall most certainly be done very speedily, as I have it fully in Design to return hence in about three Weeks; having made sufficient Experiment of this excessive Hot Climate, in the Course of ten days past, to avoid as much of it as possible.  As it is uncertain whether I shall be at home soon enough to prosecute before the Legislature my Claim to the House & farm in the Possession of Sleght, I have authorized either of them by express designation in a new Memorial referring to my former or their Counsel effectually to represent Me on the Subject before the Legislature.  The distresses of my poor Family are so great for Want of a comfortable Habitation, that I am wounded by every Letter from them on the Subject.

Mrs. Jackson is not the worse for her Ride, I think the better. I wrote hastily to Bror Nat twice while upon the road, as the Oppys were more direct to him & desired him to inform you where & how we were.

I have scarcely entered the political Circle, have but only paid my Compliments to the great Officers of State. The French Minister is making great preparations & erecting a Building for the celebration of His young Master's birth-to be on the 15th. I believe there is nothing worth communicating even from the Cabinet, was it to be opened. The general opinion here seems to be that there will be no active campaign.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia July 6th. 1782 I did not receive your favor dated Amsterdam May 17th 1781. 'till June 29th 1782.(1) It is with very great pleasure that I accept your offer of a correspondance which cannot but be highly interesting to me. The independent spirit which markd your proceedings when you arrivd first at Petersburg, did not please some.(2) Upon this subject I have but one observation to make, That a foreign minister, if he attempt any thing out of the hackneyd path, must do it at his peril. Success alone can silence the mongrel spirits which will otherwise raise a cry against him, from the effects of which, if unsuccessful, he will find no shield but in the goodness of his intentions. This consideration will not prevent a firm & virtuous mind from pursuing what he thinks really for the good of his Country, because even a JULY 6, 1782  failure cannot deprive him of that consolation which arises from conscious patriotism. Our embarrassments for money are great, not that there is any real want of it, but because by the constitution of the Bank, & until lately a most prosperous Commerce, in this tory City, has accumulated all the money here & consequently disenabled the other States from paying taxes to support the war. The residence of Congress in the bosom of toryism & the encouragement given to them is as impolitic as it is unjust. It put such advantages into their hands, as in case the war shoud take a turn, may enable them to deliver us up tied & bound to the Enemy. It is extreme political weakness to suppose that because these men have changd their professions that they have therefore abandond their principles. These are what a tory never changes, & tho he may make them bend occasionally to his interest, yet whenever an opportunity offers you will be sure to find him the same enemy to public Liberty.  I am sorry that the attempts you mention have in any measure succeeded; tho' they have faild of the whole intent, wch. was to place the negociation of peace in corrupt and servile hands only. The wickedness of that old Man (3) is beyond example, & his good fortune in escaping the punishment due to his crimes so well known, is as extraordinary. Horace says-raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo.(4) Dr Franklin is the rare exception to his rule.  It may be proper to inform you that the present Secretary for foreign Affairs is a decided partizan of Dr. F. & enemy to Mr. Adams. Like a number of other Parrots here, he praises the former by rote, & undertakes to tutor the other. Whatever you see or receive from him you may consider as dictated by the french Minister. He made him what he is, & policy, or gratitude keeps him from disobeying or renouncing his Maker.  I have little hope of your succeeding where you are. On the contrary I doubt much whether the Empress will continue neuter, shoud G. Britain be hard-pressd. Her policy as well as his partiality must, in my judgment, direct her to prevent the accomplishment of the aim of France, to give Law on the Ocean, & make her lean towards G. Britain.(5)  Farewell  ""

  Dear Sir Phila. July 8th. 1782. I am exceeding obliged by your repeated Favours, & should more frequently have written to you, but have been waiting for some Intelligence sufficiently important to claim your Attention, but nothing of this Kind has come forward. Your Friends Mr. Izard & Mr Lee are both now in Congress, & I am happy in assuring you they appear to me to be two of the ablest & best of our Counsellors; we have had few Measures attempted that are pointed against our Friends abroad, but I find Jealousy & Attention is necessary to prevent the Introduction of them. Soon after my arrival a most disagreable Distinction was attempted by making the Salary of Mr. Adams much less than those of Dr. F & Mr. J. (1) under Pretence of his being at a Court less expensive. I ventured to enquire into the Evidence of the Fact, & tho I was tho't & almost called an Upstart, persisted till a Recommitment was made & on Enquiry it turns out that the Hague is the most expensive of the three Courts, & so this Matter ended;(2) within a few Days I think a much deeper Plan has been laid to embarrass his Negociations by instructing him not to consent to an Article in the proposed Treaty which gives the Subjects of the U. Provinces the same Rights as to holding & conveying Estates, as the French Subjects have, altho it is almost certain that the Plan of a Treaty has been communicated long since to the Dutch, but this Matter will I believe end like the former. We have heard very little lately from the Financier-he has certainly been very usefull & therefore with the great Powers given him, should be watched. Not the most distant Hint has reached us from any Quarter, as to the Designs of the british Ministry. I believe they are exceedingly embarrassed in forming any Plan if they are not warring with each other. Mr. Izard thinks they must be greatly divided. We are on the Brink of Insolvency again for Want of some Supplies. France supplies scantily & of the Sum she has this Year advanced, not a Shilling is to come to America in Cash, Dr. F. is too old or too busy or to be very minute in his Accts. Of the Application of these Monies, large Sums have been retained in his Hands. I have been amazed to hear that any Doubt could be created on the Question of the Impost's Bill's being a Law. I know of no Case in which Sunday is not computed in Law Reckonings. I hope the act will be daily more popular, such a Fund as that is designed to be, is very necessary at  JULY 8, 1782  this Time. Great Commotions have taken Place in this City on the Knowledge that Bills will be no longer drawn for the Interest of Loan Certificates. France has absolutely refused to furnish any more Money to be applied to this Use & there is no other but what may arise from the Impost which can be applied to this Use. I shall be with you I suppose before the next Meeting of the General Assembly.  I am with much Esteem, your Friend & Servt, JLowell  ""

  Sir, Philadelphia July 9. 1782 I take this Opporty to write you by Mr. Smith of Boston. The United States being informed by Doctr. Franklin's Letters, that France did not hold themselves obliged to pay any more Bills for Interest due on the Loan Office Certificates and that they would be protested if drawn, a Committee was appointed to Consider of this Subject & report to Congress, the Substance of which report was that no more Bills Shoud be drawn for payments of Interest.(1) While this report was under Consideration a Memorial was presented signed by some of the Citizens requesting that Congress would postpone their Determination on this Subject untill they could have a Meeting of the Holders of Loan Office Certificates.(2) You will see by the News Paper what the Citizens have done. Some are for appropriating the five per Cent Impost for the purpose of paying the Interest on the whole Loans others for funding those Loans which were made prior to the first of March 1778, and that this Interest shall be first discharged, but How can Congress appropriate a fund which is not yet granted to them? What will take place I cannot say. We have no late News from Europe. Their are several reports in this City respecting Two Actions at the Southward in both which it is said Our Troops were successfull, but nothing to be  JULY 9, 1782  Depended on, it remains uncertain whether there has been any actions or not. In my Letter of the 26th Ultimo to the Honble. the President, I urged that the State should be represented here, perhaps it may be thought by some, that I say too much on this Subject but I am Confident if such persons were here they would alter their Sentiments. The Vote of One State in Thirteen is of some Importance. There are many things absolutely necessary to be reformed, notwithstanding all our reformation plans we are now paying a large Number of Civil & military Officers who are doing us no Service. Figure to yourself Sir the pay and subsistance of at Least Thirty Field Officers, Eighty Captains & 160 subalterns besides a Number of General & Staff Officers (all belonging to One State) who have not private Soldiers Enough to give each Officer a Servant, & in other States their are regiments fully Officered who perhaps have not Ten Private soldiers belonging to them-and these States will perhaps have almost as large Accounts against the united States as some others who keep up a good proportion of Soldiers by reason of their almost numerous Officers. I would not be understood as endeavouring to prevent N H from raising soldiers, but I must repeat that I think a Vote here (though very Expensive) should be an Object of the first Consideration Both as it may be of Service to the Genl. Interest of all the States and the particular Interest of New Hampshire, but as I think I have discharged my Duty in this respect I shall Endeavour when I write the State in future to find some other Subject.  The Delegates from Carolinas & Georgia have Money advanced them out of the public Treasury agreeably to a Resolution of Congress passed about One year agone, those who have Families here are to have 200 Dollars per month, those who have not, 150 Dollars per month, to bear their Expenses, which is to be Charged to their respective States, there are five from South Carolina & Three from Georgia now present.  A large Committee are appointed, to report some plan for lessening our Expences, but what they will be able to do I cannott Say. The post Sets out from this place on Wednesdays. I Suppose my Letters do not reach Exeter untill the Friday Fortnight after sending them. Perhaps this may reach you by the Same Post as my Letter to the President of the 3d Instant as Mr. Smith will carry it directly to Boston. I want to hear what has been done at the late session of the Gen'l Court, the Titles of the public Acts with some General Sketches of the most material Business would be very pleasing. One Letter from Collo. Langdon, One from Genl. Whipple & One from Genl. Bellows is all I have received from New Hampshire Since I left there, I Expected Several by yesterdays post, but was disappointed.  Great preparations are making by the minster of France to Celebrate the birth of the Dauphin, on Monday next, it is Expected it  will be the most Brilliant affair ever known in America. You will not Consider this as an Official Letter, but Communicate the Same so far as you may think proper.  I should be glad if I had some Agreeable News to Communicate to you, but have not any thing Important. Make my Compliments to the Gentlemen of the Committee of Safety & inform Esqr.

Altho' no official accts. have been recd. on the part of our Ally, those which have been published on the other part with the numberless corroborating incidents are too powerful for the skeptical mind. The last report from the Cape is that the Fr. & Span. fleets had parted the former with the Trade towards Europe, the latter towards the Havannah. You will observe that this is no more than a report.  The same defect of authentic information applies to every other JULY 9, 1782  quarter. The first arrival from Europe will I hope enable me to feast your starving curiosity with a treaty, with Holland, and a prospect of all its salutary consequences, particularly to the Tobacco States.

  Dear Sir Philada. 9th July 1782. Your two favors of the 27th were recd. this morning. (1) I sincerely regret that any reports should have prevailed injurious to the patriotism of Williamsbg. and particularly that my name should in any manner whatever be connected with them.(2) I {informed}(3) Mr. {.Jones that the minister of France} had been made somehwat {uneasy by some accounts from Virginia and desired him to enable me to remove it by proper enquiries}. It must have been a very gross mistake that could have {built the reports in question on this letter even if} its {contents had been known}. You saw I presume {the letter}. I think I wrote you {a letter to the same effect but I am not sure}.  The dearth of intelligence which has rendered my late letters so uninteresting, is not yet removed. It is reported that the French & Span. fleets have left the Cape & each other, the former to convoy to a safe distance the trade of that Island, the latter to resume its inactivity & security at the Havannah. This however is mere report. The next arrival from Europe will I hope render my correspondence more valuable. I am exceedingly impatient for the conclusion of a Treaty with Holland. The commercial spirit & views of that nation must produce the most salutary effects to the U.S. & those especially whose staple is Tobacco.  The trade with the Enemy at N.Y. has at length I am told produced spirited & successful exertions among the people of N. Jersey for suppressing it. The same alarm & exertion seem to be taking place in Connecticut. The ordinance of Congress against collusive captures on water has not yet passed. The mode of proof & the distribution of the effects, occasioned some diversity of opinion, & a recommitment ensued.(4) I am not very sanguine that any thing of efficacy will be done in the matter. Notwithstanding the supposed danger arising to the bank from the exportation of hard money to N. York, a dividend of 4 I/2 PerCt. for the first half year has been  JULY 9, 1782  advertized to the Stockholders. Will not this be very captivating to the avarice of the Dutchman in case his apprehension shall be removed by a Political connection between the two Countries?  Mr. Jones writes me that he proposes to set off about the 20th instt.(5) When will you follow him?  ""

I Imagine he has a Private Correspondence with some Gentlemen in Portsmouth by which means he is informed of the particular Circumstances of the State.  A Letter from Genl. Greene of 31st May was Receiv'd Yesterday, in which was Inclosed Copy of a Letter from Genl. Wayne to him giving an Account of an Action near Savannah in Georgia in which a Considerable party of the Enemy were Compleatly Routed, (4) the particulars you have in the News Paper Inclosed. We have no late Accounts from Europe, by the last our Enemy were Endeavouring to make a Seperate peace with the United Provinces, whether they will Effect their purpose, or those States Unitedly Accede to our Independence is at present to us Uncertain.  It is difficult to find out the Intentions of our Enemy. Some people are of Opinion that they will soon withdraw their Troops from us, carry on the War against our Ally & Endeavour by their Emissaries to destroy our present Alliance. Perhaps this mode in General might be good policy for them, but I dare Say they cannott perswade America to break her Engagements with France. There has been a great Bustle in this place some days past on Account of a Resolution (which is now under the Consideration of Congress) to put a Stop to drawing Bills on France for payments of Interest on Loan Office Certificates. This Resolution was produced in Consequence of a Letter from Dr. Franklin Informing that the Bills must be protested if Drawn. The Holders of Certificates in this place have had a Meeting on this Subject and have presented a Memorial to Congress-what will be finally Concluded upon I cannot Say. However disagreeable the measure proposed is, yet if it is Unavoidable it must be taken. A Committee of Congress are Appointed to report some plan for reducing the great Number of Officers who are now in pay of the United States & doing no Service. Figure to your self the Expence of Ten or Eleven Regiments (belonging to One State) fully Officered, and who perhaps have not private Soldiers Enough to give Each Officer a Servant.  ""

Your Memorialist begs leave to observe, that not only foreign Ministers have been paid, but even Agents & Factors, who had profits on large sums of public mony advanced to them, have been also paid considerable Sums out of the invoices borrowd in France.  Your Memorialist presumes, that Congress will immediately perceive, that his standing thus the sole object of neglect, not only deprives him of what has been ascertaind as due for his Services, but seems to be a mark of the displeasure of Congress, which he is far from conceiving he has deservd.  He therefore submits to Congress, the justice of ordering the payment of his Salary, with that of his Secretary, directed to be carried to his credit by the Resolve of Augt. 4. 1781,(2) in the same manner as has been done, in the case of other foreign Ministers; that such payment shall cancel the Certificates he has receivd.

Few, and beg leave to return our best thanks for the information therein contained.  We had prior to the receipt of it, and after much patience and exertion obtained a supply of Arms, Ammunition, and some Clothing which was sent to the State by Genl. Twiggs & Colo McMurphy & are hopeful it has long since reached you in Safety. We can by no means flatter you with any additional supplies. By the Fininciers Letters you will be very competent to judge of the situation of our Finance, and at a time when pressing Applications are making to the respective States for money, it will be a difficult point to prevail on Congress to advance any part of it, on Loan or otherwise to any one of the States, Altho it is certain that motives of humanity and justice ought to prompt some additional Aids, Notwithstanding we are satisfied such cannot be obtained.  It will not admit of a doubt but that our Country after all will do well, temporary distress, hardship & difficulty, time will Surmount. The virtue of 1775, with the exertions of subsequent years will guide us in safety and lead in the straight path to peace & Independence.  In our Letter by Genl. Twiggs to the Assembly (1) we touched on the propriety of Continental aid, and are happy to understand that the Assembly are making exertions tending that way-and we are sanguine in measures being pursued to Accomplish this very interesting event. Even One hundred & fifty men will give relief to our Militia, and thereby enable them to remain at their homes (except on particular or pressing Occasions, by which means they will be fully enabled to provide for their Families & perhaps something to spare for the immediate support of the Soldiery.  The only mode you can pursue to obtain any payment on Account JULY 13, 1782  of Any State supplies to the Army will be by and through the channel of Genl. Greene, who may for some Particular articles of supply, and from a full conviction of your wants indulge you. This ought to be done with great delicacy and only for Special and particular purposes the article of Salt is one, and some others will readily Occour.  We think it best to give you our Opinion on some words in the Delegation that appear to have been Omitted, and may if not revised by the Assembly previous to January be the means of the State being without a representation from the first Tuesday in January until the new Delegation may appear, which we conceive was not adverted to at the time of the Resolution.(2) The Delegation ought to run any two or more, and after the first Tuesday in January, until others shall be appointed. We only mention this a[l]teration as necessary to continue the representation in Congress, until the State can send a new Delegation and are hopeful the Assembly will enable you to make the necessary Amendments to it, without which We must on that day walk out, and quit our Seats in Congress, Until another Delegation shall arrive.  You have no doubt heard of a total change of the British Ministry and their intentions of changing the system of War in America. These are circumstances that we consider by no means favorable to conclude the War speedily with the States, and ought rather to alarm and call forth our utmost exertions, than to lull us into ideal security. It is evident the Pride & Ambition of that Nation, is not yet sufficiently humbled, to agree to our Independence & Alliance with France, nor have we any reason to believe but that Britain will exercise every means in her Power to effect her Nefarious purposes.

They will undoubtedly occur to your Excellency and need not be enlarged upon. A long letter to General Schuyler giving an Account of my wants and some strictures on JULY 16, 1782  publick affairs was intercepted at the same time.(3) Nothing can be achieved from it that will give the Enemy Information or pleasure: Unless they can be gratified at the pecuniary misfortunes of an Individual.

  Dear Doct. Philad. July 16th 1782 I am favoured with yours of the 8th with the paper inclosed wch I shall Send to the press. Who is Mr. P's Correspondent? Have heard nothing of the order. We have had no intelligence lately respecting the French and British fleets in the West Indies-during the Hurrican months, it is probable they may Come this way, the British to N York and the French in the Chesapeak. Lippincot is not yet given up. G. Washington writes that Sr Guy had informed him, that the Court Marshall had given their Sentence, but does not mention what it is, that he should send him the minutes of the proceedings with some other documents from this it may be concluded that Lippincot is Acquitted. I set up very late last night at the Ministers entertainment for the Dauphin, I shall not attempt a description of it. It far surpassed my expectations. We Shall have it in the papers. It is said a vessel is arrived at Baltimore with an Amsterdame paper which mentions that the States General have Acknowledge our Independence, if this be true, the Combined fleets of France, Spain and Holland will be far Superior to the British.

  Dear Sir, Philada.

It is said to have been the identical party.(2) I am not yet so happy as to be able to transmit the expected intelligence from Europe, no vessels having arrived from that quarter or from the W. Indies. Our only news is a report that Charlestown has been evacuated & burn[ed]; of which you will be a better judge than I am.  Genl Washington & Ct. Rochambeau met here on Saturday evening.(3) The object & result of the consultations belong to the military cabinet.  Genl Carlton in a correspondence with Genl W. yesterday laid before Congress (4) complains much of legal proceedings agst. adherents to the British cause, as Traitors, adopts the maxim that \""in a civil war between people of one empire there can during the contest be no traitors at all.\"" and asks a passport for Genl Robinson & Mr. Ludlow to confer & settle arrangements on that idea. He at the same time and from a similar policy, proposes in order to remove our objection agst. exchanging B. soldiers [and] Amer. seamen, that the latter shall be free & the former restrained from serving agst. the 13 Provinces for one year, within which he is sanguine an end will be put to the calamities of the present war.  Other parts of the letter which speak of Lippincut make it probable that Asgil will at last be left to expiate the guilt of this mu[r]derer. Having less time for preparing the post than I usually devote to my friends I must conclude abruptly with begging an excuse for the defects which render this scarcely legible or intelligible.

  Dear Sir Philada. July 16th. 1782 Notwithstanding the defensive professions of the Enemy they seem to be waging an active war agst. the post riders. The mail for the Eastward on Wednesday evening last shared the same fate which the Southern mail did a few weeks ago, and it is said from the identical villains. This operation has withdrawn them from their Southern stand, and secured the arrival of the mail which brings your favor of the 5th inst.(1) I fully concur in the change of cypher which you suggest, and understand the reference for a key-word.(2) I have been in some pain from the danger incident to the cypher we now use. The enemy I am told have in some instances published their intercepted cyphers. On our first meeting I propose to prepare against another separation, a cypher framed by Mr. Livingston on a more enlarged and complicated plan than ours, of which he has furnished me several blank printed copies.(3)  Your computation of the numbers in Virga. tallies very exactly with one transmitted by Mr. Jefferson in an answer to several queries from Mr. M s.(4) It is as accurate as the official returns to the Executive of the militia would admit. His proportion of the fencibles to the white souls is stated precisly as your computation states it.(5)  You will continue your information on the case of the flag and send me the acts of the Legislature as fast as they are printed. Will you be so good also as to obtain from the Auditors a state of the balance due on the principles established by law, and let me know when & how it is to be applied for? As also what chance there is of obtaining a regular remittance of future allowance?  Genl Washington & Ct. Rochambeau met here on Saturday evening. The object of their consultation is among the arcana of war.  A despach from the Commander in cheif communicated to Congress yesterday a late correspondence between him & Genl Carlton, principally on the subject of two traitors who under the cover of a flag of truce exposed themselves to arrest in New Jersey, and had sentence of death passed upon them. Genl. Carlton among other observations on the Subject, says that \""In a civil war between people of one empire, there can during the contest, be no treason at all\""- and asks a passport for Genl Robinson & Mr. Ludlow to confer with Genl W. or persons appointed by him, & to settle arrangements on this idea. Genl. W. declines the conference, observing that the proposed subject of it is within civil resort. Whereupon Genl. Carlton asks-Am I to apply to Congress to admit persons to conferences at Philada.? can any deputation be sent by Congress to your camp to meet persons appointed by me? or will you Sr. undertake to manage JULY 16, 1782  our common interest? The drift of all this need not be pointed out to you. As a counterpart to it, the British Genl. proposes, in order to remove all objection to an exchange of Soldiers for seamen, that the latter shall be perfectly free, and the former subject to the condition of not serving agst. the 13 Provinces for one year, within which period he is very sanguine that an end will be put to the calamities of the present war.  The same despatch informs Congress that a party of the Enemy have lately made a successful incursion upon the settlements of Mohawk, have reoccupied Oswego and are extending themselves in to the Western country. However little these movements may coincide with a defensive plan, they coincide perfectly with ideas which will not fail to be urged at a pacification. Messrs. Montgomery & Root returned yesterday from their Eastern deputation.(6) They have not yet made their report. The former complains that several {of the States}(7) are {appropriating the taxes which they lay as their quota of the eight million to internal uses-He owns that the knowledge he has obtained of the case} has {changed his mind on that head} and {that if the ground was to be trodden over again he should take a very different part in Congress. He adds} that the current opinion is that a vessel arrived at Quebec brings a {royal charter} for {Vermont}. That the people there are {in much confusion} and {many of them disposed to reunite} with {N. Hampshire}. A letter to Mr. Livingston from Mr. {Livermore} corroborates this good news. It imparts that a very unexpected turn had taken place in the temper of the people {between the river} and {the ridge} that they were {petitioning New Hampshire to be restored to} that {state} and that measures would be taken in concert with {New York} for that purpose. The revolution in the {sentiments of M g y} may be owing in part {to the new relation in} which {Pennsylvania stands} to {Connecticut} which he says is governed on this occasion by interested {individuals}. The controversy between Pena. & Connecticut will I suppose be now resumed & put into a course for decision, the return of Mr. Root having removed the cause which suspended it.(8)  In the beginning of this month Committees were appointed in pursuance of a previous Resolution for such an appointt. every half year, to examine into the proceedings of the several executive departments & make report to Congress. This plan adopted not only to discharge the general duty of Congress & to satisfy their constituents, but also that such reports might shelter in some degree faithful officers from unmerited imputations & suspicions, as well as expose to just censure those of an opposite character. For reasons which will occur to you {Doctor Lee was sent into} the department of Finance.(9) The {Doctor} is endeavouring I am told Contrary to the object in view to go into an investigation of the {contracts in trade} allowed by Congress. All the movements of {Doctor} are pointed directly or   circuitously either to {Morris or Franklin}. This cypher I find is extremely tedious & liable to errors.  Genl Carlton in his letter to Genl Washington above quoted, says with respect to Lippincut only that the Ct. had passed their judgment and that as soon as the length of the proceedings would admit, a copy should be sent to him. It is inferred that this murderer will not be given up, and Consequently a vicarious atonement must be made by the guiltless Asgill.  Our expected news from Mr. Adams is not yet arrived, nor any news whatever from Europe. The same continues to be the case with respect to the W. Indies. The reports for several days have turned on the evacuation & burning of Charleston. If there be any truth in either of them, you will have heard a confirmation before this reaches you. The former is as probable as the latter is otherwise, unless it may have been the effect of chance, or the hand of some desperate refugee  You never touch on the time of your visit to us, a point on which I am you know not a little anxious. Mr. Jones is detained I perceive (10) by a mode of supply from Mr Ross which has only a retrospective efficacy. (11)  ""

Lieut.

After Inquiry he says it will be done, that he is going to New Hampshire and shall there Endeavour a Settlement to the first of August 1780, and shall then Apply to the Financier for a Settlement of the Sums due after that time. I have made Enquiry and Cannot find that any State has settled with their Troops for Depreciation &c. further than August 1780.

Warrens, Hancock's & Austins seem to me to have a preference in the collection.(2) I wish that you would institute annual orations on the anniversary of independence, or of the signing the alliance with France. On the 4th of July 1778 I attempted a little matter of this kind in Charlestown of which I have not a single copy or I would send it.(3)  We hear that Charlestown is both evacuated & burnt. This will add the finishing stroke to the sufferings of our exiles, who consoled themselves with the idea of reposessing their habitations.(4) For my own part, I can as readily go down stairs as go up. In a short life I have known the conveniences and inconveniences of both poverty and riches, & find as to the real enjoyment of life there is very little difference. The man who lives according to nature can never be poor, he who lives according to fashion & opinion can never be rich. I wish to be one of the first class, & can therefore make myself happy in every state and condition. One thing is consolatory that though the burning of the town would accumulate distress on individuals, it would be a public advantage as the enemy would then be confined to the single spot of New-York. Partial evil-Universal Good alleviates the distresses of our suffering whigs. I do not mention it as certain, that this event has taken place. It comes by the way of New-York in a vessell of a short passage from Charlestown; but a number of concurring circumstances give probability to the report. If Charlestown is evacuated I think it probable, that the French army will move northwardly, [& p]erhaps a vigorous cooperation would make them evacuate New-York. This would well repay the continent for the loss of Charlestown.  I am glad to hear that your ladies think you are so attached to Philada. as that they suppose you will soon repeat your visit to this city. I can assure you that there are many here of both sexes who would be glad to see you.

Of this Epistle I kept no Copy but it contains some political Strictures on publick affairs and some Reflections on my own Circumstances. Unless it is a Reproach to become poor in a good Cause I shall have no Occasion to blush for a single Sentiment tho' I have written it with unreserved Confidence to a Friend for whom I with hold nothing.  I expressed the feelings of my Heart on the very friendly and affectionate manner in which you advise me on the Subject of my own private Concerns; and I repeat it that this Instance of your Sensibility toward me has made the deepest Impressions and convincd me that I was not mistaken when I so freely opened my affairs to you and wished for your Council. I explaind-I am giving an Account of the intercepted Letter-I explaind the Necessity-as I must change the Domestic Situation of my Family-of obtaining from the Legislature a Reimbursement of the Advances I procured for their Honour to pay my Expences on the Delegation; and how destructive it woud prove to every Exertion I can make for my Family if that money is withheld. On the late Statute of our State for giving Peace to the Citizens on the North East, I observed that I had long since formed a fixed Resolution to object to no measures which might be adopted for Restoring our internal Tranquility, even if by those measures my private property shoud be made a Sacrifice; adding this single Reflection \""that my Passivity coud not alter the Dictates of Justice.\""  I lamented the Fate of the Land Office bill And pointed out the Weakness of that Policy which while it was operating to Cure the  JULY 19, 1782  Evils of a Controverted Jurisdiction which had been so severely felt in one part of the State: did not extend itself to another part where similar mischiefs were daily to be apprehended.  I took Notice of the good Effects which woud probably result from the Declarations of several of the Legislatures occasiond by the late Changes in the British Administration and their project of a defensive war, and Scheme of Conciliation-And concluded that nothing coud lend more effectually to put an End to the Delusive Expectation that this Country woud prostitute its Honour & good Faith, than the Unsolicited and solemn Resolutions of the whole people by their immediate Representatives, that they will inviolably adhere to their federal union and national Treaties and employ their Strength & Resources to compel their Enemies to such a Peace as will establish our Independance and maintain our national Dignity.  These Topics with the few Articles of our Southern Successes & Intelligence which have since run thro' the News Papers, to the best of my Remembrance, filled up that hasty Letter which as I before hinted I had not leisure to correct or transcribe.  We have no Accounts from Europe since and indeed some time before my Arrival here. Three Vessells arrivd last night from the Havannah notwithstanding this Coast is so strictly guarded.

  Sir, Philadelphia July l9th. 1782 We have been honored with your Excellencys letter of the Ulto. and the inclosed resolutions of the Honle. the general Assembly. (1)  You may be assured that proper attention will always be paid on our part to any Instruction which that honorable body may think proper to honor us with, and particularly to those now received. We have a proper sense of the principels and justice on which they are  JULY 19, 1782  founded, and are fully impressed with the importance of the objects that the state wish to obtain. Yet such is our embarrased situation that we dare not at present flatter you that we shall be soon able to obtain that justice which is due to the state on account of the Old money or back lands. At the same time we take the liberty to assure you that we will endeavor to obtain those desirable objects by embracing every favorable moment.  It is now believed that the United Provinces of the Low Countrys have acknowledged the Independance of the United States and received Mr. Adams in his official character of Embassador. This intelligence depends altogether on the authenticity of the public News papers.(2) No official letters have been received from Europe of a later date than about the last of March or first of April. We have little doubt but that this glorious news is true and if so is an event that cannot but be favorable to the United States. Notwithstanding we are informed from good Authority that a Minister at the Hague from a respectable nothern Power used every means in his power with their High Mightinesses to prevent its taking place. Therefore cannot undertake to say what effect it may have in the different Courts of Europe.  We are altogether at a loss to say what measures the Court of Great Britain intend to persue, having received no Intelligence from Europe that is to be relyed on since the new Ministry entered upon their Administration neither have we any reason to suppose that Sr. Guy Carlton has received any instructions from them. It appears probable that this summer will be spent by them in fixing their plans. Whether they will be for war or peace is at present altogether uncertain. But in our opinion let them adopt which they will they will prosecute the one they do adopt in earnest.  Congress have been imployed for a long time in the common business that dayly presents its self, without doing any thing that particularly deserves your notice. There are several Committees that have business of consequence under consideration on which it is probable they will soon report.  His Excellency the Commander in Chief has been a week in this City, his journey to this place was in consequence of a previous appointmt to meet the Count De Roshambau, their meeting was according to the appointment. Several Committees of Congress have had conferrences with the General since he has been in this place on business of importance And we have the pleasure to assure you that we have every reason to suppose that the most perfect harmony subsists between him and Congress at this time his stay from the Army will be short.  We beg you will excuse us on account of the barenness of this  letter as well as for our fault of not acknowledging the recept of yours at an earlier period. We waited in hopes of being able to communicate somthing worthy your notice.  We have the honor to [be] your Excellencys most obedt. Humble Servants, Ezek Cornell  David Howell.  ""

I should have forwarded the Petition & Citation to be served on Coll Stanton so as to appear at Hartford but as by looking over the paper I find the Circumstances of the case so Varied from my Apprehensions Antecedent to My revising the paper that my Deposition tho substantially true yet will want a good deal of explication to have the matter fully understood which cannot well be done Unless I could be present at the hearing & when I might be of Essential service, which cannot be at Hartford. We are therefore waiting for Mr. Paca one of the Judges his arrival at this place when a time will be appointed for holding a Court in this place which probably will be sometime in the month of September if so it is probable I shall be here & can Attend the Trial, & hope it may be done before the final Trial on the Bond at Rhodisland, but I should think whenever the Petition shall be served & Notice given to Stanton for a rehearing, tho the matter should be undecided yet the Supr. Court at Rhodisland will certainly Continue the cause till the Court of Appeals can decide the matter but am in hopes it may be tried here so as to give you seasonable Notice before the final Trial on the bond comes on. Expect to forward the citation &c per Brown who will set out in 6 or 8 days. Am with sincere regards, yr Hle Servt. Elipht. Dyer  ""

10999,dg018616,1782,John Witherspoon s Speech in Congress,"""John Witherspoon's Speech in Congress
  Mr President, July 22? 1782](1) I have little to say against the resolutions, as they stand reported by the superintendant of finance. Perhaps they are unavoidable in the circumstances to which we are reduced. Yet the step seems to be so very important, and the consequences of it so much to be dreaded, that I must intreat the patience of the house, till I state the danger in a few words, and examine whether any thing can possibly be added to it, which may in some degree prevent the evils which we apprehend, or at least exculpate Congress, and convince the public that it is the effect of absolute necessity.  Sir, if we enter into these resolves as they stand, it will be a deliberate deviation from an express and absolute stipulation, and  JULY 22, 1782  therefore it will, as it was expressed by an honourable gentleman the other day, give the last stab to public credit. It will be in vain, in future, to ask the public to believe any promise we shall make, even when the most clear and explicit grounds of confidence are produced. Perhaps it will be said that public credit is already gone; and it hath been said that there is no more in this, than in neglecting to pay the interest of the loan-office certificates of later date; but though there were no other differences between them, this being another and fresher instance of the same, will have an additional evil influence upon public credit. But in fact, there is something more in it than in the other. The solemn stipulation of Congress, specifying the manner in which the interest was to be paid, was considered as an additional security, and gave a value to these certificates, which the others never had.(2) I beg that no gentleman may think that I hold it a light matter to withhold the interest from the other lenders, they will be convinced, I hope, of the contrary before I have done; but I have made the comparison merely to shew what will be the influence of this measure upon the public mind, and therefore upon the credit and estimation of Congress. Now it is plain, that the particular promise of giving bills upon Europe, as it had an effect, and was intended to have it in procuring credit, it must, when broken or withdrawn, operate in the most powerful manner to our prejudice. I will give an example of this, in our melancholy past experience. The old continental money was disgraced and sunk, first by the act of March 18th, 1780, (which the Duke de Vergennes justly called an act of bankruptcy,) telling you would pay no more of your debt than sixpence in the pound. This was afterwards further improved by new estimates of depreciation, of seventy-five and one hundred and fifty, for new state paper, which itself was sunk to two or three for one; and yet bad as these men's cases were, the disgrace arising from them was more than doubled, by people's referring to, and repeating a public declaration of Congress, in which we complained of the injurious slanders of those that said we would suffer the money to sink in the hands of the holders, and making the most solemn protestations, that ultimately the money should be redeemed dollar for dollar; and to my knowledge, some trusting to that very declaration, sold their estates at what they thought a high price, and brought themselves to utter ruin.  I cannot help requesting Congress to attend to the state of those persons who held the loan-office certificates which drew interest on France; they are all, without exception, the firmest and safest friends to the cause of America; they were in general the most firm, and active, and generous friends. Many of them advanced large sums of hard money, to assist you in carrying on the war in Canada. None of them at all put away even the loan-office certificates on speculation, but either from a generous intention of serving the  public, or from an entire confidence in the public credit. There is one circumstance which ought to be attended to, viz. the promise of interest-bills on Europe were not made till the 10th of September, 1777. It was said a day or two ago, that those who sent in cash a little before March 1st, 1778, had by the depreciated state of the money, received almost their principal; but this makes but a small part of the money, for there were but six months for the people to put in the money, after the promise was made; only the most apparent justice obliged Congress to extend the privilege to those who had put in their money before. Besides, nothing can be more unequal and injurious than reckoning the money by the depreciation either before or after the 1st of March, 1778, for a great part of the money in all the Loan offices was such as had been paid up in its nominal value, in consequence of the Tender laws.  This points you, Sir, to another class of people, from whom money was taken, viz. widows and orphans, corporations and public bodies. How many guardians were actually led, or indeed were obliged, to put their depreciated and depreciating money into the funds-I speak from good knowledge. The trustees of the college of New Jersey, in June, 1777, directed a committee of theirs to put all the money that should be paid up to them, in the loan-office, so that they have now nearly invested all. Some put in before March, 1778, and a greater part subsequent to that date. Now it must be known to every body, that since the payment of the interest bills gave a value to these early loans, many have continued their interest in them, and rested in a manner wholly on them for support. Had they entertained the slightest suspicion that they would be cut off, they could have sold them for something, and applied themselves to other means of subsistence; but as the case now stands, you are reducing not an inconsiderable number of your very best friends to absolute beggary. During the whole period, and through the whole system of continental money, your friends have suffered alone-the disaffected and lukewarm have always evaded the burden-have in many instances turned the sufferings of the country to their own account-have triumphed over the whigs-and if the whole shall be crowned with this last stroke, it seems but reasonable that they should treat us with insult and derision. And what faith do you expect the public creditors should place in your promise of ever paying them at all? What reason, after what is past, have they to dread that you will divert the fund which is now mentioned as the distant source of payment? If a future Congress should do this, it would not be one whit worse than what has been already done.  I wish, Sir, this house would weigh a little, the public consequences that will immediately follow this resolution. The grief, disappointment and sufferings of your best friends, has been already mentioned-then prepare yourselves to hear from your enemies the   most insulting abuse. You will be accused of the most oppressive tyranny, and the grossest fraud. If it be possible to poison the minds of the public, by making this body ridiculous or contemptible, they will have the fairest oportunity of doing so, that ever was put in their hands. But I must return to our plundered, long ruined friends; we cannot say to what their rage and disappointment may bring them; we know that nothing on earth is so deeply resentful, as despised or rejected love-whether they may proceed to any violent or disorderly measures, it is impossible to know. We have an old proverb, That the eyes will break through stone walls, and for my own part, I should very much dread the furious and violent efforts of despair. Would to God, that the independence of America was once established by a treaty of peace in Europe; for we know that in all great and fierce political contention, the effect of power and circumstances is very great; and that if the tide has run long with great violence one way, if it does not fully reach its purpose, and is by any means brought to a stand, it is apt to take a direction, and return with the same or greater violence than it advanced. Must this be risked at a crisis when the people begin to the fatigued with the war, to feel the heavy expence of it, by paying taxes; and when the enemy, convinced of their folly in their former severities, are doing every thing they can to ingratiate themselves with the public at large. But though our friends should not be induced to take violent and seditious measures all at once, I am almost certain it will produce a particular hatred and contempt of Congress, the representative body of the union, and still a greater hatred of the individuals who compose the body at this time. One thing will undoubtedly happen; that it will greatly abate the respect which is due from the public to this body, and therefore weaken their authority in all other parts of their proceedings.  I beg leave to say, Sir, that in all probability, it will lay the foundation for other greater and more scandalous steps of the same kind. You will say what greater can there be? Look back a little to your history. The first and great deliberate breach of public faith, was the act of March 18th, 1780, reducing the money to forty for one, which was declaring you would pay your debt at sixpence in the pound- But did it not turn? No, by and by it was set in this state and others at seventy-five, and finally set one hundred and fifty for one, in new paper, in state paper, which in six months, rose to four for one. Now, Sir, what will be the case with these certificates? Before this proposal was known, their fixed price was about half a crown for a dollar of the estimated depreciated value; when this resolution is fairly fixed, they will immediately fall in value, perhaps to a shilling the dollar, probably less. Multitudes of people in despair, and absolute necessity, will sell them for next to nothing, and when the holders come at last to apply for their money, I think it highly probable, you will give JULY 22,1782  them a scale of depreciation, and tell them, they cost so little that it would be an injury to the public to pay the full value. And in truth, Sir, supposing you finally to pay the full value of the certificates to the holders, the original and most meritorious proprietors will in many, perhaps in most cases, lose the whole.  It will be very proper to consider what effect this will have upon foreign nations; certainly it will set us in a most contemptible light. We are just beginning to appear among the powers of the earth, and it may be said of national, as of private characters, they soon begin to form, and when disadvantageous ideas are formed, they are not easily altered or destroyed. In the very instance before us, many of these certificates are possessed by the subjects of foreign princes, and indeed are in foreign parts. We must not think that other sovereigns will suffer their subjects to be plundered in so wanton and extravagant a manner. You have on your files, letters from the Count de Vergennes, on the subject of your former depreciation;(3) in which he tells you, that whatever liberty you take with your own subjects, you must not think of treating the subjects of France in the same way, and it is not impossible that you may hear upon this subject, what you little expect, when the terms of peace are to be settled. I do not in the least doubt that it may be demanded that you should pay to the full of its nominal value, all the money as well as loan-office certificates, which shall be found in the hands of the subjects of France, Spain or Holland, and it would be perfectly just. I have mentioned France, &c. but it is not only not impossible, but highly probable, that by accident or danger, or both, many of these loan-office certificates may be in the hands of English subjects. Do you think they will not demand payment? Do you think they will make any difference between their being before or after March 1st, 1778? And will you present them with a scale of depreciation? Remember the affair of the Canada bills, in the last peace between England and France-I wish we could take example from our enemies. How many fine dissertations have we upon the merit of national truth and honour in Great Britain. Can we think without blushing, upon our contrary conduct in the matter of finance? By their punctuality in fulfilling their engagements as to interest, they have been able to support a full load of debt altogether enormous. Be pleased to observe, Sir, that they are not wholly without experience of depreciation: navy debentures and sailors' tickets have been frequently sold at an half, and sometimes even at a third of their value; by that means they seem to be held by the class of men called by us speculators. Did that government ever think of presenting the holders of them, when they came to be paid, with a scale of depreciation? The very idea of it would knock the whole system of public credit to pieces.  But the importance of this matter will be felt before the end of the   war. We are at this time earnestly soliciting foreign loans. With what face can we expect to have credit in foreign parts, and in future loans, after we have so notoriously broken every engagement which we have hitherto made? A disposition to pay, and visible probable means of payment, are absolutely necessary to credit; and where that is once established, it is not difficult to borrow. If it may be a mean of turning the attention of Congress to this subject, I beg of them to observe, that if they could but lay down a foundation of credit, they would get money enough to borrow in this country, where we are. There is property enough here; and, comparatively speaking, there is a great number of persons here who would prefer money at interest to purchasing and holding real estates. The ideas of all old country people are high in favour of real estate. Though the interest of money, even upon the very best security there, is from four to four and a half, four and three quarters, and five per centum, yet when any real estate is to be sold, there will be ten purchasers where one only can obtain it, and it will cost so much as not to bring more than two, two and a half, and at most three per centum.  It is quite otherwise in this country, and indeed it ought to be otherwise. To purchase an estate in the cultivated parts of the country, except what a man possesses himself, will not be near so profitable as the interest of money, and in many cases where it is rented out, it is so wasted and worn by the tenant, that it would be a greater profit at the end of seven years, that the land had been left to itself, to bear woods and bushes that should rot upon the ground, without any rent at all. Any body also may see, that it is almost universal in this country, when a man dies leaving infant children, that the executors sell all his property to turn it into money, and put it in securities for easy and equal division.  All these things, Mr. President, proceed upon certain and indubitable principles, which never fail of their effect. Therefore, you have only to make your payments as soon, as regular, and as profitable as other borrowers, and you will get all the money you want; and by a small advantage over others, it will be poured in upon you, so that you shall not need to go to the lenders, for they will come to you.  MS not found; reprinted from John Witherspoon, The Works of John Witherspoon . . . 9 vols. (Edinburgh: J. Ogle, 1815), 9:125-34.  1 Witherspoon apparently delivered these remarks in opposition to recommendations from the superintendent of finance for suspending the payment of interest on loan office certificates, which had been before Congress since June 13. The immediate occasion for the speech was probably the proposed resolutions contained in the July 18 report of a committee appointed to consider Robert Morris' second proposal on the subject. See Morris, Papers (Ferguson), 5:396-99, 491;JCC, 22:447-48, PCC item 19, 4:361-62; James Madison to Edmund Randolph, July 2, 1782, note 5; and the preceding entry.  2 For these April 18 and June 28, 1780, resolutions, see JCC, 16:374-75, 17:56669.  3 For Vergennes' letters of June 21 and 30, 1780, to John Adams, and of June 30 to Benjamin Franklin, see PCC, item 84, 2:383-86, 401-10, 415-20; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 3:805-7, 827-28.

I begin to receive my allowance more regularly than heretofore and therefore would not have you put your self to any trouble about supplies. Should be glad to receive the £100. I believe it is beyond a Doubt that the States General of the united Provinces have received Mr Adams in his public Character And Acknowledged our Independence, on which Important and very Interesting Event I most sincerely Congratulate you. This will be more than a ballance for the Defeat of Count de Grasse. The naval Force of the united Provinces added to those of France and Spain must give them a decided Superiority and dispose the British (Vain and haughty as they are) to offer reasonable terms for a general peace and none for a Separate one will ever I am persuaded be received by France or America, nor unless our Independence is previously Acknowledgd.  There has been two or three fortunate Arrivals here lately from the Havanna with a Considerable quantity of specie all of which is thrown into the Bank. These are lucky reinforcements especially as the States pay nothing into the Treasury. Lippincot it is said is acquitted by a Court-Marshall (haveing proved that he acted by order of the infamous board of refugees). If so it is probable he will not be given up and a British officer will suffer. General Washington is in Town as is Count Rochambeau. Our Gen. is in high health and looks better than ever I see him.

  Dear Sir Philada. 23 July. 1782.  The sterility of my late correspondence will be compensated by the contents of the inclosed paper, which besides other interesting particulars sufficiently confirms the recognition of our Independence by the States General. Among the numerous good consequences of this event to us I wish the people of Virginia not to be inattentive to its influence on the value of their staple, which it is probable will be an immediate object of speculation. Other particulars not yet republished from the foreign papers are the capture of 1 if not 2 French 74s with a number of transports on their way to the E. Indies, by Admiral Barrington-the capture of a British Frigate, with some transports by a Dutch ship of war-the capture of the rich island of Ceylon from the Dutch by Admiral Hughs, & of Negapatam another of their important possessions on the coast of Coromandel, with two ships richly laden with oriental productions.  The language of the New Ministry is not a little novel & extraordinary. They seem to consider themselves as they really are, the creatures of the people, not of the crown and address their whole conduct to the temper of the former, with as much assiduity as their predecessors did to the latter. The popular & oeconomical principles which they urged out of office, are the basis of their plans in office. They are excluding contractors &c from the legislature- abolishing sinecure appointments-pruning the civil list-arming the Militia and even patronizing a scheme of equal representation. In the last particular they met with great obstacles & Mr. Fox had the mortification to find himself in a minority on the question for appointing a committee to bring in plan for the purpose.  Ireland is reaping a large share of the harvest produced by our labours. Besides a free trade & a free legislation, the shackles are taken off the poor Catholicks in the articles of their religious worship & the tenure of real property.  Genl. Washington is still here. My last contained all the information I can give you relative to Lippencut & Asgil, Carlton preserves his taciturnity. It is said that a fleet of transports is just arrived at the Hook, and that they have troops on board. This has brought to life again the supposed evacuation of Charleston.

  Dear Sir Philada. 23 July 1782. I have at length the pleasure of presenting you with certain tho' not official intelligence of the recognition of our Independence by the States General. This event with other interesting particulars is contained in the inclosed Gazettes. Among its salutary consequences to this country I hope the people of Virga. will not be inattentive to its influence on the value of its Staple, on which it is very probable Speculations will be attempted.  The Language & measures of the present administration will furnish you with copious matter for reflection. If we had recd. fewer lessons of caution agst. sanguine expectations, I should with confidence explain them by a scheme for a general pacification, and for fathering on their predecessors all the obnoxious conditions which the public distresses may expose them to. If this solution were a just one, it ought at the same time to be remembered that the triumph of Rodney may give a new turn to their politics. It appears from the paper from which the inclosed intelligence is republished, that this event had reached London, that it was received with great rejoicings, but that the public were Still haunted with fears for Jamaica. Other articles not included in the paper herewith sent, are, the capture of 1 if not 2 French 74's with a number of Transports for the East Indies by Adml. Barrington-the capture of a British frigate with some transports by a Dutch ship of war-the capture of the valuable Island of Ceylon from the Dutch by Admiral Hughs, & of the Negapatam another of their important possessions on the Coast of Coromandel, with 2 ships richly freighted with Spices & other oriental productions. Ireland is likely to be indulged in every thing. In addition to a free trade & a free Legislation, they have obtained the assent of the Ld. Lieutt. to an act of Parliament for emancipating the Catholics from the shackles on their religious rights, & on their tenures of real property. Your philanthropy will be gratified by my adding as other proofs of the progress of light & freedom, the abolition of the inquisitorial jurisdiction in Sicily, the only part of the Neapolitan dominions where it was in force, and the inefficacy of the Pope's visit to Vienna in checking the liberal innovations of the Emperor in his ecclesiastical polity.  The news from Holland has much emboldened the {enemies of France. Doctor Lee declared}(1) that it ought to be considered as the {epoch of our emancipation}. Yesterday I was reminded {by Izzard} that {Franklin was interested} in restoring the {backlands to the crown}. Soon {after I was shewn by Lee a proposition for reconsidering the} commission & {instructions for peace}.(2) The plan is to {exclude F____n & Jy (3) & to} with{draw} the others (4) from the {direc- JULY 23, 1782  tion of France}.

General Washington is still here. I have nothing to add to my last on the subject of Lippencut & Asgil. It is said that a fleet of transports is just arrived at the Hook, & that it has troops on Board. This revived the idea that an evacuation of Charleston has taken place.

Our Prospects brighten daily and tho' the misfortune of the French fleet in the West Indies is severely felt, the British Nation must be JULY 24, 1782  tired of prosecuting a hopeless war, and be brought by the Combination of so many Enemies to think seriously of Peace.  I continue to enjoy an uninterrupted State of Health. May you and ours experience the same great Blessings with thankful Hearts.  Adieu my dearest Polly. Kiss and bless for me our dear Children and present my respectful Compliments to our Friends-and believe that I shall never cease to be-your most affectionate & faithful Husband,  Jas. Duane  ""

  Wednesday, July 24. [1782] Mr. Lee made the following motion.  \""That the Commissions of the 15 of June,1781, appointing ministers plenipotentiary to negotiate a treaty of peace with Great Britain, together with the instructions given to the said Commissioners be reconsidered.'' (1)  JULY 24, 1782  Mr. Bland informed the house that he had always been against the instructions so far as they obliged the ministers ultimately to govern themselves by the advice of France, and therefore he seconded the motion for reconsideration. An objection was made to his seconding the reconsideration as he had acknowledged he had voted agst the instructions. The objection was deemed valid, whereupon after sometime  Mr. Jackson gave it his second.  The motion being thus introduced was read and a debate thereon ensued.  Mr. Lowell said he would have seconded the motion, but that he intended to have brought on the Consideration of the subject in another way, that he thought the instructions were not valid as they had not at the time of passing had the vote of nine states which by the Confederation were necessary to give them validity. This occasioned a call for the minutes of the proceedings which were read.  Mr. Bland supported the propriety of a reconsideration.  Mr. Madison objected to it. He took notice that the motion before the house went much farther than the reasoning in support of a reconsideration. That the reasoning was confined entirely to the impropriety, inexpediency and dangerous consequences of one single clause in the instructions; that the motion was pointed against the ministers as well as against the instructions; that nothing was said to show that the appointment was improper and that therefore he could not agree to the motion. But waiving this he should object to the motion if confined to the instructions; as to the objection started on account of an amendment to the original instructions which was carried by seven states, he apprehended the articles of confederation did not require the vote of nine states for the purpose of making peace; but even admitting it did and that there was an error or defect in the instructions by reason of the amendment, admitted by seven votes on the 11 th June 1781, yet the passing them afterwards on the 15 of the same month which appears to have been done without dissent, and the confirmation of them by the act of the 31st of May last removed every defect or error which the admission of the amendment might have occasioned. That before gentlemen condemned the instructions they ought to consider the times & circumstances in which they were passed. Here he went into a detail of the critical situation of affairs in America in June 1781, the interposition of mediating powers, the rejection of the motion for joining other persons in the Commission with J. Adams, the unfortunate difference between him & the Co[un]t de Vergennes & the information given that the court of F. had not a full confidence in Mr Adams prudence & management. Upon the whole he did not  think it prudent or proper to reconsider the instructions; that they could not be productive of any ill consequences and that the reconsidering and altering them might interrupt the harmony which at present subsists between the U. S. & F., might abate the zeal she has hitherto shown in our favour & that our affairs were not at present in such a situation as to warrant so hazardous a step.  Sundry other members opposed the reconsideration & at last an adjournment was called for which was agreed to.

  Gentlemen, Phila, July 25th, 1782. Your favour of the 24th, (1) proposing a method for agreeing on Judges in the Case between Pensylvania & Connecticut has been duly recd & attended to, and on Considering it we are led to think that the method proposed will be inadequate to the object in view, for it may happen that no one name will be found in both lists, and very unlikely that the whole number proposed will-in either case we are left at large to devise some other Method for appointing the whole or a part, as the Case may be-besides we doubt whether Congress can with propriety judge between us in the Case you mention, where a Commissioner shall be found in both lists & afterwards be Objected to on acct of Interest, &c. We are inclined to think that this business may be better effected & with more Satisfaction to the Concerned in the following manner, which we take the liberty to propose for your Consideration. That the Agents for Pennsylvania & Connecticut alternately nominate a person to be approved or dissented to by the other party, & so to proceed until we shall have agreed upon the number proposed, or shall find it to be impracticable. Or that the agents of sd States each make out a list of persons to the number of Seven, whom they would have to be Judges, & exchange the same with each other for approbation or dissent in part or in whole-in either of these ways no person will be appointed a Judge without the full Concurrence of both the parties-further it appears to us most probable that after attempting every other method this must be ultimately resorted to as the only way of Completing this business, but as we expect a  JULY 25, 1782  Conference to morrow morning, (2) according to appointment, we shall then attend and Endeavor to agree in a method to proceed in the business.

11008,dg018625,1782,Charles Thomson s Notes of Debates,"""Charles Thomson's Notes of Debates
  Thursday, July 25. [1782] Mr Lee informed the house that he had looked into a report from the superintendant of finances of the 24 of May, by which it appears that large sums of money are reserved in France for certain purposes; that in his opinion some of these purposes did not require so large a sum as was reserved for them, and that others were not proper; that the situation of our treasury required an examination into this matter and therefore he moved \""That the report of the superintendant of finances of the 24 of May last stating the application of the monies of the United States in France be referred to a Com[mitte]e to be examined & reported on.\"" This motion was agreed to and Mr Lee, Mr Izard and Mr Wharton were elected. (1) It may not be improper to observe that the superintendant in his report of the 24 of May enclosed, 1. A copy of a letter from the Count De Vergennes to Doct Franklin dated 6. Feby 1782, with an acct of the money lent & obtained for the United States in 1781 and the balance remaining unexpended 2. A copy of a letter of 4th March from Doct Franklin informing the superintendant that the court of France had agreed to furnish the United States with the sum of six millions of livres in the year 1782 in four quarterly payments, & 3. An account from the superintendant of the purposes to which the balance of former loans and the six millions granted & to be paid this year are to be applied \""from which,\"" says he, \""Congress will perceive that every loan we can command during the year 1782 is anticipated.\"" Hence it appeared evident that no more bills could be drawn as heretofore for the payment of the interest of monies borrowed before the 1 March 1778, and that for the support of the war during the present year Congress must rely on the exer- JULY 25, 1782  tions of the states. The states had not yet all complied with the requisition of Febry 1781 for granting an impost of five per cent on imports and prizes which was to be appropriated to the payment of interest and discharging the debt contracted during the war. The quotas of 8 millions of Dollars required for the present year were like to come in very slow. The first quarter day had passed without any money being paid. The treasury was exhausted, large anticipations had been made. And the superintendant had informed Congress that he could not with safety proceed farther and that some of the great war departments were at a stand for want of money. Letters and representations to the states had not had the desired effect. To give a full display of the situation of affairs in writing would be dangerous as it would expose it to the knowledge of the enemy. Congress therefore on the 27th May thought it proper to send two of their members to the states eastward and two to the southward to give them a confidential and full view of affairs and to stimulate them to a speedy compliance with the requisitions of Congress, particularly those relative to the impost and the quotas for 1782 (2) some time after, viz June 1 a Comtt (3) consisting of Mr Osgood, Mr Izard & Mr Witherspoon reported a resolution for putting a stop to the drawing of any more bills. This was referred to the superintendant who reported a resolution to the same effect. And this together with the former report was referred to Mr Rutledge, Mr Lee, and Mr Clark, and their report concurred with the former that a stop should be put to the drawing of any more bills for the payment of interest. The subject was taken up and debated in Congress. The holders of Certificates who had heretofore been paid their interest in bills of exchange now took the alarm and remonstrated against this step. On the 12 July while this matter was under deliberation Mr Lee presented a memorial to Congress stating that on the settlement of his accounts in August 1781, as there was then no money in the treasury he had taken a Certificate for the balance payable with interest at a future day, and that as all the other ministers whose accounts were settled had been paid in bills of exchange praying that he might be put upon the same footing with them and the Certificate given him taken up and cancelled. This was referred to Mr Witherspoon, Mr Lowell and Mr Middleton, and notwithstanding the information given by the Superintendant that there were no funds on which bills could be drawn, notwithstanding a report of a Come in consequence of that information was then before Congress and under deliberation for putting a stop to the drawing any more bills, & notwithstanding the clamours of the holders of certificates which would naturally be increased when they found their interest stopped under pretence that Congress had no funds in Europe on which they could draw bills and at the same time drawing in favour of one of their members for a sum equal to one   fortieth part of their whole interest, notwithstanding all this the Come on the 19 July reported \""that the superintendant should be directed to draw a bill on Doct. Franklin in favour of Mr A. Lee for the sum of £2238.17.9 sterling with interest from the 6 of August last, and that the Certificate given him for that sum being the balance of his acct as settled by the board of treasury should be cancelled.\""(4) The report was objectionable on another account. A special resolution had been passed 29 May 1781 for facilitating the settlement of Mr Lee's acct; no other voucher than his word of honor was required for his expences ordinary or extraordinary amounting to 155,191 livres 18 sous & 14 denr, (5) he had without any authority expended for the State of Virginia a part of the monies he received for the public use to the amount of sixty six thousand eight hundred and fifty three livres, whereby he fell in debt to the Public; and it was only by allowing him to charge that sum on the promise of Virginia to account for it with the United States, that he became a public creditor; and by accepting a Certificate for the balance payable at a future day with interest he had put himself on a footing with other public creditors and therefore had no right to any peculiar favour or indulgence  Mr Lowell, one of the Comtt, informed the house that he had objected to the report on account of the want of funds in Europe but was over ruled by the other members. The report of the Superintendant of the 4 of May was called for and read and after debate the report of the Commtt was referred to the Superintendant of finance to take order.  By this step Congress avoided the apparent inconsistency of conduct & partiality in favour of their own members and left it to the superintendt to falsify his own report & incur the odium of the public creditors by drawing in favour of Mr Lee, or the resentment of Mr Lee by a refusal.  Reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 65-68.  1 JCC, 22:416.  2 This action was actually taken on May 22, not the 27th. See JCC, 22:289-90; and Jesse Root to Jonathan Trumbull, May 24, 1782, note.  3 Undoubtedly a misreading of Thomson's abbreviation for committee, which he often abbreviated \""comee,\"" \""commee,\"" or \""come,\"" but never \""com't.\"" In this instance the issue is of little consequence, but elsewhere in this NYHS Collection text of Thomson's notes, \""com\""\"" is given where Thomson undoubtedly wrote \""comr\"" (commissioner).  4 See Arthur Lee to Congress, July 12, 1782.  5 The following note, which appears at the foot of the page, is keyed at this point in the text. \""The board of treasury was ordered in adjusting Mr Lee acct to compute from 15 Dec 1776 to 25 March 1780, which is 3 yrs 3 mo & 10 days including three months and after he was out of services, during that time he charged and was allowed for expenses ordinary and extraordinary the sum of 155,197.18 Livres 4 Denr which is at the rate of 47382 livres or 9476 2/5 dollars per annum & besides this a salary of 500 pounds sterling a year.\"" JULY 27, 1782

  Dear Sir Philada. July 29. 1782  I dare say you attribute to neglect my long silence on the Subject of my last letter. (1) The truth is, I have not been able to say any thing of importance on the Subject. Upon Genl. Lincolns return from head quarters, he made a report for appointing three Brigadiers, one for Massachusets Line, one for Connecticut & one for Jersey- with this report he laid before Congress a Letter from the Commander in Chief to the secretary at War, in which he states the situation of the three lines, & Urges the Necessity of Appointing Brigadrs for the two former, but Signifies that the reasons in favour of a Brigadr. for Jersey are not equally strong with the former owing  JULY 29, 1782  to their having but two Regiments; in this Letter you are named as having a right to promotion in Case Congress think the measure necessary, the General Also mentions you as a good Officer &c.(2) This report of the Secretary at War was referred to a Committee who have not yet reported. The appointing Genl. Officers is by no means a popular Subject with Congress who think they have at present a Sufficient Number if properly employed.  General Parsons & Glover lately desired leave to retire for recovery of their health, until they might be able to perform their duty with a Suspension of pay during their absence. Upon taking their request into Consideration, Congress dismissed them altogether upon half pay;(3) this indeed was an alternative proposed by them. Those dismissions, especially Glovers, will probably hasten the report of the Committee, as there are now two vacancys in the Massachusets Line; but they know not what to say if Jersey is left out of the question and I can perceive they wish to have us forgot.  Congress is endeavouring to wipe of every Unnecessary expence both in the Army & Civil departments-a work attended with great difficulty. The want of money embarrasses every department.  When ever I can say any thing agreeable on the Subject I shall not fail Writing. I am Dear Sir, Your Obedt. servt.  Abra. Clark ""

  Sir, Philadelphia July 29th 1782 We had the Honor to Receive your Excellency's Letter of the 12th Instant with its Inclosure.(1) No further Provision has yet been made by Congress for Demolishing the Continental Bills at our Treasury, it has often been moved without Success, we shall move it at a Proper Time if thought advisable. JULY 29, 1782  Congress have just Passd an Ordinance Regulating the Commissaries of Prisoners which we hope will Expedite the Exchange of Naval as well as other Prisoners.(2)  A Plan is also in Agitation for a General Cartell which if settled According to Sir Guy Carletons Proposal to Exchange Seamen for Soldiers and that Soldiers so Exchanged shall not Serve against America within one year, will bring on a General Exchange, Congress has not given their Reply to the Above Proposal but will Probably Agree, with this Alteration, that those Soldiers Shall not Serve against the united S[t]ates or their Present or future Allies within that Time and further it will be Insisted on that the Ballance Due to the United States for Support of the Capitulants of Saratoga & York-Town be Adjusted & Paid.  The Approbation of Mr Smith as a Commissioner to settle the Accounts between the United States and ours will (we hope) be a Means of bringing those Accounts to a Satisfactory Close.(3)  An Ordinance for Regulating the Post Office of the United States is in Agitation and will Pass in a few Days by which some Present Inconveniences will be Removed and the Revenue arising from that Office Increased. The State of Maryland have Passd an Act Granting to the United States a Duty of five per Ct. on Importations &c so that the only States that Still Neglect are Rhode Island & Georgia and by their Means the Whole Measure is Retarded to the very Great Injury of the United States, who have no other Means to Pay the Interest of Monies Received on Loan; That of Bills on France being wholly Stoped.  The Continental Treasury is very low, not more than Twenty Thousand Dollars being yet Paid in all the States for the Expenditures of the Current Year, and unless the States Exert themselves in Collections the Most Distressing and Ruinous consequences must Ensue.  The Financers Notes and Bank Bills are in full Credit & Paid on Sight and are rather preferred to money by the Merchts. here and yet a Shameful Discount is Placed on them and large Speculations made by Traders in Distant States without Regard to Justice or Public Danger, Nothing will Prevent this evil but Regular and Effectual Provisions for taking up those Notes and Bills in Each State by the Collectors or Receivers of Taxes; in Exchange for hard Money & those notes be immediately delivered with the monies they may have Collected to the Treasury that the State may have the Credt of it with the united States.  It is mortifying to See Publications in all the Papers on the Continent that nothing has been Paid in Connecticut to the Receiver of Taxes. Might not Large Quantities of Salted Provisions on Hand have been Delivered to the Contractor for the Financers Notes and those Notes Negociated into the Hands of the Receiver of Taxes?

The order of the day being called for to fix the salary of the Comtt to be appointed, pursuant to a resolution of the 28 May last, to liquidate and finally settle the accounts of all the servants of the  JULY 29, 1782  United States who have been entrusted with the expenditure of public money in Europe, a motion was made by Mr Telfair for 4000 dollars per annum.  Mr Smith objected to the fixing any salary, that it was not a standing office, that when the service was performed a quantum meruit should be allowed, that it would make a material difference whether a person was sent from hence or one residing in Europe was appointed. Some objections was made by several members against settling the accounts in Europe whereupon a motion was made by Mr Montgomery seconded by Mr Lee to reconsider the resolution of 28 May. Question taken, passed in the affirmative.  Mr Ramsay moved to augment the number and instead of one to appoint 3 Comrs. Mr Bland was against the appointment altogether, thought the acct should be sent over and settled by the proper officers in the treasury, spoke of improper contracts being made & old arms sent over.  Mr Dyer was of the same opinion.  Mr Madison was for sending a person or persons to liquidate but not with power finally to settle the acct.  Mr Scott was of the same opinion-expatiated on the advantages of sending a person to examine vouchers on the spot, collect facts & evidences & give information; that instructions might be given in the way of a commission from chancery by which little would be left to discretion.  Mr Bland spoke again; concurred in sentiments with Mr Scott and moved to commit the resolution.  Mr Witherspoon spoke to the same effect and seconded the motion for committing.  Mr Telfair made a rambling speech.  Mr Lee spoke much of the necessity of investigating thoroughly the accts of merchants and people employed in France, mentioned the accounts offered to the comn in France by M. Monthieu, an acct in one line of so many suits of Cloaths, or so many shoes, blankets &c., but no invoices. And the most they could get from him was so many bales, casks &c but no acct of the contents of each, that it was necessary to examine persons at the ports of delivery relative to the quantity recd.  The Resolution was comd to Mr Scott to report the powers with which the Comtt should be invested, a draught of instructions to be given & to confer with the Superintendt of finance on the subject.(1) Reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 69-70.  1 For the context of this debate, the congressional resolution on this subject eventually adopted on November 18, and the instructions from the superintendent of finance to the commissioner appointed to settle such accounts, see JCC, 22:416, 421, 23:728-30, 77342; and Morris, Papers (Ferguson), 7:168-75.

  Sir, Philadelphia 30 July 1782. It being impracticable for a new member of Congress soon to comprehend our great national concernments & the views & purposes of Principal men in the various Departments and especially the complicated System of European Policy you will not expect such proffitable communications from me at present as are to be expected from my Colleague, who has every advantage to be derived from experience in military & political life. I shall, however, neglect no opportunity of transmitting every intelligence from time to time which may be in my power & affect the Interests of my constituents.  Eleven States have transmitted copies of their acts vesting Congress with a power to levy and collect a duty of 5 per Cent. on Imports & Prize goods; all of which acts are passed on the express condition that the measure shall be universally adopted throughout the United States and some of them have other conditions annexed;  JULY 30, 1782  Such as the following. That after a term of years it shall be in the power of the State to substitute some other revenue equally productive and which shall be approved of by Congress. That no part of the revenue shall ever be appropriated to the discharge of half-pay, pensions, &c. That the State retain a right of appointing, or suspending the Train of revenue officers, within its jurisdiction, &c. &c. Whereon I shall only observe that a reluctance against the measure appears from the mode of compliance therewith in some instances.  A Committee was lately appointed in Congress to enquire into the reasons why the other States had not complied with this recommendation before whom, on notice & request, the Delegates for the States of Georgia & R. I. & P. Ps (1) appeared to give Information.(2)  Having discovered on my arrival in this City that all the members of Congress, as well as the Inhabitants, were universally in favour of the Impost, and concluding that my single voice would be unavailing against the general current: I cautiously avoided entring unnecessarily into the discussion of the Subject, but being called on this occasion to assign the reasons which induced a delay on the part of my Constituents, a fair opportunity opened, I embraced it with pleasure, to lay before the Committee the following representations.  That the maritime Situation of our State peculiarly exposeth us to the attacks of an enemy in a time of War. By a coup de main an enemy may lay waste our Sea-port towns all around the Naragansett-bay, destroy our Navigation and plunder the whole treasure of our little State; in which sad Catastrophe the value of the State would be reduced to that of a County in the neighbouring States: and yet we should have no claim in virtue of any compact, or Stipulation, on the federal Union for a reimbursement. That in fact this had partially taken place; our State had been invaded & plundered, our Towns partly burnt, & partly torn down, & our Navigation reduced to a very low ebb-So that out of the ancient & once wealthy Town of New-Port, which in the year 1774 sent to Sea nearly 150 Sail, three only were at Sea in March 1782: WHEREFORE, if any substantial revenue could be derived from a duty on trade, this benefit ought in all right & justice, to belong solely & exclusively to the State in Compensation for losses already sustained, and as a Security against still more fatal evils to be apprehended in all future Wars. That this was the voice of nature, the voice of reason & the voice of Confederation, the Constitution of the Ud. Ss. which had in this particular, secured to us our Birthright, Viz, THE WHOLE, ENTIRE EMOLUMENTS OF OUR OWN TRADE. It was moreover represented-That, in fact, the measure in its present form tended to raise a revenue within our State & from the earnings of its Inhabitants to be carried to the general credit of the Ud. Ss.: In as much as, not only in the first instance, would the Merchant be compelled to pay the duty at all  events on Importation, which it might, or might not be in his power to Superadd to the price of his merchandize; but admitting the duty to be superadded, and the revenue to be wholly drawn out of the consumer, the first consequence would be an obvious inequality in respect to individuals, & the second a no less obvious inequality in respect to the Several States. And that our State would feel this grievance more sensibly than any other State in the Union, as consisting more of Merchants, manufacturers & tradesmen who are chiefly subsisted on imported goods and consuming a greater proportion of dutied articles would pay an unequal part of a revenue to be appropriated to the common benefit of the Union. Another consequence would be the rise of the prices of such articles of country produce as may be substituted in lieu of imported articles, which would no doubt continue to bear nearly their usual proportion to each other, & being drawn from our neighbouring States although by an Inland communication, they would thus in fact come charged with the five per Cent. duty, which would be pernicious to our intrests & increasingly so in all future time. And, moreover, that inland duties, imposed at the pleasure of our neighbours, on specific articles in addition to their prices thus unnaturally raised, (which by the way the Confederation authorised them to impose) and temporary Embargoes, the effects of which we had sorely felt during the State-bill, might lay us wholly at their mercy and precipitate our ruin; while, on the contrary, should trade remain unfettered with duties, & free to all the world, while our Ports continued open, supplies might be drawn from any part of the World, whereby we might be enabled to treat with our neighbours, however extensive their territory, or however overbearing their temporary insolence, upon terms of equality.  It was further represented-That it derogated from the Sovereignty & Independance of the State for the Ud. Ss. to draw a Revenue for their benefit out of our State & to collect it by their officers-For that all monies raised in a Sovereign State ought to pass to the credit of that Sovereignty exclusively; and all civil officers acting in a Sovereign State ought to be authorised by & accountable to that Sovereignty-the contrary being a Solecism in Politicks, and in this case injurious to the State.  That such was the State of mankind that the experience of ages evinced the extreme difficulty of collecting duties on trade. That this difficulty would be less should the duty proposed be laid on by the State for its own benefit and greater in the measure proposed. In the former case it would be the interest of every citizen to aid in the collecting with a view of lightening his own Tax thereby: in the latter, he would not only promote his own particular intrest by avoiding the duty in his own case, but the intrest of his State in   abetting others in the practice: Therefore it was not probable that the measure proposed was practicable, at least so as to afford any considerable net produce, after deducting the vast expences of the numerous officers necessary in the collecting & after management thereof.  That the term of its duration was exceptionable and precluded the State from the possibility of revoking their grant in any future Period, should experience prove it ever so unproffitable & ruinous.  That Congress were not to be accountable for the amount or expenditure of this revenue; but on the contrary it was to be absolutely at their disposal, during a term of time which would be wholly in their power. That perhaps it might really be the Intrest of the Ud. Ss. never to discharge all the debts contracted, and to be contracted during this War, and if so the duty, by the terms of the grant, was to remain to perpetuity.  That however safely this extraordinary, uncontroulable & unaccountable power might be granted to the present Congress, a change of times & of men-might bring forth abuses at present unthought of, and cause us to rue the fatal day when we so rashly devested ourselves & that irrevocably, of a power naturally inherent in the several States & guaranteed & secured to us in CONFEDERATION.  It was further represented-That the measure proposed in addition to all the evils aforsd. had an unpromissing aspect upon the morals of the Community at large, by multiplying oaths, by increasing temptations to perjury both in officers of the customs & in citizens, & by nourishing in idleness & Luxury a numerous train of Collectors, Comptrollers, Searchers, tide-waiters, Clerks, &c. &c. whereby the country would loose the benefit of their industry & incur the additional charge of their support & that not to create a revenue but only in order to throw taxation out of its present channel & to bring the weight thereof upon particular setts, or descriptions of men in the community to their great & lasting injury.  That it did not appear as yet in what manner Congress would enforce the Law proposed, whether prosecutions were to be commenced or penalties were to be recoverable in the common Courts of justice, or whether the Maritime Courts were to be impowered to have cognizance hereof & that the general plan for the execution of the Law might affect the propriety of making the grant in question.  That I had lately received pointed instructions to make urgent application to Congress in behalf of my Constituents for a participation in the vacant, or backlands, to which they claimed, for reasons the most substantive, a good right in common with their Sister States. That Congress had hitherto delayed to come to an ultimate decision hereon-And as some States pertinaciously persisted in claiming exclusive rights to sd lands: it was not to be expected that  our State would part with all the benefits of its maritime Situation untill some assurance could be obtained of a Participation in common with other States in the back lands, which ought to be considered as a continental acquisition & to be appropriated accordingly- but this was thrown out as a reason of the delay in question only conjecturally, not being so assigned in the instructions referred to.  After proposing the following alterations, Viz,  1st. That each State retain the power of chusing the officers of the revenue to be collected within its own jurisdiction.  2. That the revenue arising from this duty be carried to the credit of each State, wherein it shall be collected respectively, and deducted from their annual Quotas of continental requisitions. I withdrew, not a little mortified at having been opposed rather than seconded by my Colleague.  It ought also to be noted that on this occasion, the extraordinary exertions of our State during the whole contest, and on the opening of the present campaign in special were mentioned & not contested & added much weight to the afore going representations in behalf of the State, And that the Committee have not yet made their report which no doubt will produce a renewed application to the State: For the same reasons, which make it against our intrest, to make this grant, make it the intrest of the whole Union to solicit it, which you may expect will be done with the most unremitting importunity. After the part I have taken in this matter, which has been done with views the most disinterested, so far as I am personally concerned my Constituents will not expect any direct advice on the Subject, and knowing they possess integrity & abilities sufficient for the places they respectively fill, in all events, I shall always endeavour to reconcile myself to their determinations & govern rnyself by their instructions, however contrary to my private opinion.  A grand Committee for the support of public credit has lately been appointed in Congress, and I shall endeavour as one of that Committee to bring on a decision respecting the back-lands.(3) They would undoubtedly be a means in our hands of reviving public credit; they are of vast extent & value, beyond what is generally known or conjectured. A gentleman of no mean Talents in Finance thinks well of this plan, & that, in a course of time, they would enable us to discharge a great part of our national debt. So much in answer to the Instruction on that head referred to in your Excellencys Letter of 17 June last. The Commissioners appointed by the resolve of the 20 of February last are to liquidate and put on the list of the funded debt, which is to draw Intrest, all the Certificates issued on account of the Continent in the Several States. And it is proposed that in the Settlement to be made by the sd Commissioners the States have credit for their taxes of old money actually collected & paid in, & be charged with their deficiencies-but this   arrangement is not compleated, nor fixed as it would affect individuals in possession of sd Bills as I can yet discover.  The recommendation of Congress of Feby. 20 last for empowering them to settle the several States Quota's of expences incurred before Janry 1 1782, otherwise than by articles of the Confederation, has been formally rejected by an act of the Legislature of Virginia; whether they fear the deviation would be made against their intrest, or mean to procrastinate a Settlement, I shall not undertake to determine.  Several reductions in public expenditures have taken place since I have had the Honor of a Seat in Congress. (Economy is the present plan; the good work is begun, & going on, I perceive, can yet be done; & my exertions, such as they are, will not be wanting on this Subject. Could prompt pay be made to the army, many reductions might take place with propriety & without inconvenience. Is not this an object worthy our attention?  By a resolve of the 23 October 1780, the officers, who shall continue in the Service to the end of the War shall be entitled to halfpay during life; as well as those who are reduced by the resolve of the same day; & others deranged by other resolves & permitted to retire; whereby the Ud. Ss. are loaded with half-pay officers, even during the war, and that which was intended as an antidote against depreciation is continued, even now when the army is paid in hard money & having been originally intended as a motive to keep officers in the army, is now become a temptation for them to leave it. And what is still more extraordinary by another resolve, half-pay is to be made in all cases in proportion to full pay, so that a M.G. and B. Gl. draw their respective half pays, instead of the half-pay of a Colonel-against the universal custom in all European nations where there are half-pay establishments. A Major General & a Brigadier General lately applied to Congress for leave to retire on the half-pay establishment & obtained it,(4) and officers of inferior grades in the Line are daily retiring on half pay and others advanced to take their places, whereby we have duplicates & triplicates of officers in some instances and an enormous expence is incurred This in my opinion calls loudly on the Legislatures of the States either to provide Funds, in addition to the 5 per Cent, which will be insufficient, or to instruct their Delegates to discontinue the practice. I the rather wish for instructions on this head as I am so unhappy as to differ from my worthy Colleague on these points, tho' I do it with much diffidence & reluctance.  A report lies for Congress from the office of Finance recommending the 5 per Cent., a Land tax of one Dollar per hundred acres & a Capitation tax. From this report Congress have taken & recommended only the 5 per Cent.(5) QUERE-Would either of the other two be eligible?  July 31. This day the Grand Committee referred to above for reviving credit reported the expediency of taking up the Consideration of the cessions made by New-York, Connecticutt & Virginia so as ultimately to bring on a decision of Congress upon the Subject of the vacant Lands; a motion was made & seconded by me that next Wednesday be assigned for considering sd report.(6) The yeas & nays called & the question was lost by our States being divided. And so nothing is likely to be done about that part of your Excellencys Instructions.  Having already as I fear transgressed on your Patience I shall conclude this Letter in congratulating your Excellency on the acknowledgement of our Independance by the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands; this alliance, which we flatter ourselves is by this time completely formed, is natural and I cannot doubt will prove mutually beneficial to the parties.  Hoping to be excused for not having written before as well as for having written so much now I beg leave to assure your Excellency,  That I am, with every Sentiment of esteeme & deference, your Excellencys most obedient & most humble Servant,  David Howell P.S. Please to excuse inaccuracies this Letter is too long to transcribe. And Mr Morris has this moment sent me a note requesting the reasons in writing why our State has not complied with the recommendation for 5 per Cent. as he is about to write to the State on that Subject.(7)  ""

If any mail has failed to bear witness to my punctuality It has not been caused by any default in me. I am the more at a loss to account for such a miscarriage, as it does not appear that any outrage has been repeated on the post.(7) I shall notify the fact to the Post office here, and think it will not be amiss for you to urge an investigation upon the Post Master at Richmond.(8)  The letter inclosed in your favor of the 18th from Docr. Carter has been sent to the Auditors.(9) As far as my attention may be necessary, his case will recieve it.  A Capt. of an American Vessel is just come up with an account of the arrival of a French fleet off the capes of Chesapeak, with a body of Troops on board. Many persons are so sanguine as to expect that this armament is destined agst. New York, and that it will immediately possess itself of the Harbour of that place, before the arrival of a superior enemy can prevent it. Altho' the troops on board seem to favor such a conjecture, there are improbabilities which with me outweigh that circumstance.  I am not enabled to make any addition to the intelligence from the Netherlands conveyed in my last. You will find by the inclosed paper that a Vessel is arrived at Boston from France, which brings some loose accounts. Private letters tell us that Majr. Franks was a passenger in her. From him we shall probably receive further advices with respect to Europe in general, and ample ones from Madrid. I add to the paper of this morning two others of prior date which detail some interesting proceedings in the B. & I. Parliaments not published in the paper transmitted by last post. (10) Some paragraphs of the Courier de L'Europe contained in neither of them, make it very probable that the New Ministry have been feeling the pulse both of Dr. F. & the Ct. of France. We are very much surprised that none of these important transactions should yet have come officially either to Congress or to the Chevr. de la Luzerne.

  1782, July 30. A letter from the Secretary of War was read, (1) enclosing a list of promotions and appointments in the Connecticut line made by the Council of Safety of that State.  Mr Cornell observed that the promotions were made not only on account of death, desertion, and resignation, but also on account of officers retiring. That he understood it was become a custom among the officers of that line, when tired of the service, to withdraw from the army with the consent of their superior officers, and under the title of retiring officers to claim half pay for life & that thereupon others were promoted in their stead. That if this practice was allowed & the claim admitted, he saw nothing to prevent the State from putting every man in it on the half pay establishment & therefore objected to the granting Commissions.  Mr Dyer seemed to admit the custom, and justified it by observing that the same was practised in other States; other States did it in a hidden way, \""this return is honest, fair, plain, no disguise;\"" several spoke on the occasion and reprobated the practice.  A motion was made to commit.  Mr B. Huntington observed that some of the promotions and appointments were made on right principles, though others were on wrong, he therefore was for commitment, which was agreed to.  The Secretary of War having some days ago reported on a memorial of Webster and Judd, in behalf of the deranged officers of JULY 30,1782  Connecticut line, stating that the half pay to which they were entitled by the acts of Congress of the 3 and 21 Oct. 1780, was not paid, and praying Congress \""that such effectual and seasonable provision may be made as will comport with the aforesaid resolutions, relieve the distressed & answer the just expectation of the said officers,\""(2) and the report having been referred to Mr Cornell, Mr Montgomery, and Mr McKean, the Comtt reported the Congress should resolve That it was inexpedient to comply with the request of the memorialists. This was objected to, as improper. That it was not doing justice to Congress, nor would it satisfy the memorialists to ground the denial upon inexpediency. That it was out of the power of Congress to comply with the request, as the States had not furnished the necessary supplies of money; and therefore  Mr Duane moved to insert impracticable in lieu of inexpedient.  Mr Cornell and Mr Montgomery of the Comtt present, informed the house that the memorialists were sensible of the deranged state of the public finances and the inability of Congress to pay at present, and therefore only requested to have their accounts settled and Certificates given for the sums due, payable, with interest, at a future day; that the report was calculated to meet this request, which the Comtt thought it to be inexpedient to comply with till funds were granted for the purpose, this explanation not satisfying the house and the question for Mr Duane's amendment being lost, the report was postponed, and a motion was made by Mr Bland, seconded by Mr Lee, \""That the memorialists be informed it is not now in the power of Congress to make a general arrangement for liquidating and pay the half pay due to the reduced officers, and that it would be inexpedient to make a partial arrangement for that purpose.\""  This brought on a new debate, in the course of which Mr Clark expressed a doubt whether the States or Congress were bound by the Resolution granting half pay to the officers, as it had passed by the votes of only eight States, for though it passed before the articles of Confederation was finally ratified by all the States, yet being for the appropriation of money, and that to be made at a future day, and the votes of nine States being now necessary for that purpose, he doubted whether Congress or the States would agree to it, and therefore was against any new promises tending to confirm the former act; Mr Dyer & Mr Cornell were also against confirming the former acts by new engagements & mentioned that the Eastern States were opposed to the measure, and would not make grants to enable Congress to comply with the resolution.  Mr Dyer said that the State of Connecticut would agree to make some compensation to officers for past services and sufferings, nor would it object to the paying officers who retired under the act of 3 & 21 Oct., 1780, a sum equal to their half pay during the war, but   the State expected that all these pensions should cease as soon as the war was at an end.  Mr Madison combated the objection of Mr Clark; the doctrine it intended to establish was dangerous and if admitted would sap the foundation of a credit, and might be attended with the most ruinous consequences; that the States were as much bound by acts of Congress, which passed by a majority of votes, before the ratification of the Confederation as they would be now by the number of votes required by the Confederation: that on this rested the treaties and alliances already made and the instructions given to our ministers abroad to enter into other treaties and alliances; on this rested the money borrowed and the debts contracted, at home and abroad, for the payment of which the public faith was solemnly plighted & for which the States must provide funds, that the fixing of the pay of the army rests solely with Congress & that the States are bound to provide for what is stipulated and granted to the officers and men, whether to be paid then, at certain periods & in certain sums during service only, or while in service and for years or lives after the termination of the war; Mr Duane supported the argument of Mr Madison. Mr Root was for postponing the farther consideration of the subject, Mr Cornell was of the same opinion & thought the officers who were at home had the less reason to complain, as those in the field were not paid. Several other members spoke, at last an adjournment was called for & the house broke up without coming to a decision.(3)  Reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 70-73.  1 Not found.  2 For the July 17 memorial of William Judd and Pelatiah Webster and Benjamin Lincoln's July 23 letter on the petition, which were referred to committee on July 25, see PCC, item 19, 6:491-99; and JCC, 22:404, 418.  3 For the continuation of these proceedings, see Thomson's Notes of Debates, July 31, 1782.

  July 31-August 2? 1782](1) Some objections against passing an Impost Law, in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, briefly stated at the request of the Superintendent of Finance, by his humble servant D. Howell.  It is assumed that the usual mode of taxation draweth supplies from the people, proportionate to what they possess, and have defended by the public, and is therefore founded on the most obvious principles of justice. But the measure proposed would either draw a disproportionate supply from the merchant, as such, or from the consumers in general; if from the merchant, according to what he imports; if from the consumer, according to what he consumes. In either case, it would bear hard on the citizens of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, who both import and consume of important articles, a greater proportion than any other state. As the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations is subjected from its maritime situations to greater losses and risks in war, without any claim of reimbursement, therefore, in virtue of any compact or stipulation on the Federal Union; if any revenue can be raised from trade in the way proposed, or any other, the State is entitled to the exclusive benefit thereof, and that the amount annually passed to their credit, and be collected by officers of their own appointment, in common justice recognized in confederation. Should a duty be laid on imported goods the prices of such country produce as may be substituted in their room will be raised, (should said duty be superadded to the former prices of imported goods,) and preserve nearly their usual proportion thereto. These being drawn JULY 31, 1782  from neighboring states, will eventually come charged with a similar duty, and thus the neighboring states in particular, and the Union at large, will draw a substantial revenue out of the earnings and industry of the citizens of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Duties imposed directly on country produce, or inland embargoes by neighboring states, may in future put the inhabitants of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations on the necessity of subsisting themselves more, if not altogether, on imported goods, and increase the burdensome operations of the impost proposed. But while trade remains free to all the world and unfettered with duties, the State, though small, still remains independent.  So far from creating ways and means, or lightening our taxes, the measure proposed would incur the enormous additional charge of taking off from arts and industry a numerous train of men for the collection and after management of this revenue; and supporting them in comparative idleness only to shift the mode of raising supplies, and to throwing taxation into another channel to the lasting injury of certain descriptions of citizens.  After all this additional charge incurred, the revenue proposed would not be productive. It would be the interest of the merchant to avoid paying it, and the interest of the State to countenance him. Profanations of oaths and corruption in various forms would follow. No definite plan for the execution of the impost law has yet been promulgated. Whether penalties are to be recoverable or prosecutions commenced in the common or maritime courts, is not declared; and the operation of the law may be rendered more grievious by the mode of enforcing it.(2) The State wishes to preserve inviolate, Article 8th of the Confederation; and whenever their quota of continental requisitions shall be made agreeably thereto, to be permitted to raise it in their own way.(3)  N.B. The State is largely interested in Loan Office Certificates, and desirous of discharging interest and principal with honor.  MS not found; reprinted from Staples, Rhode Island, pp. 391-92.  1 Although undated, this document was clearly written between July 31, when Howell stated in a letter to William Greene that he had just received Robert Morris' request for a written explanation of Rhode Island's opposition to the impost, and August 2, when Morris inclosed Howell's statement in a letter to Greene. See Howell to William Greene, July 30-31, 1782; and Morris, Papers (Ferguson), 6:115, 123-26.  2 For the enforcement provisions of the draft impost ordinance then under consideration, see Morris, Papers (Ferguson), 6:683-84, 688-91.  3 Article 8 specified that state quotas would be set \""in proportion to the value of all land within each state, granted to or surveyed for any Person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon shall be estimated,\"" and that \""the taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the legislatures of the several states.\"" JCC, 19:217.

11023,dg018640,1782,Charles Thomson s Notes of Debates,"""Charles Thomson's Notes of Debates
  1782, July 31. A motion was made by Mr Root, seconded by Mr Condict,(1)  Whereas, Congress, by their resolution of 21 Oct. 1780, did in consideration of the merit and sufferings of the officers of the army grant to those who should continue in service to the end of the war or be deranged, in pursuance of the acts of 3 & 21 Oct, 1780, half pay for life;  And Whereas, Application is made by some of those officers for an adjustment of their half pay and Congress having no funds provided for discharging the same, resolved, that it be recommended to the several states to carry into effect the resolution of Congress of 21 Oct. 1780, granting half pay for life in regard to the officers in the lines of their respective states, and every state which shall settle with the officers belonging to their respective lines in regard to their half pay aforesaid and cause the United States to be exonerated therefrom shall be discharged from contributing any thing towards the half pay of officers in the line of any other state.  Mr Dyer opened the debate by observing that the resolution to grant half pay for life to the officers had occasioned more uneasiness in some of the States than any measure ever adopted by Congress. Some of the States it is true were for the measure. Pennsylvania had a similar provision for their officers before Congress passed the resolution. The States who were against granting half pay for life were not against making some compensation. The resolution proposed would satisfy the officers & the State & therefore he hoped it would be agreed to.  Mr Bland moved to amend the Resolution by striking out \""shall be discharged,\"" &c., to the end, in lieu thereof inserting \""shall be credited in their annual quota to the amount of the half pay of the officers settled with.\"" Mr Clymer seconds the amendment.  Mr Dyer against the amendment. It would not satisfy the States which objected to the half pay. They wanted to be discharged. They would settle with their own officers & satisfy them and then wanted to have done with it.  Mr Cornell was against both the motion and amendment; spoke against both.  Mr Witherspoon desires to know the difference between the original motion and the amendment, thinks the argument should be confined to shew that the motion is better without the amendment, or that the amendmt excels the motion as it stood.  Mr Bland explains that he meant by the amendment that the States should be jointly bound to the officers; but he had no objec- JULY 31, 1782  tion that every State which settled with its officers should have credit for the amount of their half pay.  Mr Madison. All charges of war are by the Confederation to be paid out of one treasury. The motion violates this article of the Confederation; the amdmt is more conformable to it; but still does not meet his approbation.  Mr Clark is against the amendment & in favour of the motion, supports the opinion he advanced yesterday that the States are not bound, distinguishes between Congress and the States, thinks Congress are bound to do every thing they can to carry their resolution into effect. The recommendation contained in the motion is all they can do. Is not against doing justice to the officers & if the resolution passes has no doubt but the States will do them justice.  Mr Telfair. Some of the States are not in a situation to do anything and their officers will be unprovided for; for \""his part he will be against the whole.\""  Mr Witherspoon is against the amendment, it does not make the proposition better, will not give greater security to the officers & will not satisfy the States which are averse to half pay for life. If the original motion operates to the disadvantage of any States it will be those who are in favour of it. But he reserves himself to speak to the motion when the question is taken on the amendt.  Mr Montgomery objects to the motion but if he thought it would pass he would be for the amendt. The motion with or without the amendt would not satisfy the officers. It had been hinted by the Comtt to the Memorialists yesterday and they objected to it with great warmth, said they were officers of the U. S. and not of any particular State, that they looked to Congress for their half pay and would think themselves deceived if referred to States which were opposed to it. That there were many officers of independent and separate corps which did not belong to the line of any State, who would not be provided for.  Mr Root. The original motion was confined to the line of the States, it left the general officers & those of independent & separate corps to be paid by congress and the States which settled with their own lines would be obliged to contribute their proportion to that expense, but he objected to the amendment because they would leave the matter as it now stood and expose them to provide for the lines of other States, which was what they wished to be discharged from. That they would satisfy the officers of their own line by making them a compensation at once. That the genius of their people would not brook the paying of annual pensions, that they could not bear to see men strutting about their streets in the port of masters who had a right to demand of the people a part of their annual labour & toil to support them in idleness. That they chose rather to pay their officers at once after the war and then see them   descend into the class of citizens. He had seen one of the Memorialists this morning; he will be satisfied.  Mr Bland supports his amendment, it is the only way to do equal justice to the officers and the States. Thinks it not worth while to answer the sophistical arguments against the power of Congress to make the grant and bind the States.  Mr. Ramsay. Against the whole measure, the States to the southward, particularly South Carolina and Georgia, from the circumstances of the war had more than their proportion of officers when the reform of the army took place in 1780, that it would be unjust that those States which had suffered the most by the war should be subjected to the payment of more than their proportion when it was over. That the war was for the common defence and the expenses should be borne by all according to their several abilities  The question on the amendment was called for and the yeas and nays required by Mr Clark-This brought up-  Mr Duane. This is a subject of too much importance to be decided in this hasty way, it requires deliberation. He is not prepared to give a vote. He wants time to deliberate and weigh the consequences. Will it satisfy the officers to deprive them of the guaranty of the U. S. & transfer them to individual States. Will the individual States be willing to undertake this. He does not know. Will any member undertake for them; they ought to be consulted. The war is not over. It may yet make a great change in the circumstances of particular States. Would it be just that officers who may have bled and suffered most should from the inability of their State occasioned by the calamity of war be in a worse situation than others with regard to their half pay. These are matters that require deliberation. He is not prepared to give an opinion.  Mr Clark maintains his opinion against the power of Congress, thinks that from the time articles of Confederation passed the rules by them established bound Congress though they were not binding upon the States until finally ratified. He has no objection against allowing time for deliberation.  Mr Montgomery & Mr Smith move to postpone the farther consideration of the subject; Mr Root attempts to alarm the fears of Congress by pointing out the dangers of postponing. Postponing the subject will be interpreted into a refusal; the army in the field are watching the conduct of Congress & will form a judgment by what is done for retiring officers, of what will be done for them when their arms are out of their hands. If they see justice done to those who have retired they confide in the promises & faith of Congress. But if they find them neglected or trifled with they will either quit the service immediately, or refuse to lay down their arms when the war is over until they have some better security. He thinks the measure was wrong at first. It was no part of the original  contract with the officers. It was an extraordinary and gratuitous emolument. But being promised they consider it as their right and that no time should be lost in giving them confident assurances that they will not be deprived of it.  Mr Duane laments that the measures of Congress however just and necessary at the time are unreservedly blamed by members who were not present when they were adopted or who do not recollect the circumstances which compelled the adopting them; is confident if any of those who now so freely condemn the resolution for granting half pay had been present at the time they would have given their assent. He could appeal to one as well satisfied and from his situation better able to judge than any other in the United States, he meant the Com. in chief, that without it the army could not have been kept together. He thought the measure right then, he thinks so still. It is a reward of military merit adopted by the wisest & finest nations of Europe. He is for complying with the promise made. But is not for giving a hasty opinion on the subject now before the house.  Mr Lowell moved to add to the motion for postponing \""till the first Wednesday in January next.\""  Mr Dyer against postponing for so long a time.  Mr Cornell not to be alarmed with the apprehensions of the army disbanding or refusing to lay down their arms when the war is over. He is acquainted with the officers; he never heard such intemperate language from any of them. They are men of judgment & consideration & citizens of the U.S. They have an interest in the prosperity of their Country. They are sensible of the embarrassed state of our finances and will not abandon their duty because every thing cannot be done for them at present that ought to be done. They will wait with patience till our affairs are in a better situation. He is for postponing till the time mentioned.  Question put and carried in the affirmative.(2) A Report was then made by a grand Comtt consisting of a member from each State who were appointed to consider & report the most effectual means of securing public credit, \""that it was their opinion Congress should come to a decision on the cessions made by Connecticut, New York & Virginia,\"" and a motion was made to assign a day for taking up the report.  Some of the members spoke against it, apprehending that the motion referred to the report of a Comtt on the cessions.  Mr Clark thought it involved questions which could not be decided till the war was over. He wanted to know where the land lay which was ceded; what right the states which had made the cession had to the land they ceded. That the boundaries of the several states should first be settled. He was against taking it in consideration now.  JULY, 1782  Mr Lowell wanted to know what right New York had to the lands she had ceded; that if any state had a right it must be Massachusetts, Connecticut & Virginia.  Mr Duane had no objection to go into an examination of the right of New York. He was prepared to enter on the subject & was furnished by his state with documents which he had laid before the grand Comtt and which would prove to the satisfaction of every impartial person the incontestable right of New York to the lands ceded.  Mr Dyer. Other states have not come so well prepared, it would therefore be improper and injurious to those states who claim the land ceded by New York to go into that matter now. The motion being explained and confined to the report from the grand Comtt.  Mr Jackson, objects to the consideration of it as a means to establish public credit. A good deal of conversation passed on the subject, at last the question was put and the yeas and nays being required by Mr Witherspoon it was lost, only six states being in the affirmative.(3)  Reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 73-80.  1 For the context of these proceedings, see Thomson's Notes of Debates, July 30, 1782.  2 For Congress' subsequent action on the memorial of the \""deranged officers\"" of Connecticut early in 1783, see JCC, 24:43, 153-54; and PCC, item 19, 6:501-8.  3 For this debate on the grand committee's recommendation \""that Congress decide upon the cessions from Connecticut, New York, and Virginia\"" as a means to establish the credit of the United States, and the vote on John Witherspoon's motion to take up the committee's report on Wednesday August 7 (which failed by a vote of 6 to 2, with 2 states divided and 3 unrepresented), see JCC, 22:423-24.

  Dr. Sir, Saturday Eveng. [July ? 1782] (1) I could not, till this day, obtain Answers to your Enquiries, respecting Colo. Hayne. You will, therefore, I hope, excuse the delay. Be pleased to receive them, inclosed. You may rest assured that the Information is true, & I hope it will be satisfactory.  I am, Sir, yr. most obedt. servt. J. Rutledge  E N C L O S U R E \""Queries. If Colo. Hayne, had he supposed himself on a Trial for Life, wd. have proved?  1st. That, when he went to Chas. Town, to submit to the British Commandt., he told him that he had borne Arms agst. them, from a Conviction of the Justice of the American Cause.  2. That the deplorable Situation of his Family, his Wife & Children JULY, 1782  Portrait of John Rutledge  then lying dangerously ill, & the Country wasted, had compelled him, for saving their Lives, to come to Chas. Town, to get a Physician, & procure Necessaries for the sick.  3. That he wd. submit to their Governmt., & take the Oath, but, must openly declare, that he shd. consider it as obligatory, only as long as their Protection shd. really be of Benefit to him; or, till the Americans shd. again get possession of the Country.  4. That this Protection was, again & again, annulled, by the British plundering him.  5. That the Americans had so far reconquered the Country, that all his Neighbours thought themselves obliged to declare for them, & insisted on his doing so.  6. That his Conduct, toward the British & their Adherents, had been remarkably benevolent.  Ansr. to 1, 2, & 3. Colo. Hayne did not go to Chas. Town, to submit to the British Comdt, but to procure a Physicn. & Necessaries for his Family, who were in the Condition abovementd-Colo. Balfour wd. not suffer him to return, unless he became a British Subject. He did not take an Oath of Allegiance, none was required of him, the Practice having been for those who applied for Protection, or requested to be admitted as British Subjects, to subscribe a declaration of Allegiance-This he did. Colo. Hayne told his Friends, that he made the declaration abovementd. to Colo. Balfour, with this Addition, that he never wd. bear Arms agst. the Americans. He also said that Mr. James Simpson, (Secretary to the Commissrs. for restoring Peace &c,) in behalf of the Commandt., assured him; that it was not expected that he shd. bear Arms agst. the Americans, nor adhere to the Allegiance which he promised, any longer than he shd. receive Protection. From a Confidence in Colo. Hayne's Veracity, the Publick beleive what he thus asserted, & it is supposed, that Simpson, Balfour, or some of the Officers of his Family, must have proved it, if they had been called for.  4. It is probable that this was the Case, as it corresponds with the Enemy's Conduct to others under similar Circumstances: but, We don't know that Colo. Hayne gave this as one of the reasons for his joining with his Countrymen.  5. There is no doubt of this-& many of Colo. Hayne's Neighbours might have been executed, with a much greater Appearance of Justice, than he was-for, several of them, after having voluntarily applied for Protection, & witht. making any Conditions, came, of their own Accord, & took up Arms with Us-But, our People, after having got possession of the Country below where Colo. Hayne resided, insisted that he shd. resume the Command which he formerly held of the Colleton County Regiment of Militia, &, if he had not done so, he wd., probably, have been brought off, & treated, as a Prisoner, perhaps harshly.  6. This is acknowledged by the Enemy, for Ld. Rawdon & Balfour extended the Time of Col. Hayne's Execution for this Reason-vide the Message delivd. by the Town-Major, amongst the Papers heretofore sent. Colo. Hayne was particularly careful, to restrain his Men from plundering, & Acts of Violence, on the Royalists-he treated all his Prisoners well-when he took Mr. Andw. Williamson, formerly a Militia-General, in our Service, but, who became a British Subject, he used him like a Gentleman, & immediately gave him his Parol to Charles-Town. Upon the whole the Reasons which Colo. Hayne thought justified his Conduct were-That his making a profession of Allegiance, to the British King, was, under the Circumstances above stated, an Act of Necessity-that he complied with the Terms stipulated, by a passive Deportment, untill the part of the Country in which he resided was recovered by the Americans, & his Neighbours were in Arms-that the British having withdrawn, or failed in, Protection, he no longer owed Allegiance-that he was not obliged to follow the Enemy into, & remain in, their Camps, or Garrison, in order to receive such a Kind of Protection as they could give only there-that it cd. not be expected that he shd. refuse to bear Arms with Us, at the Time he took 'em up, because, We wd. not suffer him to remain at Home in a State of Neutrality, but insisted that he shd. declare on one Side or the other. If for Us, that he shd. shew he was in Earnest-If against Us, his Person & Property were at our Mercy, & he could not, in that Case, have expected any Favour.\""  RC and enclosure (PPL: Logan-Dickinson Collection). In the hand of John Rutledge.  1 The date that this hand-delivered note and enclosure were written is highly conjectural. They concern events surrounding the execution in August 1781 of South Carolina militia colonel Isaac Hayne for taking arms against the enemy despite having accepted British protection following the reduction of Charleston. Both Congress and the southern commander threatened retaliation, for which see Thomas McKean to Nathanael Greene, September 21, 1781, and it was the latter threat that prompted debate of the Hayne case in the House of Lords in January and February 1782. It may have been the reprinting of excerpts from these debates in the Pennsylvania Journal of June 22, 1782, that piqued Dickinson's interest in the Hayne affair and prompted his inquiry soon after Rutledge returned to Congress (June 27) following his month-long absence as a congressional commissioner to the southern states. The Hayne case remained a topic of concern throughout the summer of 1782 and generous excerpts from the House of Lords debates were again reprinted in the Pennsylvania Packet of August 27, 29, 31, and September 5, 1782. It is also clear that Dickinson was preparing the enclosed queries and answers and other papers received from Rutledge (see the following entry) for publication. At the top of the enclosure Dickinson wrote \""Note on these words 'the Peculiar Circumstances of his Case'-first insert the Papers No. 1 to 7-with this Introduction 'Papers delivered by Colo. Hayne the day of his Execution to a Friend.\""' Moreover, on the final page of the enclosure Dickinson copied four extracts from Rutledge's brief letters printed here and in the   following entry and labelled them \""from a South Carolina Gentleman of the first Distinction,\"" to which he planned to append a \""Petition of the Ladies of Charlestown.\""  For further information on the Hayne affair, see David K.

 AUGUST 1, 1782  August 1. [1782] A plan for regulating the departments of the Adjutant General was taken into consideration & passed; the principal debate respecting it was on a paragraph for allowing the Adjutant General to draw four soldiers from the line as servants to wait on him. It was objected to by Mr Montgomery, Mr Scott, Mr Witherspoon and Mr Lee. Mr Cornell, Mr Bland & Mr Duane supported it. At length by a compromise the paragraph was struck out & the number of servants to be taken from the line by the Adj. Genl was left to be settled by a general regulation which should include the officers of the Army. (1) A motion was then made by Mr Lowell that Mr John Temple might be furnished with a copy of Mr Adams's Letter of 16th August 1781 respecting him, the letter being produced and read.(2) Mr Duane objected to the motion as improper. The letter was written to Congress by one of their ministers who declares he wrote it without the knowledge of Mr T___; it would tend to destroy confidential communications from ministers if copies of their letters were made public He had no objection against sending a copy to the Executive of Massachusetts who had ordered an enquiry into the conduct of Mr T___. Mr Lowell thought Mr T___ had a right to a copy. Mr Lee was of the same opinion. He blamed the conduct and resolution of Congress, said they had insinuated suspicions and drawn conclusions which that letter did not warrant, and therefore he ought to have it for his justification. He was personally acquainted with Mr Temple & knew him to be a warm friend to America & had suffered much for his attachment to it. Mr Madison denied that Congress had drawn any conclusions from that letter prejudicial to the character of Mr Temple. The jealousies and suspicions respecting him were grounded on his conduct which was notorious to an American. His coming from England in 1778 by the way of New York at the same time the Commissioners were sent. The person accompanying him, Doct Berkenhout, a known agent and emissary of the British ministry. His return to England without permission or notice given of his intention. The rumours and publications respecting his intercourse with the British ministry. His coming again to America at a very critical time. These were the circumstances on which the suspicions were grounded. And as it was understood that he sheltered himself under the cover of being the bearer of public dis- AUGUST 2, 1782  patches from Mr Adams & appealed to a letter written in his favour by Mr Adams, Congress related only simple facts; namely that the subject of the letters with which he was entrusted & those which Mr Adams sent at the same time by another conveyance evinced that he had not the full confidence of the minister & that Mr Adams Letter did not account for his past conduct and explain his future views. He appealed to the records of Congress and to the letter just read whether these were not facts truly stated. Mr T's conduct was at least mysterious. Congress acted properly. He was against granting him a copy of the letter, but had no objection to sending it to the Executive of Massachusetts. An adjournment was called for and no question taken.(3) MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 80-81. 1 For the evolution and adoption of these resolves, see JCC, 22:425-27; and Samuel Osgood to Henry Knox, September 17, 1782. 2 This John Adams letter to Congress, which was originally read November 12, 1781, is in PCC, item 84, 3:366-69. 3 No record of this debate is found in the journals, but for Congress' previous concern over John Temple's return to America, see John Hanson to John Hancock, March 1, 1782.

  August 2. [1782] A Letter from Mr Jay was read containing an account of his negotiations with the Spanish ministry from Oct. 3 1781 to April 28 1782, the date of the letter;(1) the delay, chicane & slight he met with and particularly his embarrassments on account of the bills drawn on him and the necessity he was at last under of protesting some of the bills for want of money. As soon as the letter was read-- Mr Rutledge moved that a Comtt be appointed to revise the instructions given to Mr Jay and report what alterations & additions if any should be made. This was seconded from every quarter of the house & a Comtt of five were chosen. Mr Lowell then moved that the Letter of Mr Jay of the 28th April and the instructions given to the ministers for negotiating a peace should be referred to the same Committee. Mr Madison called for a division. He approved the committing the letter but objected against the other part of the motion. It was a delicate subject and ought to be handled with caution & circumspection. The introducing it at this time would give ground to suspect that there was something in the letter which gave rise to it. That the Letter  AUGUST 3, 1782  contained new proof of the friendship of France. That if at the moment we were about to revise and alter the instructions respecting Spain a step was taken which might shew our want of confidence in France and give offence to that Court it might endanger our affairs.(2) Mr Lee had no objection against dividing the question but could not be easy nor think himself justified to his constituents until he brought forward the subject contained in the other part. He did not approve the present mode of bringing it on, it was too indirect. He had made a motion which was before the house on which he was determined to call the yeas & nays. He then inveighed against the instructions of the 15 June, 1781, as derogatory to the honor, dignity and independence of the United States, contrary to the treaties made with France & which must expose us to the contempt of our allies and all the nations of Europe. Mr Lowell thought this the most delicate way of introducing the subject & which he hoped would have met the sentiments of every member as well those who were in favour of as those who were against the instructions. That the subject must be debated, that the motion for referring them to a Committee with other matters did not involve the approbation or disapprobation of them by Congress & could give no offence. The Comtt might think it proper to adhere to them & make no report or if they judged it proper to make any alteration they would have time to deliberate on the mode and manner. Several other members spoke. On a division the question for committing the letter passed in the affirmative & the other part of the motion was put off by adjournment. MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 81-83.  1 For this lengthy letter and its reading in Congress this day, see PCC, item 89, fols. 379-440; Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 4:738-65; and JCC, 22:427-28.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 3 August 1782. Your kind Letter to Mr Webster,(1) I find, has induced him to think favourably of me as your Friend; I have been sundry times at his house, occasionally have dined with him & experienced every civility from him. I should no doubt have contracted a greater intimacy with him, entertaining a great opinion of his understanding & harmonizing with him in many points; but, Sir, he is the greatest stickler for the 5 per Cent I ever yet saw. And, no doubt, he will tell you that I am as  AUGUST 3, 1782  much against it. I have avoided entring into the argument fully even with him; and on many occasions declined it totally after simply giving my opinion, for I found it as vain for me to oppose the torrent here, as it was for General Varnum on Town-meeting day, when I saw him engaged in a circle, of which you made one, as you must remember in the Parade--And in both cases it would be as ineffectual for either of as it would be to oppose Pawtucket-falls. The public creditors, this way, rule the roost; and the common people have less & less to do in government after you pass the North-river till you get to Florida, which our wise men have given to the ungrateful Spaniard-- And where Tyrany is compleat. A wealthy farmer, and a good Whig, in the Jersies, could not tell me whether the people in the respective Counties choose their delegates in Congress as they do the members of their general Assembly & Council; or, whether they were chosen by the joint voice of both Houses:(2) In short, as you go Southward, Government verges towards Aristocracy. In New-England alone have we pure & unmixed Democracy & in Rhode Island & P[rovidence] P[lantation]s is it in its Perfection. I hope it may be long preserved. Should our little State have the credit of preventing the 5 per Cent from taking effect it would be to us an additional gem.  I find a field sufficiently extensive for the exertion of every faculty I possess, nay more if I had them; Business to me entirely new daily arises, and such a variety of objects are presented that I am ready to admire what I have been doing all my days not to have turned my attention to them heretofore. But the truth is--the course of my Studies & thoughts has heretofore been confined to books, Systems & Speculations; I am now concerned with life itself. I think I shall not be of the Service I expected to be to the State soon; I have much to learn--I am about it; I loose no time.  The establishment of funds to discharge, at least the interest of the national debt; and thereby, the revival of national credit, are the great objects before us at present. Fighting has grown out of fashion--little more of that is to be expected in this Country--but when we shall have peace God only knows; although there are appearances of it, and they seem to encrease & brighten; it may however be distant. The back-lands are a subject of conversation & which has been lately before Congress. There are two different opinions respecting them in Congress: six States are for acting upon them now, &, I think three against it, & two divided, one of which is ours.(3) Pray give me your opinion, or does it accord with our late instructions on that head?  We expected the States who hold up extravagant claims to the westward, might have been prevailed upon to have made liberal cessions to the Ud. Ss. after the example of New-York &, Connecticutt; but after the war is at an end and those lands shall have become more valuable, will they not prosecute their claims with more vigour? Now is   the time to settle this matter, lest, after the war fresh flames should be rekindled in a dispute, which will then be considered of more consequence. I am not for selling the lands, but should the Ud. Ss. hold such a vast territory by cessions from the respective States, it would certainly give them credit to the amount of their value, and would in time contribute to the discharge of our national debt. The States are extending their Settlements & claims daily. The lands will more & more be taken up by individuals & their claims will increase & gather strength and eventually defeat any future advantage to the Continent at large.  Requesting you to make my best respects acceptable to Mrs Arnold, your Brother Thomas & all Friends, I am, Sir, with every Sentiment of esteem Your Friend & hble Servt, David Howell. ""

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 3 August 1782. Had leisure permitted me to follow the dictates of inclination, and could I have been so vain as to have imagined that a line from me would have contributed either to your instruction or amusement, I should not have remained so long silent. The favours received from yourself and kind family, justly entitle you to rank, were that desirable, among the foremost of my friends & give you the most perfect claim to my best services.  Although I have written several Letters to those whom I used to esteeme my friends in Providence, I have received but few answers. I have written twice to your Brother John & three times to Governor Bowen,(2) but received no answer. What I have done to be thus deserted by my friends I am yet to learn; pleasanter would it be to return to my former retirement, where I was perfectly contented to  AUGUST 3, 1782  remain, than to have been brought out on the public Theatre at the expence of the loss of all my friends. Through divine goodness & a strict regimen of diet I have enjoyed a perfect State of health, excepting a cold for a few days past, ever since I left home. Even my old complaint in my throat is so removed as to give me no inconvenience.  Mr Ustic, as you must, no doubt have heard has arrived safe with his family in this City; he was well received, & as far as I can learn, is generally approved of & esteemed. But I have little intercourse with the people in the City, finding enough to do in the line of my immediate duty--To discharge which with advantage will require no small additional knowledge.  Mr Hewes is perfectly friendly, has invited me to his Lodging. Mr James Pemberton has shewn me the same respect, but I have not yet waited on them.  Providing funds to discharge at least the intrest of our national debt, & thereby reviving public credit is now the object of pursuit, & subject of much deliberation both in Congress & among our City-politicians, to participate in whose deliberations I sometimes stop a moment at the Coffee-house.  By examining the journals of Congress, in the hands of Governor Bowen you will observe what has been done about the back lands; I wish for your opinion on the Subject after you shall have obtained knowledge of what has been done in regard to them.  Much is said about a peace, the papers will inform you of all public intelligence here; You know we have commissioners in Europe with full powers to negotiate. Britain wants a peace but I fear is not humbled sufficiently to accept such terms as will be offered. Matters go as well in Holland as they do ill [in] Spain. Little is to be expected speedily from the Court of Madrid, according to the latest intelligence from our Minister there 28 April last: But a late private letter gives us hopes notwithstanding that the haughty Spaniard will open his eyes to his Intrest.  The Summer has been cool & dry. I hear not but it is as healthy here as usual. Dr Binney is very friendly--his family well. I shall soon take lodgings with other Delegates at a Boarding-house; I find an inconvenience in being so much alone.  Please to give my best regards to Mrs Brown, my old & good friend, to your mother, Mrs Van Derlight & all friends; & believe me to be your Friend, D. Howell. ""

  Dear Sir Phila 3d Augst 1782 I've not been unmindfull of my promise to you, to write you from this place after my Arrival--but really having had nothing worth your notice, I have considered it as no breach of Promise to omit troubling you with my impertinent Scrawls--your quondam Friends here have asked me how you do, & many have enquired if you are not coming on--how do Affairs stand with respect to you at home? has there been any further progress in taking up your Memorial or Remonstrance? I wish that it was settled & that I could see you here before I go. If you do come, let it be as early in the Fall as possible--for I think that I shall return in Novr. Is not Mr Sumner coming soon?(1) Mr. Osgood threatens leaving us before Novr and I am sure in addition to the State's being unrepresented if I am left alone, I shall be but a poor Support to its Interests, for want of a more thorough knowledge of their internal Politics, having been out of that Line these several  AUGUST 3, 1782  years, even were my Abilities otherwise equal to my Inclination to serve them. If the Representation of the States in Congress has generally been as good, as it now appears to be, I shall begin to think that it has not been for want of capable Men & in general honest ones that our public Affairs have not been better directed, but that it has been the Misfortune of our Situation & the difficulty of the Times. Still I can't give up an opinion that I once advanced to you, but which you was unwilling to allow, that very early Taxation, & that gradually increased with the smallest possible Use of Paper Credit, would not only have kept our Affairs under much more Controul, but would have been as practicable as any thing else, had our early Politicians but thought so. Certainly nine Evils in ten we now feel or have felt thro' out the War may be traced up to the corrupt Source of Paper Credit. I am not grown Politician enough yet to beleive but that the Honesty & the oeconomy which is best for the Individual is best also for the Body politic--and that there are very few Instances if any, where an Aberration from the Line of Rectitude, or what common Consent supposes to be so, is best for the Public--in none perhaps for the Individual--for tho' it may be difficult in all cases to draw the exact line between Right & Wrong, & as Pope says it may sometimes be as difficult to agree upon the Extreme of Vice, as to agree where the North is, whether at the Tweed--Oreads, Nova Zembla or where--yet the Individual is seldom without that inward Sense or by whatever name you will call it, that shall produce Conviction sufficient to determine his Actions to the right side, if he will be resolute enough to keep himself cool & dispassionate. Among the innumerable Evils resulting from an ill-managed paper Credit, it has not been one of the least that the bulk of the People have contracted a great disrespect for our Politics & consequently for the Managers of 'em & that has produced a Languor in all Departments, which prudent vigourous management only, & that for a length of Time, will serve to dispel. I can't but already observe in our great Assembly here, a Malady which I beleive almost every Man brings with him from the smaller Assemblies, & which I take to be the Curse of our Republican Governments thro' out the Continent--what I mean is a Willingness to spend too much time & altercation about trifling Matters, & about the trifling parts of more important ones, & too great a Readiness to admit Matters of small Moment to come before them, instead of referring them always to their proper Boards, & where none such are established, establishing others for the purpose. These small & constant Attentions are too apt to occupy the genera1 Mind of this public Body & perhaps in some measure debilitate it for the Consideration of higher Objects which only ought to engross it. These are too apt to be crouded on & passed by, it becoming too habitual to treat them in the same manner with the smaller ones. I suspect too that there is   another Disease here in common with the lower Assemblies, & perhaps from the same Cause--that when Business crouds, matters of considerable moment, but not the most pressing, are too apt to be laid by, & afterwards forgot, perhaps by the frequent change of Faces, which I find to be common among the Gentn who live in this & the neighbouring States. Perhaps the too frequent change of Members from the more distant States, & perhaps from mere forgetfullness of the Members in general, as the habit is natura1 for each to think at the time, it is no more his Business than another's, & therefore they take no more than a 20th, a 50th, or 100th part of the Burden of Memory & in the same proportion the Reproach of Neglect of Duty. I am sensible it is too much my fault to refine, as well as to find fault--but I have always uniformly thought since I first sat in a popular Assembly that no one ever ought to be without a Revisor, Supervisor, or by whatever name you please to call him, whose Business it should be to keep his Eye constantly upon the Course of Business done & the Neglects of what ought to be, by being conversant with all their Papers & Transactions--& who should recommend at least every week in their Session the Train of Business to be taken up, as I suppose it would not do to direct in our popular independent Assemblies--& who should be accountable & even impeachable if any Matters of Moment were neglected in the least for want of his Attention or frequently recommending them to the Consideration of the Assembly. The Constituents of every public Assembly upon the Continent could afford to pay such an Officer the best Salary they give to any of their Servants, as he would save much time Spent by their respective Delegates on unimportant affairs, & would correct their frequent Neglect of many important ones in the proper Season of 'em--for our public Bodies are too much like a lazy Merchant who does not do his Business in the proper Season of it, but leaves his Business to do itself, by which he is constantly hurried & never has a clear view of his Affairs.  But I am taking up too much of your time as well spending too much of my own just at present having a number of other Letters to write by Mr Lowell, who goes Tomorrow & is the Bearer of this; & to whom I must refer you, for several reasons, tho' one will be sufficient, that he knows much more of them. I say to him you must apply for the internal Politics of our Cabinet--& these I believe may soon be displayed as far as they are communicable. I shall also by him send your Journals as you directed if he can give 'em room--(2) if not shall bring 'em myself & wish now I had taken your Advice to leave 'em for I could get no Oppy to read them on the road & very little time have I been able to, since being here.  I shall expect to hear from you soon & as Letters from distant Friends are always agreeable & in some measure in proportion to their length, I shall wish you to deal out measure for measure tho' in   that case the advantage will undoubtedly be on my side--as Things of the same length may be very different as to fineness.

  Dear Sir, Phila. 3d Augst. 1782. I have wrote you once, & I think twice,(1) since my Departure, but have not had the pleasure of receiving a single Line from you.

Ever since I've been here I've been watching an oppy to comply with your request in imparting what was communicable, & by it to gratify you & your Friends but really nothing has turned up worth Communication. Brother Lowell is the Bearer of this & is much better informed than I shall be in a month or two more, of the State of Politics in the grand Council & what is impartable. Be assured their Secrets are few & but small. I inclose you this days paper--but I believe it has nothing new. The French Fleet arrived off Chesapeak, there are various Reports about--some, that they are bound to the Southward, some to the Northward for Repairs, Time will show. Don't Affairs look approaching towards a Peace? It appears to me they do, from the general situation of Things in Europe, as stated from thence by the last Arrivals. How does my good Boy conduct? to general acceptation? If I can get time I shall inclose him a short Note--but whether I do or not, please for me to observe to him that I have not received from him a single line since my departure. His Mamma as well as myself enjoy fine Health--tho' she eats no Meat and scarcely any Breakfast yet. We have not been able to get an House in the Country & the weather has been so cool we have not needed it --neither have we got one in the City yet to our mind. As Mr Lowell  AUGUST 3, 1782  is the Bearer of this, to him I refer for everything you can ask. I shall be disappointed if I do not soon hear from you.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Augst. 5th. 1782. The Letter which you did me the favour to write on the 5th Ultimo(1) I receiv' d on the 22d. What will be done respectg. Vermont affairs I cannot Say, I Suppose under present Circumstances it would not be possible to have any thing determined in Congress respecting them. I am well informed that one reason given (in private by some Gentlemen from the Southward) why they would not make them a Seperate State is because it would be adding One more to the Votes of the Eastern States, which they Say they will not do untill they can add one to the Southern likewise. I need not Comment on this. I am Sensible while the Vermont business remains undetermined N.H. will be in an Unhappy Situation. I am Informed by the New York Delegates that their State has lately (in Consequence of repeated Applications) granted a Number of Commissions to people in the County of Cumberland which I think Joins on the River. A Member of Congress from New Engld. with whom I am Intimately acquainted, (2) this day Shew me Copy of a letter which he was going to Send to a Gentn. of high rank in the State to which he belonged & in answer to One he had recd. Urging that Vermont might be made a Seperate State, in which he Says, \""I am fully Convinced of the Justice & policy of making them a Seperate State, but it is as likely that Great Britain will Cede Scotland to the United States as that the present Congress will make Vermont an Independant State.\"" I wish N. H. may not be again Duped In this affair. I Enclose you a list of officers &c. by which you will See how great a Number of Officers some States have, who have but few pri- AUGUST 5, 1782  vates--and yet in some Instances those States who have so few men have (not long Since) made a large number of Officers to fill up Vacancies.(3) There is now a Resolution of Congress against Issueing new Commissions.(4) Please to keep the Inclosed list in some measure Secret (I do not mean from the Commte.) but would not wish to have it made too public. It is Evident that our Minister at the Court of Madrid has recd. dishonourable & Fallacious Treatment, from that Court. Congress have this affair now under Consideration (5) what will be done I cannott Say but when I consider the Conduct of that Court & the Terms heretofore assented to on our part as the Basis of Treaty I really wish a Treaty with them may not take place, but from some Information (later than Mr. Jay' s tho not Official) it is probable they have altered their Conduct & perhaps have before this Concluded a Treaty. It seems to be agreed that Spain have decided Intentions of obtaining Gibralter and that they wish the present War may Continue. The Subject of former Instructions to our Commissrs. respecting a Treaty of peace &c. will I Imagine be taken up in a few Days, It is Important but what can be done where so much has been undone I cannot Say. In my letter to you of the 9th Ultimo. I wrote something respecting Loan Office Certificates, this business is in the Same Situation it was when I then wrote you. I will Venture to Say to you one thing, which is if N.H. does not adopt a System of Policy for her Self she will probably be left in the Rear. I am Sorry to Say that it is my Opinion their is not a probability of the accounts between the Several States being adjusted for a long time. I find it is very Expensive living here, beef has been frequently sold for 16d per pound, butter at 3/. Though these articles are much higher than things in general yet almost Every article is Dear. I Shall want some money by the first of September but know not how I am to be furnished, if you will Inform me I Shall be thereby obliged. Their is Eleven States now represented in Congress & would be 12 but one of the Delegates of Maryland went home a few Days ago, it is Expected he will return Immediately.6 Thus have I almost filled up my paper & I am afraid you will think unprofitably, I should be glad to give you more of facts & less of Opinions, but for want of the one I adopt the Other. I Shall be glad to hear from you frequently  I am with much Esteem your Hum Servt, J T. Gilman P.S.

  Sir, Philada. Augst. 5th. 1782 By Mr. Lowell who sets out for Boston this day I am favoured with an Oppty of writeing you. A few days Since a large Packett was receiv'd from Mr. Jay, our Minister at the Court of Madrid Dated April 28th. It Contained Copies of Sundry Letters, Memorials &c. to the Minister of that Court &c., Detailed his Applications & Transactions there, & informed that no material advances had been lately made towards a Treaty. Later Accounts from Europe seem in General to be very favourable to our Cause, though we have none Officially of later date than the above. It is generally believed that our Enemy are in Earnest for a General Peace, and it is said have Commissrs. now in France for this purpose, some Gentlemen here are so Sanguine as to Say we Shall have peace within a few Months, but I am not of this number--are in Daily Expectation of having some important accounts from Europe. Our affairs in the United Provinces are undoubtedly in a good Situation. A French Fleet Consisting of Thirteen sail of the Line & Some Frigates arrived on this Coast a few days past, I cannot Say any thing Respecting their destination. Have not any late Official accounts from the Southern Army, but believe their is no doubt but that the Enemy have Evacuated Savannah, and their is great probability that they will soon leave Charlestown. Congress have now under Consideration sundry Reports for Lessening the Expences of our Army by reduceing the number of Officers &c., we have now in full pay more than double the number which is necessary, but, (from a Variety of Causes) it is hard work to make those deductions. I Inclose you a Copy of Resolution of the Legislature of Virginia, passed in Consequence of the Recommendation of Congress of the 20th Feby. last, it needs no Comment.(1) In my Letter of the 17th Ultimo I wrote you respecting the States making a Settlement with the Contl. Troops of their Line for the years 1780 & 1781. In addition to what I then wrote I would Just Say that I cannott find any Resolutions of Congress requiring it--that if New Hampshire gives Notes for the Sums due, & the Lines of other States should have their settlement made here the Consequence will probably be that N.H. must Redeem her own obligations given for this purpose, & that those which are Settled here will be paid out of Some public Funds of which N.H. must Contribute her part, I cannott Say  AUGUST 5, 1782  this will be the Case but to me it appears probable. I am Sensible that New Hamp. can bring this into the account against the United States, but from present appearances I am Inclined to think a very Considerable Period of time will Elapse before those Settlements are made. I am aware that some settlements have been already made in the State with officers &c. but perhaps the proportion when Compared with those which are Unsettled, is small. I would not wish this to the Injury of the N.H. Line, but it appears by Lt. Blanchard' s representation, that it would be much more agreeable to them, to have the settlement made here as they could then have their Subsistence Money Settled at the Same time.  I have the Honour to be, Your most Obedt Servt.  John Taylor Gilman ""

  Dear Sir Phla. Aug. 5th. 1782 {Frank(1) has arrived}(2) with {a long letter from Jay}(3) being a {sequel of}, the {insulting} de{lays} d{isappointments} and {tergi}ver{sations which form} the {history of} his {mission}. To make our {mortificati}on {complete he} was {finally suffered} to {protest t}he {bills} of Congress, {tho t}he {amount did} not {exceed twenty} five thousand {ster--g}. The {blame of this seemed} justly to {fall} in {part on France} who probably meant to make that {display of her importance} to the {U. S}. This circumstance with some other {passages} in {Jays letter} which cannot be here recited, were {fresh leaven to} the an{tigallic ferment} and {revived the motion} lately mentioned to you.(4) It {was again susp}end{ed by} an {adjournment} but will be {renewed and pressed} to a {decision}. From the {present temper} of {Congress} I infer that the {decision} if not {reversive} of the {power given to France} in the {negotiation of peace} will {denote such} a degree of {discontent and distrust as} will greatly {impair the confidence} on the {side of our ally} and  AUGUST 5, 1872  may {if discovered inspire} the {enemy with new hopes} from a {protraction of the war}. It is very probable that this {affair will} eventually be {adjusted on} some {middle ground}. The {venom against France} will not be {assuaged} with{out some} such {expedient}.  We are still without official information both from Mr. Adams, relative to the negociations with the States General, & from Docr. Franklin relative to advances made by the British Ct. at Versailles towards a general negociation. That such advances have been made may be inferred not only from private reports, but from repeated paragraphs in European papers. Whether they be sincere or insidious may be another question.  Augst. 6th. A letter of the 14th of May has come to hand from Mr. {Jay} in which he says that he is {called to Paris by doctor Franklin}.(5) This {call can only be in his} capacity of {minister for peace} and in consequence of a {prospect if not commencement of negotiations}. He says nothing on the subject himself, but refers to {intelligence} which he takes for granted would previously {arrive} from {Paris}. He congratulates Mr. Liv{ingston on the acknowlegement} of our {independence} by the {United Provinces}. This is the first official evidence of that event.  The Committee as a member of which you prepared a certain report was yesterday {augmented to five and filled up}. The present composition {of it promises a speedy and favorable report}.(6) The {middle states are} rendered apparently very {ductile} by {their fears} of a {coalition between the eastern and southern in a change} of {the instructions for peace}.  Mr. {Montgomery} has given {notice to Congress} of his {intention to call for the report} on the {case of Vermont and to} lay before them such {information as he has acquired}.(7)  The French squadron which lately appeared off the Capes of Chesepeak are now off those of Delaware. The Ultimate destination of it is only a subject of conjecture. There is I believe {no reason to expect more than en passant advantages from it}. In several of my late letters both to you & Mr. Ambler I have, intimated the necessity of some {pecuniary remittances} and asked your friendly attention to that subject. Will you give me leave to repeat this request?  Mr. Jones' s letter by yesterday's post (8) informs me of his purpose of visiting Philada. forthwith. Besides the pleasure I take in gratifying you with every interesting communication I must own that some of the particulars mentioned above are meant to hasten if possible a like purpose in yourself.

  Monday, August 5th. [1782] The superintendant of finances sent in a long letter which was read,(1) stating the necessity and advantage of borrowing money towards the current expences of the war; the impossibility of doing this or establishing public credit without solid funds for the payment of the interest of the money already borrowed as well as of what may be wanted in future, pointing out three funds in addition to the 5 per cent on imports & prizes, 1 a tax of a dollar per 100 acres on all land; 2 a poll tax of a dollar per head on all males, paupers & soldiers excepted, above & under;(2) 3 an excise on spirituous liquors, which with the impost duty he estimates may amount to 2 millions of Dollars. He then obviates the objection that may be raised against granting these funds, warns Congress against placing any immediate dependence on back lands, & concludes with an estimate of the debt already contracted & an earnest exhortation to come to some speedy decision. Another letter from the superintendant was read enclosing estimates of the supplies wanted for the year 1783, amounting to eleven millions of Dollars, viz--(3) AUGUST 5, 1782  For the War Department 8,106,648.10 For the Marine Department 2,500,000.00 Civil List 181,214.38 Contingencies 212,137.42 11,000,000.00 Out of these estimates by proper arrangements which he hopes will take place he apprehends there may be a saving to the amount of two millions: and therefore he proposes only to call for 9 millions, and if the funds pointed out in the foregoing Letter be granted or others equally productive he proposes that of this 9 millions four should be borrowed and five raised by taxes within the year. He states the necessity of attending to the navy & presses an early decision on these matters. These two letters with the papers enclosed were referred to a grand Comtt appointed on the 22 July.(4) Some private business was then dispatched after which  Mr Bland moved--\""That the instructions given on the 15 June 1781 to the Comtt [i.e., Commissioners] for negotiating a treaty of peace be reconsidered & committed.(5) This was seconded by Mr Jackson, but as the day was too far spent it was agreed that the discussion of the subject should be deferred till next day & an adjournment was called for and agreed to.

  Sir, Philada. 6 Augt. 1782.(1) It is but natural to suppose it will be agreeable to you to hear from an acquaintance & friend tho' engaged in a matter abhorrent from your principles of faith (2) as a Christian, I mean in prosecuting the affairs of war; The end you know, Sir, that all reasonable men profess to aim at by war is peace; I have your concurrence therefore in the end tho we may differ about the means.  Although I believe it is beyond a doubt that Britain has made some advances towards a negotiation yet it is to be feared that the pride & lust of domination which on her part first originated the present war is not yet so debased & eradicated as to permit her to accept of such terms as will be offered her. By the latest accounts from our Minister at Madrid he was going to Paris (3) and I should not be surprized to hear that all our Plenipotentiaries had a meeting there or elsewhere. The new Ministry of the British Court have laid aside all Ideas of a separate peace with any of the powers combined against them. A general pacification, or a continuation of the war is to be expected. I have reason to acknowledge with gratitude to the being in whom we live, the continuation of his goodness in preserving me, so contrary to my fears, in a perfect State of health ever since I left home, except- AUGUST 6, 1782  ing a cold for a few days. To this no doubt the strict regimen of diet, which I have prescribed to myself, has not a little contributed. I have lost flesh--but have not even been troubled with my old complaint in my throat. Such a rapid succession of new business of various kinds has continually passed through my mind that hitherto I have had little time for amusement or visiting my friends. When the business of my place shall be familiarised I promise myself more leisure.  My mind is at times deeply oppressed with the weight of public affairs. You know I always was subject to be low Spirited. I feel so much of it at times now as utterly disqualifies me for all business.  The vanity to which I am subject when in full spirits, adds poignancy to my reflections at such times, and having no particular friend here to whom my difficulties are known to converse freely with, I am the more overcome. Never did tears flow more freely from my eyes than since I have been in this City.  I write to you thus freely not to give you trouble but to ease my own mind, which even now feels relief. So much does our make delight in Society. I undertook my present business, I can say with the greatest truth & sincerity to serve the people & the cause of real Liberty, and as disinterestedly as I ever did, or expect to undertake any thing in life: But I fear it will not be in my power to do much; no exertions I can make shall be wanting, however little their success may be. For your kind attention to my concerns at [. . .] (4) you will be pleased to accept my warmest ackn[owledgment].  Sometime last fall I spoke to Mr Borden [about] the price of the old house which belonged to my [. . .] Father. Should you see him, as it will soon [fall] into his hands, & he said he intended to sell [it] as soon as he could, I wish you would let him [know] that I have still a mind to buy it should the [price] & terms of payment suit, & wish you to write [them] to me.

  Dear friend, Philadelphia Augt. 6th. 1782 As I was in Virginia when Mr. Lowell arrivd here, it was some time before I receivd your favor by him. It gives me a good deal of concern that we are so soon to lose that Gentleman, his integrity & abilities rendering him an ornament to Congress. Every thing from England seems to announce a real disposition to peace. But it is very surprising that by six or seven opportunities from France, we have not receivd a line from our Minister. Not even by Major Franks, who came as a special Messenger. And what is yet more astonishing, we have not a word from Mr. Adams relative to the late important proceedings in Holland. I am apprehensive, his Dispatches were sent, thro France; & were stopt there. This profound silence on subjects so very interesting together with the perilous & humiliating situation we are in touching the negociation for Peace, I own alarm me. I am very much inclind to think that France will be for protracting the war, or for turning the cheif advantages of it to herself & to Spain. Mr. Jay' s last Letter suggest strong suspicions of that Court, & we have put ourselves shamefully & entirely in her power as to the conditions of Peace.  Spain appears to have been acting a part as silly as it is selfish; & to be covering the weakness of her Councils, by the insincerity of her conduct. Some spirited measures will be taken respecting that Court; merely because bravado in one instance, is some consolation for servility in another. For our interests seem out of the question in that quarter, She being no ways desirous of treating with us.  I am of a Committee appointed to inspect the department of Mr. Morris.(1) Mr. Duane is the Chairman. Such a choice seemd to point out that Congress did not mean the inspection shoud be productive of public good. Nor have I any reason to think it will. All the Monies of the U. S. ought to go into the Treasury, & be issued from thence, the Treasurer being a chosen & sworn Officer & giving security for his fidelity. Mr. Morris has began to deviate from this line by putting half the monies of the Public into the hands of his qoundam Clerk, (2) where he may not only have a more certain use of them for his private purposes, but be coverd in every thing he does. Shoud this maneuvre pass muster, the whole will soon go into the same channel, & the Institution & checks of a Treasury be rendered entirely useless. I am apprehensive that it will not only pass uncorrected, but receive the collateral approbation of an allowance to this Swanwick for his services. The accumulation of Offices in this man, the number of valuable appointments in his gift, the absolute controul given him over all the Revenue officers, his money, & his art; render him a most dangerous man to the Liberty of this Country, as his excessive avarice does to the trea- AUGUST 6 1782  sure of the public so much in his power. Our funds in France are in hands equally rapacious & less responsible. This ravenous spirit prompted Dr. F. to do what amounts to an absolute robbery. It is this. Col. Laurens had obtaind a million & a half of Livres from the french Court, to bring over hither for the support of our credit. It was deposited in Specie at Amsterdam & by the order of Col. Laurens to be brought by Major Jackson in the S. Carolina. When Col. L. had saild, Dr. F. by threats & orders prevails on Major Jackson to give up the money, & has it remitted to him at a loss to the U.S. of 19500 livres, besides the disappointment & embarrassment of our Finances here. This transaction will I have no doubt pass also unpunishd & uncensurd. Your friends in Virginia were well when I left them, & remember you with affection. My respects to Mrs. Adams & rememberances to Genl. Ward & all our friends, Farewell. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia. August 6th. 1782. Perpetual employment in public business, some attention to my private concerns, sickness & death in my family (for I have lost a promising daughter of ten years old) (1) have prevented my answering my friends letters for some time past. My neglect of you, I confess, is almost unpardonable, and I must rely on your goodness more than any thing I can urge for forgiveness; but why need I appologize to a friend, who, I know, has already excused me. Major Brown is well settled in Lancaster; my brother Judges & myself were present at the opening his Academy, for so it is stiled: he owes much to your recommendation, and gives general satisfaction.  Your introduction of Mr. Jackson to me lays me under a particular obligation; I respect his character, and am much pleased with him as a member of Congress.  The subject you mention in your favor of the 19th September last (2) is now likely to be taken into full consideration, I mean an American Navy: It is very much the conversation out of doors, and appears to be popular. The great losses lately sustained by the merchants from the too numerous captures by the enemy, engages the whole mercantile interest in the measure; in short, every thing seems not only to invite  AUGUST 6, 1782  but to demand an immediate attempt to establish one. Money alone appears to be wanting to make a beginning. The acknowledgement of our Independence by the Dutch affords a dawn of hope respecting that matter. There is a large Committee appointed to devise ways for the re-establishment of national credit, and for the procuring money on Loan, of which I am a member.(3) If we can obtain an undisputed title to the Western lands, that belonged to the Crown of Great Britain, and have been conquered by the blood & treasure of the United States, as a fund to borrow upon; and can by a land and poll tax, or otherwise, obtain sufficient sums for the payment of the interest until one year after a peace, or until these lands can be sold for the purpose of discharging the principal, I am not without hopes of getting as much money in the United Provinces of the Netherlands and amongst ourselves, as would answer our present purposes and build a dozen ships of war such as the Carolina; which construction would render the British frigates in a great degree useless in this country from the inferiority in strength, and be the cheapest with respect to both men and money. The Superintendant of Finance is very well inclined to these proceedings and will contribute all in his power to their furtherance.  The arrival of the French Fleet, of thirteen ships of the line and three frigates, in the Chesepeake, where they staid a few days, and now at the capes of Delaware, where they purpose to continue five or six days, has afforded an opportunity to our merchants of getting out their vessels with safety, and fully proves the utility and necessity of a Navy; for the Enemy have all fled to New York and elsewhere, so that a cruizer is not to be seen.  The indifference of the Spanish court to our credit & interest has been fully manifested to Mr. Jay in March last, by suffering a protest of several Bills drawn on him, tho' the whole did not exceed £20,000 sterling. Our good Allies immediately furnished Doctor Franklin with six million of livres for this, or any other purpose we might apply them to. The capitulations of West Florida, Providence (4) &c., their late treatment of American vessels at the Havannah, their haughtiness and some lesser circumstances induced me heretofore to doubt of the policy of the Spaniards, but this last affair settles my opinion: I am apt to think, even their present Ministers may live to repent of their behavior towards us.  The British nation appear to be prepared for a peace, and their new Ministry seem wisely to lay hold of the opportunity, afforded them by the success of Rodney in the West-Indies, to accelerate it: It is more than probable that Commissioners are now met on this great business. If preliminaries are not soon adjusted, Gibralter and the late conquests in the East-Indies may change Masters.  Congress is at present composed of virtuous men, and were it not   for some diversity of opinions respecting the Fisheries and Western Lands there would be more harmony in that Body then I have heretofore observed. This will be an important year. May God direct and overrule all our counsels to the establishing an honorable and lasting peace, and to the happiness of the United States in particular and Mankind in general.  My expressions respecting the Spaniards would have been more guarded, but that this goes by Mr. Lowell, and [will] therefore get safe to hand.  I am afraid I shall tire you in telling you what you know as well as I do, and shall therefore subscribe myself what, with great truth and sincerity, I am, Dear Sir, Your affectionate friend & most obedient servant, Tho M:Kean ""

  Dear Sir Philada. 6th Aug. 1782. I shall pay due attention to the request contained in your favor of the 29th (1) relative to the slave of your nephew. Should I however be so fortunate as to recover him, the price of slaves here leaves no hope that a purchaser will be found on the terms demanded. We have had several arrivals since my last but are still without official letters. The European papers, as you will see by the transcripts in the inclosed, teem with paragraphs relative to pacific negociations. The language & conduct of the New Administration of G. B. do by no means discountenance the supposition that they are more solicitous for peace than their predecessors, and less scrupulous as to the punctilio of national honor. But the insidious policy which has so long directed the British Councils, should always restrain our hopes of peace from circumscribing our preparations for War. We expect every moment dispatches from our foreign Ministers which will elucidate the publications of the Gazettes. The French Squadron which lately appeared off the capes of Chesapeak are now off the Capes of Delaware. I can say nothing as to its ultimate destination. Our trade I hope will at least receive some transient advantages from its visit to the American Coast. AUGUST 6, 1782  I am Dr Sir with much regard Yr. frd & Sevt. J. Madison Jr. PS. Upon recollection, it will be impossible to dispose of the Slave in this State, there being a legal prohibition agst. it. Even his coming into will operate as a manumission, unless the case of runaways be provided for which I believe is the fact. I will enquire more accurately into [the] matter. ""

  August 6. [1782] The delegates for Pennsylvania yesterday informed Congress that the commander of the French fleet, which was now off the Capes of Delaware, had sent up a message that if the ships in the harbor were ready to put to sea he would afford them a convoy from the Coast; that the merchants & the State desirous of improving this opportunity were willing to make an attempt on Bermuda if the French admiral could send with them some frigates, and therefore they moved that a Comtt might be appointed to confer with the minister of France on the subject.(1) This was refused but it was intimated to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs that he should confer with the minister & report. In consequence of this the Secretary for Foreign Affairs this morning reported \""that he had conferred with the minister of France on the expediency & practicability of making an attempt on the island of Bermuda--that he had related to him what he had learned with respect to the present strength of the island & the security the possession of it would give to our commerce and that of France, & desired to know whether the Marquis De Vaudreuil had any orders that would prevent his undertaking this expedition or any object with which it would interfere. \""That the minister replied that the operations of the fleet or the propriety of detaching any part of it must in some measure depend on the motions of the enemy--that he did not know that the marquis had any orders that would interfere with the plan mentioned--that he knew he had several objects advantageous to the United States, the execution of which he would concert with General Washington. The minister wished that this plan might be concerted with him, that if it should appear more advantageous than others which the Marquis had in contemplation he might take measures to carry it into effect. He observed farther that as this conquest would be on account of the  U. S. it would be necessary to furnish it with an American garrison. AUGUST 6, 1782  \""That he (the Secry for Foreign Affairs) desired to know whether troops might not be spared from those on board the fleet to perform this service for the U. S. in case they should find it inconvenient to send a part of their own army. \""That the minister replied that the whole land force in the fleet was too Inconsiderable to admit of a reduction, that they were designated to act as marines & for the security of the fleet in case they took a post to refital, that he concluded with wishing that the desire of Congress on this subject should be referred to the general, who upon conferring with the Marquis de Vaudreuil would be best able to judge of the expediency.\""(2) This report being read, Mr Bland moved that the conference with the minister of France reported by the Secretary for Foreign Affairs be referred to the Commander in chief to take order if he thinks the measure alluded to expedient & not interfering with other operations of greater importance that have been concerted or may be effected. This brought on a debate. Mr Lee was against referring it in the first instance to the Genrl; it was one of those cases mentioned in the treaty which required a previous Convention to settle the compensation. If it was undertaken without such a convention the French might conquer it for themselves or demand such a compensation that could not be granted. That the General could not settle the compensation, because it must be in money and the General had no right to appropriate money. Mr Duane was against referring the report to the General because it would hold up the object in too strong a point of view. When the matter was first introduced it was only mentioned as an object that might be adopted in case the fleet was going off the coast, either on their return to Europe or the West Indies. In this light he would have no objection against referring it to the General. That if the fleets staid any time on the coast there were other objects of far greater importance, such as the attack of N. York. He was therefore for committing it that it might be represented in the light in which it was first introduced. Mr Jackson was of the same opinion, thought there were several other objects which required greater attention mentioned--an attempt on Halifax or the reduction of Penobscot. He was for committing. Mr Rutledge thought that the motion was well guarded. He had no objection against accompanying the reference with a letter to explain the views of Congress, but was against committing. Mr Clark was against committing and against referring unless the words \""to take order\"" were expunged and the words \""to report\"" were inserted. Several others spoke on the occasion. At length the question for commitment was put and passed in the negative.  On the question for referring it to the Comr in chief, the yeas & nays being required by Mr Clark-- New Hampshire, Mr. Gilman, No. } X Massachusetts, Mr. Osgood, No. No. Mr. Jackson, No. } Rhode Island, Mr. Cornell, No. No. Mr. Howell, No. } Connecticut, Mr. Root, No.  Mr. Huntington,No. No. Mr. Dyer, No. } New York, Mr. Duane, No. Divided.

S. to decline acceding to the same until he shall have transmitted them to Congress for their approbation; unless the treaty proposed be of such a tenor as to render his accession thereto necessary to the fulfilment of the stipulation on the part of the U. S. contained in the separate and secret article of their treaty with his most Christian majesty, in which case he is to conclude such a treaty on the first requisition of his Catholic majesty. \""That Mr Jay be at liberty to leave Spain and go into any other part of Europe whenever the state of his health may require it.\"" This report being called for and read, Mr Lee moved that the latter part of the first resolution, \""unless the treaty &c.\"" to the end, be struck out. He observed that Congress were not bound by that secret article, as Spain had refused or declined to accede. That she had no right to the indulgence mentioned. Mr Montgomery called for the secret article, which was read, and in which a power is reserved to Spain of acceding to the treaties of commerce & alliance with France at any time she may think proper. Mr Lee said any time meant a reasonable time, that reasonable time had been allowed & she has absolutely refused and therefore Congress is no longer bound. Mr Jones seconded his motion. Mr Montgomery was of a different opinion The terms of the secret article were express that Spain should have liberty to accede when she thought proper. That she was to judge of the time & that the U. S. were bound to admit her accession. Mr Izard called for a letter of Mr Jay wherein he mentioned that the Count de Florida Blanca declared that the court of Spain would not agree that the treaties between them & his M. Christian Majesty & the U. S. should be the foundation of a treaty between the U. S. & Spain. This letter not being at hand, Mr Duane arose and observed that we had nothing to do with Spain. The secret article was made with France. She on account of the strict connection between her and Spain stipulated and reserved this privilege to Spain. We have solemnly agreed to it and pledged our faith to France to receive her accession & facilitate the means to it whenever she thinks it a proper time. Can any thing Spain has yet done justify our violating our faith to France? Because Spain has offended shall we break with France and so soon violate the first treaty made with us?  Mr Ramsay is against the amendment; had rather America should lose its existence than its faith & honor. Mr Madison is also against the amendment; grants that there is some weight in the observation of his colleague with regard to the time of Spain' s accession. That the design of France was to engage Spain to enter into the present war & guarantee the independence of the U. S. agst G. B. Should she decline acceding until the conclusion of the war she ought not to be entitled to the benefit of the alliance or the future guarantee of the U. S. for her American possessions. He was not for striking out the paragraph or for limiting the time without the consent and concurrence of France. Mr Root spoke on the same side. Mr Bland thinks a treaty with Spain of no advantage to the U. S. If she wants a treaty let her sue for it and let Congress judge of the terms. Mr Lee. Gentlemen had mistaken his meaning. He did not mean to violate the engagements entered into by the secret article; no man could be more averse to such a measure than he. He only meant that we should not shew too great a desire to enter into an alliance with Spain, which would be the case if the paragraph stood. Spoke of the interested views of Spain. Mr Witherspoon observed that some gentlemen had under rated the services of Spain. She had done much. She had entered into the war with the common enemy. We had derived as much advantage from her exertions as if she had agreed to the treaty of alliance, for in that case she would have had a right to prosecute the war in such way as she thought proper & might have undertaken the siege of Gibralter &c and would have been justified in so doing. Besides this she had aided us with money, opened her ports and admitted us to trade to Havannah. He is for retaining the clause; it gives a dignity to the report and will place our conduct in the fairest point of view. We are not perfectly satisfied with the reception our minister has received; we will not teaze Spain with solicitation; but we will leave her to judge of the time & when she thinks it proper we will be ready to comply with our engagements. Mr Rutledge. Concurs in sentiments with those who think we are bound by the secret article, and therefore will be against the present amendment but reserves the liberty of moving as he shall move to strike out the words \""in which case\"" to the end, because it goes too far as he will show at a proper time. Mr Clark, before he gives an opinion on the amendment wants to know the meaning of the report; apprehends it is only calculated to repeal the instruction given respecting the navigation of the Mississippi; if that is the design he is for speaking out plainly. However he will be against the present amendment. Question put, shall the words stand, 10 states in the affirmative, Georgia against it.  Mr Rutledge then moved & was seconded by Mr McKean to strike out the words \""in which case\"" &c. to the end. He observed by the secret article that a right was reserved to Spain not only to accede to the treaties of amity & commerce & of alliance at any time she thinks proper, but also to propose one analogous to them founded on the principles of equality, reciprocity and friendship, that in either case we were bound to admit her and in the latter had promised to endeavour in good faith an adjustment of the points in which the King of Spain may propose any alteration. That this latter case supposed and necessarily required deliberation & discussion and therefore that part of the instructions was improper. The words were accordingly struck out and the resolution with the amendment passed N. C. D.4 MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 84-92.  1 The following motion on this subject--\""That a Committee be appointed to confer with the Minister of France on the expediency of striking a blow at Bermuda if not inconsistent with the destination of the French fleet\""--in the hand of Pennsylvania delegate Thomas Smith and endorsed by Charles Thomson \""Motion of delegates of Pensylva.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Augt. 7th. 1782 I wrote you a long letter of the 30th Dec. 1780 to which I have not yet receivd any answer. But I can not help writing a line to you by this opportunity, as well to congratulate you on the success of your negociations in Holland as to mention to you what I think may be of material concern to you; that the present Minister for foreign Affairs is as devoted a partizan of Count de Vergennes and Dr. Franklin as any that exists. Here he is entirely under the direction of the Minister & Marbois. It may be obvious that considerable caution will be necessary AUGUST 7, 1782  in your correspondence with such a Minister. You may also judge that some ballance is necessary against the french influence here, to keep us from swerving from the interest of our Country wherever that happens to run counter to the real or imaginary interests of the Court of Versailles. Therefore a Minister from the States general may be of essential utility here. For when there are two foreign parties, the friends to their country, tho' few, may make the scale preponderate as they please, which certainly is not now the case. For these reasons I think you will render us an essential service by hastning the departure of a Minister who may answer this valuable purpose.  Our Affairs here at present are prosperous. The Enemy have e[v]acuated Savannah after having been beaten in an engagement by Genl. Wayne; & it is pretty certain that the evacuation of Charles-town will soon follow. Hard-money begins to come in by taxes, & when Commerce has a little recoverd us from the baneful effects of Paper-money, I think, our Finances will soon acquire stability, & the States credit.  The Instruction which subjects you to the french Ministers gives great offence & uneasiness to many in Congress; & to no one more than to myself.1 I think it most dishonorable & dangerous. It is a surrender of our Independence & Sovereignty & an acknowlegment that we are unequal to either. Mr. Jay has expressed the same sentiments very freely to Congress & I hope the Commissioners will not think that Instruction can bind them to assent to any thing injurious to their Country, tho it shoud be the advice & opinion of those who cannot have the interests of this Country so much at heart, & who are not responsible to us for their conduct.  God bless you & prosper your Negociations, in spight of us, to a safe, honorable & lasting Peace.  PS. Please to make my Compts to Mr. Jay, & let him know that his Letters have gaind him some friends, & perhaps lost some. But his account of a certain Court differs so much from what I had learnt of it, that I cannot but think there has been some secret agency in the business. Remember me affectionately to Mr. Laurens. Sir Guy Carelton & Admiral Digby have announcd to Genl Washington & he to Congress, that Mr. Grenville is instructed to propose the Independence of the 13 provinces, so they phrase it, previous to a negociation. This Letter was committed to Mr Lee, Mr. Witherspoon & Mr Rutlege, who will report I beleive--That Congress consider the above Letter as mere matter of Information, inexplicit as to the nature & extent of the Independency directed to be proposd by the british Plenipotentiary; & as Congress have receivd no information on this subject from   their Ministers for negociating with G.B. therefore no public measure can or ought to be taken upon it, in its present form.  That it be & hereby is recommended to the several States in the Union, not to remit of their exertions for carrying on the war with vigor & effect.  That the Commander in cheif be authorizd to empower the Commissioners he shall appoint to settle a general Cartel; to release Earl Cornwallis from his parole in return for a similar indulgence granted by his britannic M[ajesty] to the Honble. Mr. Laurens.(2) To our very great surprise, we have not received one line from you relative to our acknowlegement &c by the States general.

  Wednesday, August 7th. [1782] Mr Rutledge moved for an addition to the instructions which passed yesterday (1) which was agreed to and the instructions as amended and finally agreed to are as follows: \""Resolved, That the minister plenipotentiary at the Court of Spain be instructed to forbear making any overtures to that court or entering into any stipulations in consequence of overtures which he has made, and in case any propositions be made to him by the said Court for a treaty with the U. S. to decline acceding to the same until he shall have transmitted them to Congress for their approbation; unless the treaty proposed be of such a tenor as to render his accession thereto necessary to the fulfilment of the stipulation on the part of the U. S. contained in the separate and secret article of their treaty with his most Christian majesty. \""That Mr Jay be at liberty to leave Spain and to go into any other part of Europe when ever the state of his health may require it.\""(2) The Comtt for retrenching the expenditures of the United States in the several departments having reported a plan for arranging the army ,(3) in which it was proposed the troops of each state should be formed into complete battalions of not less than 500 rank & file by draughting the junior into the senior regiments, that no more officers be retained than what were necessary to command the regiments and that the supernumerary officers should retire on half pay until called into service or be employed in the staff department. When the paragraph respecting the retiring officers was under debate, Mr Montgomery thought if the officers were liable to be called into service they ought to be allowed their full pay, as they could not enter into business or make solid arrangements for their future support and subsistance. Mr Clark thought that the burthen of the half pay should be thrown upon the states which were deficient in their number of men & prepared an amendment to that purpose. The amendment appearing in the light of a substitute was not admitted whereupon he moved and was seconded by Mr Root to strike out the whole paragraph. Mr Root was of opinion that according to the Articles of Confederation Congress ought to fix the number of troops necessary, assign to the States their respective quotas & call upon them to furnish those quotas, and that each State would be obliged to furnish its troops with the proper number of officers or would be answerable for the deficiency. Mr Dyer. Of all the evils attending this war that of the half pay was never foreseen or thought of by the States.

11050,dg01925,1782,Charles Thomson s Notes of Debates,"""Charles Thomson' s Notes of Debates
  August 8th. [1782] After the house had passed a vote for reinforcing the garrison at Fort Pitt with 300 militia from Pennsylvania & Virginia & decided on a report respecting two Canadians,(1) Mr. Lee arose and reminded the house that there was a business before them of the greatest importance; that the interest, the honor and the safety of these States were so much concerned that he could not be easy nor stand justified to himself or his constituents until he had done everything in his power to bring it to determination. He therefore moved \""That the instructions given on the 15 June 1781 to the ministers plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace be reconsidered.\"" This was seconded by Mr Bland & some other members. But Mr Root rising and expressing a desire that the motion might be expressed in such terms as to avoid all debates concerning the effects of a reconsideration, he moved \""That a Comtt be appointed to revise and consider the instructions given to our ministers for negotiating a peace with Great Britain, and report what alterations ought to be made therein.\"" Mr Lee said he wished only for a fair discussion of the subject and to avoid every difficulty and debate arising from forms and therefore withdrew his motion and seconded that of Mr Root.(2) AUGUST 8, 1782  Mr Rutledge is resolved to adhere strictly to the principles of the alliance with France, and to shew her all the respect and confidence which one nation would shew to another. He had full confidence in her magnanimity, but is doubtful whether Congress had power to surrender themselves into her hands. The case is delicate; he does not wish to give an opinion; he may upon mature deliberation. The Comtt think it proper not to alter the instruction. It deserves consideration. He is therefore for appointing a Committee; if upon the most mature deliberation the Comtt shall be of opinion that any alterations should be made they will report what they think proper; if they are of a contrary opinion they will say nothing about them. He found by looking over the journals that instructions had been given respecting a treaty of commerce and that afterwards these were withdrawn & repealed and nothing farther done on the subject. He thought the Comtt to be appointed should be instructed to take this matter into consideration & report what was proper to be done. Mr Williamson said he had listened with the greatest attention to the arguments offered He had examined the instructions given. He did not think them of so dangerous a nature as was represented. The independence of the States and the principles of the alliance and treaty of commerce were fully secured. These were made ultimate, and not to be given up on any account. The matters in which the ministers were ultimately to be governed by the opinion of France were only what respected disputed boundaries, the fisheries and other matters which might come into discussion at the treaty. Mr Rutledge. The boundaries were everything; what are the States ? They must have boundaries. Is France to say what those boundaries shall be and must we submit? Mr Lee differs in opinion with the gentleman from North Carolina. It is not sufficient that the independence of these States is secured. But he doubts whether even that is secured by the instructions. He is afraid of the accompaniment. That we shall be so circumscribed in our boundaries that our independence will be a nugatory independence. France in making a treaty will be governed by her own interest and from her long and close connection with Spain and prefer it to ours. Is it wise, is it proper to give a nation the absolute disposal of our affairs that is under the influence of two interests which she is bound to consult in preference to that of these States? This unlimited confidence will render us despicable in the eyes of France and make her less attentive to our rights. We have been informed by a minister of France that Spain has large claims on the lands beyond the mountains. Her conduct shews that she means to support her claim to that Country. She wishes to confine us to the lands lying below the heads of the waters falling into the Atlantic. We are told that she thinks she has a right to possess herself of all to the westward. And shall we submit it to France, her old friend and ally, whether her claims shall be   confirmed & we be excluded from the possession of that Country? Besides the power and instructions we have given will be dangerous to France and render her suspected by the other nations of Europe. Her language to the other powers of Europe has been that she entered into the war to support our independence; that we were left at liberty to grant the same indulgence and privileges to other nations that were granted to her. What will the other nations of Europe think when at the treaty of peace they find her entrusted with the whole, the absolute disposal of our affairs? Will they not become jealous? Will they not think she has deceived or means to deceive them? The instructions are also dangerous to the United States. It is essentially giving up the independence of these States and becoming dependents on the minister of France. For notwithstanding what is said in the former part of the instructions respecting independence & adherence to the principles of the treaties, as the clause comes afterwards by which our ministers are bound to govern themselves ultimately by the advice and opinion of France he is strong in the opinion and thinks he will be warranted by the rules of construction & the judgment of all men that this supersedes the former: and shall this be suffered to come in doubt? He is for binding the minister to pay the utmost respect and place the utmost confidence in France, to take no steps without consulting her. Thus everything will be done that can and ought to be done. Can any friend of France desire more? Can any gentleman in this house wish to continue to her a power that will be ruinous to our independence, dangerous to herself, expose us to the contempt and scorn of all the nations of Europe, and bring upon both her and us their jealousy & perhaps their resentment? Mr Madison grants that the instructions given are a sacrifice of national dignity. But it was a sacrifice of dignity to policy. The situation of affairs and circumstances at the time rendered this sacrifice necessary. Nothing essential is given up, nor did it render our situation less precarious than it was before; nay he was persuaded that this mark of confidence gave an additional security to our interests as the Court of France must be sensible that the odium of unequal or hard conditions will now rest wholly on her. At least he was sure that the instructions given did not weaken that security. Our interests are as safe in her hands now as they were before or as if the ministers were left wholly to their discretion. Our ministers may still, notwithstanding the instructions given, state & assert our claims and contend with the utmost earnestness for our rights, and it is only in the last extremity when all their pleas, all their reasoning and all their most earnest endeavours prove ineffectual that they are ultimately to govern themselves by the advice and opinion of the Court of France; and must not this have been the case if the instructions had never been given? France has voluntarily bound herself by the treaties she has entered   into with us to secure and guarantee our independence & sovereignty absolute and unlimited as well in matters of government as commerce. What indication has she given of any alteration of sentiment or conduct towards us? It is her interest as well as policy to secure the affections of the people of these States and forever separate us from G. Britain. She can never think us formidable to her while we continue absolutely independent, nor will she ever object to our enlarging our boundaries or increasing our commerce & naval power unless we give her reason to suspect a want of confidence in her and a disposition to reunite ourselves with her ancient enemy. In that case interest and policy will both unite and induce her to keep us as weak as possible. Whether withdrawing our confidence at this critical moment will not give just grounds of suspicion and jealousy he leaves gentlemen to determine. There was a passage in Mr Jay' s letter lately read which made a strong impression on him; he did not know whether it made the same on others. He meant that passage which mentioned the fears and suspicions occasioned by the late change in the British administration, lest the men now in office who had always professed themselves friends to America and had in such severe terms condemned the war might influence the councils and conduct of the Americans. The withdrawing the instructions given on the 15th June, 1781, added to what has passed with regard to Spain, will increase that jealousy. Let us consider how it will operate on Great Britain. Tired with the war and disappointed in all her attempts to separate us from France, there is reason to think there are serious thoughts of peace, but flushed with her late success and flattered with the hopes of rising dissentions & jealousies between us & the other belligerent, will she not be encouraged to prosecute the war with new vigour & try by redoubled efforts to reduce us to her power? But it is said our dignity is stained, and that we must revoke the instructions in order to wipe off that stain and restore its lustre. But will this do? Will it repair our loss of dignity in the eyes of the nations of Europe to convince them we are a people unstable in our councils & measures, governed wholly by circumstances, abject & profuse of promises when in distress and difficulties, but who veer about on a change of circumstances & on whose promises and professions no reliance can be placed? In a word, continued he, I am persuaded that a change in the instructions will not add to our security. I am persuaded that it will give umbrage to our ally, and by a seeming act of ingratitude or of diffidence awaken her suspicions and jealousies, and abate her zeal in our favour. I am persuaded that the umbrage and jealousy which this measure will excite will be prejudicial to us and will give encouragement to our enemy to prosecute the war. I am persuaded it is now too late to alter, and that withdrawing our confidence will not cure the wound given to our national dignity. For all these   reasons I shall be against touching the instructions given. But if any member thinks that anything farther can be done to secure to the United States the several objects claimed by them, I shall have no objections to that, it being well understood that no encroachment is to be made on the instructions given, but they are to remain in their full force. I shall therefore move that the motion before the house be postponed, and if that is carried I shall then move-- That a Comtt be appointed to take into consideration and report to Congress the most advisable means of securing to the United States the several objects claimed by them and not included in their ultimatum for peace of the 15th day of June 1781.3 I now move that the consideration of the motion before the house be postponed. Mr Witherspoon seconded the motion. Said that if he had been agst the instructions at the time they passed, he would now from circumstances be against altering them. But he would remind gentlemen that the passing the instructions of the 15 June 1781, against which exceptions were now taken, was only the least of two evils which Congress were reduced to a choice of. A difference in sentiment had arisen between the Count de Vergennes & Mr Adams respecting the use the latter thought he ought to make of the discretionary powers with wch he was intrusted. This dispute was maintained by Mr Adams with a pertinacity that gave just offence more especially as it must be allowed & Congress were sensible he was wrong. Besides this Mr Adams entered into another dispute with Count de Vergennes on a subject which had no immediate connection with his mission. These disputes had given such offence that Congress were under the necessity either of recalling him or passing the instructions. They chose the latter as the least injurious to their national dignity. He was satisfied at the time & is still satisfied that it did not lessen our security. The Court of France by her treaties with us was bound only to maintain our independence absolute and unlimited as well in matters of government as commerce. These being secured she had a right to judge whether she would continue the war for other objects claimed by us, in the same manner as we had to judge whether we would continue the war on her account for objects not contained in the treaty. Our ministers were not restrained from urging everything they thought proper to obtain what we wished or desired. They could contend to the last and if obliged to submit they could enter their protest. Could they have done more if left quite at liberty? Congress adopted the only thing in their power to secure the rights of all the States. They added more members to Mr Adams and those from different parts of the continent. This removed every suspicion or fear that the interest of one part would be sacrificed to secure that of another. He then touched upon the jealousy which a change in our instructions wd excite, the opinion that would   be formed of our instability & possibly of our ambition. G. B. had taken great pains to impress the Courts in Europe with an opinion that we aim at conquest. France had even imbibed some suspicion of that sort & therefore her former minister had in a free conference with Congress urged the necessity of moderation. He concluded with observing that as the confidence placed in France was a mere compliment and not a giving up any real security, he should be against withdrawing it and should therefor vote for postponing.(4) Mr Rutledge said it was true France was bound to maintain the independence of the States but he wanted to know what were the States. He did not enter into the war for himself or for those inhabiting the lands on the waters falling into the Atlantic, but for posterity; for those who would hereafter inhabit the country beyond the mountains to the extent formerly claimed by the crown of Great Britain as belonging to these thirteen States. He would continue the war forever rather than be circumscribed in narrower bounds. He should therefore be against postponing. The question being put passed in the affirmative. Mr Madison then proposed his resolution and was seconded by Mr Witherspoon. Mr Rutledge resumed the debate; he was against the motion as explained. It is absolutely to ascertain our boundaries & define our other claims. He understood that the minister of France in a conference with the Comtt who brought in the instructions of June 1780 had pressed them to fix the claims of the U. S. They ought to have done it; as they did not then do it it ought to be done now. They had no business to suppose we had disputed boundaries. There were other matters that might come on the carpet in a negotiation for peace. We had withdrawn the instructions and powers formerly given respecting a treaty of commerce with G. B.; we should say something on that matter. He therefore would propose to postpone the present motion & if that was carried he would move-- That a Comtt be appointed to revise the instructions to the ministers plenipotentiary of the U. S. for negotiating and concluding a treaty of peace with G. B. & to consider & report if any and what instructions should be given to them respecting such treaty & for negotiating a treaty of commerce with G. B. The motion for postponing being seconded by Mr Dyer. Mr Witherspoon seemed to admit that the minister had desired the Comtt to fix their boundaries; that it could not be done so as to make it an ultimatum to the satisfaction of all the States. He observed that the happiness of the people on this side of the Alleghany Mountains was a sufficient object to induce them to enter into the war; that some of the States had their boundaries fixed and determined; that the State he had the honor to represent was one of them; that it had not entered   into the war nor would it he believed be willing to continue it for the sake of boundless claims of wild uncultivated country; more especially as it was a matter of dispute & will undoubtedly occasion much contention among the States to whom that country if ceded will of right belong that what relates to a treaty of commerce will come within the objects of the present motion; he is therefore against postponing it. Mr Jackson wished to have an exposition of our rights made out and laid before the King of France, & that he should be informed nothing less will satisfy the people of this Country. Mr Telfair. For his part he thinks it no matter who gives up our rights if they must be given up, whether the King of France or our ministers; he is for fixing our boundaries to the Mississippi. As to our claims beyond that to the South Sea he would leave them to discretion. Something more was said but rather in the way of conversation.

Whether these overtures are Sincere on the part of Great Britain, & proceed from Sound policy, to improve the late brilliant Successes in the East Indies & elsewhere, to treat more advantageously, rather than risque the Consequences of so formidable a Combination against her to the Events of War, and being Convinced of the impracticability of regaining America by arms, by an Open, Explicit Acknowledgement of our Independance, Secure to themselves future Commercial advantages from a Connection with us; Or Whether they are Insincere & insideous, made to amuse only, to lull us into Security & gain time for themselves, is somthing of a question; for Congress as yet has received no official accounts of the matter.  Congress have passed a resolution reducing the army, a Copy of which is inclosed.(1) The Agents for Pensylvania and Connecticut have agreed on the Judges to determine the Controversy between the Two States: they are as follows (viz) Genl. Whiple of New Hamshire, Genl Green of Rhod Island, Cheif Justice Brearly & Mr Huston of the Jersies, Mr Griffin & Mr Jones of Virginia, & Govr Rutlidge of South Carolina, any five to be a Quorum.(2) The appointment of officers in the Army from Connecticut was objected to, because some of them were said to be appointed in room of others who had retired, which wants Explanation; but since the late regulation we doubt Whether any new appointments will take place.

I wrote you in my last something About half pay. I have Since enquired into it more fully: in the estimate for the Currant Year 110,000 Dollars are allowed for half pay to Officers already deranged, or retired. Besides which there are Several Years arrearages due, & Annuetys granted to foreigners & to disabled Soldiers & Officers & the whole Corps of Invalleds a dead weight in Addition, & perhaps Juste enough, to a very Considerable Amount.  By a resolve passed Since I came in which my Colleague & I were divided About 23/40 of Our Officrs are permitted to retire on half Pay during life, which will Amount for the ensuing Year of 1783, to 240,000 Dollars.(5) Hence the half pay list only for the Year 1783 will Amount to the enormous Sum of 350,000 Dollars.  You may now Judge whither in my last I did not rightly conjecture That it would exceed the Net proceeds of the 5 Per Cent revenue.  AUGUST 10, 1782  Mr. Morris's Calculation for the 5 Per Ct. is as follows.(6) He Admits that 12,000,000 of Dollars is the Amot. of Imports & prize Goods Annually; the 5 Per Ct. on which would be 600,000 Dolls. Allowing 1/6 for Collecting &c (which is moderate) the Net proceeds would be 500,000 or about half a Million. Should peace take place, of which there is Some Prospects and we all Hope for it Soon, if good terms can be Settled, and Should the whole Armey be deduced you may easily Calculate from the Above principles and with graitcertainty, that the half pay by that Means Augmented, would exceed the computed, or estimated or imaginary net proceeds of the 5 Per Ct. Now sir I ask, and I demand an Answer, would not this enormous load of debt, contracted without Any Necessity & to be paid without receiving Any Services therefor, prove a Birden too heavey for eighther us, or our Children to bear? It is given out that the 5 Per Ct. is to be Appropopriated for Discharging the Intrest of Loan Office Certificates, it may be so, or it may not be so, for its Appropriation is Wholly Trusted to Congress & should they deem it more Necessary to Discharge half pay than Other Debts, who shall Oppose there Determination? I wish my Constituents only to know the Truth & to Act with there Eyes open and I must rest as easy as I Can Under their determination.  Prudence forbids trusting to the Casualties of a letter, Some other remarks About our Finances, which I wish to make. But Should Heaven grant Us virtue to do Justice with Impartiallity both to Soldiers & Citizans nothing is to be feared, Our resources are Superior to every Demand.  A loan is in Contemplation, so that the Above requisition of 9,000,000 Dolls will not be made on the People but in Part, It is well known with what difficulty the last Tax is Collected, or rather is Not Collected. It is My Opinion that mony is very Plenty this way, which I argue from the high prices of Produce & Merchandize, and that the Apparant Scarcity of money is caused by the real want of Credit, both publick & private. Yours &c, D. Howell  P.S. Please to Inform me of the Most Material Transactions of the General Assembly as soon as you find it Conveniant.(7) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 10 Aug. 1782. Your favour of the 6 Ult.(1) came to hand the 5 Inst. I congratulate you on your safe return home--to the enjoyment of the repose of domestic life endeared by so long an absence on public service. You wish for news I send you the paper of the day--in it you will see Carleton & Digbys letter to Genera1 Washington and make your own comments.  Notwithstanding my endeavours to qualify myself with the notices requisite, both as to form & substance, to enable me to fill, with propriety, my present place, I find myself very deficient. It is not an easy thing for a new member to take up the business of Congress & proceed in it with consistency & propriety.  Genera1 Washingtons Letter enclosing the above sd. letter informs us that an embarkation is taking place at New York and that it is said to be for Charlestown. This does not look like its being evacuated soon as we have been led to expect.  I am informed that the Resolve concerning the German Prisoners is carrying into effect. The Ordinance for establishing a Supreme Court of Appeals in maritime causes has not had a 3d reading; nor is the vacant Seat in the Court filled as yet; my friendship to Mr Marchant will lead me to serve him with pleasure as far as it shall be in my power.  Not long since was read in Congress a Letter from Mr Jay dated at Madrid. It contained upwards of 100 pages in Folio; being a journal of his proceedings from October 1781 to April 28 1782, including his negotiations with the Ministers at that Court, His Letters to Dr. Franklin, answers, &c. &c. On the whole it might have been written in Capitals Procrastination. Nothing definitive is be expected soon in that Quarter. So entirely do they neglect us that Mr Jay has been under the necessity, notwithstanding encouragement from them at sundry times of pecuniary assistances of protesting bills for the pitiful Sum of £20,000 Sterlg. But Dr Franklin found means to satisfy the bills soon after through the bounty of our Great, good & generous Ally. By another Letter of May last, which is short, we are informed that Mr Jay was going to Paris. What if Messieurs Adams & Laurens should join him & Dr Franklin at Paris & be, perhaps at this moment settling preliminaries for a genera1 pacification? The British have undoubtedly made some advances--What is doing time will discover, \""Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.\""(2) The objects of negotiation are various--To divide interests--To procure Allies--or for peace. The Britons wish  AUGUST 10, 1782  for peace, but I fear they are not sufficiently humbled to accept of such terms as will be offered them. Should their terms have been concerted and approved of by the Empress, or any other northern Power, and be rejected by the Powers at war with them, tho' they fail of peace they may get allies & carry on the war with renewed vigour. God grant us an honorable peace or none at all! It gave me great pleasure to find that you breakfasted with our illustrious General the friday morning after you left Philadelphia not only on account of the mutual Satisfaction it must have afforded you both, but as it will tend to justify the attempts I made, on a late occasion, to remove an injurious aspersion thrown out against you in this regard. Your conduct, Sir, must silence your enemies & put them to confusion; I am sorry to hear that either Judge Mowry should assert or General Miller believe that you ever was concerned in such an infamous intrigue as you mention.(3) As I have no evidence of its existance, but every reason to believe that had it existed, you would have detested entring into it, I cannot doubt but on a thorough investigation and detection of their affairs, in which I wish you good speed, your character instead of being injured will receive an additional lustre. It is indeed to be lamented but experience evinces the facility with which points are carried in such small Republics as ours by the vile arts of falsehood & detraction: and little do those who practice them regard their detection after their points are carried; while the injured party, not having the means of defence at hand is obliged tempori succumbere and with difficulty at last, if ever, totally eraseth the ill impressions from the minds of his Fellow-citizens.  No official accounts have been received from the Hague further than the News Papers must have informed you. The Completion of treaties & the arrival of a Dutch Minister may be momentarily expected.  On the request of Mr Joseph Brown of Providence I have lately transmitted him by a safe hand a very particular account of the construction, parts, dimensions, &c. with a deliniation of the Cylinder & flue of the wooden still about which you wish to be informed; as I kept no copy and doubt not of his having received my letter (4) I must refer you thereto for information. I beg you to make acceptable my particular regards to your Brother Christopher Ellery, your Son in law Mr Channing, Mr Merchant & all Friends. Believe me to be with much esteem & deference, Sir, your Friend & humble Servant, David Howell. P.S. Should you attend the ensuing Session of Assembly have to request you would give me the earliest notice of their most material transactions. D.H.  AUGUST 12, 1782  ""

  Monday, August 12. [1782] The Comtt on the letter from Carleton and Digby made a report, whereupon Congress, in order to obviate an opinion that was prevailing of their having received overtures for a peace, directed the letter to be published & resolved that they considered the letter as mere matter of information, inexplicit as to the nature and extent of the independence directed to be proposed. That as they have received no information on this subject from their ministers for negotiating a peace, no public measure can or ought to be taken upon in its present form. They recommended it to the several States not to remit of their exertions for carrying on the War with vigor as the only effectual means of securing a safe and honorable peace. And as the British Commanders had heretofore always refused to settle a cartel under pretence that it would be in fact an acknowledgement of our independency, they resolved to put the British Commanders' sincerity to the test and therefore directed Genl Washington to propose to them the appointment of Commissioners to settle forth with a general cartel for the exchange of prisoners, take care that the liquidation of accounts & settlement of the balances due for the maintenance of prisoners be provided for therein. The Comtt proposed and reported that the General should be directed to empower his Commissioners to release  AUGUST 12, 1782  Cornwallis from his parole, in return for the indulgence granted to Mr Laurens. But Mr Rutledge, one of the Comtt, inveighed against this with so much warmth and indignation that it was rejected with a loud and general no from every part of the house. Nothing was said on the proposition for exchanging soldiers for seamen, Congress deeming it inexpedient to touch upon that matter at present or to do anything that might serve as a pretext for refusing to settle a cartel; and apprehending, if a general cartel was established, provision might be made therein for the release of our seamen as well as for preventing the capture of unarmed citizens.1 MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 105-6.  1 For the congressional response to the two reports acted upon this day, see JCC, 23:462-64; PCC, item 19, 6:399-402, 413; and Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 5:42-43.

  Dear Sir Philada. Aug. 13th 1782 The post is come a second time without a line from you. From a letter from the Presidt. of Wm. & Mary, I infer that you are more profitably employed.(1) I transmitted to you a few days ago by express the contents of a letter from Genl Carlton & Admiral Digby to Genl Washington, announcing the purpose of the British court to acknowledge the Independence of the 13 Provinces. Our expected advices on this head from Europe are not yet arrived. A Mr. Blake an opulent Citizen of So. Carolina (2) who came from G. B. under a passport from Mr. Laurens to New York & thence hither assures us that the Administration are serious with respect to peace & the independence of this Country, that the point however was carried in the Cabinet by a majority of two voices only--that their finances are so disordered that a continuance of the war is in a manner impracticable--that the Militia at N. York have been thanked for their past services & told explicitly that they would not be wanted in future--that the evacuation of the U. S. will certainly take place this fall & that a large no. of transports are coming from England to remove the B. Garrisons, probably to the W. Indies--that these transports will contain about 2500 Germans who it is supposed in case of such an evacuation will have the same destination--that Carlton told him & desired him to mention it at large that he was a real friend to America, and wished her to be powerful, rich, united & happy, and secure agst. all her Enemies--that he also intimated in the course of conversation that Canada would probably be given up as a 14th member of the confederacy. You will draw such conclusions from these particulars as you think fit. The Gentlemen of So. Carolina 930 vouch for the veracity of Mr. Blake. It appears to me much more clear that the Ministry really mean to subscribe to our independence, than that they have renouncd the hope of seducing us from the French connection. The motion for revoking the {power given to France has been made again and pushed with the}(4) expected {earnestness} but was {parried and will} issue I {believe in} an {adoption of your report} with a representation thereupon to the {court of France}.950  The Controversy between Connecticut & Pennsylvania is a promising train for adjudication; The Agents having agreed on the Commissioners to whom it is to be submitted.  Among other means of revenue the back lands have on several late occasions been referred to, and at length recommended by a Grand Committee to the Consideration of Congress. A motion for assigning a day to take up the report, was {negatived by a small majority}. The  AUGUST 13, 1782  report has been {repeated} by the {committee} but a second experiment has not been {made in Congress}.(6) Several of the middle {states seem to be facing about. Maryland} however preserves its wonted {jealousy and obstinacy}.  In compiling the evidence of our title, I suppose you will of course be furnished with all Mr. Jefferson's lights.(7) I have lately seen a fact stated by him w[h]ich s[he]ws clearly the ideas entertained in Virga. with respect to her territorial limits subsequent to the resumption of the Charter. In convention between Commissioners on the part of the Commonwealth of England & of the Grand Assembly of Virga. in 1651, by which the latter submit to the new Govt. it is stipulated that Virga. shall enjoy the antient bounds & limits granted by the Charters of the former Kings & that a new Charter shall be [sought?] from the Parliament agst. any that shall have intrenched [up]on the rights thereof. I forgot to mention to you by the last post that as Congress have adopted a scheme of settling the Accts. of the several Departments and of the Hospital among the rest by an itinerant Commissr. specially appointed for each, the Accts. of your friend Dr. Carter can not be audited here, and must be sent back to him. We have no very recent intelligence from the French Squadron. They are probably bearing towards Boston whither it is the current opinion that they are destined. It does not appear that they have as yet made any prizes, except a recapture of a Frigate which had Struck to the Sta. Margarita, a British-Spanish Ship of superior force. You will observe that I venture more tha[n...] with respect to uncyphered comm[uni]cations. To this I am led not only by a scarcity of time, but by the diminution of the danger occasioned by the apprehension of 13 or 14 of the gang of mail robbers who are now in the gaol of this City.(8) ""

I went on board of her some days before the receipt of your Letter to enquire after Mrs. Stiles & family, and from a Young man on board, I was informed they were all well about a month ago. I told him you were well and in Virginia, and gave a direction and requested the Captain to call on me, and that I would write Mrs. Stiles, which made me conjecture I should not loose the opportunity. From every information we have the best reason to conclude, that a Negociation for peace is now on foot at Paris, and from every appearance, there is reason to conclude it will take place--insomuch am I satisfied in this measure as to hazard an opinion, that the chance is against your building a Vessel constructed for the present commerce if you have not gone to far, or can make a saving Sale, in my Judgment, it would be adviseable, at this conjucture.

The General Assembly of North-Carolina, are among the few who have not addressed you on this auspicious occasion; but they would be wounded by the most transient suspicion, that such delay had arisen from the want of gratitude or affection for his Most Christian Majesty. It was their misfortune, that during their last session, in April, they had received no official information of the birth of a Dauphin, wherefore they could take no public notice of that fortunate event; but fame had circulated the intelligence--it was universally believed; and we beg leave to assure you from our own knowledge, for we attended dur AUGUST 14, 1782  ing the whole sitting of the Assembly, that the pleasing report of the birth of an heir to the Crown of France, was received with the most cordial pleasure by the citizens of North-Carolina; it filled every countenance with joy, and every heart with gladness: Every man found himself personally concerned in an event which contributes so much to the happiness of a people they esteem, and a Monarch they will constantly revere.  We request you would do us the justice to believe, that the citizens of North-Carolina will not fail to pray, that the Supreme Ruler of the Universe may prosper and preserve the Dauphin and his royal parents; for we are fully convinced, that under God we are indebted for our early deliverance, the preservation of our liberties and establishment of our independence, to the generous interposition of his Most Christian Majesty, and the persevering valour of the French nation.

Marion, &c.(2) The first, third and fourth of these gentlemen shewed, that the movement made by you on Camden, was made on information given by them of the weak condition of that post, the certainty with which (had it not been unexpectedly reinforced) it would have been taken, and the important consequences that would have followed to the army and the state, from the capture thereof. And further, that the movement was not only a proper one under the view already taken, but indis- AUGUST 14, 1782  pensable to the safety of Gen.

When neither Baron de Kalb, General Smallwood, General Caswell, General Guest, or General Stevens advised to the measure, and that the latter, considered and declared, the capture and information of the prisoners as a ruse of Rawdon to escape an attack.

I shall be desirous to know your Excellencies Opinion whether we should agree to accept of the Cessions of N.

[1782] The Comtt appointed on the 8th to take into consideration and report the most advisable means of securing to the United States the several objects claimed by them, and not included in their ultimatum for peace of 15 June, 1781, reported as their opinion:(1) \""That the Comtt to whom was referred the report of a previous Comtt relative to the said claims, be instructed to deliver over to the Secry for Foreign Affairs the materials which they may have collected in support thereof, and that the said Secry perfect & transmit the same to the Ministers Plenry for negotiating peace, for their information & use; provided that nothing which shall be done by virtue of this resolution shall be construed to affect any dispute which now does, or may hereafter exist between individual States, or between the United States & individual States. That the Min. Plen. for negotiating peace be instructed to communicate to his M. C. M.(2) so much of the facts & observations so transmitted, & in such form as they shall judge fit, representing to his My that Congress have caused the same to be compiled & laid before him, under a persuasion that he will find therein such clear proofs, both of the validity and importance of all their claims, as will silence any pretensions by which they may be opposed. This representation of the grounds of the said claims was rendered the more essential on the part of Congress by the extreme solicitude of their Constituents, with regard to those objects, and by the ardent desire of Congress, not only that this just solicitude should be eventually satisfied, but that it may be found that every useful precaution had been taken to that end; that the favourable circumstances under  AUGUST 16, 1782  which a negotiation is likely to be carried on, afford additional confidence that the issue will not disappoint the expectations of the U. S., nor the zeal with which his Ma[jest]y has assured them he shall support their interests; but, on the contrary, that the magnanimity and wisdom which led his Ma[jest]y into the war in their behalf, and which have marked his conduct through the course of it, will appear with fresh lustre in the act by which it is to be terminated, and that the alliance and amity which have been cemented by the mingled blood of the two nations, will derive still further stability from the final attainment of the just demands of both of them.\"" Mr Bland objected to the first part, he wanted to see what the Committee had prepared before he gave a vote for referring it to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Mr Jones had no objection against the papers going into the hands of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, but he should be ordered to report thereon, and not to transmit anything to the Ministers, for negotiating a peace until it had received the approbation of Congress. Mr Madison said it was the design of the Comtt that Congress should give no opinion or judgment in the matter. That the papers should go to our Ministers merely as information, not as instructions; that this would not be the case if Congress decided thereon, or even if the Secretary for Foreign Affairs laid before Congress what he proposed to transmit. For by the instruction of the office for foreign affairs papers going in that way from the Secry for Foreign Affairs to our Ministers abroad were to be considered as acts of Congress & binding on the ministers, whereas the letters and papers from him to them which were not submitted to the view or consideration of Congress were only to be regarded as mere private opinion and information, by which the conduct of the Ministers would be influenced no farther than their judgment directed.

  Dear General Philadelphia 16th August 1782 I shoud sooner have done myself the Pleasure of writing to you had any better Conveyance offered than the Post. Twice in that way I have furnished Amusement for the Garrison of our Capitol which was much more than they had any Claim to from me. Indeed they do not seem to think my last intercepted Letters sufficiently entertaining to  AUGUST 16, 1782  deserve a place in their Gazette. This will be Committed to the Care of our worthy W Livingston, and I trust it will get safe to your Hands, tho' not soon enough to give you the first Intelligence of late Events which are the Subject of general Speculation. You will see in the papers the interesting Letter from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digbey as Commissioners of Peace to General Washington. You will see too the Opinion of Congress on that Communication, and that they have received no Intelligence touching Propositions for peace from any of their ministers. We know indeed that some negociation is commenced at Paris: because we have certain Information that Mr Jay has repaired thither from Madrid. The people of England collectively, we are well assured, are heartily weary of the American War which they look upon as a Scourge and a Curse. The present Ministry, at least a Majority of them, we know were violently opposed to this war before they got into office. We know that they have used every Argument since they assumed the Administration, to impress on the Nation an Apprehension of Danger, and a deplorable Idea of their Finances and Prospects. We are told that Lord Stair has presented an Estimate by which it is demonstrated that their peace Establishment will amount to 13,000,000 Sterling yearly: And that lands have actually fallen from 30 to 20 years purchase.  But after all these Circumstances are considered they do by no means Justify a Relaxation of our Efforts to compell the Enemy to quit the Country. While they retain their present Posts and are in force, we are bound to push our Operations with the utmost Vigour.  It is singular that even by the latest Debates of Parliament the Idea is not lost that America may be induced to accept an Irish instead of an absolute Independance; and some are of Opinion that the former is the Independance which their plenipo. Mr. Grenville is authorized to propose. It woud be astonishing indeed if, after all their Experience, they shoud attempt so vain and absurd a Delusion; which coud only expose them to Odium, and increase the Breach which they pretend to be Solicitous to repair.  You will readily conceive of our Solicitude to hear from our own Ministers which will alone enable us to clear up all doubts; and to form Conclusions on Just Grounds.  In the mean time I congratulate you on the Evacuation of Georgia. By the last Accounts, the Enemy had retired to Tibee a small Island in the Neighbourhood of Savannah. I am of opinion they will not long retain their post in Charles Town: it ceases to be an Object unless they maintain constantly a naval Superiority in the American Seas. There are other Reasons, tho' not conclusive, which Justify this Expectation.  You have been informed of a small provision made for Col. Ja. Livingston shortly after my arrival here.(1) It is all I coud at present procure for him. Present my Compliments to him & let him know that I   will answer his last Letter if I can get leisure; and that in the mean time I cannot think it worth his while to make an expensive Journey to Philadelphia, as I am very apprehensive it will not be productive of any advantage. I now, my dear Sir, turn to your very friendly Letter of the 25th of July. There are circumstances attending my Appointment to the Senate which I ought to consider as honorable; and my being continued at the same time as a Delegate calls upon me to express a high Sense of the Confidence reposed in me by my Country. I hope my Zeal and feeble Efforts for her Service and Glory will not altogether disappoint the Expectations of the Legislature. You know my wish to have you near me for the pleasure I enjoy in your Friendship and Conversation, and because your Ability, Experience and Reputation fit you for the most arduous Employments, and in a peculiar manner for a participation in the general Government of these States: But since your Health does not admit of it, the next best Object which I have long had in Contemplation, and have lost no Opportunity in promoting, has to my very great satisfaction taken place. I mean the election of my ingenious and worthy Friend Col Hamilton to the Vacancy which your Resignation occasioned.(2) I shall now, with the utmost Confidence of an able Representation, look forward to the Period when my Country will permit me to attend to my shatterd fortunes, and domestic Enjoyments.  I observe with pleasure the Steps taken by our Legislature to aid the Finances and strengthen the general Government. They are spirited and wise. It was not till this day that they were officially communicated to Congress and they were immediately referred to a Grand Committee.(3) I feel so much the want of the money expended to supply the Deficiency of my Support from the Legislature that your Information on this Subject gives me real pain. I am in danger of being destitute of the means of being decent and comfortable even in the Article of Dress. But why shoud I give you disquiet by dwelling on an Incident that is not at present to be remedied?  The Assistance you expect from me in Senate you greatly overrate. Every Effort however in my power shall be faithfully employed on the particular subject you mention; because I know it to be essential to our tranquillity and Safety.  Alass poor Tryon County! What uncommon Scenes of Calamity has she sustained; and what Evils may she not yet apprehend! Believe me, Sir, I am distressed for her beyond Expression. Is it impossible to protect the scatterd Remains of this once flourishg district? I once hoped it was not. Congress on the first Intimation chearfully supplied the new Levies with Cloathing and every thing promised by the original Stipulation; so that they are in all respects on an equal Footing with the Continental Battallions. They have also called for an Estimate of what will be necessary for the Oneidas &c (4) being resolvd to reward   their Fidelity and encourage their zeal and Exertions against the common Enemy. If any thing further can be done it ought not to be neglected. To support our Fellow Citizens on that exposd Frontier is a first Duty. I find that you still labour under Infirmities which requires an uncommon degree of Patience and Fortitude to sustain. These happily for your Friends are Virtues which distinguish your Character. You have my earnest wishes that your Health may be restored and your useful Life prolonged for the Consolation of your Family and the service of your Country. I cannot part with the pleasing Idea that we shall yet spend many happy Hours in Social Enjoyments and mutual good offices; and talk over the Dangers we have encountered in the Retreats which we have contemplated with so much Satisfaction. When our Country is possessed of all the Blessings of peace and Safety, may we not hope that there will be a portion of Happiness reserved for her virtuous Citizens who have stood foremost in the Hour of Danger and drank freely of the Cup of Distress and Anxiety! I will indulge the Thought! Adieu my dear Friend; and believe me to be with unabated Regard and Affection, Your most obedient, humble Servant Jas. Duane [P.S.] The Governour writes me that Mr. Lhommedieu will speedily relieve Genl Scott. Col. Hamilton will be prepared to set out in the Fall to give me a Requiem.(5) I shall with great pleasure present him to Congress & the Circle of my Friends & leave nothing unattempted to make him happy in himself & [...]able to the Community as far as will depend on the most favorable Impressions of his Virtues & Capacity.

  August 16th. [1782](1) Mr Montgomery, one of the Committee to whom was referred a report of a Comtt on instructions to the Delegates of Massachusetts respecting the fisheries, informed the house that Mr Randolph, who had been the Chairman of the Comtt, had collected a number of facts and observations in support of the several Claims of the United States, not included in their ultimatum of the 15th June, 1781, that he had submitted them to the consideration of Mr Carroll another member of the Committee; that Mr Carroll had made sundry remarks and observations; that upon leaving Congress he had left Mr Randolph's state of facts and observations with him the only remaining member, & had requested him not to lay them before Congress until he returned and had an opportunity of finishing his remarks and stating his objections; that this was the reason why the Committee had delayed to report, but as the Committee which reported yesterday seemed to refer to Mr Randolph's \""facts and observations,\"" and sundry members had expressed a desire to see them, he had therefore laid them on the table with a report.(2) The report was read in the following words: \""The Comtt to whom was referred the report on instructions to the Delegates of Massachusetts, report that they have collected facts and observations herewith reported to Congress, which they recommend to be referred to the Secry for Foreign Affairs to be by him digested, completed and transmitted to the Ministers Plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace for their information and use.\"" The facts and observations reported by the Comtt were then called for and ordered to be read.(3) When the Secretary had read to the end of the following clause. \""Thirdly, that if the vacant lands cannot be demanded upon the preceding grounds, that is upon the titles of individual States, they are to be deemed to have been the property of his Britannic Majesty immediately before the Revolution and to be now devolved upon the United States, collectively taken\"" (see the State of Facts & Observations, book A, p. 16, ante, p. 116):(4) he was interrupted by Mr Bland, who moved, and was seconded by Mr Lee, that the clause be expunged. This brought on a long debate, in which many members spoke. The members of those States whose boundaries were fixed and determined supported the clause, those members whose States claimed territory to the Mississippi, or whose eastern boundary was undefined, opposed it. Mr madison observed that the clause was imported for the purpose of reconciling all the States to the report, that though he was satisfied there was no solid foundation in the argu- AUGUST 16, 1782  ment, yet he saw plainly if the clause was struck out sundry States would object to the rest of the report & therefore he should be for its standing. But he thought it improper that any vote should be taken. Mr Bland insisted on a vote & called for the yeas & nays. Hereupon it was observed that the whole debate was out of order; that the report was reading for information not for debate; that the interruption & motion were improper and that no question could be taken until the whole was read through. To this it was answered that the objection should have been made sooner. To put an end to the debate an adjournment was called for and agreed to.(5) MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 108-42.  1 There is no record of this day's proceedings in Secretary Thomson's journals. Most of the information found in this entry is recorded under the date August 20 in JCC, 23:471-522, which Gaillard Hunt printed from Thomson's secret journals. PCC, item 5, 3:696-740.  2 The \""instructions to the Delegates of Massachusetts respecting the fisheries\"" were embodied in a Massachusetts Act of October 27, 1781, which had been referred on November 17, 1781, to a committee consisting of Daniel Carroll, James Lovell, and James Madison. The committee's report had been debated and recommitted on December 12, reported again on January 7, and probably provided the occasion for William Ellery's motion the following day calling for an enlargement of the \""ultimata for concluding a treaty of peace.\"" Although Ellery's motion was rejected, the report on the Massachusetts instructions was referred the same day to a new committee consisting of Carroll, Joseph Montgomery, and Edmund Randolph, which is not mentioned again in the congressional records until August 5, when, because of the continued absence of Carroll and Randolph, it was revived and enlarged with the addition of James Duane, James Madison, Samuel Osgood, and Hugh Williamson. Montgomery's remarks preserved here by Thomson provide the final clue to the disposition of the committee's work. For the sources of this information, see PCC, item 74, fols. 189-92, item 186, fols. 4, 10, 17; JCC, 21:1166, 22:11; 23:471; and James Madison to Edmund Randolph, August 5, 1782, note 6.  3 The lengthy \""Facts and Observations\"" which follow at pp. 109-41 in the NYHS Collections text, were printed in a somewhat fuller form by Gaillard Hunt at JCC, 23:482-522 as a composite text created from Thomson's secret journals (PCC, item 5, 3:696-740) and from Edmund Randolph's manuscript report (PCC, item 20, 1:91- 140).  4 The reference is to NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 116.

  Sir. Philadelphia 18th August 1782. We took the liberty to inform you on the third Inst. that with the desire, of placing the State we represent in a fair and respectable light, we had thought it our duty to publish an abstract of the late acts of the General Assembly in favor of Troops & Revenue.(1) The publication was very well received here, and we hope it met with your approbation. On the 14t Instant for a similar reason we presented an Apology or address to the Minister of France.(2) It is enclosed together with his answer, from the whole of which answer we apprehend you will conclude that the address especially in the critical season of presenting it, was by no means unpleasing to the minister. In fact the particular circumstances of Public Intelligence had much weight in our determinations. Congress had just received the Letter which the British General seemed to circulate with avidity. It seemed to point at some desire to seperate America from her Union with France; at this season we apprehend that we cannot be too attentive to obviate every probable cause of Jealousy in the Breast of our Ally who doubtless has served us faithfully. However it is not enough that the public at large should approve our Zeal to serve the State which we have the honor to represent, we are particularly solicitous to meet with the approbation of that State. With respect to the public, we observe with pleasure that they seem to think we availed ourselves of a very critical season to present an address which our duty called for. With respect to the State we have taken the risque fully on ourselves. If they should be pleased to approve our Conduct, they make the address their own.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 20th August 1782. Your Excellency's dispatches of the 5th Instant I had the honour to receive three days since; and have once more an occasion to express my grateful sense of your kind attention to my personal Concerns. I can only lament that the Sum I am in advance for my support here, inconsiderable as it is in itself, is so necessary for the Accommodation of my Family, that the delay of a reimbursement leaves me in a situation little short of actual distress. The recent proof of the Confidence of my Constituents in electing me to the vacant Seat in Senate, deserves my grateful acknowledgments, and your Excellency will be pleased to accept my best Thanks for your Congratulations. I feel, with equal satisfaction, the Honour of being so uniformly entrusted with a place in the Delegation; as it is a high mark of publick esteem which I know how to value. But, however flattering to my Reputation, the Exercise of this last office, from domestic Considerations, is become painful and indeed next to impracticable; and I look forward with Impatience to the Period when I shall be able to decline it with the approbation of my Friends. Col. Hamilton's Talents qualify him eminently for a seat in Congress, and his Appointment is a strong proof of the discernment of the Legislature. I am doubly pleased with it, as it may facilitate the Accomplishment of my wishes to be once more united to my Family after a separation of more than seven years. The Measures taken by our Legislature to aid the Finances, and strengthen the system of Continental Government, will do them the most permanent Honour. The Act, on the last Subject, is under the consideration of a grand Committee;(1) & the dispatches for the States transmitted thro' their Delegates. I hope, with your Excellency, for substantial benefits from Mr. Mont's (Montgomerie) (2) present Sentiments, whenever Congress shall  AUGUST 20, 1782  be prevailed on to resume the Vermont business: but the critical state of our publick afairs strongly opposes the Determination we have a right to expect. It seems to be a general wish, that a decision should be suspended until we can form a Judgement of the Views of the present British ministry which are involved in no small obscurity. The first Intelligence from our own ministers will unravel them. The Act which the Vermont (people) have presumed to pass, must injure them in the opinion of their best Friends in Congress; tho' I fear it may fall with a heavy weight on the Towns which retain their Attachment to our State.(3) I feel most sensibly for our fellow Citizens in Tryon County. While the Enemy remain posted in Force at Oswego, we have nothing to expect short of total Desolation of the scattered remains of that once flourishing district. I do not trust myself with Reflections on this Subject which may be ill founded. I hope to enclose with these dispatches, an Act of Congress to give our new Corps the full benefit of the former Resolution in their favour.(4) A report is made on the principles I wished and steps recommended for the more comfortable support of our faithful Indians. We daily expect Mr L' hommedieu, when Mr. Scott will proceed homeward, his subsistence money being already expended. He will give your Excellency every Information in which I may be deficient. For the news of the day be pleased to be referred to Mr. Livingston. I anxiously wish for Intelligence from our Ministers which may unravel the equivocal Conduct of the Enemy. While they profess an Intention to withdraw their Troops from this County, it is positively asserted that upwards of 1500 Hessians and 500 British are arrived within Sandy Hook in a large fleet of Transports, under Convoy of 6 Ships of the Line. While Sir Guy Carleton and Adm Digby write of Propositions for peace--officiously publishg this Letter before it reached Congress--one of their ministers insults us in parliament with the offer of an Irish Independance. While their General calls aloud on the Americans to soften the Rigours of War and lay aside Acts of Barbarity which are disgraceful, & even proposes to set the Example, Tryon County is made a scene of Blood, Devastation & Wanton murders. While they irritate, provoke (and we have Reason to apprehend) chicane and deceive, they have the Effrontery to charge us with a want of Moderation and a Thirst for War; and to hold us up to the world as implacable Tyrants! But I suspend the Indignation which is natural from such mysterious Measures. The doubts which perplex maybe yet be cleared up when this whole System is revealed. The British Mininstry may, notwithstanding present strange Appearances, be in earnest to pursue maxims, which out of office they avowed; which introduced them to power; and which are dictated by the general voice of the nation   which they govern. In short they may convince us that the accidental Victory which the too fortunate Rodney obtained over a part of the fleet of Count DeGrasse, and the transient Advantages in the Island of Ceylon, and on the Coast of Coromandel, have not made them mad.

A continuation of the silence of our foreign Ministers has disappointed me. The extreme length of this silence is very remarkable and distressing.

A Number of the Prisoners from the Goals of England have arrived here conformably to the intimation given in their letter to Gen Washington.

  My dear Friend, Philada. Aug. 20th. 1782 In my last I informed you that the {motion to rescind the controul given to France over the American ministers had been parried and}(1) would probably {end in an adoption of your report}.(2) It was {parried by a substitute so expressed as to give a} committee sufficient {latitude in reporting without implying} on the part of {Congress a design to alter past instructions}. The composition of {the committee appointed according well with the object of the substitute a report was made that the expository report} should be {referred to the secretar}y for {foreign affairs} to be {by him revised and transmitted to the ministers in Europe and that the latter} should {communicate so much thereof as they} might {judge fit to his M[ost] C[hristian] M[ajesty] representing to him &c}.(3)  {In this train the business was going on smoothly} each of the {opposite parties seemingly concur}, from a {fear of something more distant} from {their wishes--when}  Mr. L____l.(4) {The reading of} the {argument in favor} of {boundary drawn} from the {federal source} present{ed to Bland} a {snake in the grass}. This {jealousy was sup}port{ed by Lee by} suggestions {which pointed to Franklin}. The {arguments used by} these {gentlemen} raised {up the advocates} for the {federal pretensions} and the {merits of this question} were {altercated} with a {warmth which ended} in {an adjournment}.(5) Nothing could have been more {fatal to the report than} to {connect this dispute} with it in the {mind of Congress} and I have no longer any {hope of its success}. I rather {surmise that a new struggle} will {ensue against the ob}no{xio}us {clause}.(6)  I am at a loss to account for the impenetrability of the cypher in my late letters, of which your favor of the 6th instant(7) complains. I regret it too the more as I have since made liberal use of it.(8) The rule I have observed has been to select the colums beginning with the several letters of the Key word, to arrange them in the same order in which the letters follow each other in the Key word and to use them in that rotation; always beginning afresh after the use of a word, syllable or letter written in the usual character, & often throwing in these characters merely to break a sentence or paragraph into parts, & thereby circum- AUGUST 20, 1782  scribe the influence of an error. This explanation I hope will be satisfactory. The printed cypher of Mr. Livingston is too large for four sheets to be sent by the Post as you propose.(9) If a private conveyance offers I shall embrace it. Your very friendly attention to my pecuniary affairs lays me under a very great obligation. Nothing but the utmost distress will induce me [to] encroach on your Tobo. which I consider as possessing an intrinsic value too far beyond its immediate price to be unnecessarily disposed of. I inclose you an authority (10) to obtain any aid which the Auditors may be able to afford. As my accounts already transmitted specify all the monies recd. prior to the 20th of March I am at a loss to understand why they cannot be settled up to that date at least. Is the depreciation to be liquidated by the scale established by Congress--by Pena. or by Virga.? I have rcd. since that date £281.5. Pena. Currency, of Mr. Whitesides in consequence of arrangements made with him by Mr. Ross.(11) The stigma on \""some of the U.S.\"" contained in the preamble to the Ordinance agst. collusive captures is a typographical erratum. It s[houl]d have run \""some of the citizens &c.\""(12) I differ from Mr. L.(13) in opinion that the Cession of Va. will be accepted. The repugnance to it seems indeed to have in some degree subsided, owing perhaps to a change of Members in Congress, and a cooler view of the subject, but in its present form I cannot think it will at this time obtain a sufficient number of votes. Upon what authority was the condemnation of the flag vessel included in the decree agst. the contraband merchandize?(14) I am not able to add a syllable to what I have heretofore written on the subject of Paciefic negociations. The silence of our Ministers in Europe is amazing, unless a miscarriage of their despatches be the cause of our not hearing from them. The Minister of France is in the same suspense as Congress. We have not yet recd. even a line from Mr. Adams notifying the resolution of the States Genl. in his favor, an event which we cannot suppose he would be backward to communicate. I inclose you from the Freeman's Journal of the 7th inst. a very curious letter from that Gentln. to his friend Mr. Searle which was taken with the Vessel from which the latter escaped in the Bay of Delaware & published in N.Y.(15) I have no other information relative to the French fleet than what you will receive from the Gazette. It seems they very unluckily left the tract to N. York a little before the arrival of a fleet with the Garrison & Stores of Savannah. The description you give of the drought in Virga. is equally suited to this Country since their Wheat Harvest. New Jersey & Maryland are under the same calamity. The States East of the North River have escaped this providential visitation.  ""

  Tuesday, August 20th [1782] The State of Facts and Observations was called for and read through.(1) And the report of the Comtt being amended to read: That the facts and observations reported by the Comtt be referred to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to be by him digested completed and transmitted to the ministers plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace for their information and use. Motion was made by Mr Lee, seconded by Mr Bland, to amend it further by inserting, after the word committee, \""except the following passage\"" 3 That if the vacant lands as before recited & except the following passage viz. \""But if the vacant lands &c.,\"" to \""the common labours of the United States\"" inclusive (see Facts and Observations).(2) Mr Lee supported the motion by observing, that the supposition was groundless and the reasoning upon it fallacious; that the claim to the western territory rested solely on the titles of individual states. That Congress had no authority but what it derived from the States. The States individually were sovereign and independent, and upon them alone devolved the rights of the Crown within their respective territories. Could the sovereignty of the Crown of G. B. devolve on the U. S. in Congress assembled, before such an assembly existed? What authority is there for that supposition; where is the sovereignty of the United States derived? Is it in the Confederation? Is it in the Treaty of Alliance? Does it really exist? Shall we put an argument in the mouths of our Ministers which they may use to their own advantage. It is well known that one of our Ministers is interested in the decision, having a Claim to some of the lands in question. That one of the Ministers of our Ally is likewise interested. If our Claim is supported solely on the titles of the States, they will be cut off from their intentions; if on the supposition that the rights of the Crown devolve on the United States collectively taken, their plea will be strengthened. Mr Witherspoon, wished to have a question and the opinion of Congress without any further debate. The reasoning in the facts and observations went to this, that the Ministers in supporting our Claims to the Western territory, should first urge the titles of the several States. But if they failed in this they were then to urge the argument in the Clauses now excepted against. Whereas the spirit of the amend- AUGUST 20, 1782  ments was that if our Claims could not be supported on the former ground they were to be relinquished & given up. Mr Lee replied that the amendment was to take away an argument which our Ministers might use to their own advantage an argument which was ground1ess and fallacious; he called upon any gentleman to shew what foundation there was for it. None had attempted this. The reason was because it was not in their power. The Ministers ought to rely on solid argument This was to be found only in the titles of the States. If they were confined to these they would urge them with force, and he had no doubt they would prevail. Mr Witherspoon said if there was any doubt that our Ministers would be unfaithful, let them be changed. If Mr Franklin, whom the gentleman alluded to, was interested, let him move for his recal, he would second him. The facts and observations, as they now stood, required that the Ministers should in the first place urge the titles of the several States; if these prevailed the end was obtained, and the argument in question would not be brought forward. But if arguments drawn from old Charters, Charters granted at a time when the extent and limits of this country were without Charters and Titles interfering one with another whose limits were so extravagant that it was thought proper to curtail them in a former treaty, if arguments from this source should be found to have no weight with the mediating powers & other powers in Europe, and this he believed would be the case, would any Gentleman wish to preclude our ministers from using an argument which would have weight, an argument drawn from general security, the force of which had been admitted in former treaties, and would be admitted by every disinterested power of Europe. The several States were known to the powers of Europe only as one nation under the stile and title of the United States. This nation was known to be settled along the Coasts to a certain extent; if any European power was admitted to establish colonies or settlements behind them, what security could they have for the enjoyment of peace? What a source of future wars! Was not this the principal argument urged by G. B. against France at the breaking out of the last war? Whether the uncultivated wilderness on the frontiers should belong to one state or another was a matter of little concern to the European powers. The only argument that would weigh with them was whether it was necessary for the security of the United States that other nations should be excluded from that country, and particularly G. B., the enemy of these States. He should therefore be against the amendment. Sundry other gentlemen spoke and the amendment being insisted on and notice given by Mr Bland that he meant to call the yeas and nays, which would bring the whole of the facts and observations upon the journals, by which means Congress would be under the necessity either of resisting the whole or of amending & making them an act of   Congress, so that they would go as instructions and not merely as information, which was the thing intended; a motion was therefore made that the report be committed. And the motion for commitment being seconded, and having by the rules of the house a preference, was put and carried in the affirmative.

  Dear Doct. Philadelphia August 23d 1782 I have at times Considered the proposition you made some time  AUGUST 23, 1782  ago for purchasing wine &c here to be sold at Frederick. It might answer but the difficulty is to make the purchase, nothing to be had without the ready and how is that to be procured? Perhaps a Load or two of hemp might be had on Short Credit this would make a beginning and the Waggons employed in Transporting the hemp might be loaded back. The difference in the price of the hemp might perhaps defray the Expence of the Waggons.  Should be glad to be informed as to the price of hemp and Tobacco with you and at what price Claret, Port wine, Madeira, Rum, Spirits, leaf Havannah, Muscovado Sugars would Sell in Frederick. I have recommended to A to leave Annapolis as I thought his Continuance there would be ruinous unless some further means Could be fallen on for his Support other than that of his Salary, but he seems Averse to it. His objection to going to Frederick is, that the Situation disagrees with his health and it would be only hastening him to his grave. He prefers getting into Some Safe Species of merchandizing to every thing. If therefore he should be able to do any thing, Should be glad to have him Concerned with us. He may perhaps be able to procure £100 on Loan, and if we put in each of us a like Sum, a tryal may be made, if we find it answers the Business may be encreased, if not it may be declined without much loss. I shall not mention Any thing to A on the Subject untill I hear from you, which I hope to do by the first opportunity. If any thing is to be done Shall endeavour to Settle a Correspondence here before I leave Town. This will be handed to you by Gen. Gates.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 23 Aug. 1782. I will suppose you have either never received, or had no leisure to answer my two former Letters (1) & on this footing undertake to write you a third.  You will no doubt be anxious to hear something about peace. It is the general wish, & I may add that of Congress too, while at the same time a manly firmness in persevering in our just claims and in our military operation so necessary to vindicate them will mark their character in this as well as in all former stages of the contest. Nothing has yet transpired officially about the negotiation on foot. Private Letter from Paris June 28 mentions that Plenipotentiaries from the belligerent powers were in close consultation at Paris & it was expected that a general pacification would take place. I need not assure you of my disposition for peace on good terms.  A reduction of the Salaries of our forreign Ministers is in Contemplation & has been agitated in Congress this day. They have at present the enormous Sum of £2500 Sterlg per Annum.  You will soon be informed of your appointment as one of the Seven judges to determine the long subsisting controversy betwixt Connecticut & Pennsylvania respecting the Lands on the Susquehanna: The Court are Mr Whipple of N.H., Mr Welcome Arnold of R.I. & P.P., Messieurs Brearley & Houston of N. Jersey, Messieurs Jones & Griffin of Virginia & a Mr Nelson.(2) All the judges were appointed by the mutual choice & agreement of the parties by their Commissioners. I hope you will not decline serving, as you will thereby not only disoblige the parties who have chosen you but your Friends who undertook to recommend you. It is a very high trust. It will at least make you known in the World. The allowance will be ten dols per day in full.  At the moment of my writing this Letter you are as I suppose at So. Kingston deliberating about 5 per Cent. I hope you will not adopt it. You will thereby raise money for some States who will not raise any for you nor even for themselves.  It is in contemplation to order a Contl. Tax of 1,200,000 Dols, to pay the intrest of the funded debts for 1783. This will be constitutional and in my opinion much better than the Impost; but should that be adopted, this will probably be laid aside. We wait the result of your present deliberations with impatience. Georgia has not yet agreed to the Impost.  Please to write me fully the doings of the Legislature & the Sentiments of the people. AUGUST 23, 1782  I have reason to be thankful for a good State of health hitherto through the heat of the Summer, which is nearly past. The Season has not been extreme except in droughth.

  Dear Sir Philada. Aug. 27th. 1782. Your favor of the 16th (1) came duly to hand yesterday. The hints which it gives with regard to merchandizes imported in returning flags, and the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other States, merit attention. The latter subject has on several occasions been mentioned in Congress, but I believe no Committee has ever reported a remedy for the abuse. A uniform rule of naturalization ought certainly to be recommended to the States. Their individual Authority seems if properly exerted, to be competent to the case of their own Citizens. The report touching the unpopularity of {General G}(2) was perfectly new to me. It may nevertheless be true. The letter recd. yesterday from the Govr.(3) is silent as to the appointment of Commissrs. to treat with the Southern Indians. We are still left without information concerning negociations in Europe. So long a silence of our Ministers at so interesting a crisis grows equally distressing & inexplicible. The French fleet has gone into Boston Harbor. The arrival of a British fleet on this coast is reported but disbelieved by many. The French Army is on its way Northward from Baltimore. It is to proceed in five divisions; the 1st of which is to be here about Friday next. Congress red. yesterday a letter from Genl Washington enclosing one to him from Carlton with the proceedings of the Ct. Martial in the case of Lippencut.(4) It appears that this Culprit did not deny the fact charged upon him but undertook to justify it as a necessary retaliation, and as warranted by verbal orders from the Board of Refugees. The Ct. decided this warrant to be insufficient, but acquitted him on the pretext that no malicious intention appeared. Carlton explicitly acknowledges & reprobates the crime, & promises to pursue it in other modes; complaining at the same time of irregularity in the step taken by Genl W. of selecting & devoting to execution an innocent & even a capitulant officer, before satisfaction had been formally demanded & refused. Genl. W. seems to {lean to the side of compassion} but {asks the direction of Congress}. What that will be may perhaps be communicated in my next. The consideration of your territorial {report has been resumed}. The expedient which was meant to conciliate both sides proved, as often happens, a means of widening the breach. The Jealousies announced on the side mentioned in my last, were answered with reciprocal jealousies from the other, & the {report} between the two was falling to the ground when a committment as a lesser evil was proposed & agreed to. Mr. Jones & his family arrived on sunday at Germantown without halting in this City. Himself, his lady & little son were all extremely sick during the whole journey. Mrs. Jones is still very much indisposed, & Mr. Jones considerably so. They do not propose to come into the City till the salubrity of Germantown shall have enabled them to encounter its noise & polluted atmosphere.(5) I cannot in any way make you more sensible of the importance of your kind attention to pecuniary remittances for me than by informing you that I have for some time past been a pensioner on the favor of H. S.(6) Will not the Agent of Mr. Morris(7) give a draught payable to me for notes payable to the bearer? Or may not the Notes be so endorsed as in case of accident to prevent payment to another? In either of these cases a remittance of notes (if they can be procured for me), by the post will be safe. But my present situation renders such a conveyance preferable to delay, even if neither of the foregoing expedients be practicable. Shew this paragraph to Mr. Ambler (8) if you please. As I do not find that any of my letters in which Mr. L____s Cypher was used, have miscarried, I inclose you a Key exactly copied from mine.(9) If it arrives safe, and unlocks the past letters, it may be of future use. You w[ill] observe & inform me whether the seal of [this letter?] obviates all suspicion of its having been opened. Mr. H. & Mr. T.(10) present their very affecte. regard to Mrs. Randolph & yourself.

  Tuesday, August 27th [1782] The Comtt of the week, viz.: Mr Gilman, Mr Clark & Mr Huntington having recd a petition signed by a number of inhabitants of a tract of Country called Kentuckey reported that it should be read & filed.(1) The reading was first called for, and the purport of the petition was to state that the petitioners had, at the risk of their lives, settled a tract of country westward of the Allegheny Mountains on the waters falling into the Ohio, that the State of Virginia had lately granted large tracts of land within that district without any condition of settlements, that she had undertaken to form them into Counties and claimed jurisdiction there, that being removed above 800 miles from the seat of Government, it could not be exercised with justice & energy; that they were in danger of losing their rights, if they must go to Richmond where the Supreme Court sat & there contend with the last Grantees; that they have taken an Oath of Allegiance & considered themselves subjects of the United States & not of Virginia, that the Charter under which Virginia claimed that Country, had been disolved; that in consequence of the dissolution the Country belonged to the Crown of G. Britain & that by the revolution the rights of the Crown was devolved on the United States, and therefore praying Congress to erect them into a separate and independent State and admit them into the federal Union. Mr Lee was surprized that the Comtt had not explained in their report the nature of the petition, as they ought to have done, as that might have prevented its being read. The countenancing such petitions was an insult to the State of Virginia.(2) As the petition had been read, the only thing now to be done was to refer it to the State of Virginia. The petitioners were subjects of that State, if they suffered grievances they should apply to the legislature of that State for redress, and not to Congress. What right had Congress to interfere? that the rights of the Crown devolved upon Congress was a groundless, an extravagant & idle supposition. Could they devolve on Congress before it had an existence? Congress derived its power from the Confederation, it had no right but what the Confederation gave it. The United States individually were in existence before Congress was. They were sovereign free and independent & retained all the rights of sovereign free and independent states, except what they voluntarily gave to Congress by the Confederation. That the rights of the Crown to the vacant Lands within the bounds of any state could not devolve upon Congress but on the individual state within the bounds of which the lands lay. Mr Madison supported the propriety of referring the paper to the legislature of Virginia. The State he said had already taken measures  AUGUST 27, 1782  to redress some of the grievances complained of. The legislature had divided the Country into Counties, they had established Courts, appointed judges, and brought justice to the doors of the petitioners. He was sensible that they were far removed from the seat of Government; that the time would come when the people in that Country must be divided into separate jurisdictions. The Constitution of the State had provided for that event; but the Legislature of Virginia & not Congress were to judge when that would be proper. The dissolution of the Charter did not break the social Compact among the people. The Charter was an agreement between the King, the proprietors, and the people. Though the King, by the dissolution of the Charter, might succeed to the rights of the proprietors, the rights of the people remained entire, and the King had no right to cut them into separate Governments without their consent. He doubted whether the present petition expressed the sentiments of the people in that district; he apprehended there were few if any of the natives of Virginia among the number of the petitioners. That the paper read should be referred to the Legislature of Virginia that they might enquire into the facts and determine what was proper to be done. As to the supposition that the right of the Crown devolved on the U. S. it was so extravagant that it could not enter into the thots of any man. If the right of soil devolved why not the right to the quit rents and confiscated estates. Mr Williamson observed that the petition involved a question of a very serious nature; that no doubt a time would come when it would be discussed: that whenever it was discussed it would be attended with most serious consequences, and he apprehended the sword alone would decide. He wished it might be put off a long time, & not revived in our time, nor in the time of our children or their grand children. Mr McKean, was sensible it was a question of a very serious nature--that it must be discussed. He was not for putting off the discussion to so distant a period. He was not for leaving it to posterity. He was willing to face it with all its consequences, and hoped it would be decided before the present war was concluded. If the people of Kentuckey have taken an Oath of Allegiance to the U. S., he will take them by the hand. He is not afraid of Virginia. He hopes no State in the union will ever be so great as to give laws to all the rest, nor that any will be suffered to acquire so much power that the others cannot controul it. Mr Clark wants to be informed more particularly respecting the conduct and views of Virginia with regard to that western country, & what the meaning of the provision is of the Constitution of the State. He understands that they have it in contemplation to form the western country into distinct subordinate governments & to send out lieutenant governors to rule them. This will be going on the plan of Great   Britain with regard to her former Colonies, & must bring on another revolution, which will be attended with convulsions & break the peace of the union. If he is rightly informed, that plan is already in part adopted and is one of the grievances complained of by the people and the foundation of the present petition. He is apt to be jealous, but he thinks it right to be jealous in such a case as this. He wishes for full information. Mr Howell observed that the right to the western Country was vested in the Crown of Great B. That by the proclamation of 1763 the King had prohibited his Governors from granting lands beyond the heads of the waters falling into the Atlantic; that by that proclamation reserved to himself the right of pre-emption; that the Crown of England claimed and had always exercised the right of setting off new governments--that both these rights devolved on the United States. Congress had acted upon the former when they passed the resolution recommending it to the states who claimed the western Country, not to make any grants of unappropriated lands. See Oct. 30, l779, (3) in opposition to which the State of Virginia made grants of which the present petitioners now complain and the 11th Article of the Confederation provides for the exercise of the latter right by the words \""no Colony shall be admitted into the union until such admission be agreed to by nine States.\"" This is not to be confined to Colonies then or now in existence, but extends to any future Colony that may at any time be established or formed. Mr Witherspoon began by observing that one of the gentlemen from Virginia said it could not enter into the thoughts of any man that the rights of the Crown devolved on the United States. He supposed he intended that only as a figure in rhetorick, not as an assertion that would be admitted. It certainly could enter into the thoughts of men and had actually entered into his thoughts, and it had entered the thoughts of the petitioners and into the thoughts of very many sensible men at the beginning of the present Controversy. The western uncultivated and unappropiated lands belonging to the Crown were considered and spoken of early in the controversy as fund for discharging the debts that might be contracted in the war by the U. S. It would appear a strange whim if a sentiment which occupied and engrossed the minds not only of speculative, but of illiterate men and of the bulk of the inhabitants of many of the States had not some solid foundation to rest on. For his part he thought it founded on truth, on justice, on the nature of things, and was warranted by the Laws of Society. This controversy was begun and the war was carried on by the united and joint efforts of the thirteen States. By their joint exertions and not by those of any one State the dominion of Great Britain was broken, and consequently the rights claimed and exercised by the crown devolved on all, and not any individual State. Why should one   State reap more advantage than another. He admitted the consequence that not only the right of the unappropriated soil but also of the quit-rents and confiscated estates devolved on the U. S. As to the quit-rents it seemed to be the general opinion that they should be no longer collected, but that each man should enjoy the portion of land he was possessed of, clear of all incumbrance of quit-rents, and therefore they were not made an object; with respect to confiscated estates, they were too inconsiderable to excite attention. Had a major part, or even one-half of any State joined the enemy, and their estates thereby became confiscated, he apprehended it would have been a matter of serious discussion whether they should belong to the U. S. or be appropriated to the sole benefit of the other half of the Citizens of the State. With regard to the powers of Congress, or of the U. S. collectively taken, they could not be exactly defined in the articles of Confederation. Cases would arise for which no previous provision could be made. These came under and were decided by the great law of necessity, which was admitted as a law of nations. It might happen that a State would grow so powerful and so ambitious as to be dangerous to the other States in the union. In such a case the law of necessity and of self-preservation might compel the others, by a sovereign act of authority, to abridge the power of that State, and even to divide it into two or more distinct and independent States. He would not undertake to say that the petitioners were within or without the bounds of Virginia, or that it would be proper or improper to grant the prayer of the petitioners; but he saw no impropriety in letting the petition remain on the files of Congress, and should therefore vote in favor of that question. Mr Williamson insisted there was nothing before the House in which a question could properly be taken; that the bulk of the names to the petition which had been read appeared to be signed by one or two hands; they might be forged. No body could say that the signers or the persons whose names were written lived on the lands in question, that therefore the paper should be dismissed. This brought on a new debate, and at last an adjournment was called for and agreed to. MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 145-50.  1 See JCC, 23:532-33. Although Thomson records a lengthy debate over the disposition of the Kentucky petition in these notes, there is no mention of the matter in his journals of Congress.  2 For the Virginia reaction to this Kentucky petition, see Madison, Papers (Hutchinson), 5:82-84; and Virginia Delegates to Benjamin Harrison, September 3, 1782.

I refer you to General Scott for any particulars respecting the Ratification of the Sentence which you may be curious to know. With Truth, Sir, I can affirm that the high Estimation in which your Zeal, your Merits and your Services had placed you remains unimpaired. I have been so long habituated to disappointment from the Professions, and the extreme Folly, of our Enemy, that I form Conclusions with respect to their Measures and that sincerely with the utmost Caution. Pardon me then for confessing that you take greatly the Lead of me in Expectations of a sudden peace.

  Wednesday, August 28th? [1782](1) A flag-ship having arrived at Philadelphia with prisoners from Fortune [Forton] Prison in England, the Captain represented to the agent of marine that on the passage the prisoners had compelled him to furnish them with a larger allowance of provisions than the rules of the victualing office and his instructions warranted, and therefore he demanded to be paid for the extra allowance. The agent of marine having communicated this matter to Congress and requested instructions, his letter was referred to a Comtt consisting of Mr Duane, Mr Howell & Mr Izard, who reported this morning a state of facts as it  AUGUST 28, 1782  appeared to them, and recommended that the accounts of the Captain be referred to the agent of marine for liquidation and payment.(2) It was urged on the part of the Comtt the honor of the nation was concerned; that the Captain, relying on the security of a flag and the honor of the American prisoners, had entered into a contract with Government to carry the prisoners to America; that in making his Contract he relied on furnishing them during the voyage with a certain quantity of provisions, daily, the same that was allowed to British soldiers on board of transports; that he had been compelled to give more, and that the loss would fall upon him; that he might have complained of the violation of the flag and demanded a reparation, which could not have been denied; but that he contented himself with only demanding pay for the extra allowance, & that this ought to be granted. Mr Rutledge thought the honor of the nation no way concerned. What mighty stain would it be on the honor of the nation that a number of men who had been for many months confined in prison and half starved, which was the case, should, when they had the power and when by a freer air & more exercise they found their appetite restored, compel the Captain to increase their allowance of provisions. He did not see the propriety of paying money when the enemy refused to settle with us and pay what they owed for the maintenance of their prisoners in our hands. Besides it should be considered that many of those who were now returned were militia of North & South Carolina, & had been, contrary to faith and justice, sent to England and kept confined, when by the Cartel settled between Greene and Cornwallis they ought to have been at liberty and in their own country. That in strict justice the enemy ought to return them entirely at their own expense. But he did not desire this. He was willing that justice, strict justice should be done. He wanted no favours, he would receive none from the enemy. He was for accounting with the enemy not only for the extra allowance but for the whole quantity of provisions issued to the prisoners during the voyage. For this purpose he had no objection against granting the captain a Certificate for the quantity of provisions served out to our people on the voyage, and that the amount should be charged to us and admitted in the general settlement; but he was against paying any money until the general account was settled. Several other members spoke on the occasion, and at last the report was recommitted.(3) The matter being over, Mr Smith arose and begged leave to call the attention of the house to a clause in the Ceremonial established with regard to foreign ministers. He meant that which regulated the visits between members of Congress and foreign ministers. He found it was differently understood by different members; some thought it was the duty of the minister to make the first visit, and that they were bound not to pay him a visit or accept his invitations to dinner until they had   received his visit. Others did not consider themselves so bound. Hence arose a distinction among the members; while some held an intercourse with the minister and were constantly seen at his table & entertainments, others where wholly secluded. For his part he thought the minister's entertainments and invitations were too frequent and that it would comport more with the dignity of Congress if the members were seldomer seen at his table. But he saw no reason why one should not be there as well as another & that there should be one rule of conduct for all. He therefore desired the sense of the house on the clause. Mr Lee thought it highly proper to establish a rule. The republic of Venice had a law by which every member of the Senate was prohibited from dining with or being entertained by a foreign minister. This was to prevent all suspicion of being under undue influence. He did not mean that Congress should adopt such a rule. It was proper that that the etiquette of visits should be settled. The Ceremonial being read it appeared that the clause had a reference only to the visits of ceremony paid after the first public audience of a minister. Several members treated the matter as trifling, & not deserving further attention. Mr Bland thought a Ceremonial should be settled that members might know their place; for this purpose he would move that a Committee be appointed. Mr Lee seconded his motion. Gentlemen might despise etiquette as they pleased; but it was so important as to be attended with very serious consequences. Every civilized nation had found it necessary to settle it. We should not affect to be wiser than all the world. Mr McKean observed that we might soon expect more ministers from foreign Courts, it was therefore the more necessary to settle the line of conduct to be observed toward each of them separately and to whom a preference should be given when together. Mr Williamson made a florid harangue on the occasion and mentioned the house contrived with several doors and the round table at Aix-la-Chapelle where the ministers of several powers met to settle the peace of Europe.(4) Mr Clark, composing his countenance to more than usual gravity, to give more poignancy to his accustomed sarcasms, wondered that gentlemen should call in question the importance of the subject or oppose the appointment of a Comtt. He wanted to see the report & should therefore vote for a Comtt. After many learned arguments and fine speeches it was resolved, That a Comtt be appointed to revise the Ceremonial respecting foreign ministers and to report the proper alterations and additions to be made thereto. The members chosen: Mr Lee, Mr Izard & Mr Williamson.(5) AUGUST 30, 1782  MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 145-50.  1 See notes 3 and 5 below.  2 For Robert Morris' August 23 letter to Congress and the settlement of the accounts of Capt.

  Dear Sir, [August ? 1782] (1) Your favor of the 1st ult. reachd me safely. I am very much obligd to you for your attention to me both as to the Paper money & the Grant. It is not a little unfortunate that the person so fit for the business shoud have been visited with so grevious a disorder, for which I am very sorry as well on his account as my own. It is probable that times of more safety in those parts will soon happen, for I think the Enemy can hardly continue the war long, & all parties seem disposd to peace.  I wish it were in my power to give you any comfort as to the spirit that generally prevails in this Country. It seems as if patriotism was an unnatural feeling, & therefore short-livd; while prostitution & servility, were so congenial with human nature, that they revive & florish with wonderful rapidity. AUGUST ? 1782  By the absolute order of France, Dr. Franklin & Mr Jay were joind in commission with Mr. Adams for negociating a Peace. At this very time Congress had the fullest evidence and conviction that Dr Franklin was both a dishonest & incapable man. Mr. Laurens & Mr. Jefferson were added, but the first was a prisoner, & the latter woud not go. Mr. Jay has with a very becoming spirit desird to be left out of a Commission, which is accompanied with Instructions to obey ultimately the opinion of the french Ministers. This he states as in his apprehension, so humiliating to the Commissioners, so disgraceful & injurious to America that he cannot submit to it. I have movd in vain for a reconsideration of these Instructions. The yoke is riveted upon us, & the man who I am sure sold us in the negociation with France, is the sole adjunct with Mr. Adams, in a negociation on which every thing that is dear & honorable to us depend. He, good man, felt no qualms at such a commission, no sense of dishonor or injury to his Country. On the contrary he expressd the utmost alacrity in accepting it, & I beleive most cordially; since it puts him in the way of receiving money, which is the God of his Idolatry.  The French therefore are to make a peace for us; we have presumd only to desire Independance; but whether it shall be on secure & honorable terms, whether by the stipulations annexd to it we shall participate in the Fishery, in the navigation of the Missisippi, or in the western territory, whether conditions Trenching nearer, & more shamefully on our rights will accompany the naked & nugatory assertion of Independance, is in the soverign arbitration of the french Court. To judge what is for our own interest, to instruct our Plenipotentiaries, for them to think & act for us, are treason against the Alliance, by which we were acknowledgd independent & soveriegn. In short, the most servile display of the most servile principles, is what alone must entitle us to the patronage of our great and generous Protector. This was not the sentiment, or languge, that commensd the revolution, & I can plege myself it is not the sentiment or language that will bring it to a happy issue. But there seems to be no public here to appeal to. Sordid pursuits & servile attachments have apparently absorbd all the Faculties of our fellow Citizens. In the last resort, I hope the jealousy of G. Britain & of the other Powers in Europe will prevent France from abusing the power which we have thus basely & imprudently confided to her.  Spain has behavd towards us with very little wisdom, or decency; but it is much to be suspected that the French are at the bottom of it; insomuch that a well-informd person on the spot, writes thus \""I have many reasons for believing that the french Court does not wish to see us declard independent by other Nations, lest we shoud become less manageable as we become less dependent on her for support.\"" I have endeavord to inculcate this truth into those to whom it woud be useful, & yet they constantly act in opposition to it.   The rapacity of a certain person after power & profit, (2) the little caution or wisdom that governs appointments are the reasons for the accumulation of Offices in an unprincipled & suspected Individual. The distress of our Finances which he has the art of colouring high, & plentiful promises of relief from wonderful abilities, operate like a charm upon weak minds.  I beg you will make my best & most respectful wishes acceptable to Mrs. Warren & believe always, with the most perfect esteem, Dear Sir, your most sincere friend  ""

  Sir [August ? 1782] (1) I now sit down agreeably to Your Request to recollect & commit to writing the Circumstances most worthy of Notice at the Time of Congress agreeing to the final Instructions to our Commissioners for negotiating Peace (2)-And to point out the Views which seemed to me chiefly to have governed that Body & induced them to direct our Commissioners to be ultimately guided by the Opinion &Judgement of the Court of France.  It will not be improper to permit some short Remarks upon the State of things from the Beginning of the War both before & after the French Alliance.  It was from the first Appearance of Things coming to Extremities admitted by all that the cheif if not the only Quarter from which we were to look for foreign Aid was France. As also that Foreign Aid was necessary that is to say that unless we had foreign Aid we could not expect to establish our Independence but after many years of suffering-a depopulated Country & deluge of Blood-& that most probably some of the States themselves might have been lost.  I do not remember any Difference of Opinion worth mentioning upon either of these two Points. Therefore our Views were directed to France. There was a much greater Difference of Opinion whether we should offer an Alliance to any other Power. AUGUST ? 1782  When Application was made to France that Court proceded with the utmost Caution. It was easy however from the whole Intercourse to perceive two things (1) That both The Court & Nation of France were very desirous that we should be supported & succeed (2) That at the same Time they were exceedingly doubtful whether it was safe for them to involve themselves much with us or openly to take our Part.  This Backwardness arose plainly from two different Causes which seemed to have almost equal Influence (1) Jealousy of us least we should not adhere to our Resolutions but draw back & make Peace with England (2) A necessary Fear of the Power of England and particular its Naval Force. They have hardly even yet been wholly free of either of these apprehensions.  The Affairs of the United States were never in a more critical situation than in December 1776 when Congress went to Baltimore-there never was a greater need for or greater Anxiety to obtain foreign Aid. The Number that attended Congress then was small but their Measures were decided & I believe judicious. I do not remember one Word of Despondency to have fallen from any Member or the most distant hint of a Desire to draw back & make submission to England. But the Means of persuading France to [in]terpose effectually was the great Subject of Deliberation & Discussion.  At that Time there was a Letter or Letters mentioned from a P[er]son in France which intimated that we should make Propositions to France to induce them to support us in an effectual Manner & since this Sentiment was Spoke of coming from that Quarter that if we could put France in the Place of England they would certainly protect us. This came from no official Persons nor was directed to any official Body nor had we any Reason to suppose that it was done at the Suggestion of the Court of France. I do not believe it was. The Proposition was not worthy of being taken into Consideration.  There were however several Persons in Congress who reasoned in this Manner. It is plain we cannot be supported without foreign Aid. There is no Place to which we can apply with Probability of Success but France. We know she is disposed to assist us but We have been given no Sufficient Inducement to that Power to interpose. We have offered nothing to France but what we have offered to every other Nation. The Proposals mentioned were to offer France an exclusive Trade with the united States for a limited Time-or to offer them an exclusive Trade in some particular Articles-or to offer them a Distinction from other Nations in form of Freedom from Imposts &c.  After a very deliberate & accurate Discussion it was the Opinion of a very considerable Majority of Congress to make no such Proposals. That they were contrary to the very Spirit of our undertaking-that if we were to be independent we could be independent of all the World-That to separate the united States from England was an   Object of itself sufficiently interesting to France-That it did not appear from any Communications made to our Commissioners that the Court of France desired any such Preferences but that their slowness & Caution arose from other Causes.  Therefore Congress sent the most solemn Assurances that we never would [give] up or in the least Degree recede from the Declaration of Independence. Soon after this Instructions were given to our Commissioners to propose to the Court of France that if they would enter into the War with us we would assist to the utmost of our Power in the conquest of the West Indies by furnishing Provisions & Stores for the Fleets & Armies of the King of France & by any other Way in our Power and that all such Conquests should remain with France. One of the Copies of these Instructions was taken on the Passage, published in London, republished in Charlestown S. Carolina & from these Papers published in Philadelphia yet neither Friends nor Enemies discerned or suspected from them the nature of the important Debate which had preceded them.  Soon after the Capture of Burgoyne the Court of France came to a determined Resolution to support us vigorously. The first Authentic assurance of this was contained in letters from our Commissioners of date Dec 16, 1777 & reached us about the last of January 1778 though the Treaty was not subscribed till the 6th of Feb. that year.  It is easy to see from the Treaty itself that the french Court was still somewhat apprehensive of the Issue for they put in the 8th Article that they were not to lay down their Arms till the Independence of America shall have been formally or tacitly assured &c.  In the Year 1779 When the first Proposal was made of attempting a Treaty of Peace under the Mediation of the Emperor & King of Spain Congress was called upon to consider & determine upon what Terms of Peace they would be willing to accept at the same time to be prepared for War. At that Time in a very large & full Conference with M. Gerard the french Minister he particularly & strongly recommended to Congress not to be too high in their Demands & indeed discovered an Apprehension that we might mar the Treaty by being so. Probably this might be occasioned or augmented by rash publications at that Time insisting that we ought not to make Peace with out having Canada, Florida & Nova Scotia ceded to us. The Minister took great Pains to represent to Congress that much would depend upon the Opinion the mediating Powers might form of our Temper & Disposition & that it was plain England took all public Pains to represent us as an ambitious People that wanted to extend their Bounds & would be dangerous to other Nations. In this Conference also he told us that the Events of War are uncertain, that therefore we ought not to be too confident & particularly he used this Expression that it was hard to say what might be the Effect of a decisive Victory at Sea. If Rodney's victory  in the West Indies had happened two years sooner than it did its Effects would have been perhaps fatal to us.  From this state of Things & all that followed I am convinced that nothing could be more false than the Supposition of some Persons that France wanted the War to continue for the Purposes of Ambition & the greater Humiliation of her Enemy. On the Contrary France always discovered a Desire to have the War terminated & listened to any Proposal for this Purpose perhaps prompted or suggested the Offers of Mediation from Spain, the Emperor & Russia. This was the natural Consequence of the two Causes above assigned for her slowness & Caution in entering upon the War.  Mr John Adams was chosen for the Purpose & the Commission for negotiating a Peace with great Britain was given to him alone. The Instructions at first sent to him contained a Description of our Claims as to Territory & made the following particulars essentially necessary to our making Peace. The Extension of our Bounds to the 45 Degree of Latitude North & to the Mississippi westward-The right of fishing on the Banks of Newfoundland-And a free Navigation of the Mississippi to the Mouth.  When Mr Adams was in France he thought it best to intimate to the Court of England as from himself that he had a Commission for negotiating Peace. The Court of France was of Opinion that that Time was not proper that things were not sufficiently ripe for it & that no such separate Intimation should be made & that it might encourage England in the Expectation of Engaging in a separate Treaty with America & dividing the Allies, a thing which they earnestly desired & made repeated attempts to accomplish. In a Correspondence between Mr Adams & the D. de Vergennes on this subject & also on the Subject of the Act of Congress of the 18th of March 80-estimating the continental Money at 40 for 1, Mr Adams maintained his Opinions with a Tenaciousness which gave great Offence to the Court of France & indeed such was the Manner of his writing upon these Subjects that he was finally forbid to continue it by an express order de par le roi.  In the year 1781 Congress entered upon the Reconsideration of the Instructions (3) formerly sent to Mr Adams particularly the making essential Conditions of the extensive boundary, of the fishing on Newfoundland & the free Navigation of the Mississippi. The last of these we heard from our Ministers was very disagreeable to the Court of Spain another viz the fishery not very agreeable to the Court of France who had not this Right by Treaty themselves, & the other We had Reason to suspect that the English might be very tenacious upon nor did we know what might be the Sentiments of the Mediating Powers or the P[owers] of Europe in general as to our Right or the Expediency of our having such extensive Dominions. It was also to be considered that as none of these particulars was specified in the Alliance with   France the Question was necessarily reduced to this Form whether though France should not support us in these Claims we would continue the War ourselves unless they were granted.  In this Situation after much & long discussion it was at last resolved as to all the three to depart from making them absolute & essential Conditions least at our Distance it should be a Bar to an otherwise honorable Peace. The Spirit therefore of the final Instructions was that the former should still serve to shew what we wished & thought we ought to Obtain but from a Desire of Peace we left it to our Ministers in Conjunction with our Allies to do what Circumstances should discover to be wisest upon the whole. When these Matters were transacting the Minister of France often intimated both to Committees in Conference with him & to particular Members of Congress that it would be highly agreeable to his Court that Congress should leave nothing as general or undetermined but say expressly upon every particular what they would & what they would not yield. It could not easily be known with Certainty whether this arose chiefly or only from their Jealousy of Mr Adams or whether they preferred upon the whole that as little should be left discretionary as possible least blame should be laid upon themselves.  It was however my plan that this could not be complied with. To have been specific upon every Point & to have brought the States generally to agree upon them as to what might & what could not be given up would have required much more Time than could be allowed by the State of Affairs & probably it never could have been or with Cordiality & Unanimity at all. Besides these are some of the particulars that it was clearly impossible to be absolute & explicit upon for example as to Boundary. How could it be said that it is the Interest of the United States to contract their Boundaries to the westward 100 miles in order to have other Points secured but no Necessity or Advantage as sufficient to make them come in 200 miles. How could the Congress judge of the Sentiments of the Public upon such Matters so as to be peremptory & to make a Demand at the Risk of our Independence or our very Existance. Therefore it was without much Difficulty agreed to continue the Instructions in the general & discretionary Form.  When the Instructions were therefore agreed upon Communications were made of them to the Minister of France & the Directions were given in the same Manner as always had been done to our Minister to make the most free & candid Communications of all his Proceedings to the Court of France & to avail himself of the assistance, friendship & Influence of that Court in all his Transactions. Then a Difficulty arose which was trying indeed, it appeared that this was not sufficient in the present Instance. The Minister read to the Committee the Letters of the D de Vergennes upon the Subject of Mr Adams  complaining of him in the Strongest Terms & expressing their fears of the negotiations being marred by his Stiffness & Tenaciousness of Temper. It was natural to suppose & probably was supposed by the Members of the Committee that the Minister wished Congress would take that Commission from Mr Adams & give it to some other though no such thing was read to the Committee from D. de Vergennes letters nor proposed by the Minister himself.  When this Matter was reported to Congress a very serious Deliberation was taken upon it. What Mr Adams had done by which he had incurred the Displeasure of the Ministers of the King of France had been undoubtedly from his Zeal & Attachment to the Interest & honor of the united States. His Ability & his unshaken Fidelity was well known. In such a Case to displace a Minister merely because he had given umbrage to some at the Court where he resided by an excess of well Meant Zeal seemed to be a most pernicious Example & probably would have the worst Effects upon succeeding ministers & therefore ought not to be done. The Writer of this Memorial of Facts in particular was clearly of Opinion that Mr Adams judged wrong in both the Points which he contested in his Correspondence with the D. de Vergennes the Reasons for which need not now be mentioned. Yet he was as clearly of Opinion to sacrifice a Minister of unquestionable Integrity ought not on any Acct to be submitted to merely because he had more Zeal than good Manners & therefore it was proposed that a Clause should be added to the Instructions to this purpose and that he should do nothing without the Consent C approbation of the Court of France.  Another Committee was appointed to confer with the Minister & made this Communication. But in Conference this also was in his Opinion insufficient. He repeated the Fears they had of Difficulties with Mr Adams & insisted that by this New Clause he was only bound negatively that he could not indeed do any Thing without the Consent of the Court of France but he might obstruct every Measure & unless he were perfectly satisfied effectually prevent any Thing being done.  When this was repeated to Congress the Matter appeared exceedingly delicate & difficult. It was discussed at great Length. All the Objections against removing Mr Adams remained in their full force. But on the other it appeared humiliating at least if not dangerous to deliver ourselves up entirely to the Court of France. However after full Deliberation it was agreed by the Majority in Congress to add to the Instruction that he should be ultimately guided by the Opinion & Judgement of the Court of France.  As This particular Resolution appeared so dubious to several Worthy Members of Congress & there were so many Attempts to recon-  sider & revoke it and as it will in due Time be the subject of discussion by the Public at large it seems necessary to recollect which Circumstances are fresh in our Minds & to record the Necessity or the Reasons that induced the Plurality to embrace it. It is not intended in this recollecting Memorial to attempt distinguishing between the Opinions of one Mem[ber] & another but just to mention as many as possible of the Sentiments that were proposed & advanced by those who finally voted for it.  It was plain that from the first Rise of the Controversy we had been greatly indebted to the Court of France. They had interposed effectually & Seasonably in our Cause. They had exerted themselves with much Vigor & Free[dom &] put themselves to a very great Expense upon our Acct. At the very Time when this Debate was agitated our most necessary Expenses were supported by them & even the Subsistence & Support of many Delegates in Congress was from Bills drawn upon France. We had accustomed ourselves & many public & Authentic Acts to call the K of France our great & generous Ally. Perhaps there were as humiliating Expressions on many of the public Acts & proceedings of Congress as could be in this Resolution which might well be considered as the effect of grateful & generous Sentiments.

  Sir. Philadelphia 2d September 1782 \""You know that the 8th. article of the Confederation says that the quota of each State in bearing the expence of The War shall be fixed according to the value of all located Lands & their improvements in those States respectively. The small States whose lands are valuable and much improved with Towns &c wish to throw the expences of the war on Lands at large by the hundred acres without regarding the quality or buildings. They would lay this beside the 5 per Cent Tax & an excise on Spirits & a Poll Tax. Many pretty reasons are given for this kind of Land Tax as that it will prevent frauds & perjury in valuing Lands & improvements & save a great deal of Trouble. That it will operate as an agrarian Law in making large Landholders despose of their lands & occasion the Country to be well settled. All these arguments, which are not without force, we are obliged to answer by one short & plain argument viz. considering the smallness of our Towns & the great tracts of broken, barren & piney Land in North Carolina, we should, on this plan, be charged with near double the quota of public Debt that should in Justice fall to our share. Therefore we are not bound in Justice to consent, nor are we bound in honor, because the confederation expressly fixes another mode. In our Public Letter (1) you was informed by Mr. Blount & myself that we should certainly oppose the report of the Committee (2) with this explanation I hope you will approve of our determination. Should we, supported as we shall be by the Southern States, be able to carry a Recommendation for Taxes to fund & pay our Quota of the National Debt according to the confederation it would certainly give you & every lover of the State pleasure to find that our State was among the first in adopting an Honorable & Just measure. Most States in the Union have their annual Elections in the autumn & of course their session for the more weighty business of  SEPTEMBER 3, 1782  Government is on the beginning of Winter. Congress will doubtless fix their plan & send on their recommendations before that time and as this scheme is to comprehend the payment of all past & future debts you will not wonder that we are solicitous that the assembly should meet especially when you add the seperate consideration, That it may be proper for our State to determine what is best to be done with the vacant Lands.\""  I have the honor to be, Hu Williamson ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 3. 1782. The cautious ear which your favr. of the 26 Aug.(1) shews that you gave to the communications of Genl Carlton is fully justified by the insidious marks they bear as well as by the general tenor of British proceedings. I am sorry that I am obliged to repeat my inability to add any new lights from Europe on this interesting subject. We are unhappily left exposed to all the misrepresentations which the Enemy may please to practise upon us.  It appears from a New York paper that the British Commander in Charleston had given notice on the 7th. Ulto. to the Inhabitants that he meant speedily to evacuate that Garrison; with an offer to transport to Augustine or elsewhere such as chose to adhere to the British cause. This information will probably have reached you before this does. The fermentation at New York is said to be much increased by it. We have no other materials for ascertaining the probability of an evacuation of the latter port than you will be possessed of.  I have seen nothing of the man in pursuit of your Nephews slave, from which as the French troops are now passing thro' this place, I infer that he has fulfilled his mission & returned. A slight indisposition for some days past has kept me from being about as much as I otherwise should I have however made application to Mr. de Marbois for his advice as to the most proper Course to be pursued; and he thinks it will be best to postpone a search under the orders of the Commanders till the army shall be stationary again. This will not I suppose be the case till they reach their destination.(2) At present they march in several divisions and halt but one day here. The implication which the frequent applications of this sort carry of at least a defect of vigilan[c]e against an illicit resort of slaves to the army renders them I believe rather unpleasant. If the overseer should not have recovered the slave & you have no acquaintances where the Army may finally halt, I will take every step in my power to have him found out & secured.  The effects of the dry weather here although less than you describe them in Virginia are very considerable already in the markets, and particularly in the article of forage. On the other side the rumors of peace have produced some abatement in the prices of imported articles.  Mr. Jones & his lady are mending fast but are not yet sufficiently recovered to remove from their present salubrious situation into the City.  I forgot to mention the unlucky accident which had happened to a ship of the line belonging to our Allies in Boston Harbour. As I observe however that it is published in the gazette, I need only confirm the fact.  SEPTEMBER 3, 1782  ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 3d. 1782. You will again be disappointed at the opening of this, since it will contain no European intelligence on the subject of peace. Among other reasons which render it astonishing that we should be so long uninformed, a material one is, that neither the Court of France nor our Ministers can be insensible of the inexpediency of leaving the people at large so much exposed to misrepresentations of the Enemy. I am happy to find by your letter of the 24th (1) and those recd. from my other correspondents by yesterday's post, that so cautious an ear is given to every thing which comes from them of a flattering aspect.  The inclosed hand bill published a few days ago will inform you of the steps taken at Charlestown towards an evacuation of that place. It is said to have given fresh violence to the fermentations at New York.  Another {petition from Kentucky) (2) has been {received by Congress}; contending {for the right of Congress to create new states and praying for an exertion of it in their behalf). A (copy will be sent) to {the Governor) by {the delegates). Mr. {Lee moved that the original) should be {referred to him by Congress. The debate) which {ensued) was terminated by {an adjournment and) has not {been revived).(3)  General Washington writes to Congress that Carlton had concurred in the proposition for a general Cartel so far as to appoint a Commissr. for that purpose.(4) There is little probability however that he has authority to settle such a cartel on the principles which Congress had in view, namely those of a national convention. It was thought by some that this would put to the test the sincerity of their professions on the subject of independence.  I believe I did not acquaint you on a former occasion that the prisoners who have lately returned from capitivity in England were {discharged in consequence of an agreement by Franklin) that a {like number of the army of Cornwallis) should be {given for them. This bold step) at first {gave much offence. Compassion however) for {the patriotic captives stifled reproaches). They will probably {come out yet unless) subsequent {events discountenance them).(5) SEPTEMBER 3, 1782  There are it seems (three letters in the post office from Carlton to the Governor} which do not {appear to have been licenced} nor is it {known how they got into that channel.(6) The curiosity of people on this point is in}con{ceivable}.  A very unlucky accident has happened to one of the fleet of our allies. After it got safe into the Harbour of Boston, the unskilfulness or negligence of a pilot suffered a 74 to strike on a rock, the wound occasioned by which proved mortal. Most of the furniture has been saved.  I have not yet presented the note to Cowan (7) which you have been so good as to enclose to me. The general obstacle to advances here to be replaced in Virga. has been the ballance in trade agst. the latter. This is the current answer to attempts to negociate draughts on Virga. My next will inform you of the result of the experiment of your note. If its success depends merely on a confidence in your credit, it will certainly be productive. Mr. Ross has unlimited credit in this place, may it not be made instrumental to our supply? At least it would be well to consult him when an occasion presents. His bills on Whiteside will command any sum that may be wanted.  Our friend Jones & his family have experienced much efficacy from the climate of Germantown. It will however be some days, perhaps weeks, before he fixes his abode in the City. The difficulty of getting a proper house seems likely to prove as tedious an obstacle as the convalescence of his family.  The french army has been passing through this place for several days Northward. The last division will pass tomorrow or the day after. The praises bestowed on their discipline & sobriety in Virginia, are repeated here with equal cordiality & justice.  ""

Congress expects to be reimbursed the Expences of maintaining the prisoners and are now and have been for some time endeavouring to bring the British General to a liquidation And settlement of those Accounts, and to force a payment of the Ballance, which must be very Considerable. In Conformity to the generals Ideas Congress adopted the plan of enlisting the Germans or permitting them to go into Service for a Certain sum of money to be paid to the United states; (3) this Scheme it seems is not likely to Succeed, but which has hitherto prevented any thing Else being done with them. Your plan of letting them out on Security for their return when Called for, is thought by many members of Congress to be a very good one, and perhaps would have been adopted had not the other have been recommended.  I think you have been Extremely Ill used in the instance you mention but the Secretary at war I believe is not to blame. He it is probable Knew nothing of you, And the person who has been prefered was I  SEPTEMBER 4,1782  suppose recommended to him. If Our Governor and Council had any hand in it I should think them most ungrateful and their Conduct highly Censurable, and if it is a fact I Shall make no Scruple in letting the Governor Know that I think you have been Ill treated.  I am pleased to hear you have been able to Collect So much of the red money, if the Executive do not think themselves Authorized to receive it only at the Exchange at the time of payment, yet the next assembly may think it right to Settle it at par, as the money went out as Specie and no loss will be Sustained.  Nothing less than being invested with all power both Civil and Military would in my opinion Satisfy a Certain Class of people and so little regard have they to the Common rights of mankind for which we have been so nobly Contending, that had they power I am persuaded, so far from reaping Any advantage from Shaking off our dependance upon great Britain that we should be reduced to a Mere abject State of Slavery than we should have been in by Continuing to be Connected with them, however I am not in the least Alarmed at their threats, and shall forbear Saying Any thing more on the Subject.  Congress have had no Official Accounts from Europe for near five months, neither has the Minister of France had any Since the 30th March. At a time when it is Said a general peace is negotiating, to be Keept so intirely Ignorant how matters are going on is very distressing And may prove very Injurious. I sincerely wish for peace, but I am Still afraid it is not so near as most people Seem to immagine. I cant help Suspecting the Sincerity of the British and that they are endeavouring to amuse. Charles Town I believe is Evacuated And it is probable the Enemy will leave new york Some time this fall. They Can employ those troops to much better purpose in the West Indies, and if hereafter they find it necessary, they Can repossess themselves of both these places whenever they please. We Shall leave this place about the Sixth or Eighth of November and Shall return either by Lancaster or Baltimore, A passage across the Bay being too uncertain at that Season. If you Could make it Convenient to Call at Philadelphia on your return home from the Eastern shore we Shall be happy in having your Company. Mother Sends you a yard of Cambrick and your other affairs Shall be Attended to. We are well little Cate was never better and g[ives] in love to pappa and her little sister & Brother.(4)  ""

  Dear Sir (1) Philadel. 5th Septr. 1782  I had the pleasure of your favour by Mr Ellice and feel much for your Situation. To be exposed for debts contracted for the publick while your Reward for your Services is withheld is a hard Case indeed. I will chearfully give you my candid Advice. Get your Accounts settled without Loss of Time. Mr Denning I think has Authority to do it. Without this it is impossible you can be relievd if there was ever so much money in the Treasury. Congress will not fail to urge the States to pay every publick Creditor & Servant their Just demands, and to provide Funds for the discharge of the Interest till the principal can be also Satisfied. The States must provide those Funds or be dishonored. Perhaps you have a Claim on your immediate Employer for the Advances made by his particular Engagement or direction.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Sepr. 9th. 1782 I am inform'd that a Committee of Officers of the Massachusetts Line of the Army, are appointed to attend at Boston the next Session of our Legislature on Matters specially relating to themselves. From what I have hitherto been able to collect of their Mission, I am induced to believe that it is principally to obtain some express Promise of our Legislature relative to half Pay for Life after the Close of the War. If this should be their Aim; a few Observations may not be unseasonable; It is happy for the State, that you were in Congress when the Memorial of the deranged Officers in the Connecticut Line, was considered.(1) It plainly appeared then, that Congress could not agree upon any Thing that would answer the Views of the Memorialists. The SEPTEMBER 9, 1782  Promise of half Pay for Life which was made the 21st of October 1780 has occasioned considerable Difficulty. It has obstructed the reducing of the Officers of the Army-because those who were opposed to half Pay, would not on that Condition Vote for a Reduction, & those that were for it, would not agree but upon that Condition.  But how can the Legislature of Massachusetts take up the Matter? Will the State undertake to make a Compromise for the half Pay? There could be no Objection to this, if the State could do it with Safety & give no Offence to several States in the Union. But as it is altogether a national Matter, if the State should enter into any such Agreement without the Consent & Approbation of Congress; you are sensible from what you heard observed, when the Memorial from the Connecticut Officers was under Consideration, that some of the States will not agree to excuse any State in Requisitions for half Pay, notwi [th] standing it may have made a Compromise with its own Officers.  If half Pay for Life is agreeable to the State, they can instruct their Delegates in Congress to be in Favor of it. But without such an Instruction, I beleive they will conclude that they are acting conformable to the Sentiments of the State, in opposing it. I have no doubt at present, But it will be finally referred to the several States to do in this Matter as Wisdom &Justice may direct. But whenever this is made a serious Question in Congress it will be warmly opposed; because some of the States are exceedingly in Favor of half Pay and will do all they can to make the discharging of it a national Matter, from a Supposition, that it will have a Tendency to cement the Union or, (which I think is more probable) from an uncertainty, whether, if it is referred, their own Legislatures will think it reasonable to give half Pay for Life to their Officers indiscriminately.  The Arguments in Support of half Pay for Life must be drawn from the Sufferings & hard Services of the Officers-The Sacrifice they have made in their private Fortunes-And the Injury done to their Constitutions-That their Mode of Life in the Army has disqualified them for any other Employ.  In Opposition to these Arguments, it will be said that no Country ever gave half Pay for Life, which did not maintain a standing Army- That in the American Army, as the Promise stands at present, it will be an exceeding unequal Reward.  Our Officers are very numerous, & many of them have not performed nine Months actual Service.  That in the Distribution of Rewards, equal Justice ought to be a governing Principle-But many of our old & best Officers will receive a much less Reward, than younger Officers. I need not endeavor to prove this, by Doctr. Halley's Calculations to ascertain the Value of Annuities.  What Reason then can be given, why an Officer that left a Family which depended upon him for Support & Protection, & hazarded his   Life at the Expence of all his domestic Feelings, should not be, at least, entitled to the equal Favors of his Country?  I flatter myself, that I am a very sincere Friend to the Army-But I am sure I should be unworthy of the least Confidence, if ever that Friendship should become so prevalent, as to obliterate the Idea that the Rights of the Citizen are to be preserved as inviolable as possible. The Army I doubt not mean to become Citizens again. But as an Army, making a special Contract for themselves, they are not Citizens-And let the Fatigues & Hardships of the Army have been ever so great, they cannot in Reason, found any Right to so much of the Interest of their Country, as would render it miserable afterwards, if not destroy those Priviledges, for the maintaining of which the Army was instituted. If it should appear that half Pay for Life is an excessive, as well as an unequal Reward-it would be paying an ill Compliment to the good Sense of the Army, to suppose that they would wish for any Thing inadmissable in it's Nature: But if admissable altogether disproportioned to the real Merits of it's Individuals-To undertake to prove that the Abilities of the Country will not enable it to comply with the Promise, would be a hard Task for me. I am not possess'd of Documents to go thro a Calculation with any Degree of Accuracy. But on general Principles I can ascertain the annual Amount of half Pay of the Army. The Amount of the Debts of the united States, & the Debts of the several individual States cannot be ascertained with any Degree of Accuracy.  The half Pay of the full regimental Establishment of the Army, for one Year is nearly as follows-  Infantry 88 Colonels @ 75 Dollrs. each per Ann. is 39,600 88 Lt. do. @ 60 360 31,680 88 Majors @ 50 300 26,400 792 Captns. @ 40 240 190,080 792 Lieuts. @ 26 2/3 160 126,720 792 Ensigns @ 20 120 95,040 88 Surgeons @ 60 360 31,680 88 Mates @ 40 340 21,120 Artillery 4 Cols. @100 600 2,400 4 Lt. do. @ 75 450 1,800 4 Majors @ 62 1/2 375 1,500 48 Captns. @ 50 300 14,400 48 Lieuts. @ 33 1/3 200 9,600 114 2d do @ do do 22,800 4 Surgeons @ 75 450 1,800 4 Mates @ 50 300 1,200  Cavalry 4 Cols. @ 93 3/4 577 1/2 2,310 4 Lt. do @ 75 450 1,800 4 Majors @ 60 360 1,440 24 Captns. @ 50 300 7,200 48 Lieuts. @ 33 1/3 200 9,600 24 Cornets @ 26 2/3 160 3,840 4 Riding Masters 33 1/3 200 800 4 Surgeons 60 360 1,440 4 Mates 40 240 960 20 Brigadier Genls. 1500 750 15,000 12 Major Genls. 2000 1000 12,000 683,810 Hazen's Corps consisting of four Regiments is not contain'd in this Estimate--Neither the Hospital Officers about fifty in Number, nor two Partizan Corps, are mentioned. It is impossible, for Want of accurate Returns, to know what Allowance ought to be made for Deficiencies in the several Corps of Officers--But the Deficiencies are nearly all in the lowest Grade of Officers. I beleive the annual Estimate cannot be short of the above Sum. As Massachusetts has hitherto been call'd upon, her Proportion will be about 120,000 Dollars to discharge the half Pay annually.  The Amount of the national Debt cannot be ascertain'd with Precision, but I apprehend we may place the Proportion of Masstts. @ 5,000,000 Dollrs. Let us suppose her private Debt to be- 4,000,000 Am 9,000,000 Annual Interest @ 6 per Ct. 540,000 Do. Amo. of half Pay 120,000 National Expendrs. to Support 30,000 Civil List of U.S. &ca--  Civil List of Masstts. and 60,000 other Contingencies  750,000 Dollars  I doubt not but you will be in my Opinion, that this Calculation is made upon the most moderate Principles. It is calculated for Peace; & goes not to the discharging of any of the Debt. But as the War is not yet closed, & probably not so near a Close, as many apprehend; we must calculate for War. How much Masstts. can pay annually without distressing her Inhabitants too much is a Question I cannot resolve. But until Credit is established upon a uniform steady Basis, discontent will prevail, &   Government will be obliged to push Taxation beyond what the People will chearfully submit to. Whilst on the one Hand, the public Safety is endangered thereby--on the other, the Cry of Injustice on Account of broken Promises, will not cease to be made by those, whom Experience may have taught to put little or no Confidence in public Faith. Until Principles are adopted & persevered in, that will operate equally among all Classes of People, the Brow of Sorrow & Uneasiness will not be smooth'd into a happy Contentment. But this is a Subject on which your superior Knowledge & Opportunity therefor, forbid me to say much.  The Subject of half Pay induced me to take up my Pen. It ought to be treated with Calmness & Deliberation--because many of the Officers of our Army merit very particular Acknowledgements from their Country. I beleive them to possess enlarged & liberal Minds; that they will always be ready to meet a fair Argument & give it a candid & fair Answer.  In October 1780 Congress reduced the Army to 57 Regiments (2)--And nearly 40 Corps of regimental Officers retired under the Promise of half Pay for Life. Comparing the great Number of Officers, with the Number of Men then & before in the Field, it must be concluded that many of the Officers never had a single Man to command in the Field.  Can the Officers then, in actual Service at this Time, advocate the Idea of half Pay in all its present Extent? On what Principle? Is it because the Officers may have had a continental Commission, & lived several Years upon the public without performing any real Services? No. Their Arguments must be drawn from a different Source. The Officer who retired under the Resolutions of Octor. 1780 performed less Service for his Country, than the Officer will have done, who is to retire on the first of January next--And if the War should not be closed--those who will remain in the Service several Years longer, will be entitled to more Attention, as having made a greater Sacrafice in the Service of their Country. Upon what other Principles can a Composition be made with the Army that will be satisfactory?  Let us view the Matter from Appearances at present in Congress--can the States which are sanguine in this Measure ever expect to carry it thro? When the annual Estimates are bro' t into Congress, the Amount of the half Pay must be particularly specified, & as it is an Appropriation of Money, Nine States must assent thereto by the Confederation, which is not at all probable will ever be obtained. In this View of the Matter the Promise of half Pay stands upon a very slender Foundation. It is probable that the Subject at large may be taken upon in January next, on a particular Reference: should the Officers of the Masstts. Line think it adviseable to Join a Petition to Congress, requesting Leave to compromise with the State, it would have a Ten-  dency to Support the Plan which Genl. Lincoln was about submitting to Congress. And I am perswaded that sooner or later the whole Matter will be referred, & recommended to the several States to do as their Wisdom may direct.(3) I must request you to excuse so long a Letter upon a single Subject.  I am, Dear Sir, with great Esteem, Your most obedient Servant,  Samuel Osgood ""

11120,dg01995,1782,John Witherspoon s Speech in Congress,"""John Witherspoon's Speech in Congress
  Mr President, [September 9, 1782](1) I must entreat the attention of the house, while I endeavour to state this subject with as much brevity and perspicuity as I am master of. It is not easy to forbear mentioning, yet I shall but barely mention, the distressed and unhappy situation of many of the persons concerned in the public loans. I shall also pass by their characters, as whigs and friends to the American cause. I shall pass by the services which many of them have rendered, in their persons, by their friends, by their purses, and by their prayers. These are affecting considerations, which ought not, and which I am confident will not fail, to have their weight with every member of this house. Let us then, leave these topics altogether, and let us confine ourselves to the duty and interest of the United States in their present situation, when the care of their affairs is committed to us who are here assembled. Public credit is of the utmost moment to a state which expects to support itself, at any time; but it is all in all in a time of war. The want of it defeats the wisest measures, and renders every department torpid and motionless. It cannot be denied, that by many unhappy, if not unwise measures, public credit among us has been reduced to the lowest ebb, first by a monstrous and unheard of emission of paper money; next by an act of bankruptcy, reducing it to six pence in the pound; then by a table of depreciation.(2) There remained but one thing which preserved us some degree of respectability, that the promises made to lenders of money before a certain period, had been kept for three years; but now as the last and finishing stroke, this also is broken to pieces, and given to the winds. SEPTEMBER 9, 1782  Let not gentlemen cry out as before, why distinguish these people from other public creditors? I do not distinguish them by asking payment for them alone; but I distinguish them, because their circumstances and disappointment give a new and disgraceful stroke to the credit of the United States. I distinguish them, because I hope that their sufferings and complaints may induce us to take some step towards the payment of all. Strange it is to the last degree, that this comparison should seem to set gentlemen's minds at ease--because great injury has been done to one class, therefore the same may and ought to be done to another. In this way it would be very easy to rid ourselves of both, and to say, why all this noise about loan-office certificates? have not all the receivers of continental bills suffered as much or more than they, and had the immense sum of two hundred millions sunk in their hands? If this would be a good answer in one cafe, it certainly would in the other. Now is it proper or safe in our present situation, to refuse all kind of payment to the public creditors in this country, so numerous and so variously circumstanced? Let us examine it a little. We are now endeavouring to borrow, and have the hope of borrowing money in Europe. Is this the way to succeed? Is it not possible, is it not highly probable, that our treatment of our creditors here, will soon be known there? Nay, are not some of our creditors interested in this very measure, residing there? Must not this repeated insolvency, neglect and even contempt of public creditors, prevent people from lending us in Europe? I am sorry to say it, but in truth I do believe that it is their ignorance of our situation and past conduct, that alone will make them trust us. I confess, that if I were at Amsterdam just now and had plenty of money, I would give what I thought proper to the United States, but would lend them none. It is to be hoped, that in time truth and justice will so far prevail, that our posterity will fee the necessity of doing their duty; but at pres-ent we seem but little disposed to it. By making some payment to the public creditors immediately, and prosecuting the measures already begun for further security, we should obtain a dignity and weight abroad, that would procure money wherever it could be found. Let us next consider the effect upon our credit at home. It has ever been my opinion, that if our security were good, and our credit entire, so that obligations by the public would be turned into money at any time, at par or at little less, we should find no inconsiderable number of lenders. Every thing of this kind proceeds upon such certain principles as never to fail in any instance of having their effect. From the general disposition, that prevails in this new country, real estate is less esteemed, and money at interest more, that is to say comparatively speaking, than in the old. Now, whatever success we may have in Europe, I am persuaded we should still need, or at least be much the better of loans at home, which are in their nature   preferable to those abroad; and therefore whatever leads utterly to destroy our credit at home, does an essential injury to the public cause. Nay, though there were not any proper loans to be expected or attempted at home, some trusting to public credit would be necessary, to make those to whom we are already indebted patient, or at least silent for some time. To this may be added that annihilating public credit, or rather rendering it contemptible, has an unhappy influence upon every particular internal temporary operation. People will not seek your service, but fly from it. Hence it is well known, that sometimes stores and ammunition or other necessaries for the army, have stood still upon the road till they were half lost for want of ready money, or people who would trust you, to carry them forward. We must now go a little further, and say, that if this proposition is inforced, it will be a great hindrance to the payment of taxes, and raising the supplies which must be called for from the states. I do not insist upon what has been already mentioned, that the payment proposed would enable many to pay their taxes; because, though that is certainly true with respect to those who shall receive it, and though it is admitted they are pretty numerous, yet in my opinion, it is but a trifle to the other effects of it, both in the positive and negative way. It would give dignity to the public spirit, and animation to the people in general. It would give the people better thoughts of their rulers, and prevent murmuring at public persons and public measures. I need not tell this house how much depends in a free state, upon having the esteem and attachment of the people. It is but a very general view that people at a distance can take of the management of men in public trust; but in general it is well known, they are abundantly jealous, and as ready to believe evil as good. I do not speak by guess, but from facts, when I tell you that they say, we are now paying prodigious taxes, but what becomes of all the money ? The army, say they, get none of it, being almost two years in arrear. The public creditors say they get none of it, not even interest for their money. This was told me by the county collector of Somerset county, New Jersey, who was not a contentious man, but wished to know what he ought to say to the people. Now this small payment, as it would be very general, would be much talked of; and I am persuaded, for its general good influence, would be worth all, and more than all the sum we shall bestow. I have heard it said in some similar cases, you must sometimes throw a little water into a pump, in order to bring a great deal out of it.  Now, on the other hand, what will be the consequence of a total refusal? You have told the public creditors, that you have no money in Europe to draw for. They will very speedily hear of this loan in Holland. They are sufficiently exasperated already; this will add to their   indignation. They really are already sore; their minds will be rankled more than ever. They are looking with an evil eye upon some new men coming into play, and thinking themselves unjustly and ungratefully used. I believe they are not so much without principle, as to turn their backs upon the public cause; but a spirit of faction and general discontent, upon such plausible grounds, may do it essential injury. They may combine to refuse their taxes; and if any such unhappy association should be formed, it would spread; and many from a blind attachment to their own interest, would pretend to be upon the same footing, though they have no concern in the matter: and if this disposition should become general, it would put an entire stop to all our proceedings. This discouraging prospect is not merely founded on conjecture. I have been told that there have already been meetings for entering into concert for refusing to pay taxes. Is it possible we can, in our circumstances, more profitably employ the sum mentioned in the motion, than in giving satisfaction to a deserving body of men, and in preventing evils of so alarming a nature. It is possible, Sir, that some are comforting themselves with their own sincerity and good intentions; that they ultimately resolve to pay all honourably; that they have taken, and are taking measures to prepare for it. A sum of money is called for on purpose to pay the interest of the public debts; and the five per cent. impost is appropriated to the same purpose. But, Sir, it will take a considerable time before the most speedy of these measures can bring money into the treasury; and in the mean time the late step of refusing to draw bills, has given such a stroke to loan-office certificates, that their value is fallen to a very trifle--the spirits of the people are broken--a gentleman told me the other day, I see the loan-office certificates are gone, as well as all the rest of the money. The inevitable consequence will be, that hard and irresistible necessity, or incredulity and ill humour, will make them part with them for a mere nothing; and then the greatest part of them by far will really be in the hands of speculators. When this is notoriously the case, I shall not be at all surprised to find that somebody will propose a new scale of depreciation, and say to the holders, you shall have them for what they were worth and generally sold at, at such a time. Past experience justifies this expectation, and no declaration we can make to the contrary, will be stronger than that of Congress in the year 1779, that they would redeem the money,(3) and that it was a vile and slanderous assertion, that they would suffer it to sink in people's hands. I know particular persons also, who by believing this declaration, lost their all. Now, if this shall be the case again, public faith will be once more trodden under foot; and the few remaining original holders of certificates will loose them entirely, being taken in connection with those who purchased them at an under value.

  My dear Sir Philada. Sepr. l0th. 1782 The loss of the French 74 in Boston Harbour presented an occasion which was embraced by Congress, of making a small requital to their Ally for his benevolent exertions in behalf of the U.S. They have directed the Agent of Marine to replace the loss by presenting in the name of the U.S. the Ship America to the Chevr. de la Luzerne for the service of his M. C. M. The States were unanimous in this vote. The {dissenting members were Bland and Jones of Georgia}.(1) Independent of the motive of Gratitude, it was {certain that our resources could not launch the ship before the winter; that before the spring she would be scarcely worth launching; that it was prudent therefore to dispose of her and more so by gift to France than by sale to either France or Spain}.  The report of the Grand Committee \""that the western lands if ceded to the U. S. would be an important fund &c.\"" was the subject of the deliberations of Congress on Thursday & Friday last.(2) After the usual discussion of the question of right, and a proposal of opposite amendments to make the report favor the opposite sides, a turn was given to the debate to the question of expediency, in which it became pretty evident to all parties that unless a compromise took place, no advantage could ever be derived to the U.S. even if their right were ever so valid. The no. of States interested in the opposite doctrine rendered it impossible for the title of the U. S. ever to obtain a vote of Congress in its favor, much less any coercive measures to render the title of any fiscal importance; whilst the individual States having both the will & the means to avail themselves of their pretensions, might open their land offices, issue their patents, and if necessary protect the execution of their plans; without any other molestations than the clamours of individuals within & without the doors of Congress. This view of this case had a manifest effect on the most temperate advocates of the federal title. {Witherspoon} moved a set of resolutions recommending to the States which had made no Cessions to take up the subject, & to the States whose cessions were not entirely conformable to the plan of Congress, to reconsider their acts;(3) And declaring that in case of a compliance of the several States claiming the back lands, none of their determinations with regard to private property, within their cessions shall be reversed or altered without their consent, except in cases falling within the 9th article of the Confedon. On this motion the report was postponed & these resolutions committed. The report of the Committee on the last article will probably determine the ultimate sense of Congress on the pretensions of the companies. Every review I take of the Western territory produces fresh convic- SEPTEMBER 10, 1782  tion that it is the true {policy of Virginia} as well as {of the United States to bring the dispute to a friendly compromise}. A separate {government can not be distant; and} will be an {insuperable barrier to subsequent profits}. If therefore the decision of the State on the {claims of the companies} can be {saved} I hope {her other} conditions will be {relaxed}. On the notification given to the inhabitants of Charleston of the approaching evacuation of that garrison, a committee of the Merchts. with the license of the commanding officer waited on Govr. Matthews with a proposition; that they might be permitted to remain in the town in the character of neutrals for 18 Months, to sell their goods freely for money or produce, and remove with their effects to G. B. or elsewhere finally, together with several other indulgences still more extraordinary. The answer permits them to stay for 6 months, to sell their goods as requested, & to make their remittances to Neutral ports. I fully anticipate your feelings on this transaction. Mr. Cohen has given me hopes that your letter will produce the desired effect within the present week.(4) The bill on Mr. Holker for 200 Drs.(5) is very acceptable, but both together do not make me independent even for a moment. The continuance of your exertions which your favr. of the 30 Ulto.(6) promises will therefore be necessary. I need not repeat to you how sensible I am of your kindness on this subject. I am making out a State of my accts according to the request of the Auditors, on the new idea; & expect to transmit it soon in a form which will render less of their labor necessary. With it I shall inclose a copy of the scale of Depreciation of this State.(7) Genl Washington has moved with his principal force down to Verplanks point. His object, if he has any material one, is not yet disclosed. 7 Ships of the line part of a fleet under Lord Hood is arrived at N. York, and 1500 foreign troops have embarked for Halifax. We are still left by our Ministers in the most painful suspence with regard to events in Europe. The arrival of a packet at New York has supplied us with the articles published in the inclosed Gazette. The new revolution in the British Cabinet in favor of the Shelburne party has a sinister aspect on peace. Unless however this party be reinforced out of the late adminisuation it must be too feeble to resist the popular champions whom they have exiled from office. Adieu. ""

  Dear Sir, Philada. Septr. 10th 1782 Your favor of the 14th of August came safe to hand on the sixth of September, for which I am much obliged to you.  The prospect of an evacuation of Charlestown had reached us several days before by the way of New-York. Prior to that we had sent in to Sir Guy Carleton the names of 429 persons to take the benefit of the flags which he had on a former occasion agreed to grant.(1) They are now in high spirits & determined to return as soon as possible. The evacuation of Charlestown will not terminate the troubles of the people of Carolina. I forsee much to be done & more to be suffered before the country will be completely organized in every department. Now is the time for a spirit of moderation & sound policy to manifest itself. I very much fear the madness & unforgiving temper of some whigs. To reconcile, to unite, or as the chymists say, to amalgamate the people into one homogeneous body would be a divine work. I feel myse[l]f happy that my tour of duty lies in a distant part of America.  This will be handed you by an express who carries to you a resolution of Congress countermanding your orders to repair to head quarters; (2) this resolution would not have been carried at any other season; but, it was said on all hands your army would be useless here till next Spring, & that you might as well remain in Carolina till February. I am therefore well pleased that the enemy did not evacuate as early as was at first expected. If you think proper to undertake the reduction of Augustine, the resolution is expressly worded in such a manner as to leave it fully in your power. It is certain that the Southern states would be greatly releived by a successful expedition into E. Florida. The people of that province will receive such a powerful reinforcement of refugees all instigated by a spirit of revenge, & a wish to repair their broken fortunes, that Carolina & Georgia (when left without an army) would probably  SEPTEMBER 10, 1782  suffer more from their incursions than when the British army was cooped up within the walls of Charlestown & Savannah.  We have no accounts from our ministers in Europe respecting the negotiations for peace. So long an interval between dispatches from Dr Franklin, Mr Adams &c was never known. We know nothing of that business but through our enemies. This circumstance makes us very cautious in every step we take.  Congress is now busy in arranging their public debts. They have voted 1,200,000 dollars to be immediately quotaed on the several states to pay the interest due to all public creditors. To appropriate the western territory as a continental fund to pay the principal is the wish of the smaller states, but, the scheme is warmly opposed by the larger ones. Mr Morris recommends duties & taxes to operate all over the states; but, the members of Congress seem averse from this scheme, & to prefer an assignment of a quota to each state, & they to use their own discretion in raising that sum. Your letter of the 11th of March gave offence to a few individuals in Congress; but, their number was small.(3) The Legislature of New-York has recommended a continental convention for the purpose of strengthening the hands of Congress. The idea is a good one, & I wish it to take place but, I fear that Congress will not adopt it.  Yours most respectfully, David Ramsay ""

Certicates & other publick Debts when liquidated. The Resolves are ordered to be forwarded by the S. I.

Finance was, by a Resolve yesterday, directed to order the Commissioners of the L. Offices in the several States to Issue no more Bills of Exchange for Interest which hath or may become due since that date.(2)  In Consequence of the Loss of the Magnifique in Boston Harbour, Congress, to express their Sense of the generous Exertions of his most Ch. Majesty have directed the Agent of Marine to make a Tender of the America the 74 Gun Ship now in New Hamp to Monsr. de la Luzerne for the Service of his Majesty, which has been accepted.  The British Genl. & Adml. have agreed to nominate Commissioners for settling a General Cartel, but from Circumstances we have no Expectation of it's taking place soon.

  Sir Philada. Sept. 10. 1782. Your Excellency's favors of the 23 and 30 Ulto.(1) were recd. yesterday. Not recollecting that any resolutions of Congress declaratory of their ultimate sense with regard to confiscations, have been published, we apprehend that some mistake must have led to your remarks on that subject.(2) The Journals of Congress for 1779 are not yet compleated. As soon as they are you shall be furnished with a copy. The propriety of applications to the British Commander for a restitution of slaves having never been agitated in Congress, it is impossible for us to inform you with certainty in what light such a Step would be viewed by them. We can only say that in general, all separate & partial transactions between individual States and the Enemy are considered as disaccording with the Spirit of the confederacy, that a solicitation of favors from the Enemy at this juncture may not be very politic, and that there does not appear to us any sufficient evidence that the application in question if made would be attended with success.(3) The loss of the Magnifique a French Ship of 74-Guns in the Harbour of Boston, was thought by Congress a fit occasion for testifying their sense of the exertions of our Ally in favor of the U States; and they have accordingly directed the Ship America to be presented to the Chevr. de la Luzerne for the service of his Most Christian Majesty. General Washington has moved with the chief part of his army down to Verplank's point. Seven Ships of the line, part of a fleet from the West Indies commanded by Admiral Hood, are arrived at New York; and 1,500 foreign troops have embarked at that place for Halifax. The Gazette herewith enclosed contains all the intelligence which has yet transpired from the packet lately arrived at N. York from England. Congress are still destitute of intelligence from their Ministers in Europe. The Minister of France is in the same predicament with respect to his Court. It may not perhaps be amiss to suggest to your Excellency that advantage will probably be taken of this seeming reverse in the prospect of peace, to Speculate on the Staple of Virginia. We hope our Country men will be on their guard against such artifices. We have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest regard, yr Excelly's obt. servts. Theok. Bland Jr J.

  Philadelphia, Sept. 11, 1782. A Ship arrived here last Evening from Holland, which Place she left the 28th of July: she is loaded with Goods on Account of the United States to the amount of Thirty Thousand Pounds Sterling. Letters by this Ship confirm the Report of the Capture of the greatest Part of the Quebec Fleet. We have no Particulars of the Negotiations of a Peace so much talked of. Mr. Adams is still in Holland. Mr. Jay is in France. It is supposed that the late Change in the British Ministry, will for some Time prevent a general Peace, as the present Ministry are much averse to the American Independance. Congress have for some Time been employed in devising Modes for establishing Funds in the different States on General Principles, for the Payment of Interest on Moneys which now on or hereafter may be loaned: a Land Tax is talked of, and also a Poll Tax, but as all the states must agree, when we consider, that the 5 pr Cent act is not yet complied with, I have not much reason to expect the several States will readily adopt this, if it should be recommended; it is agreed for the present to raise 1,200,000 for the Payment of Interest of Money loaned and for the Interest of debts due from the United States; the Inhabitants of each state to be paid their Interest out of the Monies to be raised in the State to which such Inhabitant shall belong or when the Money was loaned. The Quotas of the States as agreed on are different from the last Quota in respect to each other. Connecticut is 133,200; New York 54,000; New Jersey 66,000.(1) The Resolutions of our Legislature recommending the Con- vention, (2) will not I believe have the Effect that many Gentlemen expected, as but very few States seem disposed to grant further Powers  SEPTEMBER 11, 1782  to Congress, and tis said some of the States will not adopt the Act of Congress of for fixing the Quotas for past expenditures otherwise than is directed by the Confederation; however, the Documents our Committee may procure probably hereafter may be of use to the State. With respectful Compliments to Mrs. Clinton, I am, Sr, with great Esteem your Excellencys very Humble Servt, Ezra L' Hommedieu Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 8:37-38.  1 As these 1783 quotas were the states' share of a total requisition of $1,200,000, their shares were 11.1%, 4.5%, and 5.5%, respectively, compared to 1782 shares of 9.3%, 4.7%, and 6.1%. Cf. JCC, 21:1090, 23:564. For the unsuccessful effort of L' Hommedieu and Duane to reduce New York's quota by $9,600, see JCC, 23:569.  2 The New York Assembly had adopted a series of resolutions on July 20 and 22 at the urging of Alexander Hamilton and Philip Schuyler, calling on Congress to reform its fiscal affairs and to summon a \""general Convention of the States, specially authorised to revise and amend the Confederation.\"" The resolutions were referred on August 16 to a grand committee on the public credit, where they remained unacted upon. On April 28, 1783, they were recommitted to another committee, of which Hamilton was then a member. No action resulted, however, and the measures were referred on July 23 to yet another committee which submitted a report on September 2 calling for postponement of any consideration of the convention proposal until the states completed action on the impost recommended April 18, 1783.

  Dear Sir Sepr. 11. 4 oClock The Gentleman by whom I wrote this morning havg. waited till I had the opportunity of knowing the contents of the dispatches from Holland, I take advantage of it to add that we are disappointed by their silence with regard to peace. Those from Mr. Adams relate cheifly to his transactions with the States General.(1) A letter from Mr. Laurens of the 30th of May informs us that he is returning to U. S. having declined the service of Minister for peace.(2) He appears to have been very unhandsomely dealt with by Mr. A. with respect to his Comission for Holland, which will no doubt be the foundation of mutual enmity. There is an uninteresting part of a letter from Mr. Dana, the first pages of it having been omitted. Mr. Berkeley writes on the 13th of July that the Mail from England subsequent to the resignation of Fox, Burke &c. breathes war.(3) He confirms the success of the combined fleets agst. the Qubec &c. & the sailing of a fleet from the Texel consisting of 11 Sail of line--5 or 6 frigates, &c--to cruise in the N. Seas, & the retreat of Adml Howe into Port. A N. Y. paper of the 7 contains a very interesting conversation on [the 10]th July in House of Lords between Shelburne & th[e Duke] of Richmond on the subject of Ministerial politics, in which the latter assigns his reasons for not following the example of Fox &c, and both their sentiments with respect to American Independence. The Duke of Richmond seems tolerably well reconciled to it, but Shelburnes speaks out his antipathy without depriving himself of the plea of necessity. He professes to adhere however to the principles which the Administration carried into office relative to the war agst. America. I have written this in extreme haste.

Mr. Laurens gives a considerable History of his Conduct. He says his sufferings have been very great. But that he never once failed to be pointed in his Opposition to them when Opportunity offered--both privately & public he avowed the genuine Sentiments of a true American. I do not feel very unhappy that Mr. Adams is likely to enjoy the fruit of his own Labors obtained without Money, without Corruption, without servile Flattery but by the still, small Voice of Reason. I expect Mr. Sumner here every Hour (3)--And then, I hope to see Boston soon.

  Dr. Sir, Philada. 15th Septr. 1782. I loose no time in answering your confidential favour of the 7th of Septemr Instant; because it will give me great Pleasure, if in my power, to relieve you from uneasy Reflections. As to the payment of Interest on bills of Exchange I advise you to adhere strictly to Mr Morris's Instructions and then you will not be personally exposed. Where there may be room for doubt you can have it cleard by writing me a Line.  Mr Lhommedieu Joind me a few days after I had parted with Mr Scott so that the Delegation did not Suffer.  I feel much obliged by your Intention to do Justice to your Delegation in providing for it a regular Support. The Inconveniencies, and even distresses, which I have suffer'd and now sustain; by having my provision withheld, demand Redress; and I hope I may add that some Attention is due to my faithful and disinterested Services.  In Answer to that part of your Letter which relates to the Appointment of the Continen[ta]l Receiver of Taxes be pleased to indulge me to state the following facts.(1) By Act of Congress of the 2d of July I had the honour of being appointed Chairman of a Committee of five to enquire fully into the proceedings of the Department of finance:(2) like Committes were at the same time appointed for the other great Departments, in order that they might be responsible agreeably to the Institution.  In the Course of this Examination which is still executing, the Financier explaind the motives which induced him to seperate the office of Receiver, from that of Continental Loan officer. He observed  SEPTEMBER 15, 1782  it was necessary for him to act on general Rules--That the Receiver was an officer whose Diligence & punctuality were of the utmost moment to him. That some of the Continental Loan Officers were neither regular in their Returns, nor clear in their Accounts: That, if they had all been capable, it woud be improper to throw the Supplies for the War into the hands of the Loan officer as it might expose him to clamour if he refusd to pay the Interest when he had money: while, if he satisfied those Claims, the Army might suffer & the publick Safety be endangerd. These were some of The Reasons which he said had induced him to lay it down as a general Rule to keep the two offices of Receiver and Loan officer seperate; and from that Rule he had not deviated in a single Instance.  He added that he had taken Care, at the same time, that this System shoud bring no Augmentation of Expence: for the Receiver was to be allowed no more than the same Commission on the Tax, which woud have gone into the hands of the Loan officer had the two offices been United.  If, Sir, you are not wholly satisfied with this Regulation, of one thing at least you must be convinced that it can imply no Suspicion \""of your Honesty, Capacity, or want of Friends\"" and that it never was intended to wound your Feelings, & cannot injure your Reput[atio]n. Since my last Congress have pressed the States with the utmost warmth to collect 1,200,000 Dolls. to pay the Interest of the Money borrowed from their fellow Citizens, On the publick faith & for the publick Safety. They were compelled to this Requisition by the obstinacy of Rhode Island whose Assembly persists in withholding their Assent to the 5 per Cent duty on Imports & Prizes: & have consequently suspended the entire Operation of this essential Measure.  Be pleasd to present my Compliments to your fire side and to believe me to be--with great Respect, Your most Obedient humble Servant, Jas. Duane  ""

  Sir,(1) Philada. Sepr. 16. 1782 The Legislature of Pennsyla. have Appointed Judge Bryan, Mr Bingham, & Mr. Gray Commissrs. for dividing the Islands & settling the Jurisdiction of the River Delaware, but have not compleated their instructions which are now under Consideration.(2) As our Legislature will meet this week, they will it is presumed instruct their Commrs., which appear necessary, as their Appointment does not appear to Convey any power more than Obtaining information and reporting the same--this may also be necessary to undergo a revision.(3) The business may be easily Accomplished if two matters can be agreed to. One is a reciprocal Jurisdiction on the Navigable part of the Delaware-this I mentiond to you as in my opinion Necessary, since which I am told the same sentiments prevail here; this is intended to grant Jurisdiction to each state over Vessels belonging to the same, and over persons going therefrom to the other while on the River. The other matter is the Island Opposite to Philada. which I believe will be strongly insisted upon to belong to them, and I can see no reason for rejecting their Claim, as it is of importance to them & none to us--unless we should wish to have it purely to injure Pennsyla. without any Advantage resulting to New Jersey. In this settlement I Consider the Islands as belonging to no state, and the conver in jure of both must be Attended to. No difficulty I believe will attend the Division of the other Islands, and I suppose some Equivalent might be Obtained for the Island Above Alluded to. These matters I mention to you to Obtain instructions thereon from the Legislature when they must, as otherwise we should be at a loss how to Conduct.  I hope you will communicate this to Dr. Henderson and Consult him previous to any Communication to the Legislature.  I must inform you that what I have said respecting the desires or intentions of Pennsylvania. I have not learned from the Commissioners but from Other Gentlemen who have Conversed with me upon the Subject, but who I believe delivered the Sentiments of the Commrs.  Delaware had instructed their Delegates respecting the Island and Jurisdiction of the Delaware, which upon examination does not appear to Convey powers necessary for effecting any thing.(4) The proceedings of our Legislature I have Communicated to Governor Dickinson who promised to lay the same before the Legislature of Delaware at their meeting this fall.

  My dear Sir Philada. Sepr. [16] 1782 (1) My letters by a private hand subsequent to the last post have anticipated the cheif intelligence from Holland which I had allotted for the post of this week.(2) I have however one important article which at that date lay under an injunction of secrecy which has been since taken off. Mr. Adams we are informed has contracted with a mercantile House in Holland for the negociation of a loan of 5 Million of Guilders, or about 10 Million of livres, for which he is to give 5 Per Ct. interest, and 41/2 Per Ct. for commission & other douceurs & charges, which will raise the interest to about 6 Per Ct. The Principal is to be discharged in five annual payments, commencing with the 10th year from the date of the loan. When the dispatches left Holland, upwards of 11/2 Million of guilders had been subscribed, and upwards of 1 Million actually received. The Contractors however made it a condition that none of the money should be paid to the U. S. until the contract should be ratified by Congress. This ratification passed on Saturday (3) and, its arrival in Holland will place under the orders of Mr. M.(4) the money which shall then have been procured. How far the amount will by that time have augmented is uncertain. The Contractors seemed to be tolerably sanguine but not absolutely sure, of getting the whole sum. The partial subscription already secured, is a most seasonable relief to the department of finance which was struggling under the most critical difficulties. In addition to the preceding fund Congress have been led by a {dispair of supplies from the states to sue}(5) for a {further loan of four million dollars} for the {service of the} ensuing and {the deficiencies of the present years}.(6) This {demand will be addressed} in the first  SEPTEMBER 16, 1782  instance to {the court of France. In case of miscarriage there an experiment} will be made on the {liberality of our new friends}. The Legislature of Rhode Island has broke up without acceding to the impost of 5 Per Ct. Congress have apportioned 1,200,000 Dollars on the States for the payment of interest to the public creditors. Virga. is rated somewhat lower in this requisition than in the last; not however without complaints from some quarters. On these subjects you will have full information from Mr. Lee who will set off in a few days he says for Virga. in order to be at the October Session.(7) I should have told you that some progress had been made by Mr. Adams in the Treaty of Amity & Commerce with their High Mightinesses. His propositions with the remarks & amendments of the College of Admiralty had been taken ad referendum. It is somewhat extraordinary that he should omit to send us a copy of those propositions & remarks. He had taken no steps towards a {treaty of allyance}.(8) The debates and explanations produced by the resignation of Mr. Fox and his adherents, have unveiled some of the arcana of the British Cabinet. I inclose them for you complete, as far as they have been published here. If there be any sincerity in the party remaining in office it would seem that the war is not [to] be pursued against the U. S. nor their independence suffered to be a bar to peace. We shall be able to judge better of their sincerity when the proceedings of Mr. Grenville come to our knowledge. Mr. Cowhan has advanced me £50. of this currency which he says is the utmost that his engagements & the scarcity of money will permit. I have given him an order on you for that sum, in favr. of his partner at Richmond. Sepr. 17. On Friday two large French frigates bringing money &c for the French army & despatches for Congress & the F. Minister came into Deleaware bay. For want of Pilots in time they got entangled among the bars which perplex the navigation of this bay. The appearance & bearing of the British fleet after pilots were obtained rendered it impossible for them to return into the proper channel. The only expedient that remained was to push forward & attempt under the advantage of high water to force a passage through the shoal which obstructed them. In this attempt one of them succeded. The other stuck in the sand, and was lost. All the public Stores, particularly the money on board have however been fortunately saved. The Capt. & Crew we fear have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. The Ship it is supposed can not be raised by them, having been skuttled before they took possession of her. The Frigate which escaped is up at Chester. We expect the Despatches will be here today. The Marquis Viominil and 20 or 30 other French officers have returned in these ships. The Post is not yet come in. Your trip to Wmsbg. I supposed pre- SEPTEMBER 17, 1782  vented you from writing by him. We can not tell whether he is sick or has been intercepted. The former is the most probable supposition. ""

This was referred to a Comtt consisting of Mr Duane, Mr Madison and Mr Rutledge who next morning, September 17th, reported two resolutions which were immediately read and agreed to by Congress. The first was to this effect, that Mr Laurens be informed that the reasons which induced Congress to appoint him one of their ministers for negotiating a peace still subsist, and therefore Congress cannot dispense with his services. And the other was to this effect, that the ministers of the United States for negotiating a peace be instructed, each of them, upon receiving information of the time and place of opening the negotiations, immediately to give notice thereof to the rest in Europe in order that they may attend.(2) SEPTEMBER 17, 1782  MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 154-55.  1 Henry Laurens' May 30, 1782, letter to Congress is in PCC, item 89, fols. 225-32; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 5:454-59.

  Dear Sir Philada. Septr. 17th. 1782. After I had wrote my Letters of the 11th Instt. official accounts from Holland as late as 13th July were received by the Arrival of a Vessell in this Harbour. I Just noted this in my Letter to the Honble. the President of the State (1) & Mentioned that those accounts were very agreeable Especially in some particulars which I was not then at Liberty to Mention. This Vessell is One of Three which was Loaded in Holland with Cloathing &c. on account of these United States, which was purchased & Expected would have been brought here some Considerable time past, but was delayed by Vile Mismanagement, (2) are informed that another of these Vessels is Arrived at Boston by which Suppose you have the accounts of the United Provinces acceding to our Independance, if you have not you will see them by the News-Papers; The particular Circumstance which I had reference to in my Note in the President's Letter is the Negociation of a Loan in Holland. Mr. Adams informs that he has Opened a Loan for 5,000,000 Guilders (Equal to about 1,875,000 Dollars) this Loan is going forward as fast as can be Expected, about one fourth part of the Money was ready when these accounts came away; This will be of great service to us & I doubt not but it will be better managed than some Loans have heretofore been.  I think our Enemies must have given up all Hopes of making a Seperate Peace with Holland, but believe they have some Expectations that the Empress of Russia will Interfere in their favour. Their is some probability that they will Evacuate New-York this fall, but this is altogether Uncertain. It is the general Opinion that the Commanders at New York are not yet Informed of the Intentions of the British Ministry in this particular. If they Should leave that place it is probable they will send a Considerable force into Canada in order to Extend the Boundaries of that Government Agreeably to the Quebec Bill, and that they will Maintain as much Territory to the Eastward as possible, prosecute the War against our Allies with their Utmost Vigour, &  SEPTEMBER 17, 1782  Endeavour by their Emissaries to make a Seperate Peace with us, but this is Conjecture, for my Own part I am at a loss to know whether their withdrawing their Troops with those Views would be of any advantage to us; but if they should meet with any Considerable Loss in the Naval Way before the Close of the Year, they may be Lead to think Seriously of a Genl. Peace the Coming Winter. You have undoubtedly seen the Resolutions for Reducing Officers in our Army, and those other Resolutions respecting Interest on Loan Office Certificates.  Congress have agreed to call on the several States for 1,200,000 Dollars to pay the Interest of Domestic Debts, the plan is not yet Compleated but it is Intended that Bills be Drawn on the Several States for their proportions of this sum and that the Holders of public securities within Each State shall be Intitled to payment out of the Monies raised in such State before any others are paid, perhaps this Tax will not be agreeable to the Ideas of some, but what can be done better; the Resolution to prevent Drawing Bills was absolutely Necessary at the time it passed, as we did not then know of any funds on which we had a Right to Draw, and it is in my Opinion Ill policy to pay the Interest of Domestic Debts by foreign Loans. I Suppose you have the Resolutions of N. York (passed some time Since) with respect to Holding a Convention for the purpose of Considering the Articles of Confederation &c.(3) That those Articles are Deficient and Imperfect in some degree must be allowed, but the Query is whether their is any, the least probability that a Convention would make any material alterations for the better, which would probably be agreed to by the Several States; I Suppose Our Legislature will be adjourned before this Reaches you, I Should Imagine that they have not come to any determination on this matter.(4) You will observe by the Resolutions for Reducing the Officers &c. that they are to retire agreeably to former Resolutions which gave Half pay, perhaps this will not be agreeable to our Legislature, but their was no other alternative, they would have been Continued drawing whole Pay, Subsistance &c. if this had not been done--the saving which will be made by this Reduction is Calculated at about 700,000 Dollars Per Annum.(5) In Two of my Letters to the Honble. the President of the State I wrote respecting Depreciation &c. due to the army for the years 1780 & 81.(6) I have not had any thing in Answer therefore Conclude my Suggestions on that Subject were not agreeable, but as I then thought, and Still think it to be an affair worthy the Serious attention of the State, I considered it as my Duty to mention it.  In a Letter from Portsmouth of the 31st Ulto. which I Receiv'd Per last Post is a Paragraph to this purport after mentioning the time at which the Genl. Court was to meet my Honble. Correspondant adds \""I hope we Shall then Send you a Colleague provided we can find a   proper One but as disagreeable as your Situation is at present I Should think it would be more so to have a Colleague to divide with.\"" I Should not have taken so particular Notice of this Paragraph but  I have had several other Letters from different Persons in which are Expressions somewhat to the Same purport; I am not Sensible of any particular Circumstance between me & either of the Gentlemen now in the Delegation, or between me & any One who I think is likely to be appointed that would probably Occasion Division of Sentiment in public affairs; but if it should be most agreeable that Two Delegates should Immediately come on, I hope no Sentiment of Delicacy or any other Consideration as it may personally respect me will prevent them for a Day, for Should Two Delegates arrive here before the time for which I was appointed Expires, I Shall be happy to See the State have a Vote here & Shall Immediately Retire with more pleasure than I came on. The general Tenor of my Letters will Evince with what Unreservedness I write you, but I Should be happy to give you, & through you any other Friends, more particular information on the Subject of our public affairs if the Conveyance was Safe. The Division & Distraction in the Councils of our Enemy, the wretched State of their Finances, together with the United Efforts of those who are now Opposing them, will I hope Compel them to think Seriously of a general Peace before another Campaign, the war has now been carried on for more than Seven Years & they can furnish themselves with Seventy times Seven Reasons if so many are necessary to Convince their Cruel Obstinacy that they never can obtain their first object, Viz our Dependance on them. That Peace may be Speedily Established on an Honourable & permanent Basis, from which may flow Happiness to Society & much Felicity to Individuals, is the most Ardent wish of One who though he has Contributed but little to the Common Cause of his Country, yet has the happiness on the most Serious Reflection to Consider that his Mite has been always ready at his Country's call.  I am with Sincere Esteem, Your Obedt. Servt. John Taylor Gilman P.S.

By my friend Heyward I embrace an Opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your favour by Mr Sansum, with many Thanks for the good Intelligence contained therein, & not without hopes that the flattering prospect of an Evacuation will have taken full Effect before this reaches you. We are sanguine here in these Expectations but &c.

But remember a Frenchman was behind him with his Sword drawn--not but I suppose he might have done it without a Stimulus--slow & sure--I hope will be verified as the Buttermilk begins to work, we may, should the war continue, soon expect to see the Days of Van Tromp & De Ruyter renew'd. The allied states now amount to Twenty, God grant an Encrease of them, but not one more in America at least for a Century.  The Alterations in the British Cabinet may perhaps retard the advances towards a general Pacification, But I flatter myself their present Delirium will soon have a Crisis, & they will once more come to their Sober Senses; one thing to me is next to certain, which is, that unless they close very soon & be content to pocket their Losses & their Infamy, the Price of wickedness, a Carte blanche will be the Consequence, & that once more formidable & glorious People be sunk to the lowest pitch of weakness & Contempt; were I to turn Prophet I should not think much of hazarding a Prediction of the National Bankruptcy, the absolute separation of Ireland, (probably that of Scotland), & to crown the whole the Expulsion of the present Evil race of Geese Drivers,(2) & all the Curses attendant upon those Wars vulgarly called civil which lead to & are consequent of an entire revolution in governments.

  Dear Sir Philad. 17 September 1782. It will not appear strange to you that I have taken up my pen to  SEPTEMBER 17, 1782  write you on a Subject in which you are no otherwise personally concerned than as a military person who always ought to have warm military attachments--yet I confidently presume none other than such as are perfectly consistent with our national safety and such as will be always circumscribed within the limits of rational expectation. I know too well your liberal sentiments both towards the Army & the civil confederacy not to suppose that you have formed ideas of both upon the soundest principles of national policy. Impressed with these favourable Sentiments I need not ask your Candor when I explain to you the principles which governed their Committee and I trust Congress itself in adopting the late System for the Adjutant Generals departments.(1) A system no otherwise complained of to my knowledge but as the pay and emoluments annexed to the several Officers are unequal as is supposed to the duties required of these Officers. The Confidence unavoidably reposed in their fidelity and the great necessity of punctuality and energy in the execution of the trust reposed seem to point out as is said pecuniary emoluments as the greatest security for the good conduct of the Officers in that department--or that they be rewarded by Military rank and promotion. The present Adjutant General (2) (against whose Abilities to execute or promptness in execution no unfriendly insinuation has to my knowledge ever been made) feels himself necessitated to leave his Office unless his pay and emoluments are increased or that he be rewarded with Military Promotion. The pay and emoluments annexed to the Adjutant General by the last System are those of a Brigadier General, if not, it was certainly the views of the Committee that they should be the same--the Number of Rations are particularly specified as well as the Sum for Subsistence--this seems to be complained of--But I think without the shadow of a reason--because Congress are so heartily disposed to gratify the Army in these matters which they can do without any additional expence to the public that if they will make their election and point out what will please them they may either draw all their Subsistence Money in specific Rations or otherwise as is most convenient for them. This in the present mode of supplying the Army is a matter of so little consequence to the public that it may without any application to Congress be adjusted by the financier and Secretary at War--under that head there is no reason of complaint. The reason given why the pay and emoluments are an insufficient reward for the Services performed is solely because a Brigadier General executes them--and he receives no addition to his pay as a Brigadier General. But if a Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, Commandant, or Lieutenant Colonel they will severally have such an addition to their pay and emoluments as to make them equal to a Brigadier General. On this the main Argument seems to be grounded--for if these are entitled to an additional pay then certainly the Brigadier General is equally so. I will not say this consequence is a true one--I   think it is clearly otherwise--perhaps no one Office in the Army has been so uniformly the same as to pay and Emoluments as that of the Adjutant Generals. It has always had annexed to it the pay and emoluments of a Brigadier General. The first Officer that filled it had the rank of a Brigadier General--the subsequent ones till the present had the pay and emoluments without the rank (3)--therefore from former precedents no argument can be raised in support of additional pay. It has been suggested that Colonel Scammell the late Adjutant General quitted the Office because the pay and emoluments would not support him. But from my intimate acquaintance with him I have good reason to believe he quitted the office from a very different reason. It seems to be advanced that the quantum of Promotion in the Officer that fills that Office shall alone govern the quantum of reward without having any regard to Services. I do not recollect ever before to have heard this advanced as a Rule for adjusting Rewards. But otherwise that similar Services generally entitle to similar rewards. With respect to this office I persuade myself Congress adopted the last rule and that let an Officer of which ever of the Grades it is confined to fill the Office his necessary and unavoidable expences would be great as those of any other Grade. Is the Opinion founded in Justice that if a Brigadier General fills the Office and has no additional pay then a Lieutenant Colonel in the same Office ought not to have any?  I think the plain and natural construction of the resolution of Congress is that the pay and emoluments of a Brigadier General are a sufficient reward to induce the most confidential and best qualified Officers to undertake it except Major Generals for no one can suppose that Congress expected they would reduce their own pay by accepting the Office--and the experience of six or seven Years would naturally impress them with this Sentiment that notwithstanding a Brigadier General filled the Office with Approbation and esteem at present yet if it should be our Misfortune to have him removed therefrom on any account Congress had no certain reason to conclude that all the military Geniuses best qualified for that Office were confined to the Grade of Brigadier Generals but on the Contrary that it might be possible that from three lower Grades a person might be found better qualified in every respect to execute the duties of that Office than Brigadier Generals. The opinion may have been a presumptuous one--But I believe it was really so. As to rewarding the services of this Office with Military promotion I believe very few Officers in the Army would be willing to consent to it. It would be attended with so many apparent ill consequences to the peace of the Army that no Arguments need to be adduced in refutation thereof.  That the pay and emoluments annexed to the Office are as great considering the duties as those annexed to a Brigadier General I will not presume to determine. I can easily conceive that the Office is   highly confidential and of the utmost consequence to the peace and safety of the Army--the more so the more honorable.  But I can easily conceive when a Brigadier General has no Brigade, when he can have no command in the Army unless in that Office rather than be idle and eat the bread of an impoverished and reduced Country without rendering any Services therefor, That duty as well as inclination would strongly urge him to accept of such an Office with the pay and Emoluments that have invariably been annexed to it. Surely General Hand will not presume to think that he is the only person that has filled that Office with general esteem and approbation--he will not surely pretend that his duties are more numerous and multiplied than those of his predecessors or that his expences are necessarily greater. If my information is good his duties are not so great and consequently I cannot conceive that his expences are necessarily greater so that I humbly conceive that Congress rather discovered a liberal than a contracted and penurious disposition--Therefore the policy of it stands upon the broad bottom of generous principles. Neither can there be a charge of inattention. Surely the subject was very carefully and very fully examined. It was not hastily adopted--it was several months under consideration and after much conversation on it by the Committee they unanimously agreed. The only objections in Congress against it were that the pay and emoluments were too great. I think from this candid explanation every charge of inattention will be removed. How far it is destitute of respect or any thing else I will not determine--because if the Subject was carefully attended to, if it is founded on liberal principles which in my opinion is clearly the case, I have nothing to do with respect or deference in a public capacity farther than directed by my own Judgment which I hope will ever be free and unconstrained.  Thus Sir I have freely opened to you my Sentiments on a subject which I find has been the cause of very severe strictures. If I am wrong in my opinion, I hope to feel the weight of a rational conviction which I must acknowledge I do not at present.(4) Forgive me dear Sir for having troubled you thus much and believe me to be with sentiments of the greatest esteem, Dear Sir, Your most obed.

Mr. Adams's latest Date is of the 5th July, he was then at the Hague, & does not expressly mention an Intention of visiting Paris, nor have we any authentick Account of the then State of the Negotiations for a Peace; it is not improbable but Rodney's Victory in the W Indies, together with the Death of the Marquiss of Rockingham & the Change in the British Ministry may occasion some procrastination in the Settlement of Preliminaries, Tho' we are hopefull the success of the French in the East Indies, which we are willing & have reason to credit, will fully compensate for their Losses under Mr. DeGrasse's Misfortune. Mr. A. has opend a Loan in Holland for 5 millions of Guilders, which is likely to succeed.  Two French Frigates with a Convoy for this Port were some Days since chased into the Capes by some british Ships of force. One of them, a new Ship of 44 Guns (L' Aigle) commanded by Monsr. de la Touche, having money on board for the use of the French Army, being without a Pilot, was unfortunately run aground on the Shears; the money & Dispatches were sent on Shore, but from Accts. recd. we are apprehensive the Officers & Crew are made Prisoners--the Ship having been scuttled will be entirely lost. A Ship loaded on Acct. of the continent is said to have arrived at an Eastern Port.  We have various reports from New York, some of which give us hopes of an intended Evacuation. We are anxious to hear of that of CTown, & wish to have it confirmed by Captn. Joiner whom we daily look for; The Carolina is moved down the river, & apparently will soon have a Crew.

  Sir Philada. Sepr. [17] 1782.(1) The copy of sundry late resolutions of Congress herewith inclosed (2) will inform your Excellency of the necessity they have been under of enlarging their requisitions on the States. This necessity has resulted in part from the perseverance of Rhode-Island in declining to accede to the 5 PerCt. impost. Since our last a Ship has arrived at this place from Holland, with a supply of goods for the army, amounting in value to upwards of £22,000. Sterlg. The despatches brought by her contain an official notification of the reception of Mr. Adams by the States General, in quality of Minister Plenipotentiary from the U. States. They also inform Congress that some progress had been made, towards a Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two Republics; and that in consequence of a contract entered into by Mr. Adams with a Mercantile House for the negociation of a loan of 5,000,000 of Guilders, upwards of 1 Million & a half had been subscribed, and upwards of 1 Million actually paid in. It was uncertain however to what amount the subscriptions would be continued. On Friday last two large French frigates with supplies of money &c. for the French army, and despatches for Congress & the French Minister, came into Delaware bay. Having no pilots on board, they got into a wrong channel, and proceeded in it till the appearance of a superior enemy below rendered it impossible to return into the right one. In this perplexity they pushed forward and attempted to force their passage with the aid of the tide over the shoal which obstructed it. In the attempt one of them was successful & has since got up safe to Chester. The other stuck and was lost. The money &c. and despatches on board her were fortunately saved. It is said that the Capt. and crew have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. The despaches being not yet come up, we can say nothing of their contents. We have the honor to be with the highest respect Yr. Excellency's obt. & humble Servts J. Madison Jr. A. Lee [P.S.] The post is not yet come in from the Southward. ""

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Septr. 18th. 1782 Your two Favours came to hand almost together. I did not arrive here till Thursday Evening. I paid Mr. Robertson on your Acct. £190.0.0 and I have thought that it may be possible, that by accident I may want a Sum of money suddenly. I wish you to write to him, that in Case I should request it, to let me have any Monies on your Acct. tho' I doubt my wanting any. I found every thing here in the News way, uncertain & doubtful. I have seen the Debates in the House of Commons till the breaking up of Parliament. All is Confusion there, and I believe altho' the negotiation will be delayed, that nevertheless it will finally proceed & prevail, so that the Spring will open with Peace. Our Advices by the French Frigate are dated 29th June--all goes very well in Europe.(1) Our Cause is growing Fast to Maturity, and we are becoming more & more respectable in the Eyes of the Powers thereof. Our Alliance will not stop with the Dutch.  The Frigate tho' lost, has been lucky in escaping the Enemy, as she had large Sums in Cash on board, and some valuable Passengers as the Count de Viomeni1, second in Command in America & the Duke  SEPTEMBER 18, 1782  de Lazune, Baron de Montesquieu &c &c. The Marquis is detained by our Ministers at Versailes. I have delivered your Letter to the Fr. Minister but not to Mr. Morris, being willing to wait a little to know how the Land appear. The arrival of the French Fleet at Boston is premature, as it happened by accident to be the English Fleet under Admiral Pigott, who has blocked up the French Squadron. Shall call for your rent & send it by first Opportunity.  The Cash from on board the Frigate is arrived here but the Capt. & Crew it is feared were all taken. The Passengers got on Shore.

The Secretary informs me that he has not received your Letter.(1) I will Endeavour to have the Commissions sent you next Week if I can obtain them.  By Letters from France of 29th June it appears probable that the Enemy Intended to proceed in a General Negociation for Peace,(2) but that they had altered their Tone in Consquence of their success in the W. Indies & accomodation of their affairs in Ireland. But Still their is some probability that Negociations may be again on Foot.  Doctor Franklin and Mr. Jay are in France, Mr. Adams busy at Holland, & Mr. Laurens gone to the South of France for Recovery of his Health & to Visit some relations. I think it is probable he may be here this fall.  Dr. Franklin agreed to Liberate Lord Cornwallis from his Parole in Consequence of Mr. Laurens being released, but Expressly made this Liberation Subject to the Approbation or Disapprobation of Congress, what they will determine I cannot Say.(3) SEPTEMBER 18, 1782  The Transactions in Holland are very Important to us, and must greatly discourage our Enemies.  It Seems the Court of Spain have decided Intentions of obtaining Gilbralter.  The Councils of our Enemy must be greatly divided, Their Finances at a Low Ebb, and I really Hope as they have been Blundering for many Years, they will soon Stumble upon that which appears to be their only true Interest Viz. Seriously Endeavour to obtain a General Peace; If they are Determined to have Thirteen States under their Subjection, they may as well seek for them in the Moon, as Endeavour to regain these United States.  It is said a 40 Gunn Ship belonging to our Allies is drove on Shore about 100 Miles below this place. I have not the particulars but believe the Cargo is saved, the Ship will probably be Lost.

  D. Sir, Philada. Sep. 18 1782  Some Time ago, I recd. your favour of the 10 July, & lately, one of the 14 August. I am glad to find that Circumstances, in favour of the Southern Army have changed so much for the better as you represent to us, & hope that before this Letter can arrive, you will be enjoying, in Charles-Town, some Relaxation from the great Care & Fatigue which you have undergone; for I flatter myself, that the Alteration in the British Ministry will not prevent the Evacuation of that Garrison, tho' , I think it has put Peace at a much greater distance than most People lately thot. it. The late Gazettes will give you so full an Account of all the European & other News We have, that I beg Leave to refer you to them--you will receive, by this opportunity a duplicate of the  SEPTEMBER 19, 1782  Resolves of Congress passed abt. the Instt., relative to the Southern Army.(1) It appeared to some of the Committee, that the most effectual Way of protecting Georgia & So. Carolina might, perhaps, be, by sending a Force into E. Florida, but as that wd. be operating out of the U. States, & you might not think yourself at Liberty to do so without special Leave therefore the last Clause in the Resolves was added. I hope the Commander in Chief will give you a discretionary power of retaining such part of the Army as you think necessary for the Southern States. Being on the Spot, & fully acquainted with all Circumstances, you can judge, better than any one else of that Point--& I wish that the Part so retained may not be inconsiderable. The Southern Army could not get here to do any Service this Campaign--if wanted for the next they wd. arrive in Time tho' they shd. not leave Carolina for several Months & that State & Georgia will be exposed to great & imminent danger (if the Army is removed) whilst the Enemy have such a Force of Regulars & Tories in E. Florida, as at present.  I think there can be no danger that an Attempt to make a Coolness between you & the Governor (2) will succeed. I am sure you will give no Cause for it, & he cannot be persuaded of the contrary.  I never heard of the Matter you mention, respecting your Letter of March last to Congress.(3) If such a Matter really happen'd, it must have been when I was in Virginia whither I went, on some publick Business, by desire of Congress, soon after my Arrival here. However it is not improbable, for People don't like to be told of their Faults.  Mrs. Rutledge joins with me in respectful Compliments to Mrs. Greene.

  Sir, Philadelphia 19 Sept. 1782. Letters have been recd from Dr Franklin dated Passy June 25 & 29, containing the first official account of the negotiations for peace. The British Minister proposed to treat with his Most Xtian Majesty about Am. Independance, he was answered that it would be better to treat with our own Minister who was at hand. Attempts were made and the most tempting offers, in the first instance to negotiate a peace with  SEPTEMBER 19, 1782  the belligerent powers separately; but it was rejected with disdain. Our Independance was then proposed and the ardour of the British for peace, by their advances appeared unquestionable: But unfortunately for us, news of Rodneys Success in the W. Indies arrives, the Marquis of Rockingham dies, the Shelburn party prevails, good men resign, the Cabinet is divided, & a manifest tergiversation on the part of the British leaves little hopes from the negotiation till the event of this campaign shall decide upon the pretensions of the parties. Next winter may give us peace.  Ld. Shelburn & the old Ministry would fain patch up a peace by allowing us the same kind of Independance granted to Ireland, so little do they yet know the Spirit of America. Dr. Franklin says the King hates us most cordially, and has not given up the Idea of keeping us yet somehow, or another under him; this no doubt is his view in placing Ld. Shelburn at the head of the Treasury, who is, notwithstanding his jesuitical Speech, our inveterate enemy.  Emissaries are to be sent out to this Country to sound the minds of the people and induce them by any means to return to some kind of a dependance on Britain.  With this view English goods will be sent over, and perhaps the Post of New York kept more with a view to promote trade than to carry on military operations against us, yet some think it will be evacuated.  It is the fixed determination of France, Spain & Holland not to make a Separate peace; they are fully convinced that their only safety against the insolent power of Britain lies in their Union. I hope none will be so deluded in this Country as to think there can be any safety to us in any dependance on Britain. Should we renounce our alliance with France, such an instance of perfidy would render us forever incapable of forming such an one with any other power, & of course subject us entirely to the arbitrary will of Britain. Heaven forbid that this should be the fatal & disgraceful issue of a seven years war!  You may rely upon it the Powers in Europe will not desert us, our intrest is too intimately blended with theirs. Our trade is courted by every commercial State. All that is wanting on our part is Prudence & Perseverance. I hope the Seat of the war will no longer remain here, let the issue of the present negotiation be as it may. It is a great object with us at present to restore public credit & give value to the promises we have made, or may make. Loans will then enable us to transmit our debt to posterity without inconvenience, to be paid when the Inhabitants of this Country as well as its wealth shall be double & perhaps treble what they are at present. To this end it is essential that the intrest at least of our public debt be paid. This was the object of the Impost; you will see a tax of 1,200,000 Dols ordered for this purpose. This is a Substitute for the Impost & I hope we shall now hear no more about it. Our quota is reduced from the last, of Nov. 1781, about 1/9 but is yet too high. On this head I refer you to a late Letter to Gov. Bowen.(1)   For particulars of the Dutch Loan see my letter to Commodore Hopkins of the 14 Inst.(2) Our affairs go on well abroad. No late news from Genl. Greene; but expect to hear of the evacuation of that place, Charlestown, sometime in October next.  As to my health it has been, thro' divine goodness uninterrupted, excepting by colds, to which the frequent changes of weather here subject one, unless great precaution is used. Last week we had several days of fresh cool air, the weather is now hot & sultry.  I have removed my Lodgings to the Revd. Mr Marshalls in 4th Street. I am now nearer my business & in the neighbourhood of those with whom it is to be done. Dr Witherspoon & myself live on the same floor. As Genl. Cornell sets out next Saturday on his business in the Army, the State will be unrepresented till Dr Arnolds arrival,3 which I wait for with Impatience; & as Dr. W. has invited me to go to New-Jersey College commencement next Wednesday, it is likely I shall go as several other members of Congress are going. I can return in three days, perhaps before Dr. Arnold will arrive. I have not been absent one day since I first took a Seat in Congress.  I have latterly had more leisure than at first; I have dined & drank tea several times with our Friend Hewes & others, who is very kind & has offered me money on your credit repeatedly; but I have taken none of him.  I have been to eight different places of public worship in this City. I commonly attend the Friends 6 O' Clock P.M. meeting in Market Street. There is generally some speaking. Saml. Emlyn is an affectionate, good preacher. Nicholas Wall is Sensible & powerful. I went into the meeting one Evening in Company with Parson Ustic.4 Nicholas soon rose \""Put me into the Priests office that I may get a piece of bread\"" were his first words & text. He pointed out the difference betwixt Gospel, ministers & Hirelings. After we had got out of the house Mr. Ustic asked me if I had not told Nicholas that I would bring him that evening?  I have been under the necessity of making use of your kind offer to supply me with money. Col. Peck informed me that he had money of yours in his hands; I have taken of him one hundred Dollars & drawn on you in his favour to that amount. I have also written to Mr John Brown,5 who has my order to draw on the Treasury for any grant which may be made me, to pay the same to you. I expect to allow you intrest from time of payment till you shall be repaid.  With Sentiments of esteeme, I am, Sir, your most obedient & very humble Servant, David Howell P.S. I beg you to present my regards to your good Lady and all friends.  Please to shew this Letter to Maj. Jenckes and others at your discretion. You will see the resolves of the State of New York for a Continental Convention for the purpose of altering the Confederation & giving   more power to Congress. These resolves have been transmitted to Congress as well as to the Executives of all the States. They have been referred to a Committee, of which I was one, I opposed them tooth & nail & I believe none will have the hardiness to move in Congress for any thing more to be done about them. No future confederation will ever give equal Liberty to the people, or equal power to the Small States. It is boldly said that the affair of the Imposts being stopped by the petty State of R.I. fully shew that such little States have too much power. A great character in Connecticut queries to his friend in Congress whether it will not be necessary to impose a duty of 10 per Cent. on all goods brought out of R.I. By this you may see they well know that the Confederation empowers them to lay duties on goods as they pass our lines, either way. Let us stand fast in the Liberty wherewith we are made free. No alteration, rely on it, will be made in our favour. D.H.  ""

  Dear Sir. Philaa. Sepr. 25th [i.e., 19-25] 1782 (1) I had the Pleasure of addressing you by the last Post.(2) I observed, that the Comee. for the foreign Department, of which you were one, had reported.(3) Their Report mentions the Number of Letters he has wrote to Docr. F____, Mr. A____, Mr. J____, Mr. D____, &ca;(4) The Files of Papers he has in his Office; the Boxes in which they are placed; The Books in which the Letters are entered &ca &ca &ca. Upon the whole, the Comee. approve of his Conduct, Attention & Punctuality--or in Words tantamount thereto. The Approbation of Congress was not call'd for, to the Report. But this with the Reports on the other Departments, are to be fil'd only, & not entered on the Journals. Complete & substantial Evidence of his Impartiality--And all is well. I told you whilst here, that I had my Antipathies. I cannot conquer them; & Heaven forbid that I should. Matters are all going exceeding well in Europe; Doctr. Franklin & Mr. Jay appear to be very happy at Passy. The latter, in explicit Terms, commends the former, as an able and prudent minister. His Abilities, he says, exceed any Man's of his Age, that he ever saw (5)--agreed.  SEPTEMBER 19, 1782  We have lately pass'd an explicit Instruction to all our Peace Commissioners to attend the Negociations for Peace, whever they begin; & that which even receives any Intimations thereof immediately notify the others. This in some Measure does away the great Absurdity of four Joint & several Commrs., as you know the Commission stands--all of them--or any one of them. Mr. Laurens is to be informed that Congress cannot dispense with his Assistance at the Negociation. I like it, because I think Mr. A. & Mr. L____(6) will be united. There will probably be an equal Division--but I hope the Question will not be lost. It is supposed that some Coldness may have seized Mr. L____ on Account of Mr. A's Conduct towards him. When the former requested to know of the latter, if he could be serviceable in any negociations--Mr. A intimated that he did not know that he could. But there are no Expressions in Mr. L____'s Letter that Justify an Opinion, that he is in any Manner dissatisfied.(7) If Mr. L____'s Letter to Congress contains the Truth, (& Heaven forbid that we should charge him with Falshood) He has suffered the most intolerable Hardships. There are strong Marks in it, of the keenest Sensations, on Account of Doctr. F____'s Neglect of him, whilst in England. Mr. R____ge (8) commented with great Severity on his Disobedience & Neglect of the Orders of Congress with Respect to his Exchange. Mr L____ declares positively, that whilst he was Prisoner, he ever asserted the Independence of the United States; He supposes that they would have been very glad to have given him a Pardon--But he revolted at the Idea. I think Candor obliges us to beleive his Story, until we have more authentic Evidence of his Want of Firmness.(9) I hinted to you in my last, something about old Paper Money. It is an exceeding plain, & an exceedingly perplexed & difficult Matter--if this is possible. It is plain as to the Justice due to Masstts. It is perplexed in a continental View. Mr. Morris made a Report to Congress, which would have answered the Wishes of the State. But it was attacked without Favor or Affection. The Essence of it was negatived & then it was not worth having. The enclosed Motion was then made,(10) & referred to a Commee. of 13; what the Fate of it will be, I know not. I have hinted before, that some of the States are very cold in this Matter. They feel all the happy but none of the ill Consequences. But it may be asked, since it is so plain a Question, why we can't make Congress feel the absolute Necessity of Justice--And the fatal Consequences that must ensue, if Releif is not granted. I will answer it in Part, by asking, why the Preachers of Peace & Righteousness do not influence all Mankind to act Right. They acknowledge the Doctrines are wise & reasonable; But do not all obey its Precepts. A Calvinist will tell us, that the natural Man is an Enemy to Goodness, & until it is given to him, he cannot have an operative Beleif. So I flatter myself the Members of Congress feel the Justice of our Request. They have in this Respect natural, but no moral Abilities. They will not--which, I   think, constitutes some Part of modern genuine Calvanism. They see but it is thro' an obscure Glass, which removes the Object to a great Distance. They think it is not Time to adjust this Matter--the Reason why--I apprehend is, that as they have not got their Proportion, if any Thing should be done for us, it may prevent their obtaining it for nothing. I cannot suppose that (in your Profession particularly) you have lived to this Time, & never met with one Man, or one hundred, whom you could seemingly convince as to their understandings, & yet not influence their Faculty of Volition. It will not be an agreeable Matter I am sure to the Legislature of Masstts. to take up the Subject without the Provision of Congress. But if this Provision cannot be obtained--Necessity undoubtedly will oblige you to do it. I have heretofore observed that Masstts. is deficient probably several millions of Dollrs. on the old Requisitions. you can therefore clearly provide for that Deficiency--and as to the Remainder, if you should do a Work of Supererogation; It will be much less censurable than Works of Derogation. When Congress, in early Times, recommended to the States to make continental money a Tender, V____a (11) made it a Tender to discharge Interest only. When Congress recommended to the States to revise the Laws which was as much as to say, repeal the Tender Laws, V____ made then, the old Money a Tender, Paper Dollr. for hard Dollr. When Congress recommended to the same State to shut up her Land Office, with Respect to Lands beyond the Alleghany Mountains, she immediately laid out three Counties in that Country, & opened her Land Office. When Congress recommended to the State of V____ in the most pressing Manner, to raise her Quota of Troops, the Situation of the Enemy rendering it of the utmost Importance--her Legislature sit Ten Weeks, with the Recommendation before them, & no Notice was taken of it. Their whole Time was taken up about back Lands. These I call Works of Derogation. There is one Matter relative to that State, which I think is a Curiosity. Not long since they have had a Paper Currency circulating by their own Acts, one Dollar of which would discharge a Debt of forty hard Dollrs. Their old Money they continued a Tender, after the new forty for one money, was issued; which last, was not made a Tender, so that one Dollr. of it was forty Times better than a hard Dollr. I have the Information, in all these particulars, from such Authority that I cannot doubt of their being Facts.  Thus far had I proceeded in my long Story, when I was agreeably disappointed by the Arrival of Mr. Tracy, & the Rect. of your Favor of the 9th of September. I can assure you that the Observation upon Genl. Lincoln, was very far from displeasing him. We enjoyed the Humor of it: It pleased me the more because it gives me an Opportunity to rally him. ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ It is the 20th of Sepr.(1)2 Our Debates this Day in Congress, have been acciden-  tally turn'd upon the Resolution of the Day before Yesterday, informing Mr. L____ that Congress cannot dispense &ca. A Motion, after a long Preface, was made by my particular & ingenious Friend Mr. M____n to stay the sending forward that Resolution.(13) It was grounded upon a Pamphlet entitled the Parliamentary Register, in which was contained the Petition of Mr. La____s that you mentioned to have seen in Our Papers. It was said that the known Reputation of the Printer, was such, as to prevent a Doubt of the Fact. Mr. A. L____(14) said he knew the Printer to be a paltry Fellow; and that no Credit ought to be given to his Publications. The Debates lasted from Morning,' till near four o' Clock & then adjourned without any Decision; If that Petition is really Mr. L____'s, his Letter to Congress can hardly be said to be consistent therewith. Mr. Adams makes no mention of it; but expresses his Happiness upon seeing his old Friend in the same Sentiments, notwithstanding he had been so long in Britain. Docr. F____n says nothing either good or bad of him. But what does the Petition contain so exceedingly offensive, considering his languishing & neglected Situation? It evidences a Weakness of Mind. But who will say, that he should be able, when put to the Test, to brave Hunger with all its consequent Infirmities, in a Goal, & Hero like, die a Martyr without any Emotions. A Man's Mind frequently languishes with his Body. But what Reason can be given for \""ultimately\"" &ca. Considering all Circumstances, which would the impartial public of America execrate as the most injurous to the Honor & Dignity of the Und. States. It is true that one superlatively wicked Action, will not Justify another--perhaps a Decision may be had before I close this lengthy Journal.  The Financier has informed Mr. Gillon, that he now possesses Papers, by which it appears, that he has recd. nearly £19,000 Strg. of the Und. States money; that as a Servant of the public, & appointed to take Care of the Interest of the U.S., he was obliged to demand Security of him on their Behalf.(15) Gillon answered--that his matters were before a Commee. of Congress--that he doubted not but they would Justify him. And that he did not owe the U.S. a Farthing. These answers were not satisfactory to Mr. Morris & he still insists on Security. I am not without my Fears, that Majr. J____n(16) wil1 appear to have been deficient in his Duty--And that Gillon will show by J____n's own Letters, that he put into his Hands Goods to the Amo. of £11,000 Sterg. By one Way & another, I beleive no poor People were ever more wretchedly abused than we have been by our Money Transactions abroad. The Ship Marquis Le Fayette, it is beleived, were never intended for America. But if she had arrived, the Goods were scarcely worth Exportation, if we may Judge of her Cargo, from a considerable Quantity thereof, now in this City. Capt. Truxton of this City has informed some of the Members of Congress, that he offered to bring   out a Part of the Goods; but the Agents would not agree with him, unless he would take on Board a Quantity of Tea at a mere triffling Freight. It is hinted, Monr. de Ternay would have chearfully bro't them out in the King's Ship. But that he would not make them Merchant's Ships--plainly intimating, that he would not take them on Board, with other private Merchandize. Mr. Izzard gave it freely as his Opinion upon his first Arrival, that the Marquis Le Fayette would never see America. If nothing else, I hope our Poverty in future, will put a stop to our being plundered by those unfeeling insatiable Harpies. It gives me pain to reflect, that one of them is a native of Masstts. Time has elaps'd;(17) & I can now inform you how the Motion respecting Mr. La____s ended. The next Morning the Debates began after the Motion was renewed, & lasted till near four o' Clock, they were regular & well managed. It is impossible to give you an Idea of the curious Definitions & Explanations. The Mover, my honble. Friend aforesd. with his usual Cunning rather than Ingenuity began. He said the Motion was of a very tender, as well as harmless Nature. It was nothing more than merely to stay the former Resolution--and had no necessary Tendency to injure the Character of the honble. Gentleman. Indeed the Mover respected him very highly. But pro Bono publico Duty obliged him to make it; & he wished every Body to construe it, as no intended Harm against the Person. The Reasons for the Motion, he said, were, the culpable Nature of the Prayer; (for it is not calld a Petition). That the World must suppose therefrom, that Mr. L____ had labored zealously, to support the Claims of G. B. That his Life & Fortune had been endangered, by adhering to the brittish Interest. And that as he had once betrayed the Dignity of the Und. States, he never ought again to be made the Repository thereof. I found a great Difficulty in my Mind, to reconcile the Reason for the Motion, with the pretended Innocency, & the harmless Nature of it. Mr. Middleton made the closing Speech. I mention his in Preference to several others, because he was very explicit & plain. He assigned, what, he supposed, must be the true Reason for the Motion--which was, that Docr. F____n should be the sole Negociator for Peace. He reprobated the Idea very severely. He said, that Congress had more essentially wounded the Dignity of the Und. States in their \""ultimately\"" &ca than any of their Servants could do--And that it was evident from Mr. Jay's & Mr. Adams's Letters, that they were both unwilling to be, Spectators of the humiliating Situation of the und. States--And he supposed Mr. L____ must have declined for a similar Reason. Mr. L____ was a Man, incapable of being corrupted, & that might be one Reason of the Motion. But Mr. M____n said--that neither he, nor the public would ever be satisfied, with committing the whole Negociation to a Man, who appears to be perfectly pleased with being made a Cypher--(he might have added--and to a Man who  never intends to return to America and therefore cannot be responsible to us, for any ill Conduct.)

However, I do all I can, to pour in the Balm of Consolation upon his Soul, by putting him in mind, that Newton, & all the great Men his Predecessors, wanted that same Faculty of making People beleive them at first, altho they could not clearly refute their Principles. But that you, whom we all know to be no Sceptic, should be unwilling to give your assent to the ingenious Plans, Systems, Corollaries, & Deductions of the ingenious General, when at the same Time, you acknowledge that you can not clearly confute them, will stagger my Faith. And like the repelling Power of Electricity you will keep me in a constant Vibration between you--  unless you should make me feel the Charge, as sensibly as you did the Gentleman in the House, who was dancing in & out, discharging & retreating, till you fix'd him by a dead Shot.

But he has been, & still is, of infinite Service to us, in his Office. He has succeeded in his Office beyond my most sanguine Expectations.

  September 19th. [1782] The house having under consideration the report of a Committee respecting the Commissioners or allowance to be granted to the late Jos. Trumbull, Comry Genl for his services.(1) Mr Madison arose and informed the house that since the passing the resolutions of the 17th,(2) he had come to the knowledge of a fact, which he wished to lay before Congress and on which he meant to ground a motion; and as it did not admit of delay, the vessel that would carry those resolutions being on the point of sailing he wished the present business might be postponed and accordingly made a motion to that effect. This being agreed to, he then proceeded to inform Congress that he had a great respect for the character of Mr Laurens and entertained a high opinion of his abilities and integrity, and had therefore given his hearty concurrence and assent to the resolutions which passed on the 17th. But that since that time he had come to the knowledge of some matters, which induced him to think it would not be proper, at least, for the present, to forward those resolutions or so much of them as respected Mr Laurens. He would now state those matters to Congress, that they might judge. He had, he said, in his hand a pamphlet printed in London entitled \""Parliamentary Register,\"" and containing an account of the debates in the House of Commons from the month of Nov. 1781, to the latter end of Janry, 1782, among which were debates on a petition to that house from H. Laurens, a prisoner in the Tower, and that the petition was printed at  SEPTEMBER 19, 1782  full length.(3) He then read the debates and the petition; and then observed that though the evidence was not such as would, in a Court of Law, be sufficient to prove that Mr. Laurens had signed and presented such a petition, yet coming from such authority and with such concurring circumstances, it was sufficient to raise doubts in this house, and a strong suspicion that it was genuine. That if Mr Laurens did actually sign and present such a petition; he had thereby wounded the honor and dignity of the United States in such a manner that he was no longer fit to be entrusted with the character of a public minister, much less to be solicited to continue his services as the negotiator of a peace. He would not undertake to say positively that the petition was genuine, though he must confess that he could not altogether withhold his belief of its authenticity. He repeated again the assurances of his respect and regard for the man, his willingness to draw a veil over this part of his conduct, and to bury it forever in oblivion, but standing in the place he did, and feeling, as he did for the honor & dignity of his country, he could not, consistent with his duty, forbear to move.(4) \""That the resolution of the 17th day of Sept, 1782, informing Mr Laurens that his services as a minister plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace cannot be dispensed with by Congress, and so much of the other resolution of the same date as relates to Mr Laurens, be not transmitted till the farther order of Congress.\"" He would not give so much credit to the publication as thereon to ground a recall, his meaning was only to suspend the effects of a resolution, which he was convinced never would have passed had the matter now before the house been known to Congress. He confessed that if in fact the petition was not genuine a temporary injury would be done to Mr Laurens' character, and in that case, as soon as the truth should appear, no man would be readier than he should be, by every act in his power, to wipe off the stain and restore his character to its ancient splendor, and therefore would wish that the resolutions of the 17th, as well as that which might now be passed, should remain secret. But when he considered on the other hand in what light the conduct of this Congress would be viewed by, and what effect it might have on the powers of Europe if a man was pressed to continue in such a high confidential trust and office who had prostrated the dignity of his Country, wounded its honour, and as far as in him lay denied its sovereignty and independence, all which must be admitted, if the petition is genuine, he trusted he would stand excused and that the house would agree to his motion. He then repeated his motion which was seconded by his colleague, Mr Jones. The motion being read from the Chair. Mr Lee said that no sort of credit should be given to the publication; that he knew the publisher of it to be an infamous person, who would publish anything sent to him that would make his pamphlet   sell, and who would ruin the character of any man for five shillings. That for his part he did not believe the petition was genuine. That it was altogether incredible that ever Mr Laurens wrote or signed such a petition. That it was known Mr Laurens was a man of sense, of firmness & of integrity. That the petition which had been read was mean in sentiment and diction, and altogether unworthy a man of sense, that it was wrote in so humiliating a stile that to suppose Mr L. to be the author of it would be to suppose him devoid of all understanding. Mr Dyer said he could not believe it to be true. If Mr L. had ever written or signed such a petition he would certainly have taken notice of it in his letter; he would have palliated and excused the action. He would have said that in an unguarded hour when under the pressure of sufferings and reduced by sickness he was prevailed upon to set his hand to such a paper, which he is now sorry for. Nothing of this appears in his letter; no mention is made of such a paper. He cannot think it therefore genuine. Mr Jackson is of the same opinion. If he thought it genuine, he would be not for suspending but for recalling him, and passing a severe censure upon him. Mr Noble Wimberley Jones believes it is not genuine, thinks it would be cruel to pass a censure, which this wd be, upon a man of such a known and established character as Mr Laurens, even if he did write it, it was not to be wondered at, considering how he was neglected and what he suffered. He should not be condemned unheard. Mr Bland spoke against the motion, vilified the publication, said that if notice was taken of such publications no man's character would be safe; it would be easy for our enemies to publish such things of any man and to raise dissentions among us. Mr Clymer always understood that the Parliamentary Register was a paper of considerable authority. The first publisher, Almon, was noted for his attachment to the American cause. He supposed the present publisher, who succeeded him, was actuated by the same principles. It is not to be supposed that he would ruin the character & reputation of his pamphlet by publishing a falsehood which could be so easily detected. Mr Lee never heard that the \""Parliamentary Register\"" was a paper of any authority. He wished the gentleman had shewn what authority it had. He knew it was an anti-ministerial publication, and supported by the minority for party purposes. Mr Madison spoke again, professed the purity of his motives and his regard for Mr Laurens' character; urged the probability of the petition being genuine, and his readiness to make every allowance and excuse for Mr L's situation, but still persisted in the opinion that the dignity, honor, and interest of the U. S. required that Congress should agree to the motion.  The question being eagerly called for by those who were opposed to the motion, Mr Wright said it was a matter that required deliberation; it was not to be descided in so hasty a manner; that for his part he was determined to have the yeas and nays on the question when put, and he wished to have some farther time to consider the motion, and therefore moved to adjourn, which was seconded and agreed to. The petition is as follows: \""The Right Honble Charles Wolfran Cornwall, speaker of the honble the House of Commons. \""The representation and prayer of Henry Laurens, a native of South Carolina, some time recognized by the British Commissioners in America by the stile and title of his excellency Henry Laurens, President of Congress, now a close prisoner in the Tower of London, most respectfully sheweth: \""That your representer, for many years at the peril of his life (5) and fortune, ardently laboured to preserve and strengthen the ancient friendship between Great Britain & the Colonies & that in no instance he ever excited on either side the dissentions which separated them. \""That the commencement of the present war was a subject of great grief to him, in as much as he foresaw and foretold, in letters now extant, the distresses which both countries experience at this day. \""That in the rise and progress of the war he extended every act of kindness in his power to persons called Loyalists & Quietists, as well as to British prisoners of war, very ample proofs of which he can produce. \""That he was captured on the American Coast, first landed upon American ground, where he saw exchange of British and American prisoners in a course of negotiation, and such an exchange and enlargement upon parole are mutually and daily practiced in America. \""That he was committed to the Tower on the 6th of October, 1780, being then dangerously ill; that in the mean time he had in many respects, particularly being deprived with very little exception of the visits and consolations of his children and other relations and friends, suffered under a degree of rigor almost if not altogether unexampled in modern British history. \""That from long confinement, and the want of proper exercise, and other obvious causes, his bodily health is greatly impaired, and that he is now in a languishing state, and therefore your representer humbly prays your honors will condescend to take his case into consideration, and under proper conditions and restrictions grant him enlargement or such other relief as to the wisdom and benignity of your honours shall seem fitting. Henry Laurens. \""Tower of London, Dec. 1st 1781.\""  MS not found; reprinted from NYHS Collections, 11 (1879): 155-60.  1 This report was the second submitted by a committee consisting of George Clymer, Jonathan Jackson, and Edward Telfair appointed to respond to a July 23 letter of the superintendent of finance on the settlement of commissary general Joseph Trumbull's accounts. For the superintendent's role in and the congressional response to the settlement of Trumbull's accounts, which involved the controversial issue of determining rates of depreciation to be allowed in such settlements, see Morris, Papers (Ferguson), 5:601-2, 6:5-7, 12-13, 17-18, l52, 223-24, 293; and JCC, 22:415n, 23:464-65, 631, 691-92.  2 See Thomson's Notes of Debates, September 16-17, 1782.  3 For these debates of December 17 and 20, 1781, in which Edmund Burke attempted to embarrass the North ministry over the severe treatment accorded Henry Laurens, see The Parliamentary Register, 5:184-97, 224-28; and note 5 below. On December 20, Burke had moved to introduce the December 1 petition from Laurens that Thomson appended at the conclusion of this entry, but the attempt was rebuffed and the petition \""was ordered to lie on the table.\"" Ibid., pp. 227-28.  Madison had apparently obtained this copy of the Parliamentary Register from the secretary for foreign affairs, Robert R. Livingston, to whom it had probably been delivered with the letters of June 25 and 29, 1782, from Benjamin Franklin received the previous day. See PCC, item 82, 2:164-99; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 5:478-79, 510-13, 533-35.  4 There is no mention of this day's debate on Laurens' status in the journals, where Madison's motion and the vote rejecting it appear under the proceedings of September 20, for which see JCC, 23:592-93; and the following entry. For Madison's role in seeking to delay any congressional response to Laurens' request to resign his peace commission, see also Madison to Randolph, September 24, 1782.  5 At this point in Madison's copy of this document, which he enclosed in his letter to Edmund Randolph of September 24, Madison inserted an asterisk to which he keyed the following observation in the margin: \""I am informed that at the time of the stamp act his House was beset by a mob in consequence of his Known heterodoxy.\""  Madison's enclosure to Randolph also included the following \""Extract from the speech of Mr. Burke on the 17th Decr. 1781.\""  \""But was the treatment of Mr. L[aurens] in the Tower consonant to sound policy? Was it prudent to sour the minds of the Americans agst. England by the ill usage of their great & respectable President; was it politic to make him think ill of England? Ill usage might do it, but nothing else could; for he carried his love for this country even to doting; he had sent his children to receive their education in it, & to learn to love this Country; he had long opposed the disunion of B. & A.; and if any thing set him ill with his Countrymen, it was the opinion they entertained that he was too well affected to the interests of England.\"" Madison Papers, DLC.

  September 20. [1782] The journal of yesterday and the dispatches being read, Mr Madison arose and called the attention of the house to the subject of his motion.(1) The objections started yesterday he observed were grounded chiefly on the want of authenticity, though something had been said of the inoffensiveness of the petition, admitting it to be genuine. He admitted that the proofs he had adduced would not be sufficient to convict a man on a trial for his life; it is possible they might not even be admitted in a court of law; but in matter of policy and in examin- SEPTEMBER 20, 1782  ing the propriety of continuing a person in office, they might be adduced to that house, and would without doubt have due attention paid to them. The publication contains an account of the proceeding and debates in parliament from day to day. It is made at the time and in the place where the transaction passed, & where any misrepresentation might be easily detected. The petition is introduced by a member whose name is mentioned.(2) Debates ensue, the substance of which is given; the speakers named; an order passed and the petition inserted, not in substance but in the very words with the address & the date of time and place, and signed with the name of the petitioner. All these circumstances carry with them such marks of authenticity as can hardly be doubted. With regard to the matter of the petition he thought it unworthy a private citizen of the United States, but coming from a Public Minister vested with so high a character who had been President of that house to whom the representatives of the King of Great Britain had paid homage, and who was then commissioned to represent the Sovereignty of these United States, it was altogether unjustifiable. It was not addressed to the Sovereign but to the Speaker and members of the House of Commons, whose authority we denied and whose usurpations had compelled us to have recourse to arms. This petition is stated not as coming from a citizen of the United States but a native of South Carolina. What is this but indirectly relinquishing the Claim of Independence which we have so solemnly declared & pledged ourselves to maintain at the risque of our lives and fortunes? A denial of his public character and almost a direct submission and return to that allegiance he had abjured in a private citizen--such a step is unwarrantable in a public minister; it is highly culpable. It is no slight matter for a public minister to deny the Sovereignty of the Country which he is appointed to represent. What then must it be in the petitioner, who had been raised to the highest rank and held the first place in the Sovereign Assembly of these U. S.? The manner in which this is acknowledged-- \""some time recognized by the British Coms in America by the stile & title of his Excy H. L., President of Congress\"" --is too mean and contemptible to deserve animadversion. Let us now examine the Arguments used to induce the house to grant the prayer of the petitioner: \""Your Representor for many years at the peril of his life and fortune ardently labored to preserve and strengthen the ancient friendship between G. B. and the colonies, and in no instance ever excited on either side the dissentions which separated them.\"" Is not this almost in direct terms condemning the measures taken by his Country to maintain and defend their rights, \""in opposing which he risqued his life and fortune?\"" To suppose he alluded to an opposition to the measures of Britain would be to suppose him guilty of the most manifest absurdity, & to insult the house to which he most respectfully prefers his humble petition. But the two following paragraphs puts it beyond all doubt in what   manner he wished to be understood. \""The commencement of the present war was a subject of great grief to him, in as much as he foresaw and foretold in letters now extant the distresses which both countries experience at this day.\"" \""In the rise and progress of the War he extended every act of kindness in his power to persons called loyalists and quietists as well as to British prisoners of War, very ample proofs of which he can produce.\"" These are arguments addressed to the justice of the house to induce them on account of his merits to grant him an enlargement from his confinement. The arguments which follow, drawn from his ill state of health and sufferings in prison, are addressed to their humanity but the humility and tenor of the prayer, considering the character of the person who prefers it, deserves particular attention: \""Therefore your Representer humbly prays your honors will condescend to take his case into consideration, and under proper conditions and restrictions grant him enlargement or such other relief as to the wisdom and benignity of your honors shall seem fitting.\"" Taking it then for granted that the petition was genuine, or admitting a probability or even a possibility of its being genuine, he submitted it to the wisdom and candor of the house whether it would not be proper to suspend the forwarding the resolution of the 17th, and to agree to his motion. However if any gentleman had any doubts or thought his motion too strongly pointed against Mr Laurens he had no objection against altering it so that the end he had in view might be attained. And therefore he would consent to vary it so as to take in both the resolutions passed on the l7th and leave mr L's name out of the motion. Mr J. Jones said he seconded the motion as it was made yesterday. The motion was then read from the Chair in the words in which it was yesterday expressed, whereupon Mr Rutledge arose, and after a short exordium in which he expressed the delicacy of his situation and his feelings from an apprehension that what he might offer on the occasion might be attributed to an attachment to Mr Laurens on account of his coming from the same State, and assured the house that his judgment was not biased by any personal attachments or local prejudices, but influenced solely by what he thought just and right, he entered on the subject, which he said he would consider in two points of view: 1. With respect to the authenticity or genuineness of the petition, he said he would shew that no regard ought to be paid to the publication, and that there were the strongest arguments to believe that the petition there quoted was not genuine. 2. But even granting that it was genuine, there was nothing contained in it to warrant the present motion. It was, he said, well known that the \""Parliamentary Register\"" was a party paper set on foot by those who were in opposition to the late   Ministry, and calculated to support the measures of the minority. Little regard was therefore to be paid to it. Even the bringing forward this petition, and the supporting it as mentioned in the publication, was not done with a view to serve or relieve Mr L., for they only move that it lie on the table, but solely with a design to embarrass and perplex the Ministry. Who can say that the petition was not fabricated by them for that purpose? For his part he thought it highly probable that it was. It is possible they might have induced Mr Oswald, the friend of Mr L., to concur in the measure, and he might have persuaded Mr L., in the low condition in which he was, to give his consent, or not to oppose it; but would this make it Mr L's petition? Surely no. But suppose Mr L. actually wrote, signed, and sent in the petition as quoted. What is there contained in it which can give such mighty offence? It is true he does not say that he is a citizen of the free and independent States of America, that he ought to be considered as a prisoner of war, that they had no right to keep him confined in the tower as a State prisoner. This, he said, would be fine, high-sounding language. But he wondered whether any person here present would use it in the condition Mr L. was. He was committed to the Tower when he was dangerously ill, confined there upwards of fourteen months, deprived of visits of his relatives and friends, and even denied common sustenance. There is a servant of his now in town who declares that to his knowledge he was five days without any other victuals than one fowl. It appears that the Ministry wanted to starve him to death. Then there would have been an end of him. All this time he finds himself neglected by his Country and their servants who ought to have exerted themselves for his relief. He had applied to the British Ministry, but to no purpose. What was he to do? Was he to submit to his fate and die in prison, without making this effort to regain his freedom, and be again in the way of serving his Country? Surely no; it could not be expected. There was a prospect of obtaining relief from the House of Commons. He applies. The tenor of the petition was such as not to give offence, and was calculated to obtain what he wanted. In this view it is proper, and warranted by former proceedings of Congress. Here he instanced the different language held by Congress with regard to the Roman Catholic Religion in the address to the people of G. Britain, and that to the inhabitants of Canada. He then proceeded to observe that the representation or petition declared that it came from H. L., who had been President of Congress; that he had laboured to strengthen and preserve the ancient friendship between G. B. and the Colonies. This, he supposed, alluded to his conduct before the Declaration of Independence, and he appealed to the recollection of Members whether Congress had not expressed themselves in still stronger terms in their petition to the King, and address to the people of Great Britain. That   the commencement of the war was a subject of grief to him might be very true; it was the same to many who are now firm friends to Independence. That he foresaw and foretold the distresses which both Countries experience at this day only proves that he was a better prophet than others. As to what is mentioned in the next paragraph, \""that he extended every act of kindness in his power to persons called to loyalists and quietists,\"" though he did not think it a matter to boast of as he abominated the characters there described, and believed he should never have subscribed his name to such a paragraph, yet he would not therefore condemn Mr L., as he was sure that Mr L. referred to his private not to his public conduct. He had acted with him in public office, and he never saw a disposition in him to show any improper indulgence to the enemies of his Country. But as he was a man of wealth it is not improbable he might have extended acts of benevolence and charity to the persons mentioned. Upon the whole he saw nothing criminal in the petition, nothing that would warrant Congress in passing so heavy a censure on him as the present motion carried with it. He believed him to be a man of sense, well attached to the Liberty of his Country, and who would be very useful in a negotiation for a peace. He thought him worthy of trust, and could with great confidence commit to him the interest of his Country, and therefore would give his negative to the motion. Mr Howell wished to be informed whether the facts mentioned in the petition were true, namely: whether he had in the beginning of the contest acted in such a manner as to endanger his life and fortune, and whether he had distinguished himself by acts of kindness to tories and prisoners. Those who came from the same State could ascertain this, and the ascertaining the truth or falsehood of what is set forth in the petition would greatly influence his judgment. Mr Clark firmly believed that the petition was genuine. He did not think there was a member on the floor who doubted it. But it was not that which influenced him. Mr L. had been appointed to an office which he has declined to execute. He no doubt had his reasons; he may have entered into engagement with the Brit. Ministry that rendered it improper to execute the office. For his part he did not know what his reasons were, but whatever they were he was not for ramming his Commission down his throat. If he had been present he should have voted against the resolution of the 17th and would now vote for the motion. Mr Dyer spoke long, and expressed his good opinion of Mr L. Mr Jackson. Does not know Mr L., but has heard a good character of him. He does not believe that the petition is authentic. He thinks it very improbable. Mr Bland spoke against the author or authors of the publication. If such pieces were attended to it would be very easy for our enemies to blast the character of the best men in America, and to sow dissentions   among us. Things had been published in English papers and pamphlets unfavorable to the character of some who were now members of Congress But Congress did not think them worthy of notice, and he did not see why they should take any notice of this.  Mr McKean went into a large encomium on Mr L. He saw nothing criminal in the petition, nothing that affected the heart. He was inclined to believe it might be genuine. He had always considered the Parliamentary Register as a publication worthy of credit. He knew the original author was a friend to America, and that the paper was begun and undertaken at the instance of forty gentlemen opposed to the British Ministry and friends to America, and who supported it by annual subscriptions. He supposed it was still conducted under the same influence, and that it stated facts truly. But from his knowledge of Mr L. and of the high opinion he had of his integrity and abilities he thought him worthy of trust and who would be very useful in the negotiation for peace, and therefore must vote against the motion. Mr Williamson and Mr Lee both spoke against the publication. Mr Rutledge animadverted with great warmth on Mr Clark's observation, \""that Mr L. may have entered into engagement with the British Ministry,\"" and in a very loud tone of voice asked, does the member know he has entered into such engagements? If he does, let him produce his proofs. He does not understand this mode of ______ [illegible] character by surmises. The character of persons in high offices of trust and confidence, and especially of public ministers ought to be sacred and not trifled with in that manner. The gentleman said he did not think there was a member on the floor who doubted the genuineness of the petition. He did not understand such expressions. For his part he very much doubted--nay, he believed it was not genuine, and several others were of the same opinion. Mr Lee and Mr Dyer again spoke in favor of mr L. Mr Jackson thought if the motion passed that it ought to have a preamble, and therefore he moved to affix a preamble stating that Whereas, that it appears Mr L. presented such a petition. This brought on a new debate, or rather a conversation, & it being intimated that if the preamble was insisted on the yeas and nays would be called on the question, the preamble was withdrawn. At length the question was called, and the yeas & nays being required by Mr Wright on the question to agree to the motion.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 21st Septr. 1782. Your Excellency's dispatches by Barclay came safe to hand and claim our serious Attention.(1) Yesterday they woud have been communicated had not an unexpected Business employd Congress to a late Hour and rendered it impracticable. Every Saturday being assigned for the Grand-committee \""on the Publick Credit\"" Congress adjourned till Monday. This unavoidable Delay induces us to dispatch Barclay and trust to some other Conveyance to transmit the Result of the Information with which you have been pleased to furnish us. Barclay's apprehension that his money woud not hold out, and the dilatory progress of every Measure which respects Vermont, gave us no Choice on this Occasion. If it was not for the distresses of our Friends I shoud not be sorry, that this Commotion has taken place, especially as Ethan Allen is the author of it. His character is well known and odious, and there cannot be a plainer Omen of the sinking Cause of Vermont than that it is committed to his Management. What will be the Opinion of Congress it is difficult to determine. If Jersey and Pensylvania have changed their Sentiments something may be done to the purpose. I do not so far despair of Maryland as to believe she will persist in an Error which has been injurious to her best Friend.

  Dear General Philadel. 21st Septr 1782. Tho' I have scarcely time, I feel too sensibly your polite attention to be excused from acknowledging the Receipt of your favor of the 1st Instant by Major Story. I have given this young Gentleman the best advice in my power, and if Mr. Morris inclines, to employ him, will go as far in his Commendation as your Letter, and the acquaintance I have with him, can justify.(1) I am obliged to you for your account of Week's adventure. It happened too near home not to be interesting; and yet whatever may be the appearance from the passivity of the British and the Despair of the Tories; I do not think peace; no not even the evacuation of our native City, so near as is generally apprehended. The naval success of the enemy have hardened the Heart of the British Pharaoh and rekindled his expiring wishes for our subjugation. The Treaty at Paris goes on feebly and all eyes are fixed on the military Operations which will give a Complection to its further Progress at the close of the Campaign and not sooner. But I need not enlarge. Mr. Secretary Livingston has obtained permission to attend for a few weeks on his private Affairs in our State. He will open the Budget and gratify your Curiosity in all points, and I wish you to see him. Barclay has brought us an account of Allens exploit in Cumberland. On Monday we shall introduce the subject under great advantages from this fresh Insult on Congress and aggression on our State.(2) I observe all your Kindness respecting my late ill luck. I shoud not be satisfied with myself if I suspected your James unjustly, and I almost repent at what I hinted; but believe me it was the general opinion from his loose character. No man can more sincerely deprecate the vice of Suspicion than I do. It is too much the reverse of the first of all virtues, Charity, to be pardonable. This family of both sexes commission me to present to you their respectfull Compliments. Be pleased to make mine to your good Lady & Children and to be assured that I am with very great regard--Dear General, Your affect. & most obed. humb. serv. Jas. Duane.

  S' r, Philadelphia Septr. 21, 1782. We have been honoured with your Dispatches of the 16th Instant relative to the violent Outrages committed by Ethan Allen and others on the peaceable Inhabitants of our State residing on the New Hampshire Grants.(1) Congress having adjorned on Fryday until Munday, we have had no oppertunity, with any kind of Propriety, to lay the Information before them, but shall do it before any other Business is taken up on Munday Morning. As in all Probability the Papers will be committed and it may be some Days before any thing finally is determined on, we thought it unnecessary to Detain Barckley, especially as he is anxious to return as soon as possible. This New and unexpected Violence, offered, in direct Opposition to the Recommendations of Congress, to those peaceable Citizens who have always strictly adhered to the same, and the dangerous Consequences which may ensue from such evil Examples, will we trust induce Congress immediately to interpose and exert their Authority for the Releif, and Protection of those unhappy People, our Fellow Citizens, now made Prisoners by a lawless Power. Your Excellencey may rest Assured that we shall exert ourselves to the utmost for their Releif, and that Measures may be Adopted for the future Protection of the Adherents to our State who reside in that District of Country. There are not so many States at present in favour of the Independenc of Vermont as there were last Year and altho a Majority of the States present are opposed to it, yet it is very doubtful if any Decision can now be obtained on the controversy submitted to Congress conformable to their Act of the [24th] of Sept. 1779. We shall however attempt it, if we can find there is the least probability of Success. Our Act of the Legislature for quieting the minds of the Inhabitants in the Northeastern Parts of the State2 has had a good Effect, and we have reason to beleive if the Disputes about the Cessions of the back Lands belonging or claimed by the southern States are settled, few or none of the States in the union will interest themselves in favour of the Vermont Independence. We shall give your Excellency the earliest Intelligence of any Determination Congress shall make on the Communications we have been honoured with. We have nothing new since the Secretary of foreign Affairs left this Place. He will give you a more particular Information of our Intelligence from Europe than we are able to do by writing. SEPTEMBER 21, 1782  We have the Honour to be, with the utmost Respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most Obedient and very humble Servants,  Jas. Duane Ezra LHommedieu.

  Dear Sr. Pha. Sepr. 24th. 1782 The post brought me yr favor of the 20th Instant. Before I say any thing about news I must mention that you have been misinformd relative to my appointment by Congress. It has I suppose taken its rise from a letter I receivd on my way up from Mr Morris desiring me to act as receiver of the Continental taxes,(1) which I immediately informd him upon my arrival here I coud not do consistent with our Constitution, at least so it might have been Construed. There were other reasons which wou'd have been Sufft. to have induced me to decline the offer. Rhode Island is very obstinate Agt the 5 per Ct. Whether they will give way at their next session (in October) is very uncertain.  SEPTEMBER 24, 1782  The paper will give you some particulars of the loss of the Eagle a French Frigate in this bay: She was Commanded by Captn Le Touche who had a Commission from his King for the protection of our Trade. This Vessell carried 28 24-pounders besides 12 of a lesser weight--quite new, had on board a crew & everything compleat for the Guadaloupe now at Baltimore which was to compose part of la Touch's squadron. Mr Marbois tells me that two hundred thousand livers were lost. The Enemy have got the Eagle off & I suppose into New York by this time. Several persons of distinction came over in her, they got on shore among them one or two stiled princes. Our dispatches were not later than the 29th of June. Mr Granville was then at Paris. The death of Lord Rockingham and the alteration in the Ministry in the beginning of July will probably retard the negotiations, if not brake them up. I think we may not expect peace very speedily.  Is it possible to obtain abt £150 of my order from the Treasury? I am in very great want of it: please to let me know if any thing can be done.  Please to present my Compt. to yr Lady.

  Dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 24th. 1782. I am very glad to find that the recovery of Mr. Pendleton's slave hath at length been accomplished. I shall immediately relieve Col. Jameson from the task I had consigned to him.(1) The sum of the intelligence recd. by the French frigates is that Mr. Grenvilles visit & propositions looked for a while very auspicious, but that the hopes inspired by the naval success of the English in the W. Indies had reversed the prospect; and it was expected that tergiversations on the part of the Ct. of London would spin out the negociations till the chances of the campaign should be tried. Whilst Shelburne guides the helm, nothing but some dreadful calamity, or some national commotion, or the fear of one or other of them, can secure us peace. His obstinacy of temper & notorious aversion to our independence, abetted by the same sentiments in the King, will protract the war as long as means & pretexts can be found for it. The Frigate which my last informed you had been run aground in this Bay has been got off by the Enemy & carried to N. York.(2) Among other articles of Prize, nearly 50,000 Dollars fell into the hands of the Captors. Our generous Ally has given us a fresh token of friendship by remitting to us all the interest due or which wd. accrue during the war on the advances he has made to us; together with the expence of the loan obtained for us last year in Holland. He has also agreed to accept the  SEPTEMBER 24, 1782  principal in 12 annual payments commencing one year after peace. According to the stipulations of Dr. Franklin the whole was to have been paid in the year 1788. Mr. Jones commenced his alternate correspondence with you last week. It will go on hereafter according to the former roatation. I am Sir with sincere esteem yrs &ca. J. Madison Jr ""

11162,dg019137,1782,James Madison to Edmund Randolph,"""James Madison to Edmund Randolph
  My dear Sir Philada. Sepr. 24th. 1782. The substance of the despatches brought by the French Frigates mentioned in my last is that Mr. Oswald first & afterwards Mr. Grenville had been deputed to Versailles on a Pacific Mission; <<that the former had only proposed to treat of the Independence of America, & was answered by the Court that it had no right to admit that point to treaty>; that the latter was still (29th June) at Versailles; that his proposals as to the Point of Independence were at first equivocal but at length more explicit; that he associated with them the preliminary that the Treaty of Paris of 1763, should be the basis of the treaty in question; that as to this proposition he was answered that as far as the Treaty of 63 might be convenient for opening & facilitating a pacification, it would be admitted as a basis, but that it could not be admitted in any sense that should preclude his M. C. M. from demanding such equitable arrangements as circumstances might warrant & particularly in {the East Indies & on the coast of Africa. Marbois}1 in an anticipation of the communications to be made by the {Minister of France added \""on the coast of Newfoundland}.\"" In the communications it was {omitted};(2) that upon these grounds there was at first a prospect that negociations would be opened with mutual sincerity and be conducted to a speedy & happy issue; but that the success of the British navy in the W. Indies had checked the ardor of the Ministry for peace, & that it was pretty evident they meant to spin out the negociation till the event of the campaign should be decided. You will take notice that this is a recital from memory & not a transcript of the intelligence. The Frigate l'Aigle whose fate was not completely determined at the date of my last, we hear has been raised by the Enemy & carried to N.  SEPTEMBER 24, 1782  York. Capt. de la Touche & the crew were made Prisoners. Besides merchandize to a great value nearly 50,000 dollars were lost most of which fell into the hands of the Captors. The loss of this ship is to be the more regretted, as it appears, the two were particularly constructed & destined for {the protection of the trade of this country}. Our Ally has added another important link to the chain of benefits by which this Country is bound to France. He has remitted to us all the interest which he has paid for us, or was due to him on loans to us, together with all the charges attending the Holland loan, and has moreover postponed the demand of the principal till one year after the war, and agreed to receive it then in twelve successive annual payments. These concessions amount to a very considerable reduction of the liquidated debt. The fresh & large {demand which we are about to make on him will I fear be thought an unfit return} for {such favours}. It could not however be avoided. {The arrears to the army in January next} will be upwards of {six million dollars. Taxes} cannot be {relied on}. Without money there is some reason to surmize that it may be {as difficult to disband as it has been to raise an army}.  My last informed you that Mr. {Laurens} had {declined serving in the} commission {for peace.(3) His proceedings during his captivity as stated by himself} are far {from unexceptionable. Congress nevertheless were prevailed on to assent to a resolution informing him that his services could not be dispenced with. A few days after this resolution had} passed, several {numbers of the Parliamentary Register} were {received at the office of foreign affairs in one of which was published the inclosd petition. The petition} was {introduced} by Mr. {Burke} was a {subject of some debate and} finally {ordered to lie on the table. The extreme im}propriety {of a representative of the United States addressing} that {very authority against which they had made war with the pusilanimous and almost penitential language of the address} determined {Mr Jones and myself} to {move} that {the resolution above} referred to should {not be transmitted until the further order of Congress.(4) In} support {of the motion it was observd} that however {venial the fault} might {be in a private view} it evidently rendered {Mr Laurens no longer a fit depository for the public dignity and rights} which {he had so far degraded; and} that if {Congress should reinstate him} against {his own desire and with} this {fact before their eyes} it would seem as if they meant {to ratify instead of disowning the degradation}. The {motion was opposed on two grounds}, first that {the character of Mr Laurens and the silence of his letter overbalanced the testimony of the Register and} rendered {the fact incredible. 2dly} that {the fact altho' faulty ought to have no influence on the public} arrangements. The first {objection was the prevailing one}. The second was {abeted by but few}. Several professed {a readiness to renounce their friend in} case {the} authenticity {of the paper should  be veryfied} on the {question there were five noes, three ays, two divided, two half votes ay}. The {petition} had been {published some time ago at New York and} had {made some noise in New Jersey but} was ultimately {regarded as spurious}. There are so many {circumstances relating to this gentleman during his captivity} which {speak a bias towards the British nation and an undue cordiality with its new leaders} that {I dread his participation in the work of peace}.  Your favor of the 7th which had not arrived last post day came a few days afterwards, the Post having been detained by sickness. The subsequent one came to hand yesterday in due time.(5) The expedient of drawing bills here on funds in Virga. even the most unquestionable, has been often tried by us, but in vain. The balance is so much agst. Virga. that no one wants money there; and the evil will increase as the prospect of peace retires. Your credit with Mr. Cowan which procured me £50 with 200 Drs. transmitted by Mr. A.(6) have been of much service to me, but I am relapsing fast into distress. The case of my brethren is equally alarming. As some of Mr. L's friends strenuously maintain that the Petition inclosed is spurious, I would not wish it to be made public through me, untill the matter be ascertained, or he be present to explain it.

  Sir Philada. Sepr. 24th. 1782 Yesterday's post brought us no letter from your Excellency. That of the 5th. instant (1) which had not arrived at the date of our last was received a few days after. By the two Frigates mentioned in our last, Congress have received letters from Docr. Franklin & Mr. Jay who were at Versailles dated the 25 & 29 of June. The sum of the intelligence which they bring concerning negociations for peace, is that the sincerity manifested at one period by the Court of London in her advances towards a pacification had been succeeded by an apparent design to draw the negociations into length with a hope of such further advantages during the campaign as would enable her to rise in her demands. Some communications which have been made to Congress by the French Minister present the same idea.(2) The loss sustained in the French Frigate which had got aground in Delaware bay proves to be greater than was at first reported. The Enemy have succeeded in their attempts to float her, and have taken in her besides a considerable quantity of Merchandise nearly 50,000 Dollars. The paper No. 1. herewith inclosed, being an Extract of a letter from Docr.

My great fear in the cause is there are but 2 Judges. One is Mr Paca who was one of the Judges who reversed the Judgment before & fear he will be so attached to his old opinion that he then did right as not to be Willing to have the cause reheard. I shall spare no pains to effect your wishes that is that Justice take place. Shall send forward Intelligence as soon as possible to prevent a Judgment on the bond am sure they must Continue the Cause if Necessary now the Petition is duly served I have discoursed Mr Phillips one of the Judges of that Court now in this City who expects to attend that Court before it is over I hope he will not leave this City till after the 1st day of Octobr when we expect to be heard on the Petition. I have since my last to you made full inquiry into the other Cause you wrote to me about, have searched the records, find a reversal of the Decree given at N Carolina so far as it respects the Vessel but can find no paper or files. there are none in  SEPTEMBER 25, 1782  the Office, the Judgment of reversal I find to be at the same time with the other respecting Coll Stanton the Judgment counts on an Appeal Notice & no appearance of the Appellee to defend therefore reverse as to the Vessel, you mention the papers or files were sent you by mistake they will shew whether there was an appeal taken & whether Notice was given. I have also applyd to Mr. Stanley who informs me that no appeal was taken that he knows of & believes there was None & that the Cause was most Clear not only to Condemn the Cargoe but Vessel. As I wrote you before I dont see how they can carry their Judgment into Execution against the Estate of Capt Shaw, but if any remedy it must be Against the Marshal (whoever he was) in Nth Carolina but if they should recover of him you might possibly meet with Trouble afterwards but as none of the papers can be found We cannot at present preferr a petition for a new Trial in that Cause.

  Sir Philadelphia Septr 25th 1782  Mr. Brown went of so sudden that I omitted complying with your request in sending back the Copy of the Deed from the Indians to the Susqh. Company & having now an oppertunity by Mr Pumroy I send it by him. I rather Suspect we shall not have a Quorum that is the Number of 5 of the Judges Agreed upon to hear & determine our Cause with Pensylvania, who will meet at Trenton at the time Appointed.(1) Govr Rutlidge now a Member of Congress was one we Agreed upon at first & on whom we much relied absolutely refused. Mr Jones of Virginia was afterwords Agreed to in his room. Mr Jones has since Arrived in this Town as delegate & absolutely refuses to Attend at Trenton & says he must return to Virginia to attend their Assembly before that time. Genll Nelson of Virginia is one Agreed to, the Gentn here from Virginia give it as their opinion that he will not be Induced to come on any Account, & that their Assembly being to sit about that time will also prevent him. The 2 Gentn. Agreed upon in the Jerseys will doubtless attend as they are on the spot, they were it is true agreed to, but it was with a View that the Gentn from Virginia attended, whom we lookd upon as a Counter ballance to those in the Jerseys, tho as to them we are informd they are Gentn of knowledge, SEPTEMBER 25, 1782  Integrity & Impartiality--but one or both may possibly have some Bias. Judge Griffin as he now lives in this City will doubtless attend as he has not refused; he belongs to Virginia, is a Gentn of good understanding, of great Integrity & Candor but if Genll Nelson should not attend and either Genll Whipple or Mr Arnold should fail which is suspected, there will not be to the Number of 5. You are sensible it is not in my power to agree to any other, & whither it will be best I cannot determine. I am sensible it would put the State to a great Expence to have the Gentn. proposed to come to Trenton to Assist on the Trial if the Judges should fail to attend, beside Coll Root seemd to be doubtfull whether he could come & by what I hear it is Uncertain as to Doctr Johnson. Mr. Huntington seems to think he cannot tarry so late in the fall. If Judge Huntington & Mr Ellsworth one or both should set out seasonably to take their place in Congress they one or both might be appointed agents with me in the Cause. I think it would by no means be out of Carracter for Judge Huntington to undertake with me in the Cause, both belonging to the State in simular situations there, & the Magnitude of the Cause will fully Justifye us. I would not be understood to Wish Doctr Johnson or Coll Root to be superseeded, but this I propose if they should refuse to attend & as it would save expence to the State, or if Mr Huntington present could be persuaded to tarry he would no doubt be Very acceptable. There is a Mr. Beaudinot of the Jerseys, now, and for sometime a member of Congress from that state is well known to the Gentn. who have attended Congress from Connecticut. I entertain a Very good opinion of him and Esteem him an Able Lawyer & Councellor a Gentn of good reputation. I should think it not Amiss but of real policy to employe him in our Cause. He is of an Establishd reputation in the Jerseys believe he has allways entertained a favourable Opinion of our Cause. 2 of our Judges are from the Jerseys the Cause may be adjournd more than once before decision, he will be on the spot. I only hint these Matters & Submit it to Consideration; expence I know is to be regarded, especially in our low Estate but we must find money or our Cause must fall. I find that is the Dificulty with most Gentn. I am Compelld to tarry, tho only sent here on a pinch I meant to have been at loose to have left Congress when I pleased but soon found my self Confined or to have left the State without representation which I never yet Esteemd my self at Liberty to do, when I had accepted the trust, but my Cash is near expended. I cannot stay with reputation Nor can I get home. I must tarry till after the 12th of Novembr perhaps a fortnight longer which fear will bring me into a difficult season to travail. My time will be expired at Congress about the lst of Novr. if I could obtain what the State owes or in part for past services for Assembly & Supr Court Debentures, attending Council of Safety &c I would not ask the State but would Spend my own money, but some I must have soon, hope it may be provided in Mr Morris' bills procurred   from Mr Mumford who is in debt to the State or any way most agreable. Coll Root will doubtless Inform & bring what will be wanted at the Trial of our Cause at Trenton.  Many matters are in Agitation in Congress principally ways & means to Supply our Army & tho not to pay past Debts yet if possible to raise some fund appropriated for the payment of the Intrest, which would raise the Credit of Loan office Certificates & Debts funded, whereby tho the publick could not pay them, yet those who were Necessitated for the principle might readily sell out for the full Value. We have Petitions from Various quarters & Clamour run high demanding Justice, at least for Interest. The Intrest payable in France is Stopd & the Intrest on Loans since March 1778 has not been paid, & taxes are refused being paid, because the publick will not pay even the Intrest due on their Debts. If Rhodisland had agreed to the Impost it would in some measure have prevented these dificulties. Congress have recommended a tax on the several States for about 12,0000 to pay past Intrest & for the present year, what is raised in each State to be appropriated to pay the Intrest due in the State, there being no other way at present; a land tax of About a dollar or half a dollar on every hundred acres of Land, is proposed & to be continued & appropriated for that purpose by the Financier. whether it will succeed in Congress or if it should whether it would be agreed to by the States is Very Uncertain, or any other method which might be proposed. The Death of Ld Rockingham has set Peace afloat again which undoubtedly would have taken place had he continued a little longer, but so Providence has ordined. I expect Brown soon to return here, when I may be able to acquaint you more fully as to the results of Congress. Am with the greatest Esteem & Respect, Your Excells obt Hle Servt, Elipht Dyer ""

  Sir Philada. Septr. 25th. 1782. The Letter you did me the Honor to write on the 10th Instt. I Received by Post the 23d Instt.  It seems to be the prevailing Opinion that our Enemy had some Serious Intentions Respecting Negociations for Peace, but since their success in the West Indies they are much Elated and wish to see whether the present Year will not produce something further in their favour. Have no late accounts from Charlestown. The Conduct of the  SEPTEMBER 25, 1782  Enemy at New-York is such, at present, that it is difficult to draw a Conclusion whether they Expect to Winter there or not.  I am Just informed that the Tax agreed to by Congress for the discharge of Interest on Our Domestic Debts, has been forwarded to the several States, as I supposed the Business Incomplete, as to time of Payment &c. I did not Expect it would have been forwarded so soon. You will Observe that the Proportion set to New Hampshire, is not so High as the last proportion was, but it is my fixed Opinion that it is much more than it ought to be.(1) An Express arrived here few days since from the Governor of the State of New York to the Delegates of that State Informing that a Number of Persons on the West Side of Connecticutt River had been made Prisoners by the authority of Vermont, and Inclosed Some Depositions Respecting this matter.(2) You are Undoubtedly Informed of the Transactions there so that I need not be particular--these Papers are now under the Consideration of a Committee what will be Concluded on I cannot Say.  By your Letter of the 10th Instt. I am informed that you Expected soon to Receive some of Mr. Morris's Notes & Determined to forward me a Sum by the first safe Opporty. I am very unwilling to trouble you on this Subject but must inform you that I am Intirely Destitute of Money not having Enough to pay the Small Sums I owe here. I must attempt to Borrow a Sum; It is a Fact that the Extravagant Interest of 5 per Cent per Month is frequently paid here, the Difficulties & Disadvantages of borrowing when this is the Case will be readily perceived. The price of many articles here are very high. Beef is from 8 to 14 pence per pound, Butter 3/ to 3/9d, Wine 27/ per Gallon, Rum 17/, Horse-Keeping at the Rate of £50 per Year, Hay at £10 per Ton. The Rents of Houses in general is more than three times so much as they were before the war & many other Articles as so High, so that It is very Expensive living here, Hope I shall Receive a Sum from you soon which may be Sufficient to discharge my Debts here, and enable me, at the Expiration of the time for which I was Appointed to Return to NewHampshire.  I Inclose you a paper Containing some Extracts &c. The State of our Enemies Councils are Such at present that it is difficult to form a Judgment of what will be done next, but if they have any Wisdom Left, think they had best Employ it in making a general Peace, for a Seperate one with us they cannot have.  I Expect to Send the Commissions you Mentioned, by a private Conveyance to Boston in a few Days. Your Letter to the Secretary of Congress is Received.(3) I Inclose a News-Paper of this day.

  [September 25? 1782](1) P.S. Since Genl.

So Necessary is it for the State to have Constant Representation in Congress.  N.B. By Art. 5. Confederation \""Nor shall any person being a Delegate be Capable of holding any Office under the United States for which he or any other for his Benefit receive any Salary, fees or Emoluments of any kind.\"" By a Resolve of Congress May 7th. 1782 \""Resolved that the SuperIntendant of Finance be and hereby is Authorized to appoint an Inspector for the Main & another for the southern Army to take care that the Contracts for Supplying Rations be duly Executed by the Contractors, &c.\""  \""That the Pay to each Inspector be One Hundred & Sixty Six Dollars & two thirds of a Dollar per month in full of all allowances.\"" This amounts to the round sum of two thousand dollars per annum.  Genl. Cornell will not deny that he was nominated to one of those places immediately on the passing the above resolve if not before, and has had the business in contemplation from that time till he entered on it. He cannot deny that he, as a member of Congress, created the place, ascertained the salary & placed it in the gift of one of the Servants of Congress. That he afterwards while a delegate of the State of R.I. &c, and of course representing its sovereignty, in contravention of the 5th article of Confedn. accepted that place of that servant--abdicated his seat in Congress--and left the State unrepresented.

  Sir, Philadela. Sept. 26th. 1782.  I find my self Obliged to mention to your Hon' ble House my concern for the present state of the old emissions of paper money, as the publick in general and New Jersey in particular may be greatly affected by it. This money I have reason to believe hath been purchased by foreigners as a matter of speculation, and may one day be demanded of us by the Nations to which they belong, to redeem as good, upon the Supposition it was received as such, the contrary of which cannot perhaps be proved. This is not all, New Hampshire some how or other collected into their Treasury five Million of dollars more than their quota to sink; Massachusets and Rhode Island have also a large Surplusage in their states if not in their Treasuries; they request that we receive such surplusage, creditting them, either at the rate of 40 for one in Specie, or at the rate the same passed when received which might be 70 or 75, and Charge such sum in Specie at that rate upon the Delinquent States. Nothing of this kind, tho Attempted, hath been done by Congress, perhaps it never may, but while matters rest as at present, a general discontent prevails to the Eastward so far as to threaten a stopage of Taxes on that Account. I find by the Treasury books, that New Jersey is Creditted for 6,334,335 dollars, paid in & sunk, exclusive of this were 6196 dollars Counterfeit sent back to the Loan officer, as also 554 69/90 dollars noted as improper money to be sent back: thus much I thought proper to inform of, that the Legislature may know how much of the Quota of our State remained unsunk, in order that such further measures may be pursued as the Interest & Circumstances of the state may require. I wished to have it in my power to transmit the exact state of the Publick debts already funded, but as the Accounts now making out are not yet compleated, I can say no more on that Subject than that  SEPTEMBER 26, 1782  the Domestic Loans are computed at something upwards of twelve millions of dollars in Specie--the foreign Loans computed at twenty eight million of livres.  I must also take the liberty of mentioning a matter which greatly embarrasses Congress, I mean that relative to the half pay of officers. This was engaged by Congress previous to the final ratification of the Confederation, but not agreed to by the Number of States as became Necessary for such a measure after that event took place. The New Engd states positively refuse a compliance; The Delegates of New Jersey are also restrained by the sense of our Legislature long since expressed: five states are Sufficient to prevent any appropriations of money for that purpose which requires the concurrence of Nine States. In this affair the disagreeing states do not mean to commit such a breach of publick faith as to deprive the Officers of their just dues. All desired is, that the Officers may be referred to their respective states to receive their half pay, or such other Compensation as the Legislatures may judge proper, without making the same a Continental Charge--each state taking upon themselves the Sattisfying their own Officers--this will be just in many respects; and I believe will give Sattisfaction to the officers; for it cannot be supposed the Legislatures will refuse justice to their own Citizens; and by this measure they can secure the application of their own money. States which have been Multiplying their Officers, and send little or no money into the publick Treasury, wishing to draw pensions for their Citizens from other states, will of Course be Opposed to this measure. This Subject I hope will be duly considered by the Legislature, and their Opinion thereon communicated to their Delegates.  The representation of the Legislature brought by Colo. Ellis, was presented this morning, and referred to the Superintendt. of Finance who I have requested to consider and report thereon as soon as possible.(1) I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Obedient Humble Servt.

  Dear Sir September 30. 1782. The letter from the Govr. to the Delegation recd. yesterday along with yours of the 20th inst.(1) expresses some agitation at the supposed effects of the letters to him from Genl Carlton. Whatever curiosity might be excited by the circumstances attending those letters, or whatever suspicions might arise relative to the views of Carlton, they were un[accompanied as] far as I know, with the slightest imputations on his patriotism. The remittance to Col. Bland is a source of hope to his brethren. I am almost ashamed to reiterate my wants so incessantly to you, but they begin to be so urgent that it is impossible to suppress them. The kindness of our little friend in Front Street near the Coffee House (2) is a fund which will preserve me from extremities, but I never resort to it without great mortification, as he obstinately rejects all recompence. The price of money is so usurious that he thinks it ought to be extorted from none but those who aim at profitable speculations. To a necessitous Delegate he gratuitously spares a supply out of his private stock. I conceive very readily the affliction & anguish which our friend at Monticello must experience at his irreparable loss.(3) But his philosophical temper renders the circulating rumor which you mention altogether incredible. Perhaps this domestic catastrophe may prove in its operation beneficial to his country by weaning him from those attachments which deprived it of his services. The vacancy occasioned by his refusal of a particular service, you need not be informed, still subsists.(4) As soon as his sensibility will bear a subject of such a nature, will you undertake to obtain his sentiments thereupon, and let me know whether or not his aversion is still insuperable? Before he be enlisted in that service it will be fair I think to let him know the circumstances under which it is to be executed. I mean those which drew from Mr. J. the observations which you will recollect. No addition has been made to our stock of intelligence from Europe since the arrival of the Frigates. Some letters from the Marquis de la Fayette & others have since come to hand but they are all of the same date with the despatches then recd. One of the Marquis's paragraphs indeed specifies the tergiversation of Mr. Grenville which had been only in general mentioned to us before. On the communication made by this gentleman to the Ct. de Vergennes of the object of his Mission, he proposed verbally the unconditional acknowledgment of American Independance as a point to which the King had agreed. The Ct. de Vergennes immediately wrote it down & requested him to put his name to the declaration. Mr. G. drew back & refused to  SEPTEMBER 30, 1782  abide by any thing more than that the King was disposed to grant American Independance. This illustrates the shade of difference between Shelburne & Fox. Having inclosed to the Govr.(5) a transcript of the intelligence recd. from N. Y. & Canada which is pretty lengthy, you will excuse my referring you to that source. I take the same liberty with respect to some further proceedings in Congress relative to the back lands, of which the Govr. is furnished with a copy which needs no explanation.  You do not inform me whether the copy of my private Cypher answers the purpose for which it was sent.(6) Mr Livingston has it in view to compile & publish an American Kalendar. He has asked of me the names of the Offices of Virginia of general jurisdiction, with the salaries allowed them. As this will be a very easy task to you, I must beg the favor of you to furnish me with an answer to the request.7 ""

  My Dear Sir Philad. Octr 1st 1782  Your Excellencys favour of the 27th ult. I received yesterday. I Sent  OCTOBER 1, 1782  you inclosed by the last post Herons letters and the Account of wheat received. I will give directions to have a hat immediately made for you tho' my finances are very low.  Our European intelligence respecting the negotiation for peace is not upon the whole very favourable, the British it appears are for procrastination, And it is probable they will try another Campaign at least, in hopes of another 12th of April. If the Issue Should prove unsuccessful, they will not be in a much worse Situation than at present, and a fortunate Stroke at the Combined fleet, would put them in a much better. They will I think for a while longer, trust to the Chapter of Accidents.  Gen. Washington has lately received Advices from Canada (which may be depended on And which has been Communicated to Congress)1 that between three and four thousand British troops are Expected there from England, And 1500 foreign troops from N. York to Strengthen their posts in that Country, while the whole Force of the British nation is to be employed against the french and Spanish possessions in the West Indies. That Col. Campbell had lately had a meeting with the Indians in Canada, at which this informant was present. That Campbell told them, that the King from Compassion to his American Subjects, had ordered him to Acquaint them, that he had determined to Cease Hostilities, and that they must not therefore make Any further incursions or ravages on the Settlements of his Subjects, but must remain quiet untill further orders. The Indian Sacham Answered, that he was very Sensible of the present Situation of the Indians, that the English had been beat everywhere and were no longer able to Carry on the war, And that the Indians must now Submit to the Americans or be Sacraficed. He Concluded by telling Campbell that he Should no longer listen to his lyes, and went off much dissatisfyed.  With respect I am, Your Excellencys most humble Servt, J.H. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Ocr. 1st. 1782 I enclose you some late proceedings by which you will perceive that Mr. Laurens is to be made a victim if possible to the system of throwing every thing into one man's hands. By these votes you will judge pretty accurately who are Devotees to this unjust, unwise, & irrepubli OCTOBER 1, 1782  can system. Except that of N.Y. where one of the ays was from policy given against the motion of which he was probably the prompter.(1) However they have at last fed the one man's pride, vanity & all arrogating disposition by putting him sole in the Commission for negociating with Sweden, which woud not have been done had he not written that it was the particular desire of the King of Sweden communicated to him by the Ambassador of that Court at Versailles, that he might be the person. It was an omission, for which I am blameable, not to have inserted this in the Commission, that if a fiction or a mere compliment, & I suspect it was one or the other, the falsity or the vanity of it might have appeard. The words of his Letter are these--\""The Ambassador from Sweden to this Court applied to me lately to know if I had Powers that woud authorise my making a treaty with his master in behalf of the U.S. Recollecting a general one that was formerly given to me with the other Commissioners I answered in the affirmative. He seemd much pleased & said the King had directed him to ask the question, & had charged him to tell me, that he had so great an esteem for me, that it woud be a particular satisfaction to him to have such a transaction with me. I have perhaps some vanity in repeating this; but I think too, that it is right the Congress shoud know it, & judge if any use can be made of the reputation of a Citizen for the public Service.\""(2) It is with sorrow, I inform you of the death of young Col. Laurens,(3) who was killd lately in a skirmish with the British near Charles-town. He is as much a public as a private loss; & I am much afraid it will be an accumulation of misfortune on his most worthy Father too great for him to bear.  The Enemy have revokd the order for the evacuation of Augustine; but all their motions tend to that of N. York & Charles-town. They are to strengthen the garrison of Quebec, recal their indian parties from our frontiers, & bend all their force against the french & spanish Islands. How far we can in prudence pursue them thither with our land forces, is not yet the subject of discussion. Remember me to Mr Laurens if in Europe, & to Mr. Dana when you write to him.

  Dr Sir Philada. Ocr. 1. 1782. We have red. no addition since my last to the intelligence from Europe: except an anecdote mentioned in a letter from the Marquis de la Fayette, which exemplifies the tergiversation of Mr. Grenville. On his interview with the Ct. de Vergennes he said that the unconditional acknowledgment of American Independence was a preliminary point to which the King had agreed. The Ct. de Vergennes in order to  OCTOBER 1, 1782  proceed with certainty & precision wrote down this declaration & requested Mr. G. to put his name to it. The latter immediately deserted his position & refused to abide by any thing more than that the King was disposed to grant the Independence of America. It is said with great confidence that a fleet is gone from N. Y. to Charlestown to remove the Garrison, & the evacuation of the former place continues to be a subject of conjecture & conversation. Some naval preparations at N. Y. are thought to indicate a projected expedition agst. the French Ships at Boston or Portsmouth. Genl W. has sent to Congress intelligence red. from Canada of the following tenor:(1) \""that despaches have arrived informing the Govr. that a reinforcemt. of 3 or 4000 troops may be expected from Europe & 1500 foreign troops from N. York--that the upper Country will be strengthened by a reinforcement of its posts--& the fortifications of the lower put into the most defensible state, that it was in contemplation of the Cabinet to point the whole force of the Nation agst. the French & Spanish settlements in the W. Indies, that indian incursions are no longer to be permitted into our Frontiers--that Cambell had given notice of this to the Indians, assigning as the motive, that the compassion of the King to his American subjects had been excited by their professions of sorrow for what they had done. A Seneca Sachem replied that the American & French had beat the English, that the latter cd. no longer carry on the war--that the Indians knew it well & must now be sacrificed or submit to the Americans--that it was time to attend to their own concerns & listen no more to his lies. Ample presents, the salve always applied to Indian discontents were administered, but the Indians went home little satisfied with their condition.\"" The Genl. thinks this intelligence bears strong marks of authenticity.

The major is a gentleman of address and you know underst[an]ds intrigue; it is probable he will be the man should Mr Pacca and Colo Harrison decline serving (1)--however you and A. will manage the matter as you please. If you Succeed it will be of service to him, and would therefore be so far agreeable to me. Our European intelligence respecting the negociation for peace is not very favourable, it appears the British Minister is for procrastination in hopes it may be Supposed, of another 12th of April. They will be for trying the fortune of another Campaign and trust to the Chapter of Accidents. Their affairs Cant be in a worse Situation than at present, and if the Issue should prove fortunate they will be in a much better. Congress have just received late Advices from Canada--between three and four thousand British Troops are Expected there from England, and 1500 foreign troops from new york, to Strengthen their posts in that Country, while the whole force of the British nation, is to be employed Against the french and spanish possessions in the West Indies. That Colo Campbell Agent for Indian affairs had, had a meeting with the Indians (at which our informant was present). He told them, that the King had ordered him to Acquaint them that from Compassion to his American Subjects he had ordered, that all Hostilities against them should Cease that therefore they must not in future make any Incursions or Commit any ravages upon them untill further orders. The Indian Sacham Answered, that he was very Sensible of the present Situation of the Indians, and of the English, that the Americans had beat them every where, And that the English was no longer able to Carry on the War--that it was time that the Indians Should look to their own Concerns, that they must now Submit to the Americans, or be Sacraficed. He concluded by telling Campbell that he should no longer listen to his lyes and went off much dissatisfyed.  Transports are gone from New York to take off the garrison at Charles Town; it is probable that this Account is true as preparations for the Evacuation of that place have been makeing for some time. By letters this day received from General Green, We have the disagreeable Account of the Death of that worthy young man and brave officer Colo. Laurense. He was Killed in a Schermish with the Enemy near Charles Town with a few others.   Your Cloathes you will receive by this opportuny. The tomb stone is not ready, and I must defer sending your Blankets till another Opportunity. They will Cost about 40/ each and the stone will Come to between twenty two and three pounds.  You will have some Sport at your Approaching Election of Sheriff. Billy Beall I imagine will be elected. The quarrel between F & S will bring him in. I am so hurried this morning with public Business, that I have Scarce time to Write, excuse inaccuracies. We are well. Kit is fat. God bless you and the Children with health and happiness, your mother desires to Know how Doct. Nelson is, the information would also be agreeable to me.

  Sr, Philadelphia Augst. [i.e. October] 2. 1782(1) Your Favour of the 14th of last month I received by the post wherein you mention my having engaged to write to you on my Way to Philadelphia which I did not recollect, otherwise I should not have omitted what you expected. I have conversed with Mr. Morris about the office of Receiver of Taxes in our State,(2) and I do not think there is the least reason to expect, at present, that he will appoint you to that office. His objections are generally to Loan Officers being the Receivers of Taxes in the States, he has hitherto kept the Two offices distinct and no Person he thinks ought to hold both offices: however if you did not hold the Loan office, it is very doubtful with me whether you could obtain the office, as there are other Persons recommended, for the office, from the state, (I have reason to believe), whose friends have more Influence & will be more likely to succeed in an Application of this kind, than yours. The office at present is of very little Value in our State as the per Cent is the same as the Loan officer is intitled to. It may however be valuable whenever a Peace may take Place and we can raise large sums of Money by Tax.  I am glad to hear that our Frontiers are all Quiet: I hope they will continue so. Many People here are of Opinion that the Enemy will  OCTOBER 2, 1782  leave New York this Year altho the war should be continued. A short Time will determine--at present there does not seem to be any prospect of a sudden Peace. Altho the British Ministry might have been serious in their proposals of a general Peace and the acknowlegment of our Independance; the Negociations are delayd owing probably, to the late Change in the ministry, who probably expect to take the advantage of any Events which may happen during the Campaign favorable to them, and to make the American Independance a Subject of Parlimentary Inquiry. I cannot think however but a general Peace will be concluded before the opening of another Campaign, but the only way to insure Peace is a vigorous Prosecution of war. This week will be celebrated in this City by the Superintendant of Finance (who gives a Dinner on the occation), the Acknowledgment of American Independance by the United Provinces of Holland.(3) Our connection with Holland I trust will be very favorable to us as Loans are opened there by Mr Adams for Money, in which he has had some success. With Regards to your Family I am sr your very Humb Servt.  Ezra LHom[medieu] P.S. This Moment we are informed of the Death of Colo Lawrence who fell in an Action with the Enemy near Charles Town. He was a brave officer & his Death is much lamented. The Information is in a Letter from Genll. Green of the 27th of August.(4) ""

  Dear Sir. Philadela Octor. 2d, 1782 You will find that I have accepted for one Year more.(1) I should have done it with much more Pleasure if I could possibly have flattered myself of being able to render the State any valuable Services--But, Sir, without any considerable Inconvenience to my private Affairs, I can stay here, & barely keep up the Vote of the State. I don't find that there is a Probability of having here any Surplusage in the Delegation. Mr. Jackson informs me he cannot stay, & that he has desired you  OCTOBER 2 1782  expressly to put in his Resignation, therefore his Time expires in about four Weeks. Who will be directed to Join me next, I know not. Should I be obliged to stay, I hope you will give me a Colleague or Colleagues as agreeable as Mr. Jackson. I shall not be very anxious to return till next Spring, for a good Reason; for should I return now--It is possible that I might be obliged to come back & spend another Summer here. However you may have been pleased with the Temperature of the Climate here last Summer; I beleive your Judgment would be very different, & your Feelings, from what they were last Summer, upon an Experiment of several Years successively. I know your Sentiments upon the Delegation--And am sure that your Attachment to the Interest of the State will influence you to use your utmost Exertions in the Legislature, to have such appointed, as will in your Opinion, from their collected Wisdom form the most beneficial Delegation. I do not expect you will return--you will allow to express my Sorrow for it. I doubt not we can with Ease obtain your Appt. to an Office for which you have once been in Nomination.(2) But we must have proper Information of your having Resigned & that your Resignation is accepted by the State. This is more material as it is not long since we have debated the Propriety of a Member's resigning his Seat to Congress who did it with an express View of obtaining the same Office. Congress would have nothing to do with it--they would not allow any mention to be made upon the Journals thereof. As you will not return here, I wish to be informed as soon as possible of your Resignation that we may do ourselves the Pleasure of putting you in Nomination.  We have very little News here. We are induced to beleive that Transports are gone to take off the Garrison at Charlestown--And also that New York will be evacuated this Fall. Sir Guy Carleton has informed Genl. Washington that all the Indians & scouting Parties that have done so much mischief upon the Frontiers are call'd in. That it is a Fact, seems to be confirmed by the Reports from various Parts of the Frontier, that all is quiet; & by a Letter this Day read in Congress from Genl. Schuyler,(3) it is in his Opinion very probable, that the Indian Nations are tired with fighting for the English, & that some of the most inveterate of them will very soon apply for Reconciliation. Private Information from New York says, that a considerable Part of that Garrison, are going to Canada to Garrison the Frontiers of that Country strongly, not with a View of carrying on an Offensive War against us from thence, but merely as Security. That the remaining Part are to go to the West Indies to chastise the Monsieurs & the Dons--if this be true, It does not look like a pacific Disposition. However it is still the Opinion of some, that Peace will be established in the Course of five or six Months. We are entirely ignorant as to any Measures that the new Shelburn Ministry have taken. The last official Information from France mentions that Mr. Grenville was there; that tho' at first he  OCTOBER 3, 1782  appeared to be eager for Peace after the News of the Defeat of Count de Grasse there was an apparent Coldness.  I have wrote you two Letters of Consequence to me. The last is anonymous;(4) It will give me Pleasure to know that you have recd. that in particular. I apprehended the Information would be pleasing to you as you had so lately left Congress: But after all I suppose your particular Friend Mr. Jackson will give you more full; & more accurate Intelligence. You will therefore excuse me if I trouble you needlessly. If any Information I can convey to you will either be satisfactory to you or in any Manner promotive of the public good I shall always think myself amply rewarded.  I have enclosed Two Letters (5) That the Persons who delivered them to me will be much obliged to you to deliver. Mr. Bromfield I suppose is now in Boston.

  My Dear Wife (1) Philadelphia 7th Octr. 1782 We received a day or two ago Dispatches from South Carolina, by which it appears that the Enemy had embarked all their heavy Artillery at Charles Town, & were waiting for Transports to carry off the Garrison. Nothing will happen, I hope, to make them alter their resolution. About the middle of this Month it is thought they will evacuate the Town, & they will probably go to the West Indies. If they have a sufficient number of Transports, they will carry with them about Twelve Thousand Negroes, which they have now in Charles Town, & which have been stolen in their various expeditions into the Country; in that Number may be reckoned One Hundred & Seventy of mine. They will leave us in a most defenceless condition, by carrying all the Cannon from the Town, & will carry to a very great amount, property belonging to the Citizens of our State. All this might with the greatest ease have been prevented by M. de Grasse. General Washington entreated him, almost to supplication, after the capture of Lord Cornwallis, to go with him to Charles Town: but his entreaties were in vain, & our Country has in consequence, been almost ruined. I can never think of this affair without the deepest sorrow, & astonishment. The Enemy made an excursion from Charles Town to collect Rice, & other provisions on the 27th of August. General Greene's Light Infantry attacked them, & unfortunately Lieutt. Colonel Laurens was killed. He certainly was a most excellent Officer, & his loss will be severely felt. I pity his Father exceedingly: he has already had more than a sufficient number of misfortunes to contend with. He has written to Congress that he declines serving as a Commissioner for negociating Peace; & he is expected in America this Winter. Since my Letters of  OCTOBER 7, 1782  27th & 28th of last Month (2) I have enquired about Madame Oster, & hear that she is an amiable, & agreeable Woman, so that I shall be glad to hear that you have determined to come together. General Lee died in this City a few days ago. Mr. Richard Beresford is engaged to be married to the Widow Charles Elliott, Mr. Ferguson's Daughter. I wish to know how you like Mrs. Cooper. The Companion her Husband brought with him when he visited you, & his Letters in praise of Prescot, do not incline me to think very favourably of him. I was in hopes that Mr. Dundas would have quitted Paris, & followed the fortunes of his friend Fuller. Do not neglect to draw all the Money, as soon as you can with propriety, from Leipzig.

The one by Mr. C____ served principally to lead me to the use of the Cover of your last, as you had recd the Cash which I hope was right. We have great reason to expect the Evacuation of Charles Town, but as to New York, it certainly depends on Orders by the next Packett.

The Journals of Congress since May last are not Printed. As soon as Done they will be forwarded as usual.  Congress have at Length directed the same Commissioners who are appointed to settle the Accounts of the several States with the Continent, to Receive, Count and Destroy the Continental Bills Collected in the several States.(1) The Estimates of Expence for the Service of the Year 1783 are Still in Agitation and will soon be Compleated. Two Millions and Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars will be Requested of the States in such Proportion as Congress shall determine, and will doubtless be in the Same Proportion as was lately assigned in the Requisition of twelve  OCTOBER 8, 1782  Hundred Thousand Dollars for Payment of the Interest of bor[ro]wed Monies, which is in our Opinion too high on our State. The amout to be Raised by the States will be 4,000,000.(2) It is uncertain whether the Judges appointed to Try the Cause between Connecticut and Pensylvania will meet; as no answer is yet Recd from the Gentlemen at a Distance, a few Days Time will Determine it but we must be Ready at all Events on our Part.  The Talks about Peace Subsides and all Overtures on that Subject on the Part of Great Britain appear to be Insidious. Congress have Resolved not to Listen to any Proposals of a Separate Peace or Truce but will strictly Adhere to their Alliance with France, whose Court are greatly Please to see the Same Done by each Particular State.  The Ordinance for Regulating the General Post Office has been Considered and Lies for a third Reading.(3) A Loan of five Millions of Guilders is Negociating in Holland, one Million of which was Raised in July last and Subscriptions going on slowly.  The Cessions of the Western Lands as made to the United States by Connecticut, New York and Virginia are not in Terms agreeable to a Majority in Congress. The States Southward of Maryland are Very Fond of their western Charter-Territories and the States which have no such Territory Challenge an Equitable Share in those Lands and Chuse to Receive an Unconditional Cession without any Reserve. The State of Rhode Island still neglects to grant the Duty of five Per Cent on Importations &c by which the whole Measure is Impeeded. Thus Every State may in her Turn lay her Fatal Liberum Veto upon the Doings of all the Rest in the Most Essential Concerns of General Finance.

We have the last week no European intelligence of consequence. Our Colleague Mr. Lee received a Letter from Mr Jennings at Brussells dated the 29th of July the latest account I have heard which says the negociations were not suspended--that it was apprehended Ld. Shelbourne wod. not continue long in Administration as he was universally distrusted. But I fear he has so much the confidence and Sentiments of  OCTOBER 8, 1782  his Masters; nothing but the clamour of the Nation for peace and independence to America, will speedily traduce these events. The same Letter enclosed the Act of the british parliament authorising the King to make peace or truce with the revolted Colonies. We had no account of this Law other than that it was on its passage through the legislature when our Letters came from Europe and it was doubted whether it passed the several benches but now I think it certain that it received the royal assent abt. the 4th July. A report prevailed here two days ago that the Marquis was arrived at Boston a confirmation of this (which I do not report) wod. leave us withot. doubt that the negociations were at an end, or nothing soon reported from them, as that young Nobleman remained behind when the baron Viomenel, Duke Segur &c came away, for no other reason than to render his aid on the important occasion. The policy of Britain undoubtedly is to remove great part if not the whole of their Troops from the Continent to the W.

  My dear friend Philadelphia, Ocr. 8. 1782. Your favor of the 27th of Sepr.(1) came to hand yesterday and is a fresh instance of the friendly part you take in my necessities. In consequence of the hint in your last (2) of a pressing representation to the Executive, our public letter of last week (3) touched on that subject, but the letter rcd. yesterday from the Govnr.(4) which seems to {chide our urgency},(5) forbids much expectation from such an expedient. The letter from Mr. A inclosed for me a 2d bill on Mr. Holker for 200 Dollars, which very seasonably enabled me to replace a loan by which I had anticipated it.(6) About 350 more (& not less) would redeem me compleatly from the class of debtors.  I omitted in my late letters to inform you that the Sweedish Minister at Versailles had {announced to Doctor Franklin the wish of his king to become an ally of the United States and} that the {treaty might be}  OCTOBER 8, 1782  negociated {with the doctor in particular}. A Plenipotentiary {commission has in} con{sequence issued for that purpose}. The {model} transmitted {by Congress is pretty analogous to the treaty with France}, but is {limited in duration to twelve years}.  Mr. L[ovel]l.(7) Notwithstanding the particular {desire of the k}ing of {Sweden--Lee, Izzard} and {Bland} particularly the first & last, {struggled} violently {to deprive} the {doctor of the honour} intended {him}. Their {struggles and} man{oevres} however had {no other effect} than to {display their extreme enmity}.  I have put the above article of intelligence in cypher because secrecy was requested by {the doctor}. The request has not I find been very scrupulously attended to by others.(8) A letter was rcd. yesterday from Mr. Dana, bearing date the beginning of March. He had not then committed the step of which he had rendered us apprehensive, and assigns as the reason of the delay, the incompatibility of {the mediatorial character of the Empress with its success}. You will recollect the doctrine maintained in his former letters on this subject.(9) In the answer to the communications of the French Minister relative to the current negociations at Versailles, Congress after renewing their usual assurances {took occasion to press} upon his {M.C.M. in} very {strong terms the objects} confided {to his discretion} including expressly {the free navigation of the Mississippi}. This I hope has {appeased in some the rage} for {varying the plan of our ultimatum}. How far it will be {acceptable at Versailles} I can not say. When that {paragraph of the answer was read public [to] the minister here by the} committee, {his} emotion was {expressed by a} strong & universal {suffusion of the face}. The Declaration of Congress published in the inclosed paper, will {however sweeten the pill}.(10) Such a Declaration altho' in some respects {objectionable was judged upon the whole advisable at the present juncture}. Our {ministers in Europe} particularly {Jay urged it} much. Commisrs, Emissaries & Spies are {announced in all their letters as the probable vehicles of} British poison.

At the date of the late despatches from France, the passing of the bill was disbelieved, and the supposed delay of it till the next session considered as one index of the hostile views of British Court.

We have not a word further from N York. At the meeting of the Comrs. for settling a cartel, a remonstrance was presented by those on the part of the U. S. on the subject of accts. &c.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 9th Octobr l782. Being much engaged and nothing offering worth your attention I did not write to your Excellency by the Post. Mr. L' hommedieu how- OCTOBER 9, 1782  ever informed you of the State of Vermont Business at that time.(1) Since, Mr. Phelps has arrived and I believe his Eloquence will be well employed. He has opportunities; his singularity draws attention, and he overflows in the plenitude of his Communicative Powers. He is, however, terribly distressed; without Cloaths fit for the season: without money or Credit to pay for his board: and leaning on the scanty support which the exhausted purses of your Delegates can afford. What is to be done for him? I hope your Excellency may be able to remit the supply for which I took the Liberty to write; otherwise I must hasten home. It is my wish to wait for Relief as I suppose Col. Hamilton & Col. Floyd will be here pretty early in the ensuing month--but propriety must yield to necessity. Capt. Rutgers delivered me a kind message from your Excellency which I understood; but how can I think of disposing of your property at less than you value it, for my Accommodation? We have no news of a late date from Europe. The Combind and British Fleets were left by the last Accounts on the English Coasts in a Situation which may produce an Important Conflict. In my opinion, however, neither side will wish to hazard an Engagement on which so much depends. There is no doubt but the British are inferior to the combined powers in numbers; but they think they have an advantage in this Admiral Don Cordova, the Spanish Admiral, who commands the Expedition. I am sorry to hear of my Friend Benson's illness. If my good wishes prevail he will speedily recover. Accept the Colection of papers which I now transmit for your Amusement. They contain all the news. As soon as I can write to the purpose on the Vermont business I shall not fail.(2) In the meantime it would produce little advantage on so beaten a subject to trouble your Excellency with Conjectures. Be pleased to present my respectful Compliments to your Lady; and to believe that I am with inviolable Regard & Esteem, Dear Sir, Your Excellency's affectionate & most obedt. humble Servt. Jas.

  Sir, Philadelphia 9 Octob. 1782. Your acceptable favour of 17 Ult. came to hand a few days ago. I am happy to find that my Conduct in respect to the Impost meets with the approbation of one of my Constituents for whose judgment I have such an high value. For an account of the National debt, arrangements in Finance, taxes, estimates for the ensuing year--Powers of Congress, with foreign intelligence & sundry other matters I must refer you to a late Letter I have written to His Excellency Govr Greene.(1) I expect Congress will demand a Categorical answer from the State in regard to the Impost at next Sessions of Assembly.(2) I cannot doubt but it will be given with firmness. I could wish to attend the Octob. Session of Assembly but it is impossible. Should the Impost be adopted, which God forbid, I should no longer suppose myself the Representative of a Sovereign & Free State; but wish to be recalled by the same act & sink into my former retirement on my little place where I have spent the pleasantest part of my days. You cannot take too much pains in giving the members of the House due information previous to the Important vote being put, which is to decide the fate of the Liberties not of one State only but of 13, & that not only for the present generation but for all posterity. In such a case your well known prudence will lead you to take every precaution & use all Diligence. You hope the Committee for restoring public credit will answer a good purpose. I wish they may, credit is wanted more than money. The high prices evince the plenty of money beyond a doubt. Could credit, public & private, for both in a certain respect depend on government, be restored, it would be easy to carry on the war by credit & moderate taxes without an Impost. If we pay our intrest it is one good step toward establishing our credit. A tax you will s[ee] is ordered for that purpose. I hope it will be approved of. I am happy in the arrival of Dr Arnold. We shall renew the application for the back lands. OCTOBER 9, 1782  I am glad you have accepted the very Honorable appointment to which you refer.(3) The States, who have chosen you are both very happy in the choice & have full confidence in your judgment & incorruptible Integrity.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 9 Octob. 1782. Your very obliging & complimentary Letter 21 Ult. came duly to hand by our friend Dr Arnold 5th Inst. & is now before me. The apologies you make about writing to me were perfectly needless. No body writes more freely to a friend than I do, or perhaps requires more candour & indulgeance--\""Hanc veniam damus, petimusque vicissim.\""(2) I can scarcely excuse you for not writing me before; I expected it. I had written you one Letter, which I did not send for several reasons. If you, who are at home duly considered the great intrest you have in the Conduct of your Servants abroad you would take more pains to give them necessary information & useful hints from time to time as well as to enquire strictly into their Conduct. I wish my Constituents to know every Sentiment I have advanced & every vote I have given; If I have been wrong I may then be convinced of it & put right; If I have been right I shall receive that approbation from the good & virtuous which every honest Servant of the public is entitled to--This is the reward I covet, this is the object of my wishes & while I pursue the good of my Country I am sure to obtain it in Spite of envy itself. For many particulars about revenue, taxes, powers of Congress &c. I refer you to my Letter to his Excellency Gov. Greene of Sept. last.(3) I hope you will read it over & take some pains to see that it is not misinterpreted. It was written in great haste. As the Genl. Assembly will set in Providence & Congress are about to require of them a final & categorical answer in regard to the Impost I hope every exertion will be made on the occasion by the friends of Liberty & a free trade. I want much to be there but it is impossible; should it be adopted I shall no longer consider myself as the Representative of a Sovereign & free State but wish to be recalled to sink again into retirement on my little farm where I have spent the pleasantest part of my days; But I cannot  OCTOBER 9, 1782  suspect the firmness of our Assembly; I hope they will not be driven into any measure. This is but an entring wedge, others will follow--a land tax, a pole tax & an Excise. Is it not best to oppose the first in such a manner as to discourage applications for the others?  I have had an hard time of it in several respects the last Summer here--but the opposition & counteraction from my Colleague has been most grievious; I am now happy in the arrival of Dr Arnold. I doubt not he & I shall agree in substantials at least. Two of the Delegates from Maryland informed me a few days ago that if Congress would not do any thing about the back lands they intended to write to their Assembly,(4) which would set soon to repeal their act adopting the Impost. I hope you will hear soon that it is repealed there. It is not yet adopted in Georgia. I find the Delegates of that State are rather averse to it. I think they never will adopt it, at least fully. The friends to the Confederation increase & that from a conviction that no change can be effected in it by universal Consent. I wait with impatience the Letter you promise by the Post & hope to be better remembred by you in future than for the time past. Please to remember me kindly to the Honbl. judge Foster. Let him know that I still esteem him as my friend & should be glad to receive a line from him. With Sentiments of esteeme, I am, Sir, yours &c, David Howell P.S.

  Sr, Philadelphia, Oct. 9, 1782. Altho your Letter and the Affidavit respecting the Proceedings of the Vermonters were presented to Congress as soon as they met, after your Express left this Place, & were immediately after being read,  OCTOBER 9, 1782  committed,(1) we have not as yet been able to get a Report from the Committee. This delay gives me great uneasiness, as I am sensible of the Necessity of the immediate Interposition of the United States for the Relief and Protection of the Sufferers, and for the Preservation of Peace in that Country. I believe the Delay has been owing more to different sentiments in the Committee, than inattention to the Business. Colo. Bland heretofore has warmly espoused the Vermont Claim of Independance; Mr. Middleton has uniformly approved it; Mr. Montgomery the third Person of the Committee, has I believe lately altered his sentiments on that subject. Charles Phelps, Esquire, has had the satisfaction last Evening of being heard before the Committee Two or Three Hours, with very little Interruption, and laying before them a Number of Affidavits & other Papers relative to the Disturbances by the Vermonters, which Affidavits the Committee judged to be so important that they did not stop to make a report, till they had been read in Congress & referred to them; this I consented to, altho the Report will thereby be delayed one or Two Days. At present it is difficult to determine how far Congress will proceed in this Business, tho' I cannot but think the Votes of seven States may be obtained to put an End to such violent Proceedings. The Back Lands is an object of so great magnitude & Expectation that at present it influences the Politicks of almost all the States; it has become a serious matter, and unfortunately the States are greatly divided on the subject. I much question whether a Vote of Congress could be obtained for Accepting the Cession of the State of New York, (2) altho it should be agreed there were no Dispute in the Title and in Case the other States do not make Cessions of Part of their extensive Territorial Claims, the States who have no unappropriated Land will obstruct Measures necessary to be pursued by the several States, in order to compel some States to make such Cessions of Land, as they say they have reason to expect. Rhode Island gives this as a Reason why she does not comply with the 5 pr Cent Act. We have no late Authentic Advices from Europe. By the last Accounts it was not expected that a Peace would suddenly take Place, but That the British Ministry were still flattering themselves that they could by Emissaries, Artifice or Deception, induce America to make a separate Peace. The British Negotiator, Mr. Granville, in a Conference with Count d' Vergennes, being pressed to commit to writing the offers of Great Brittain respecting the unconditional Independence of America, would say no more in writing than--The King is disposed to grant Independence to America. General Greene is of opinion that the Enemy will leave New York as well as Charles Town this Fall, in order, more effectually to opperate against the French in the West Indies this Winter. Many are of the same opinion here, but I cannot find that there are such Appearances of an Evacuation of that City as will justify such an Opinion.  I beg your Excellency to rest assured that I shall do everything in my Power [to obtain a ?] Decision of Congress in favour of our unhappy fellow Citizens on the New Hampshire Grants and am with great Regard and Esteem, Your Excellencys most obedient and very Humble Servt, Ezra L' Hommedieu Reprinted from Clinton, Papers (Hastings), 8:41-43. 1 See James Duane to Clinton, and New York Delegates to Clinton, September 21, 1782. 2 But for Congress' acceptance of New York's cession, see Duane to Clinton, October 30, 1782.

I expected to have heard from you before this Time when I saw you last; I should be glad to know what success you have had in purchasing Vacant Lands upon the Plan we agreed on at Albany, and whether you have got an Apprisal of the confiscated Lands for which you made a Deposit of Certificates.

The Ministers from these States, as also the Court of France, have been so well informed of the insuperable Obsticles and of the want of Power in Congress & of the Impractibility of their inforcing in the several States any such Measures, that I have no Expectation that such an Article will ever be agreed to, and if it should be, it never will be complied with by the different States. I expect at my return home to be possessed of some money which I should be glad to lay out either in Vacant or confiscated Lands if there should be any Advantageous Purchases to be made.

  Dear General, Philadelphia 12th October 1782. It was not till the 10th that I had the Honour of your Excellency's favour of the lst Instant;(1) Mr Arnold the bearer having been several days in Town before he deliverd it. Sincerely attached to your Excellency by every Motive which can command Affection and Esteem, the Reflections which introduce your Enquiry on Huddy's Case give me great Concern. Whatever may have been the Indecision of the Sovereign Power of these States on Points in which their Commander in Chief hath at any time asked for Direction, a Delay never has been tinctured with Indifference or Disrespect towards him, and much less with a Desire to with hold any necessary Support. The unreserved Confidence reposed in his military Talents and personal Virtues, can want no Proof while the Journals of Congress, or a Transcript of the Powers which he possesses, remain in Existence. I think in a former Correspondence I had occasion to observe on the Dilatoriness incident to a popular Government, like ours, composed of thirty or forty Members from various parts of an extensive Continent.(2) In Cases of Intricacy and more especially where the Passions are engaged Tardiness is unavoidable; and without questioning a Rectitude of Intention, or the Want of Attachment to the Person interested in Dispatch, the Cause may be found in human nature. This I most sincerely believe to be a Key to the Case under Consideration. Shortly after the Receipt of the Proceedings of a british Court martial on the murder of Capt. Huddy they were referred to a Committee. To encrease their Embarrasment the same Committee were also charged with the Complaints respecting the Execution of Col. Haynes, and the Infringement of the Cartell made by Authority of General Greene and Lord Cornwallis for the Southern Department.(3) I know not whether your Excellency is fully apprized of the Subject of the last Referrence. General Greene describes it as a Dispute leading to Consequences which might affect other Departments, and which involved questions respecting allegiance, the obligation of Subjects a[nd] the Rights of Punishment; and which had--it might be Added--enkindled an uncommon Degree of Resentment and even Rage in every Man acquainted with the amiable Character which Col. Haines had sustained. The murder of Capt Huddy with the subsequent Circumstances your Excellency Justly ranks among the difficult, intricate and perplexing Cases which have arisen in the Course of your illustrious Command. It seemd necessary to premise these particulars to make way for a precise and candid answer to your Excellency's Enquiry. It is, Sir, from the Difficulty and Perplexity of these two Cases; from the Influence they may have on our national Character; from the  OCTOBER 12, 1782  Impressions they have made on the minds of the publick and of Individuals; from the Peremptoriness of our past menaces: from the Change of the British Cabinet and of the Temper of the British Nation; from the pacific assurances of their General; from their evident Despair of Advantage from Coertion or Cruelty; from their withdrawing the Savages; from the Appearances of Evacuation; and from the Prospect of Peace; It is from these Considerations combined that a difference of Sentiment which arose in Congress on the first Communication of the two Cases continues and which has prevailed in their Committee not only after frequent and deliberate Discussions; but after an Addition of members to give Room for greater Unanimity. To this moment the Fate of the Questions rests with the Chairman4 who if not undetermined seems to be unwilling that Subjects of such Magnitude shoud receive the Impression of a Report from his single Voice. I beg your Excellency to believe that no opinion has been given by Congress or their Committee that,\""Policy forbids a Decision on Huddy's Case.\"" Had such a Sentiment prevailed, it coud not, it ought not, to have been concealed from you a Moment. Indeed it has been observed, that by the studied Delays of the Enemy, while they so long trifled with your Excellency's humanity, and the Feelings not to say the Life of the devoted Victim, this great national affair receivd it's principal Embarrasment; and that it might therefore be Justifiable to regulate our Conduct by maxims of Caution; and by waiting for the Effects of an impending Retaliation; of the Address of the british Commons for altering the Conduct of the War, and of the pacific assurances of Sir Guy Carleton; And with respect to Col. Haines, by the Event of the Preparations for relinquishing Charles Town. But whatever Force there may be in these Remarks they were never maturd into a Resolution; nor do I know that they made any considerable Impression. My own Opinion is decided and I wish it neither to be concealed nor suspended. By the modern Practice of War, which is become a part of the Law of Nations, qualified and mitigated Hostilities are only allowed to be fair and honorable. All Commonwealths are considered as the natural Avengers of this Law, because human nature is honord by it's Institution and interested in it's observation. Hence, when the hand of Ferocity and Barbarism is employed to scourge Mankind, it is lawful to repress these Extremes and Desolations of War by Acts of Retaliation. There is however a manifest distinction between Retaliation and Vengeance. Vengeance can only fall upon the Guilty: but Retailation which must always flow from a rational Hope to stop the wanton Effusion of human blood, or repress the Extremes of War, may reach even the Life of the innocent; because Justified by the Motive it assumes the office of Humanity. On these Principles I have formed my Judgement,   in a firm Perswasion of the Truth of the following facts: that if the british Monarch is not seriously inclined to peace he at least despairs of success by Coertion or Cruelty; that a mitigated War is the Enemy's true policy; that they have restraind the Incursions of their Savages; that their Generals have given the strongest Assurances that if the War is continued it shall be conducted on their part with Humanity; that the Character of the united States becomes every day more respectable in the Eyes of Europe and of consequence more formidable to our Enemies; that the british House of Commons, the Nation at large and part of it's Ministry are tired of a ruinous War and eager, on any Terms, to regain the Commerce and Friendship of America. These Sir, are the Grounds from which I infer the utter Improbability that the Enemy in the further progress of the War will ever occur again to the Barbarism and Extremes of which they have found the Impotency, and feel the Disgrace. It follows that it is not necessary and therefore not Justifiable to take away the Life of Capt Asgil. I know there are some who yielding to the Impulse of Just Indignation at the enormous Cruelties of the Enemy, wish for Victims to the Manes of our murderd Friends. There are others who think that our national Glory will be tarnished by a Clemency inconsistent with former menaces of Retaliation. Altho' the Change of Circumstances obviously requires a Change of Measures corresponding to the Nature of Retaliation, I censure Neither. Whatever may be the Desire of others, it is mine that this war may be concluded, as it has hitherto been conducted by us, with the Humanity which a benevolent Religion, civilized manners, and true military Honour inspire; This is a Conduct worthy of the Patrons of Liberty; It is a Conduct which will give this Infant Republick a distinguished Rank among refined and civilized Nations; and recommend her to to the Favour and Protection of Heaven. To me it is highly pleasing so perfectly to agree with your Excellency on the manner of issuing this business. Be assured that I will give it all the dispatch of which it is capable; and that it will be one of the greatest Pleasures of my Life to convince you of the perfect Esteem and affectionate Attachment with which I have the Honour to be, Dear Sir, Your Excellancys most Obedient, most humble Servant, Jas. Duane [P.S.] I refer your Excellency for News and Politics to the Secretary at War who does me the Honour to charge himself with this Letter. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 12 Octob. 1782. I hope you have recd the short Letter I wrote you from Princeton.(1) Instead of receiving any advantage to my health by that Excursion I was taken with a fever on my return which lasted 3 or 4 days; but it was not so injurious to the State as there was then only myself here. I have for several days been happily restored to health & attended in Congress ever since Dr Arnolds arrival. For the very particular & interesting information contained in your Letter of Aug. 26th you will be pleased to accept my thanks; and for answer must refer you, agreeable to your own advice, to my late Letters to His Excellency the Governor--The Depy. Govr, Messieur's Jos. Brown, W. Arnold, T. Foster, J. Jenckes, J. Brown, &c. &c.(2) As I have written to many of my Friends on the great occasion of the October Session; which will I suppose determine the most important point ever yet determined in America. Congress, you will see have demanded a definitive answer on the Subject of the Impost.(3) The Liberties of America, the intrests of the present & all future generations are suspended on a single resolve of our little State. I have on every occasion in private conversation in Committees & in Congress used every endeavour to explain my principles of Liberty, civil, religious & personal. I have urged the principles on which the Revolution was founded, the free constitutions of the respective States & the sacred obligation of the Confederation; these have all been laboured to the utmost of my abilities--and I flatter myself that, in spite of self intrest & prejudices, I have obtained a witness in some minds to the propriety & goodness of my political System. But the whole is readily overset by linsy woolsy politicians by the single, tho dreadful word necessity. I know of nothing but that would justify, if it was real--a recourse to it shews only a disposition to carry a Scheme unfounded in reason & argument, by the hocus pocus, magic charm of--Necessity. But cannot the same word be soon employed to effect a return to Great-Britain? And will not those who will give up their Liberties, in one case through necessity, do it in another? I never will yield  OCTOBER 12, 1782  to such a necessity--it is only pretended. There can be no necessity in any possible case to do wrong. You will see, &, I hope approve of the Tax lately ordered by Congress of 1,200,000 Dollars, of which our Quota is 28,800 Dols to pay the intrest of our domestic debt. Our quota is lessen'd about 1/9 from that of the 8 millions. This was effected with difficulty. This requisition is made, as all other taxes have been made heretofore on the principles of the Confederation in conformity to Art. 8. This is our sheet anchor. If we, by adopting the Impost, or any other mode of more doubtful nature, let go this important Security, our quota will be determined by casualties & will be most li[kely] augmented. For it is scarce to be supposed th[at] the large States & those of great influence will ever consent to an alteration, which they are not to gain by. As you will have all the information by the Letters afors[ai]d it is in my power to give you; I have only to request you would act zealously on the present occasion let your opinion be what it will. I conceive all my Constituents have the same right to act for themselves as I have. I wish them to take the same pains to be informed & then to act according to their own minds without being duped, or cajolled by a noise & rattle of words, or overborn by the frightful authority of numbers, or majorities. I could willingly fill up two or three sheets to you on this occasion; but it is needless. I can inform you of no more facts. And I hope & am confidently assured that you are inspired with as many and the same Sentiments on these points as I am. Yours, &c. David Howell ""

  Philadelphia Octr. 12. 1782. The Crises has at Length arrived. Congress have resolved to call our State for an immediate and Definitive Answer in Regard to the Impost. Several of those States which have complied have done it partially and on certain Conditions such as that they Retain the Appointment of the Officers. That no part of the Money shall ever go toward  OCTOBER 12, 1782  half pay or Pensions. That Congress account with them yearly, That it last only till the present Debt or that which may be contracted during the War be paid. Maryland has adopted it only for 25 Years and the Delegates tell Me they shall advise their State to repeal that Grant unless they can obtain a Share in the Back Lands. And Georgia has not adopted it all and the Delegates from that State seem rather Averse to the Measure. Under all these Circumstances will our State be duped into the Measure--under all these Circumstances will our State be duped into the Measure against their obvious Interest? I think they will not. It is an important Step. It is to affect not only the present Generation but all posterity. For if Congress have Art enough to obtain such a Grant will they such in address to keep in Debt so long as they find use for the Impost? They will not. The Exertions of the publick Creditors, the Half pay Officers and of the Candidate for Offices under the Impost Establishment to bring on the Measure and enforce it are almost inendible. I hope those who have undertaken to contend for the Liberties of their Country and Retain the Zeal of 1775 will discover it on this important Occasion. Such an Occasion may not again Exist in the present Age. I Doubt not my Friend but you will make every honorable Effort to prevent this fatal Measure from being carried into Effect. Much lies in your Power and much will be expected of you. Nothing affords more Satisfaction in Life or lays a Better foundation for hope in Death than the Consciousness having maintaind the Rights of the poor, the Weak and the Ignorant against the Rapacity, the Violence and the Intrigue of the Rich, the powerful and the Subtle. These are Works of Righteousness, not to be consumed by Fire. These will bear the Trial while the Wood, the Chaff and the Stubble of Words and Parade which only serve to block Selfish designs shall be burnt up and utterly consumed. If ever I undertook any Business from Principal and prosecuted it with Sincerity it was the Opposition to the Impost. If there ever was a Cause in which I have felt myself disposed to suffer as well as die, and in which I have Suffered as well as acted it is this. I have had an hard Time here while contending against the popular clamour, the Voice of Congress and my late Colleague. I am however Revived by the Arrival of my Friend and Colleague Dr. Arnold. \""As Iron Sharpeth Iron so doth a Man's Countenance that of his Friend\"".(1) I flatter myself the Opposition to the Impost gains Ground. Several Members of Congress have declard their Aversion to the Impost and their Determination to adhere Steadfastly to the Principles of the Confederation. But I know you will not determine the Goodness of a Cause from its Sucess in this Wicked World otherwise you must turn not only Tyrant but infidel for Christianity meets with but few Advocates as well as Liberty. What cannot be undone should be attempted with Care and Circumspection. I can rely on you Shew this Letter to whom you please. Use every honest   Effort to Save the State and America from Slavery.

  Sir Philadelphia Octr. 13th. 1782. Inclosed herewith your Excellency will receive Several Extracts from the minutes of Congress, relative to points highly interesting to the State we have the Honor to represent. By a Resolution of the 10th Instant Rhode Island & Georgia are called upon for an immediate and definitive Answer to the recommendations of Congress respecting an Impost;(1) Upon this important Occasion we cannot admit a doubt, That the General Assembly will adhere to those Principles of Freedom which Characterize the State, and with that wisdom and firmness which have heretofore marked their decisions and which reflect, the highest honor upon their deliberations. We cannot omit to assure your Excellency that altho the interesting cause of the Western Lands has lately been agitated,(2) and the claimants out voted, our assiduous endeavors shall not be wanting to renew the Question as soon as circumstances shall render it proper.(3) As that extensive territory heretofore belonging to the Crown of Britain has in right of Conquest devolved on the United States, by whose joint blood and Treasure the late Revolution has been effected, and as certain of these States, yet continue their Claims to share it exclusively amongst themselves to the prejudice of the Union. We beg leave to submit it to the Wisdom and Policy of the General Assembly, whether it will be expedient for our State to pass the Impost whereby these same engrossers of Land will also be disproportionally benefitted before full Justice shall be done us in regard to sd Lands. To the Extracts above mentioned we have caused the Yeas & nays to be annexed, this we think proper to be done on Questions immediately affecting the Interests of the State--as thereby the Assembly will be informed--not only with how great a Majority, and by what States each is carried, but know the particular Opinions of their own Delegates, and be enabled to give them such directions & instructions from time to time as shall be found necessary. If the Assembly should not make a short adjournment, we shall take it as a particular Obligation to have a further grant of Money to be forwarded in the course of next month. We have no news either foreign or domestic worth Communicating, but what is contained in the Public papers enclosed. OCTOBER 14, 1782  With the greatest respect, We have the honor to be, Your Excellency's Very Hume Servts. Jona Arnold David Howell ""

  Dr. Sr. Philadelphia Octr. 15th 1782 Neither time nor health permitted me by the last post to be so full as I could have wishd with respect to my small affairs in your Hands. You may remember that when we parted I left with you five Hhds. of my own Tobo. amountg. to 5663 lb. Nett with an order for you to receive all the Tobo. that shd. be brought to the Warehouses at Petersburgh on my own acct. either from my own Plantations or elsewhere, at which time I informd you I expected that some wd. be paid me by Mr. Tucker, My Father & Mr. Yates--Since which Mrs. Bland acquainted me by letter that my overseer had brought down four Hhds. and my father had Sent down two on my acct. for which last Mrs. Bland desired Mr. Minor to receive the notes--besides these Mr Tucker was to pay you on my acct. one Hhd. & Mr. Yates was indebted to me three or four which in all s[houl]d be between fifteen & Sixteen Hhds--for all this and the Tobo. of Mr. Randolphs Estate which is at my disposal I had and since have had the offer of 22/6--but had determined not to accept of it. I moreover left with you a Bill of Mr. Ross for eighty dollars, and I think thirty or forty dollars in Specie for Mrs. Bland, with a request that you wd. pay her that Sum and furnish her with what other Sum she might want, which I wd. repay you--for this purpose I had directed her to sell wheat about 80 or 100 Bushels--which she did for 4/ per Bushel to Mr. Nelson--and orderd the Money into Mr. Minors hands--besides which she put by my directions the accts. against several persons Viz. Col. Peter Poythress, Mr. Peyton Randolph and others into Mr. Minors hands to receive--and when received to pass to my Credit. It being my intention to desposit in your hands all the Tobo. and Money I could collect as a sure deposit for me in time of need--and to accommodate you by way of loan with the Tobo without Interest, untill I shd. find it to my advantage to sell it when I proposed to give you the refusal if you were willing to give me the price offerd by others when that Period shd. arrive--and if any balance shd. arise for Merchandize furnishd my family or plantations to pay you such Balance at the end of Six months or when you might demand the same--thus I conceived that the negotiation wd. be advantageous to both, and a perfect reciprocity of good offices and commercial conveniency wd. take place. You will therefore Judge of my Surprize when I was favor'd with your acct. wherein I am Charged with 80.8.4 1/2 of which £33 cash advanced Mrs. Bland is a part--without Cr. for the Bill and Cash left with you to at least that amount--Credited with only 3 Hhds. deliverd from My Plantation instead of four--no Credit given for two hhds. deliverd by my father on my acct.--no Credit given for Mr. Nelsons debt for the wheat--Mr. Tuckers Hhd. which was payable on demand--or any of  OCTOBER 15, 1782  the accts deliverd to Mr. Minor--all the Tobo. absorbed but about £12--and on Assumpsit to the Sheriff standing against that. But Sr. reposing the most entire Confidence, in your honor & Friendship, I have attributed the mode of the Statement of the account to what I am convinced are their proper and real causes, viz mistakes and misunderstandings which have undesignedly taken place, in our little tho complicated transactions. I have therefore no doubt but you will revise the acct. between us and put the matter on the footing it was I am sure originally intended by both of us, tis for that end and that only that I have stated all the Circumstances; expecting that this letter wd. be not only a memorandum to you but a guide in obtaining such Tobo. as might still remain in the warehouse belonging to me but the debts above mentiond from Mr. Yates, Mr. Tucker, Mr. Poythress, Mr. Randolph--exclusive of which Mr. Nelsons acct. for wheat & the Hire of my Cooper hired him by Mr. Minor will come in as auxiliary aids. I shall not be able to transmit my acct. of the Ballance due to me from the treasury to this time by the post of today--but hope by the next post to have it ready--when I shall request the favor of you to draw it out and remit it occasionally as I may want it, by a rough Calculation it will amount to 8 or 900 dollars, (perhaps more) exclusive of what I have already drawn warrants for--this will put you in Cash for any little sum you may advance on acct. of my Taxes independent of every other expectation I have from debts due to me. I propose also to give an order for this years Crop of Tobo. & wheat; on the Principles I have laid down above if they shd. suit you, being determined not to Sell my Tobo. untill I can get the price for it which I ask--unless necessity obliges me. Concering the Tobo. of Mr. Randolphs Estate I hope in my next to write you more fully--the post obliges me to finish this long letter of Business & to assure you that I am with Sincere regard, Yr. obliged Friend & Svt.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia Octr. 15th. 1782 We have again had the dispute relative to the promotion of Colonels to Brigadier Generals before Congress.(2) It was introduced by a report of a Committee, establishing a Principle as a general Rule, \""that the oldest Colonel of a State Line, shall allways be promoted [to the] Rank of Brigadier, when there shall be a sufficient number of Troops belonging to the State for such a Commandt. And that there  OCTOBER15, 1782  were on this Principle two Brigrs. now wanting for Massachusets & one for Connecticut.\""(3) As this Principle made it impossible for Jersey & several other States ever to have a Brigadier, from the small number of Regim[ents] in their Service, I opposed with my utmost Strength, and the resolution relating to Massachusetts & Connecticut being taken up, previous to the preamble containing the Princip, I moved the addition \""& one for the State of Jersey\"". This brought on a very warm debate, and finally the whole was referred to the Secretary of War to take with him to the Army, and then by a Board of Officers to settle a general line of Conduct, and report. Not a word of News--we hear there is an Arrival at Boston from France, or Amsterdam & Letters from Mr Adams as late as the Middle of August, but are not come to Hand yet.(4) Am Dear Sir, Your most Obedt Hble Servt, Elias Boudinot ""

  Dear Sir [October 15, 1782] Extract of a letter from Sr. Guy Carlton to Genl Washington dated Sepr. 12th. 1782.(1) \""Partial tho' our suspension of hostilities may be called, I thought it sufficient to have prevented those cruelties in the Jersies (avowed) (2) which I have had occasion to mention more than once, but if war was the choice I never expected this suspension should operate further than to induce them to carry it on as is practiced by men of liberal minds. I am clearly of opinion with your Excellency, that mutual agreement is necessary for a suspension of hostility, and that without this mutual agreement either is free to act as each may judge expedient, yet I must at the same time frankly declare to you, that being no longer able to discern the object we contend for, I disapprove of all hostilities both by land & sea, as they only tend to multiply the miseries of individuals, when the public can reap no advantage by success. As to the Savages I have the best assurances that from a certain period not very long after my arrival here, no parties of Indians were sent out and that Messengers were dispatched to recall those who had gone forth, before that time, and I have particular assurances of disapprobation of all that happened to your party on the side of Sandusky (3) except so far as was necessary for self defence.\"" The language of this paragraph shews that the hope of a separate truce, if not a separate peace is still cherished by our insidious enemy. We are in hourly expectation of further intelligence from Versailles but have as yet recd. nothing more than has been transmitted to you, on the subject of a pacification. The story brought by the Ostenders mentioned in your favor of the 7th can scarcely be true.(4) The combined fleets could not have left the channel before these adventurers must have got out of the European seas. A letter from Mr. Carmichael of the middle of June speaks of great exertions & sanguine expectations relative to the siege of Gibralter.(5) I wish it may be brought to an issue in time to prevent any interference with the pacific operations. The talk of an evacuation of N. York this fall grows less and less prevelent. That of Charleston has probably taken place by this time, unless new arrangements from Europe have suspended it. An Express I am just told is come [from] Boston to the French Minister who brings acct. of an arrival at that Place from Amsterdam after a very short passage.(6) The Minister has no letters from Europe. His correspondent at Boston (7) writes that the combined fleets had proceeded from the Channel for Gibralter, that unless this Garrison sd. be speedily relieved its fall was certain, that the British fleet had returnd into port, that the French Trade with the W. Indies had arrived safe and that the French affairs in the E. Indies were in gen- OCTOBER 15, 1782  eral in a favorable train.

  My dear Sir Philada. Octr. 15th. 1782. The offensive paragraph in the correspondence of Mr. L. with Mr. P. spoken of in your favor of the 5th was as you supposed communicated to me by Mr. Jones.(1) I am however but very imperfectly informed of it. We have not yet recd. a second volume of the negociations at Versailles; nor any other intelligence from Europe except a letter from Mr. Carmichael dated about the middle of June, (2) which is chiefy confined to the great exertions & expectations with respect to Gibralter. Whilst the siege is depending it is much to be apprehended that the Court of Madrid will not accelerate a pacification.(3) . . . . . . . . .  The symtoms of an evacuation of N. Y. become every day less apparent. Our next intelligence from Charlestown will proably confirm our expectations as to that metropolis. Our friend McClurg has been here some days reconnoitreing the ground on which he has been invited to build his future fortunes. His mind seems to be so equally divided that I can not yet discover what his final determination will be. If the immediate sacrifices were less inconvenient to his finances, he would, I fancy without hesitation embrace the prospect here.(4) Lovel. (5) On a motion of {Bland a committee} was not long {since ap}point{ed to enquire into} the {detention of the money} and  OCTOBER 15, 1782  {cloathing ordered} from {Holland in Gillons ship} by {Col. Laurens}. The report on the subject which was {drawn by Bland} was {one of the most signal monuments} which {party zeal has produced}. By {mutilating and discolouring} facts in the {most shameless manner} it {loaded Franklin} with the whole {guilt and} proposed finally a {severe reprehension of} him. This {unfair} hostility did {not meet with} the {expected} countenance {of Congress}. After being considerably {exposed a recommitment took place} with {an addition to the committee}.(6) The States which {covet the backlands}(7) are by no means satisfied with the present {prospect of being gratified}. It is in {contemplation} I am told {to renew the attempt} for a fresh {recommendation} on this subject. Unless a {clause excluding the companies be annexed Virginia} will of course {oppose the measure}. I am {not sanguine however} that the {opposition} will be {effectual}. There are not {a few members} and some of them too not the least {respectable} who altho' unfriendly to {the companies dislike} such a {condition as being unnecessary to Virginia and dishonorable to Congress}. I am just informed that an Express which came yesterday evening to the Minister of France from Boston reports with certainty that a Vessel had arrived there after a short passage from Amsterdam. Whether the Express brought dispatches for Congress is not said. The Minister of Fr. is informed by his Correspondt. at Boston, that the Combined fleets had proceeded from the Channel towards Gibralter, that the fall of this Garrison was strongly expected, that the British fleet had returned into Port, that the French Trade from the W. Indies had arrived safe, and that the French affairs in the East Indies were in general in a very favorable posture. These are all the particulars which I have been able to provide for this post. If any dispatches have come for Congress, the next mail will be more satisfactory. ""

The Dutch are very friendly. They will not accede to the Proposals of the British for a separate Peace; but resolve, in all Events, to act in Concert with France and the United States. \""Fitzherbert's Commission enables him to treat with his Most Christian Majesty's Minister, and those of any other Princes or States concerned, without naming the United States. The States of the Low Countries have sent a Minister to Paris, to meet Fitzherbert and the other Commissioners to treat for Peace in Behalf of the belligerent Powers. Spain will accede to no Treaty which shall not cede Gibraltar to his Catholic Majesty. \""Some of the States of Holland have consented to the Treaty of Amity and Commerce proposed to them by Mr. Adams. Another Northern Power has solicited the Friendship and Trade of the United States; and a similar Treaty may be expected soon to take Place there. \""Our foreign Affairs are in a good Train. The national Importance of the United States is constantly rising in the Estimation of European Powers, and the civilized World. Such is their Credit, that they have of late failed in no Application for foreign Loans--and the only Danger on that Score is that of contracting too large a Debt. Instead of regretting that our Credit was no better established, by an Impost, or permanent Revenue to be mortgaged for the Purpose, Posterity, when they feel the Weight of Debt thereby transmitted on them, will admire at its Extent, and rejoice it went no further.\"" MS not found; reprinted from the Providence Gazette, November 2, 1782, where it appeared under the heading: \""Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman in Philadelphia to his Friend in this Town, dated October 16.\"" 1 The author and recipient (the publisher of the Providence Gazette) of this letter were identified after Congress appointed a committee to inquire into the identity of the author because its publication was believed to have undermined \""the honor of Congress and finances of the United States.\"" The inquiry was terminated when Howell confessed on December 18, 1782, to its authorship, while protesting Congress' investigation of him as \""a precedent dangerous to the freedom of the press.\"" See JCC, 23:791-93, 813-17. 2 These letters from John Adams of August 18 and C.W.F. Dumas of August 16-19 were read in Congress on October 17 and referred to a committee consisting of Daniel Carroll, James Madison, and Samuel Osgood. See PCC, item 84, 4:125-32, item 93, 2:87-88, item 186, fol. 63; and Wharton, Diplomatic Correspondence, 5:662, 665-67. Howell's communication of information from them to his constituents was subsequently seized upon to discredit him, undoubtedly because of the key role he had played in mobilizing sentiment in Rhode Island against ratifying the five percent impost amendment. For the controversy over Howell's breach of Congress' secrecy rules, and the protracted campaign of some of the nationalists in Congress to embarrass him for this violation after his authorship became known, see James Madison's Notes of Debates, December 6 and 12; and Jonathan Arnold to William Greene, December 18, 1782.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 16 Octobr. 1782. Yours of the 17 Ult. came safe to hand & is now before me. I feel the loss which the public must sustain in the Death of the late Governor Cooke. His political character will shine among the first Worthies in our State. His singular merit consisted in his stepping forward in the Service of the public at the call of his Country at a very critical time. He was a friend to his Country in time of need. The Sentiments you express in regard to a late production are flattering. It has the evident marks of haste upon it; the wrighter must have had one foot in the Stirrups, as we say, but the Sentiments are good & such as, I hope, will prevail. For many particulars in regard to Impost, half-pay, back-lands, &c. I must beg leave to refer you to my late Letter to His Excellency the Governor.(2) As the Genl. Assembly will sit in Providence you will have an opportunity of perusing all the public papers. Congress have called on our State to give a definitive answer in regard to the Impost; I suppose it will be done at the present Session. I hope every friend to his Country will exert himself on this important occasion. Genl. Cornell has taken an office under Mr. Morris of 2,000 Dollars per Annum; he is inspector of Contracts in the army and Delegate too. Quere, How does this consist with Art. 5th of the Confederation?(3) I am not a little mortified as well as you at British insolence on the Ocean; but it will more fully evince to Europe the necessity of a naval combination sufficient to check a power already become dangerous to their general interests. Our foreign affairs are in a good train. Sweden has courted our friendship. An alliance of amity & commerce will no doubt soon take place betwixt that king[dom] & the United States.

The Committee moved for an Addition of Members, as Mr. Middleton was about leaving the City and could not attend; Mr. Caroll, Doctor Witherspoon and Colo. Dyer were chosen and a Report was brought in and read this morning, a Copy of which is inclosed;(2) and altho it is far from giving that immediate Releif and Protection to the Sufferers which I had reason to beleive was agreable to the sentiments of the first Committee, yet considering the Complection of the Present, at lea[s]t the majority, who have been advocates for the Vermont Independence, we could not expect much more. They say ' tis in vain to keep the Peace of that Country, till the great Question is determined respecting their Claims, which Determination ought to be immediately made, but I fear under this Colour of Tactics the Decision will from Time to Time be postponed, and the unhappy Sufferers in Cumberland left to the mercy of their Enemies. I hope my fears are groundless, and that a speedy Decision of the Controversy, agreable to the Resolutions of the 24th of Sept. 1779 will take place. I am under no apprehensions at present that a Vote of Nine States could be obtained in favour of the Vermont Claims of Independence, even if it could be supposed that Nine States had a Right by the Confederation to make a New State in the Present Case; Yet it is doubtful, whether Seven States will join in opposing that Claim and desiding agreable to the aforesaid Resolutions, which I think is the only consistant Principle Congress can act upon at Present.

I am particularly obliged to you for your anxiety to furnish me with a copy of Doctor Warren's but, I have the pleasure to inform you, that this came in the first collection you were so polite as  OCTOBER 18, 1782  to send me. I agree with you that it is the best in the whole sett. I have not received the one pronounced in 1781 by Mr Dawes.(1) Our Carolina exiles are in daily expectation of flags to return them home by water. I have not forgot your compliments to our common friend Mr Smith, nor to Miss Polly who seems to have engrossed a share of your attention. While the report of the burning of Charlestown was prevalent, they were deeply affected, but later accounts have not only contradicted that; but give us good reason to beleive that the enemy have already, or very soon will evacuate that state. Even though this event was certain, I should continue in Philada till next spring. I mention this as I suspect that you were apprehensive of my having returned to Charlestown. Whether there or here, I shall always feel a particular pleasure in corresponding with a friend whom I so highly value as I do Mr Elliott. We have been alarmed for several weeks past with an apprehension of a drought to such a degree as to threaten a famine. This extends, as I am informed all the way from Massachusetts to North Carolina. Corn is very generally destroyed. Thank God the last night & this day have been distinguished with refreshing showers. It has often been observed that war is succeeded by famine. I wish that this may not be our case. The farmers here have lost their second crop of hay in consequence of which horsekeeping is very high. I flatter myself that the ensuing winter will produce peace. A seven years war is long enough. This present war has already lasted as long as either of the two last wars between France & England. If it had not been for the unlucky defeat of the 12th of April I beleive that we would now have been in possession of peace. The longer it is delayed I hope we will be better prepared for it, & more disposed to relish its blessings. One revolution in a life time is fully sufficient. For my part, I never wish to be concerned in a second one, & shall be very happy to pass the remainder of my days in the languid indifference of private life, peace & tranquility. That I may enjoy this kind of happiness in its highest perfection I long for that state which you so feelingly describe as replete with bliss; but, how long I must first wait is to myself unknown.

The friendly manner in which you are pleased to recollect  OCTOBER 18, 1782  our former acquaintance, under our present comparative circumstances, could not fail to be pleasing. Your feelings are hurt at not receiving more frequent communications from Rhode Island. I have the pleasure to enclose you a line as I presume from a very particular friend of yours.(1) I could readily join you in complaining of my friends backwardness in writing; but the truth is this, when a man leaves his friends & goes into a strange Country he misses his friends, more than they do him--They are at home surrounded by their Friends--We are among Strangers. Add to this the diffidence of many in writing to persons of your rank in life. Be assured, Sir, that the State look upon themselves no less happy on your appointment, than the Continent in that of the Commander in chief. You have many Friends, and I doubt not you will continue to deserve them. Bad as the world is, real merit seldom passes through life unnoticed, tho' it may unrewarded. I left the State last May. I saw your Brothers & Friends at Greenwich, on my route, where I stayed one night. Lest you should not have been made acquainted with all the proceedings at our last Election I inform you that, Wm. Greene is Govr., J. Bowen, D. Govr, Wm. Channing, Atty. Genl., J. Clark, Genl. Treasurer, H. Ward, Secy. Supr. Court, Paul Mumford, Peter Philips, Pardon Gray, Thos. Tillinghast & Jona. Jenckes. J.M. Varnum, M. Genl., West, Holden, Stanton, Miller & brigadiers.(2) Messieurs Collins, Cornell, Arnold (Dr. Jona.) & myself, Delegates. Genl. Cornell is lately appointed Inspector of Contracts in the main Army and his place is supplied here by Dr. Arnold, a worthy man, in whom you may confide. He will spend the winter here. I shall be relieved by Mr Collins in Decemb. (but dont let that interrupt our Correspondance) and return to my family. I wait for the time with impatience; never having left my family so long at once before. You was perhaps surprized at my appointment to a place to which I know myself to be, in some respects unequal. I have no Apology to make for accepting it, but that as it was, on my part, unsolicited, so I shall leave it as soon as a good man can be prevailed on to accept it. So illy are public Services rewarded & so little does public Spirit prevail, that places are not always filled with the best abilities. I had not the most distant thoughts of the appointment till three days before I was chosen--when I was waited upon by some respectable Gentlemen & requested to suffer my name to be printed against Genl. Varnums.(3) I at length consented, and it is not the first instance of popular delusion. After having served three successive elections in the Genl. Assembly & spent some time in the County Court, I was honored with a Seat in the Superior Court. The business suited me so well that I sought no other promotion. My present place is on several accounts disagreeable; but chiefly on account of being absent from home. Perhaps no body was ever more attached to the chimney corner, as we say in New England.  I am happy to find the present members of Congress men of Superiour abilities to what I had conceived. Some men of great learning are among their number; little of my assistance is required. The affairs of the Ud. States are at this day so well digested & reduced to such good order & System under the Heads of the great Departments--The army so well officered & disciplined that foreign affairs excepted, little remains to be done but executive business. The ways & means of supplying the Treasury at present engrosses our attention: could that be effected in Season it would facilitate every operation. As to arrangements in Finance a report from that office proposes, in addition to the 5 per Cent Impost, a Land tax of 1 Dolr per 100 Acres, a Capitation of 1 Dolr per Pole, & an Excise of 1/8 Dolr per gallon on all ardent Spirits. The net proceeds of each estimated at 500,000 Dollars, could furnish a revenue of 2,000,000 per Annum. It is to be regretted that in the actual State of our affairs an accurate Statement of our national debt is unattainable. It is estimated as follows, Viz. Foreign debt 5 millions; Funded debt bearing interest twelve millions. Unsettled accounts with the Army &c. including Staff officers certificates about 8 millions. In all thirty millions. The intrest of which Sum would be 1,800,000, something less than the annual revenue abovementioned. But Congress are not armed with power by the Confederation to carry into effect these propositions; they can only recommend them to the States--Their requisitions for money must all be made agreeably to Article 8th of the Confederation. Out of these four propositions, the Impost alone has been recommended; the others meeting with obstructions in Congress. It has been adopted by eleven States, tho' with restrictions, limitations & Conditions in some States; Rhode Island & Georgia have as yet transmitted no acts of their Legislatures on the Subject. In Consequence, Congress have passed an act requiring an immediate & definitive answer of them on the Subject. October session will produce one no doubt from our State. This is an affair of great expectation. The public creditors are open mouthed against us. Our State would more readily admit it could they reserve to themselves the appointment of the revenue officers, and have the amount thereof raised in our State pass to our particular credit. In the mean time, while these measures are suspended in this Situation, it being of the utmost importance to the public credit that intrest should be punctually paid, particularly on the funded debt, a tax of 1,200,000 Dollars is quotaed to the several States & ordered to be paid in to defray the intrest of our domestic debt for the current year. By the estimates adopted six millions are allowed for 1783, two millions will be required in way of Tax; the remainder will be solicited in Europe by way of Loan. Mr. Adams is negotiating in Holland a Loan of 5 millions guilders on the following terms. 5 per Cent annual intrest, 2 1/2 per Cent to the Society of mercantile Houses, the under- OCTOBER 18,1782  takers in full for procuring the money of the lenders, the principal is to remain fixed 10 years; then to be paid in five equal, yearly payments. One per Cent. on the intrest for receiving & paying it out yearly. More than one million was filled last June & there was a good prospect of its being filled by our last advice. Congress have resolved to make application for four million Dollars in addition. But perhaps I am relating things well known. You will be informed of the result of the late meeting of Commissioners for establishing a general Cartel--no other will be consented to. By the resolve of Congress (4) you will see they have endeavored to guard the people against the insidious views of the Enemy. My official Letters to the State will discover that I never yet conceived the British Cabinet sincerely disposed to establish peace on honorable terms. Their necessities crouded hard before Rodneys affair in the W. Indies. Thos Fitzherbert has a Commission to treat with France, &c. & with all other princes & States concerned, without naming the U. States, & the negotiation is still protracted, his Mulish Majesty has not yielded to our Independance. Next winter effectual negotiations may take place. You will observe that distrust is the mother of Security. You think we have had too much of this at home & too little abroad. A virtuous jealousy even over our own rulers is proper; when it rises too high it is injurious; where it is extinct, liberty expires. In this, as in most things there is a medium, and happy are that people who discover it. As to our enemies, we have every thing to fear from their arts, & their intrigue; but nothing from their arms at present. Our foreign alliances, which may soon be more numerous, secure to us, under the blessing of heaven, a safe & honorable peace. When no more Laurels shall remain to be won in the South, I shall be one of the many, who will bid you a cordial welcome to your native place. I must pray you to present my particular regards to Deputy Govr Hudson, my old college mate (5)--and, others, if such there may be within your present circle, to whom I am known--And to believe me to be with every Sentiment of esteeme, Dear Sir, Your sincere Friend. David Howell N.B. You will excuse incorrectness. I hate copying & this letter is too long. P.S. President Manning is now in this City--Dr. Arnold & myself attended his Lecture last Evening. He informs that the Institution under his Care is to be revived.(6) The house building repaired & a teacher procured. Several young gentlemen have entred this fall.

  Gentlemen Octr. 18th. 1782. By a resolution which is just now passed, General Washington is at liberty to continue or abandon the Post at Wioming, as he shall judge most for the public good, the former resolution on that subject notwithstanding--indeed the former resolution was optional in the General. But from his Letter on this subject, I have good reason to believe that the Continental Troops will be withdrawn, unless a representation is made to the General of the apparently pernicious consequences of such a measure.(1) I objected to any new resolution being pass'd at present 1. Because it was not necessary, the former resolution leaving the matter in the discretion of the general. 2dly. Because Harmony subsisted at present between the two contending States of Pennsylvania & Connecticut, which had not been interruptd since those Troops were Stationd there; But if they were withdrawn, either the one Party or the other might get the exclusive Possession of the Post, and then it would be easy for the Party in Possession to raise obstacles to the decision of the dispute, & procrastinate it to a dangerous length, and I ventured to predict that this would be done or at least attempted, and even should it be decided notwithstanding all attempts which might be made to prevent a determination and that determination should be against the Party in Possession, I dreaded the Consiquences. 3dly. That this Post was the Keystone of protection to a great extent  OCTOBER 18, 1782  of the frontiers of Pennsylvania, and I was so unfortunate as to be decidedly of an opinion directly the reverse of that of the general, respecting the peaceable disposition of the Indians--and may Heaven grant that the event may prove my want of judgment on this point! and that countermanding the Expeditions may be followed by salutary effects! I give Council this information in order that, if they are of opinion there is any weight in my sentiments, they may make such representations to the General as they shall judge the good of the State may require.(2) There is perhaps a necessity for removing the Troops there at Present, if they are so undisciplind & their conduct so irregular & unmilitary as represented; but that operates only as a reason for their being replaced by others & not for evacuating the Post. The Council, will, I hope excuse my offensiveness on this occasion and ascribe it to my anxiety for the Peace of the frontiers. I am Gentlemen, your very humble Servant, Thomas Smith (3) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, Octob. 19th, 1782. Since our last by Brown letters have been received, & by other intelligence we are informed, that five of the Judges or Commissioners agreed upon to hear and Determine the great cause between Connecticut & Pensylvania have accepted their Trust, and propose meeting at the time and place appointed, viz., Genl Whipple from New Hampshire, Mr Welcome Arnold of Rhodisland, Judge Brairly & Mr Huston of New Jersey, & Judge Griffin of Virginia. We rather think it unfortunate for us that Govr Rutlidge of South Carolina, & Mr Jones  OCTOBER 19, 1782  of Virginia have refused, & that we hear nothing at present from Genl Nellson of Virginia. We had in our agreement much reliance on those gentn; tho the others have a good carracter for Candor & Impartiallity, the local situation of four of them are not so agreable as we could wish; tho' it is generally Agreed that the Extended Charters of several of the United States will be considered as very material in determining the extent & Limits of the 13 United States, when their Sovereignty and Independance are Acknowledged in a Peace establishment, to be improved against the Claims of Great Britain, and to Limit the Territory of Canada. Yet those States who have not those extended Charters affect to Consider them in every other respect as Vain and Nugatory, & that every of the States have an equal right to every part which had not before the war been located and appropriated to Individuals; which has occasioned many Disputes of late in Congress, tho the most of the States Claiming under these extensive Charters seem willing to cede at least a very considerable part of their Western claims unappropriated, to the use & benefit of the United States towards defraying the General expence of the war, which, if done to the satisfaction of the other States, would very much heal the present disputes and conciliate the matter; Otherwise I much fear it may be productive of great Animosity & Contention which may terminate to the disquiet & Injury of the whole. New York have made their Cession without Condition; tho I have but a little opinion of their right, yet it has its effect. Connecticut have made a reserve of the Jurisdiction in their Cession which seems to be disagreable, and for my part I know of no advantage it will be to the State; for the fear of a Considerable part of the State, and what operated strongly against our Western Claim some years agoe, was the extending the Jurisdiction of Connecticut into that Western Country, that I could wish, if there is no more objection than I at present see against relinquishing the Jurisdiction, that that Condition or reservation in our Cessions might be taken of[f]. I am sure it would give great satisfaction to Congress, and Imagine it might Opperate kindly & beneficially in our Cause. The Cession of Virginia is still more disagreable, as they make a Condition that the United States pay the Expence they Claim in defending & securing that Country in some former as well as later Indian warrs, & that Congress also Guarrantee to them the remainder of their Western Claim, which has wholly prevented Congress at present Accepting the Cessions. And it is proposed to recommend to the States who have allready, as well as others which have not, to be Liberal in their Cessions & free from embarrassing Conditions & Restrictions; as Congress suppose they may be of great use & service in securing and discharging the publick Debts to enure equally and proportionally to the benefit of the whole; the Deligates from Virginia give some Incouragement of the Liberality of their State therein, and how far the State of Connecticut may proceed I must Submit to their wisdome & good discretion, but wish   whatever is done may be done soon and Transmitted to Congress without Delay, tho I think they may & ought to reserve to themselves a certain extent of territory beyond the Claims of Pensylvania, to make good in some measure their loss, if they should be so unfortunate as to loose their cause with Pensylvania, which I hope & trust will not be the case, but it is Impossible to foresee the event. I Informed some time agoe that the Copies of the Delaware purchase, the Indian Petition & recognition, &c., were all agreed to and accepted as the Originals by the Agents of Pensylvania. I requested in several of my letters to be Informed whether we had not a Copy or Transcript of the 2nd Indian deed to the Susqh. Company, the Original being in England; that Deed was not only free from rasures or interlineations but much more clear in the descriptive part of the Land & Territory thereby conveyd, but have never receivd an Answer. It was that Copy or transcript, if we had one, which was much wanted to gain the previous Consent of the Agents here to its admission, & if necessary for us to produce our first Deed, the last would readily remove all objections or exceptions against the first & have enured to a repeated Confirmation. I hope a Copy of the Earl of Warrick or Plymouth Company's surrendry, counting on the Grants they had made extending near 3000 miles, will not be forgot, nor the Copy of Penn's last Petition to the K. & Council, which we had, & the Agents pretend cannot be found here. I cannot undertake to enumerate all the papers & exhibits necessary in the Cause, & which would be needless, as 2 of our Agents are on the Spot & a Comtee which was formerly appointed by the Assembly for the purpose of making the preparations for our Defence on Mr Penn's Petition, with many other Gentn who are well aprised of what Copies, Evidences, & exhibits will be of use on the Trial. I hope the gentn who assist me will come in season & well prepared.(1) We had the honor in our last to acquaint your Excellency with the late Loan or subscription obtained in Holland by Mr. Adams, which by the way is ordered by Congress to be brot to America in Specie, and to be applied solely to the payment of the officers & soldiers of our Continental Army, also of the late additional Benevolence of the K____g of France, our application for a further Loan, (tho not favoured by the Delegates of Connecticut.) The Voluntary application of the K____g of Sweden for a Treaty of Friendship & Alliance with the United States of America, tho not at present to be publishd here. A Resolve of Congress for the Commissr appointed to Settle the publick accounts with Connecticut, to receive & destroy the old Continental bills Collected by our State; here, I could wish some way or method could be devised to sink the remainder of our proportion of that once Valuable Comodity, as I perceive there will soon arise a great Clamour from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, &c., who have very unadvisedly   got among them a large surplus; in Virginia I hear it has been lately obtained at 6 or 700 for one; it is in this place at about 300. I have applied to Mr Morriss to forward the Commissioner to settle accounts with Connecticut; he now Informs me he has sent him his orders and Instructions.(2) We are Informed by the latest advice that the British Court have appointed Mr Fits Herbert (3) a Commissr or Plenipotentiary from that Court, with full powers & Authority to Negociate and Settle a Peace with the States of Holland, and all other Powers & States with whom they are at War, in which the British King expresses he has it much at heart that a firm and lasting Peace may be Established, Mr Fits Herbert to repair to Paris for that purpose, &c. This was done the latter end of July. Your Excellency was acquainted that Congress had Resolved to recommend to the several States to raise their respective Quotas of 12,000 (4) dollars, in order to pay the past Interest of all the publick Debts or Loan or which might be adjusted & setled in America, as the only means to revive the sinking Credit of these United States, & the drooping spirits of thousands in distress for their principal, or at least for a security of the Interest, by which means the principal might become of some Value to them, which was depreciating with the greatest Velocity: the intrest on the first Loans is stopd in France. Congress have since agreed to recommend to the several States to raise by a tax to the amount of Two millions of dollars more towards the Expenditures of the ensuing year, having reduced it as low as possible with an expectation that the further sum Necessary will be procured on loan; the first, to be raised for the payment of Intrest, is to be applied in the State to such of their Inhabitants as have debts & Interest due thereon, an Estimate of the proportion as adjusted on the sum I enclosed in a letter to Mr Sherman, of the last 2 million I have enclosed with this.(5) On these I have to Lament that it was not in the power of your Deligates to have Justice done the State in their proportion of these sums to be raised, notwithstanding Our Utmost Efforts & exertions therein. It is well known I am warm, Impetuous and persevering, Mr Huntington cool, steady and Judicious; our joint Indeavours were not wanting, but in Vain, it is said Connecticut are a rich, flourishing & frugal people, they have great advantages, they must pay now, & when the Estimates are made, agreable to the Articles of Confederation, all shall be put right: but however they were Informed that tho we wished not to have Connecticut out of resentment withold what was right, yet they might Depend upon it, when all was done, she would do Justice to her self, as well as her Sister States & to raise no more of those sums than her proportion, with whom she was well able to Compare herself & Judge with Equity. I have been here now near five months. I fear I have done you but little good. I expected to have had three del____s attending, which   might have given some relief, & to have returnd myself before the uncomfortable season for Travelling came on, but am prevented or must have left the State unrepresented, which I have never yet Ventured to do. When I arrived I found myself unacquainted with the Members composing Congress, or the Course of the business, as the progress of affairs for several months in a Variety of Instances stand somehow related & Connected, and I at present find a very considerable part of matters, plans & projections Interesting to the States, Inchoate, slow in progression, other occasional matters Intervening, unfavourable time or season delaying, yet forming & ripening towards Completion. When a change of Members, in many Instances of necessity, takes place and Months are required to Gain that acquaintance with Men and measures as are necessary for real service & benefit to the publick, tho ever so well disposed therefor, I wish the Gentn designated for the succeding Year may be here in season to commence the year, as it is known my time is expired, and Mr Huntington thinks he must leave Congress before or at that time at farthest; I hope the State will not be left unrepresented, we have experienced the Inconvenience in many Instances, New Hampshire has not been represented this summer, Rhodisland but part, the Massachusetts are in danger of failing soon. The low state of our Finances, & the loss of publick Credit, are truly alarming, But the reducing Unnecessary expenditures, & Chearfull & Vigorous exertion in the payment of taxes, which are Necessary, Industry & frugality among the body of the Peoples, all founded and springing from a principle of Virtue and true patriotism, by the blessing of Heaven may soon relieve us.

I admire the judicious Choice of my Country men of Sheriff and delegates to the Assembly, but I expected to have Seen Colo. S. foremost on the list. It was a matter of impertinance and you Know he was allways as Early in times in stepping forth in the Service of his Country as any man And therefore ought to have been fidelitated. Congress has lately received dispatches from their Minister at the Hague of the 18th August.1 I am not at liberty to Communicate the Contents, but I may tell you that he has not mentioned any thing respecting the negociation for peace. A Mr. Allen Fitz-Herbert was Commissioned by the Court of London on the 14th July as their minister to negociate a peace at Paris. He is Authorized to treat with His most Christian Majesty, the States General of the united Provinces, and with all princes and States jointly or separately whether it is their intention to include under the term States the united States of America is doubtful, however it Cant remain so long, as they must be under the necessity of being more Explicite whenever the negociation is entered upon. Some time ago was published in a New York paper The Tryal of the Revd Bennet Allen for Killing Mr L[l]oyd Dulany in a Duel. The Jury brought him in Guilty of Manslaughter. He was fined one shilling and sentenced to Six months imprisonment. I dont recollect whether I ever mentioned this to you before. Allen had published somthing reflecting on the Dulany family without putting in his name to it. Loyd Dulany Called upon the author to make himself Known asserting at the same time that he was a liar and a Scoundrel--upon which Allen Sent him a Challenge, they met and at the first fire Mr Dulany fell. We shall leave this place I think the 8th next month and may reach Baltimore about the 11th--my Calling at Annapolis will depend on Contingencies--have Sent you some news papers and pamphlets which may Amuse you.

  Sir, Philadelphia Octr. 19th. 1782. Inclosed you will receive two Resolutions of Congress, for raising Monies from the States, And the proportions in which the same is assigned to each State, it appears thereby, that the proportion to our State is lessened as from a 37th to about 41 & 3/4--a greater diminution could not be obtained.(1) Your Excellency will find in the Resolutions of yesterday a clause which we thought it our duty to oppose, on the following grounds.(2) Because, As by the Laws of the State the Collectors in the several Towns are vested with power, & it is their duty to collect all Taxes as well Continental as others, it would operate to prevent persons from Accepting that office; and thereby embarrass, and greatly affect the Internal police of the State. Because it would in part supercede, in Office, one of the general Officers of the State, and essentially interfere with the duties of his Office. Because, it would create a New Officer in the State, unknown in its Constitution, of foreign Appointment, Independent of the people, and over whose conduct, neither the Legislative, nor Executive Authority of the State would have any Controul. Because it would, in its operation & tendency be repugnant to the Letter & Spirit of the Confederation--particularly the latter clause of the Eighth Article. We submit the justice, force, and Propriety of these objections to the Wisdom of the Assembly--not doubting they will, on this and every similar occasion, pursue their public measures in such manner as shall effectually check the oblique & covert, as well as the direct and open approaches of Despotism. The calls for money in the several departments are very pressing--and the public suffers greatly in its Interests, by the delinquencies of the States, in Taxation: but your Delegates, are happy, that the State they represent is amongst the foremost in exertions. This gives them a Confidence in their Applications and must add weight to every Argument adduced, in its favor. Congress are not yet fully assured of the Loan now negociating, mentioned in their Resolution of the 16th.3 Unless they should succeed to their wishes further requisitions for the ensuing year will be necessary. With great Consideration & respect, we have the honor to be, Your Excellency's very humble Servants. Jona Arnold David Howell N.B. Both Taxes, are apportioned upon the same principles. P.S.

I more & more admire the wisdom that framed the Confederation, that sacred Palladium of all our hopes. Long may it remain entire! From your sincere friend, David Howell. P.S.

  Dear Sir Philada. Ocr. 22d. 1782. The address of your favor of the 14th instant to me (1) coincides with the order which Mr. Jones & myself had settled. It would have been the more inconvenient too for him to have had his turn this week, as the dregs of his late indisposition are working themselves off to his no small disturbance. His lady seems now to be pretty well restored. The Vessel, whose arrival at Boston was I suppose mentioned last week by Mr. Jones, brought Congress a letter from Mr. Adams dated Hague Aug. 18th. Inclosed in it was a copy of a Plenipotentiary Commission issued July 24 to Mr. Fitzherbert who succeeds Mr. Grenville. This Gentleman has been for some time the British Minister at Brussels, and possesses I understand no talents for the management of serious & intricate negociations. His commission like the late act of Parliament is a child of Shelburne's policy and will suit any events  OCTOBER 22, 1782  which the war may produce. It authorizes him to Treat & conclude a peace at the Court of his M. C. Majesty with the Plenipotentiaries as well of the High & Mighty Lords the States General of the United Provinces, as of whatsoever Princes and States it may concern, and as well singly & separately, as collectively & conjointly. The States General had also appointed a Plenipotentiary who was to set out for Paris shortly after the date of Mr. Adam's letter. These are all the circumstances with which we are furnished relative to the business of a pacification. Unless Mr. Adams has written more fully by abortive conveyances it would seem as if the prospect was not very flattering to his expectations. The States of Holland & West Friesland had determined on the commercial Treaty proposed to them and Mr. Adams expected to have a speedy conference with the States General in order to bring it to a conclusion. Congress have reduced the estimate for the ensuing year to about 6 million of dollars; and the requisition on the States in the first instance to 2 million. A call for the residue is to be suspended untill the result of their application for loans shall be known. We have as yet no account of the actual evacuation of Charlestown. From N. York we have no intelligence that deserves credit, of any sort. There are European papers in Town which inform us that the Combined fleet is certainly gone to support the siege of Gibralter, that the British had returned into Port, and that the Dutch was again in the Texel. The last it is said was according to the preconcerted arrangement to have proceeded North About, after disposing of its convoy for the Baltick, & have reinforced the Combined fleet, but was prevented by some accident, or more probably by the machinations of the Prince of Orange whose attachment to the enemies of the Republic renders all its decisive measures abortive. Mr. Adams says vigorous steps are likely to be pursued for circumscribing his power and bringing to light his abuse of it. The death of the Marquis of Rockingham draws after it a very long train of changes in the British Administration. In addition to those some time since made known it appears that the Duke of Portland has abandoned the Ld. Lieutenancy of Ireland and is succeeded by Earl Temple. Mr. Wm. Pitt is made Chancellor & Under Treasurer of the Exchequer, Mr. T. Townsend a Secretary of State, Sr. George Yonge Secy. at War, and Col. Barre paymaster general. He is succeeded by Dundas Ld. Advocate of Scotland as paymaster to the Navy. It is also said that most of the members of the Board of Admiralty attached to the Rockingham system have retired. I am Dr. Sir yrs affecly. J.

The only further circumstance contained in his letter relative to the business of a pacification is the appointment of a Plenipo. by the States Genl. who was to set out for Paris in about three weeks after the date of the letter.(2) The States of Holland & W. Friesland had determined upon the proposed Treaty of Commerce & Mr. A. expected to have a speedy conference with the States Genl. in order to bring it to a conclusion. The same conveyance brought Congress a letter from Mr. Dana dated June 28.(3) It consists almost entirely of a dissertation on the commercial advantage of the Revolution to Russia, which had in consequence of his management been ultimately placed in the hands he wished. As a sample of {his competency to the subject}(4) I subjoin the following paragraph \""Besides, how is Russia paid for her productions &c.? Is it not by an exchange in a very great proportion for foreign commodities? Are not many of these for. comties. of the peculiar production or manufacture of America, such as Rice, Indigo, {sugar, coffee, cocoanuts, pimento, cochineal} and all sorts of {dying woods}. Does it make no difference to the interests of Russia, whether she receives those articles directly from the countries which produce them, or in a circuitous voyage thro' G. B. &c.\"" As a sample of {his political talents} here is another paragraph: \""Immediately after we had red. intelligence here of the late important change in the Councils & in the System of G.B. I consulted my corre- OCTOBER 22, 1782  spondent (5) upon {the expediency of discloseing my public character} without further {delay to her Majestys principal minister}.(6) He gave me his opinion freely & candidly. For your information I need only say that it is the same in every respect with his former one &c.(7) I can not take {upon me to say} that {his opinion} is not {well founded}. My private sentiment {then was that that event} could not fail to occasion a {correspondent change in her Majestys system also} but I knew my means of information were not as good as those of my correspondent, and that tho' every one seemed to think the Mediation of her Majesty between G. B. and Holland in effect at an end, yet in form it was still kept up; so that the reasons {against} &c. might still be supposed to have some influence. This {determined me to conform to his advice}.\"" The Secy. at War lately communicated to Congress an extract of a letter from Genl Washington of a {very unwelcome tenor}. It {paints the discontents of the army in very unusual colours} and {surmises some dangerous eruption} unless {a payment can be effected within the present year}. The Secy. is gone to Head Quarters at the request of {the general}. How {far their joint precautions will calm the rising billows} must be {left to the result}.(8) Congress have reduced the estimate for the ensuing year to 6,000,000 Drs. and the requisition on the States for the present to 1/3 of that sum. A call for the residue is suspended till the result of their application for loans shall be known. The Combined fleet have certainly gone to support the siege of Gibralter. The Dutch has returned to the Texel. According to the preconcerted plan it was to have proceeded North About after disposing of its Convoy and have reinforced the combined fleet. The disappointment is traced up to the machinations of the Prince of Orange whose attachment to the Enemies of the Republic seems to be fatal to all her exertions. For other particulars taken from foreign gazettes I refer to those herewith inclosed, and those inclosed to Mr. Ambler.(9) Mr. Jones has not yet thoroughly recovered from his late indisposition. A partial relapse has detained him from Congress for several days. His lady is at present in a much better State. Col. Bland has also been on the list of Valetudinarians. He is at present out of Town, having made an excursion for the benefit of exercise & of country air.(10) Yesterday's post brought me no letter from you. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 22d October 1782. We have not failed to write you in the course of every week or ten days since we arrived here by such opportunities as presented themselves,(1) whether any new subject of Inteligence occured or not. Letters of intermediate dates containing matters of Inteligence only, are omitted in the Registeration of the Delegates Correspondence. Probably some of our Letters have been miscarried and some of the[m] contain little else than conjectures respecting the designs or operations of the enemy. Of the different subjects on which we have taken the liberty to write, there are two or three to which we are desirous to draw your attention, these we shall endeavor to explain so fully that the present may serve instead of any or all the former Letters. The great subject that has for some Months drawn the attention of Congress is the means of supporting Public Credit & raising a supply for the expences of the next Year and paying the Deficiencies of the present year. We have called the Subject of supply, a great one, because it is emphatically such with us, since we have little to fear from the military force of the enemy who are decidedly inferior in the field and must continue so while we can pay, feed and cloath our army, never was an army worse paid than they have been and are, to say nothing of their cloathes & rations. No Citizen of North America will be surprised at this assertion when he looks over the estimate for the expences of the Year and considers how small a portion of that sum we have actually paid or borrowed. Congress have agreed, for the next year, to attempt to borrow in France or Holland five Millions of  OCTOBER 22, 1782  dollars. We expect to borrow at 5 per Cent per annum; The Brokerage and other expences will raise the Interest, for years, to near 6 per Cent. Some Gentlemen think that we should attempt to raise larger Taxes at home in order to be relieved from the expence of foreign interest. We admit that, for our parts, we have been decidedly in favor of borrowing. The peculiar quality of our Staple & the scarcity of money in North Carolina, we think, will Justify our Conduct. We contend that we are sufficiently rich to deserve credit tho we are at present enabled to pay Taxes; Because Tar, pitch, Turpentine, Lumber, Indian Corn and other the general Staple of N Carolina are too bulkey to bear exportation in time of war. In time of Peace, all those articles may be very acceptable to either of the Nations that may lend us money. We apprehend that in the time of Peace it would be more convenient for the Citizens of North Carolina in general to pay one Guinea than at present to pay one Dollar. We hope that our Constituents will at least approve the loan, knowing how difficult it would be for them to pay a Specie Tax of the twentienth part of their Quota for the annual expences of the War. It is a fact, not to be dissembled, that the different States are not fully agreed as to the best & most eligible means of fundg. and paying off the annual supply. The smaller States and some of the larger ones are extremely desireous to do something with the backlands. Their eyes are so eagerly fixed on those forests that they seem to stumble over the more obvious & productive subjects of Revenue which are nearer at hand. To this hour the State of Rhode Island have not adopted the 5 Per Cent duty. They object, that such a Tax is not according to the Confederation, while they contend for a participation of the Western Lands which is contrary to the express Terms of confederation. In our Public Letter No. 6 August 18th (2) we mentioned the Western Lands and expressed our opinion that these Lands might enable us to pay off a great part of the State debt or such debts as have been contracted for Militia service in the State. As no mention is made of the Western Lands in any of the requisitions that are now forwarded to the General Assembly, it becomes necessary that we should explain why we turned your attention to those lands. The subject of Revenue was at first submitted to a committee of 13, being a member from each State; after much deliberation and debate they reported 1st. that the Western Lands, if ceded to the United States might contribute towards a fund for paying the debts of these States. 2d. That it be recommended to the Several States to impose a Land Tax of one dollar on every hundred acres of Land. 3d. That they also impose a Poll Tax of half a Dollar on all male Slaves from 16 to 60 & all free men from 16 to 21 & a Dollar on all free men from 21 to 60 except those in the foederal army &c. 4. That an excise be laid on all distilled spiritous Liquors of 1/8 of a Dollar for every Gallon.(3) We had not such high expectations as some   of the Committee concerning the productive value of the Western Lands nor did we think that the States at large had any claims on them. The land Tax of one Dollar per hundred acres was, in our view, insufferably unequal. The vast tracts of sandy barren Land in North Carolina can never be measured with the same scale as the uniformly fertile Lands in some of the Northern States. We shall make no remarks on the other articles. There was a clear majority of the Committee in favor of the report, on which occasion we wrote the Letter refered to. However when the report was taken up by Congress every part of it which respected the subjects of Taxation, was rejected. The Southern States on this occasion were more fortunate than in Committee, for three of the Minor States, having but one Delegate each in Congress, were entitled to no Vote when the report was brought forward; hence the question was lost by these who had been a majority; for the[y] could produce but 5 or 6 Votes at most. In the meanwhile it is our duty to tell you that the debate concerning back-Lands is only dismissed for the present; it will certainly be revived whenever the Northern and Minor States are better represented, and as those Lands are like to prove the subject of warm & obstinate Contention, it may be proper to consider whether there is any middle path by which the State may equally consult its honor, its Interest and the public peace. It is expressly provided by the 8th Article of confederation, which is our Magna Charta, that in paying the expences of the present war the quota of each State shall be fixed according to the Value of all Lands in the Several States \""granted to, or surveyed for any Person together with the buildings or improvements thereon\"" to be estimated from time to time as Congress shall direct.(4) The enemy being in the Country is the reason given why this mode of fixing the quota has hitherto been neglected. For our parts we are determined to endeavor by every possible means to put this mode of fixing the Quota in a Train of Execution. Our State cannot in prudence desert that measure. It is more favorable for us than for most other States in the Union. Other States must pay for their large Towns & lands highly cultivated, while we have few Towns & much wood land. But this mode when the western Lands are included, appears to be less favorable. It is very certain that should we keep those lands, should we open the land office & sell them out, the clear Revenue arising from the sale would be very small; they would bring little money into the Treasury; but they would render our Quota of the national Debt near double of what it is at present. For in fixing the quota, every State must be charged with its located Lands, and as Land Jobbers are not a very popular set of Men in any Country, and as the Land are Probably to be valued by indifferent People, we may be assured that the western Lands which are located but not improved will be rated at their full value; and we suspect that our western Lands, on this Side of the Ohio, are nearly double of those Lands already located in the State.  Connecticut, which has a very extraordinary claim to some western Lands, also New York & Virginia have made Cessions to the United States of part of their claims, but they have not yet ceded all that is required, nor are the Terms, especially those of Virginia acceptable to Congress. If North Carolina should be induced to give up any part of her western Territory, we presume she will presume at least require the following preliminaries. 1st. That the whole expence of our Indian expeditions shall pass to acct. in our quota of the Continental expences. 2d. That an actual valuation shall be made of all lands & their improvements claimed by any State before the Cessions shall be confirmed. 3d. That the sundry accounts of every state shall be liquidated & its claims fully established, that so their several Quota's may be fixed of the debt already contracted or to be contracted. 4th. That the Lands thus ceded shall be Disposed of to the best advantage by the consent of at least nine States for payment of Public Debts. 5. That if any seperate State should ever be erected on any of those lands, part of the Public Debt shall be transfered to such State according to the value of the land it contains. It may be infered from these hints that we suspect that some of the States may prove an overmatch for ours in the art of rendering accounts. Craft is on some occasions an over match for honesty; & we confess that when we observe the studied caution with which some of the States seem to elude any attempts to fix a foederal quota; when we observe the manner in which some of them have laid Continental money and are now claiming to pay it in at 40 for one, as part of their quota; and when we attend to the Steps that have been attempted, of less consequence, but in the same spirit, we are induced to think that caution is necessary; and our State will certainly require that other People should be honest if they are generous. In a word as it is certain that the subject of vacant Lands will be resumed by Congress and it is more than probable that our State with some others, will be required to make cessions of part of its vacant territory, we have thought it our duty to mention the progress of the debate and to propose such considerations as seem to merit any attention on the adverse side of the question. We shall ever maintain the indisputable claim of our State to those Lands, against any pretensions or claims whatever; but if the state from motives of Peace or profit should be disposed to relinquish any part of her claims, it will not be infered that our opposition had been groundless. On the General subject of supplies we need hardly inform you that our Army is extremely clamorous; we cannot pay them, we can hardly feed them. There is no money in the Treasury and we are obliged to draw upon the foreign Loans before they are perfected. We know that our State will not be able to raise the quota that is assigned to her for the year 1783, but we are confident she will do all in her power. We have attempted to fix her quota as low as possible & from a Paper we   have sent, you will perceive that we have deducted some thing from the Quota of last Year, though our Circumstances are now more favorable.(5) You will observe that a monthly acct. is published of the Taxes collected & paid in by the different States. Lest from the silence of the Newspapers on that subject it should be conjectured that North Carolina had done nothing towards the Public service, we caused a short account to be published of what was done by our assembly for the current year.(6) The number of Troops raised & cloathed, the public wagons, the provisions Tax & the Tax for a public revenue all which we attempted to place in the most favorable point of light. As it is obvious that his most Christian Majesty, our steady ally, was desireous to know in what manner the United States were impressed by the Birth of a Dauphin we conceived it our duty to address the Minister of France of that occasion. We had the satisfaction to find that the Public seemed to approve and the Minister to be much pleased with our apology in behalf of the State. We hope that our Conduct will meet with the approbation of our Constituents. We shall not trouble you with a general detail of foreign events, some of them however deserve your notice. Ever since the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands acknowledged our Independence, a Treaty of amity and Commerce has been in a train of negotiation; we presume that it is sign'd before this time. The King of Sweden has proposed to one of our foreign Ministers to enter into a Treaty of Amity and commerce with the United States, & we have given the necessary Instructions & powers on that subject. The enemy are extremely desirous to get their Soldiers who are Prisoners out of our hands, but they do not offer a quid pro quo. Congress have determined not to make any exchange til the Commissioners who shall be sent to negotiate a general Cartel shall produce Powers expressly derived from the King of Great Britain, and shall have paid or secured payment for a large Balance due the United States for the sustenance of Prisoners. Attempts have been made in the mean while to secure a partial exchange. Congress have been Zealously pressed to confirm the exchange of Lord Cornwallis for Mr. Laurens. This proposition is the more extraordinary as the enemy at first pretended to liberate Mr Laurens unconditionally. The finess was certainly curious & original. However Congress have not adopted the example in giving up Ld. Cornwallis unconditionally. Such an officer is rated at 1,200 men, which is too large a gift to be made to a nation that never wishes to give us any thing except hard measures. The southern States who are best acquainted with his Lordships good Qualifications are determined, if possible, that he shall be indulged a few Months longer in the repose of his Native Country, unless he would chuse to be paroled in South Carolina. We confess that in this debate we have thought it our particular duty to give Lord Cornwallis credit for the numberless murders he has committed in the Carolinas & Georgia.   Negotiations in Paris for peace move on with such a steady pace that they are hardly progressive. Mr. Allin Fitzherbert, the British Minister at Brussels, is appointed to negotiate at Paris in the room of Mr. Grenville, who we apprehend was only removed that he might be secretary to his Brother, Earl Temple, who succeeds the Duke of Portland in the Lieutenancy of Ireland. Mr. Fitzherberts Commission empowers him to treat of joint or seperate Peace with any of the nations who are at war, But though France &ca are named, America is not mentioned in the Commission. The Dutch have also sent two Commissioners to Paris who might arrive there on the 6 or 8th of September. We have good reason to say they are instructed not to treat of a Seperate Peace. The pending fate of Gibralter must have an Serious effect on the Treaty of Peace to forward or retard it. We have many reasons to be assured that the present British Ministry have imbibed the spirit of their King. They have a vindictive hostile disposition towards America, & would gladly embrace any encouragement to repeat their attempts at Conquest. We have the honor to be &ca, Hu Williamson Wm Blount ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Octr. 23d 1782 I have long been of opinion that in all great Questions, which are agitated in Congress, especially relating to domestic Concerns, the Delegates from each State should consult their respective Constituents, when it may easily be done, at least as to general Principles. The Legislature being now met, I must beg leave, through your Excellency, to state to them the leading Facts of a very important and interesting Question now under the Consideration of Congress, and which is set down for determination on Wednesday next; on which I hope for the Legislatures Instructions; on such general Principles as will necessarily lead to the final determination. The dispute I refer to, is that of the People on the New Hampshire Grants, calling themselves the State of Vermont. When I took my Seat in Congress, I found this Controversy on the Table of Congress, having been submitted to their determination previous to the Confederation, by the States of New Hampshire & New York, and the People stiling themselves as the State of Vermont, on the principles of the Confederation then in an incomplete, unfinished State. A Hearing was thereupon had before Congress, when the States of New Hampshire & New York produced many Documents in support of their different Claims (Massachusets one of the claiming States, not attending but agreeing to relinquish their Right, provided the districk was made an independant State) the first founded on this Territory being within their Purchase under the Plymouth Company, & long possessed by them--the second adding to a continual Claim the determination of the King in Council in the  OCTOBER 23, 1792  Year 1764 in their Favour founded on the Patent to the Duke of York. The People of Vermont urged their having been several Years independant de Facto and in the exercise of sovereign Power protested agt. any Power in the world interfereing with it and insisted that their Boundaries only were submitted to the determination of Congress. Thus the Business stood undetermined, when we were informed that Vermont had extended her Claim & Jurisdiction Eastward into New Hampshire, where 51 Towns had voluntarily submitted to her Authority; and to the westward, she extended quite to the North River--That the People were defending themselves agt. the States of New Hampshire & New York by Force of Arms. Soon after, we recd. authentic Intelligence that some leading People in Vermont, had met Commissioners from General Haldiman, with whom Terms had been agreed on, for a Submission to Great Brittain--That these Terms had been sent to the Commissioners for Peace &c at New York for their Ratification, and by them to England for Instructions--That General Clinton laid great Stress, on this Measure, and had expressed Hopes thereby to conquer the Northern States. The peculiar Circumstances of this People and the danger of a civill War among ourselves, at a Time when we found difficulty enough, in carrying on the war agt. the Common Enemy; led Congress to leave the Ground on which the dispute, as submitted to them, then stood; and considering themselves the Guardians of the general Interests of the united States, and in duty bound to prevent every Injury to the union and particularly such as threatned their Existence as a Nation, took the matter up, in a general & extensive View & with the Consent of Nine States, passed the Resolutions of the 7th & 20th of August 1781. The People of Vermont were then met in general Assembly, including representatives from the Eastern & Western Incroachments. These together imprudently rejected the Terms proposed by Congress in those resolutions. But soon after, before any farther Steps taken by Congress, their Assembly again met, and by a public Act, relinquished & disclaimed those Incroachments, thereby complying with the Terms proposed and immediately forwarded delegates to Congress. A Committee was accordingly appointed to Confer with these Delegates or Commissioners, who reported to Congress, as appears by the Journals; but no determination on this report could be obtained, it being alledged that Congress was not bound by the sd resolutions of August, and New York solemnly protested agt the Power of Congress to determine otherwise than agreeable to & under the Submission, which also appears on the Journals. Your Excellency will see the reports & Acts of Congress on the printed Journals, I left with the House last Fall. The great Questions necessary for the Consideration of Congress, I concieve will be  1st. On the Submission of the sd. States, ought Congress to deter- OCTOBER 23, 1782  mine, any part of a former Colony (who have separated from the same, at the begining of the revolution, and are in the actual Exercise of an independant Sovereignty de facto) to be independant de Jure and receive them into the union as a fourteenth State? 2d. Can Congress as sovereign Guardians of the United States, when they conceive the general Safety of the common Cause shall require it, recieve into the Union as a separate State, any Territory & People in the actual Possession of Sovereignty & Independance de facto, without examining into & determining the Right & Title of such People de Jure? 3d. In the present State & Circumstances of the People styling themselves the State of Vermont, ought Congress to recieve them into the Union, as an independant State agreeable to the resolves of 7th & 20th Augt 1781? 4th. In Case Congress shall refuse to recieve them (as is most likely) ought the Delegates of New Jersey to agree to the sending the Continental Army or a sufficient part thereof, in the sd. Territory, to subdue the Inhabitants to the obedience & Subjection of the State or States that claim their Allegiance? In the past Altercations on these Subjects, your Delegates have generally considered the Congress as sovereign Guardians of the whole Union, and that they ought to prefer the general Good, to every private Interest of a particular State. That the shedding the Blood of our Citizens, and all civill war among ourselves, at so critical a period, should be strenuously avoided. That a sovereignty & Independance de facto, was a sufficient reason under these Circumstances for Congress to admit into the Union, without examining into the Right de Jure, agreeable to the strong reasoning of his most Christian Majesty, in his Answer to the Justificative Memorial of the King of Great Brittain, sent herewith. If your delegates have acted contrary to the Opinion of their Constituents, they wish to be set right, while it is in their Power to prevent any evill Consequences arising from it. We have reason to believe, that the Matter will certainly be brought on, on Wednesday next. I have two Reasons for pressing the Sentiments of the Legislature on this Subject. 1st. It has been asserted, that we have been acting contrary to the Opinion of our State. 2dly. I claim 1000 acres of Land in this Territory under the Titles of New Hampshire & New York both, and altho I consider them as of but very trifling Value, yet it may hereafter be objected, that I was influenced by considerations, which I hope ever to despise. Your Excellency by laying this Letter before the Legislature, and communicating their Sentiments will much oblige me.1 I have also another Matter relative to the Interest of the State, to lay before the Legislature, that I think worthy their Notice. The united States are looking forward to the calling in the Quota's of the States,   of the Continental money. An Alarm has gone forth, that the State of Massachusets has in their Treasury so large a Portion of this Paper, that some of the defeciency States will be obliged to purchase of her at a high rate. I have lately discovered that Connecticut has sent an Express Messenger to Virginia & purchased a Sum equal to her deficiency, at a very low Rate indeed. If our State has not made up her Quota, it would certainly be a prudent Step to appoint some Person to purchase the Sum wanting with out delay. It can be now had in Virginia, at 5 or 600 for one. It is my Duty to make this Communication, the Legislature will make such use of it, as they may think convenient. I have the Honor to be with great respect & Esteem, Your Excellency's Most Obedt. Hble Servt, Elias Boudinot [P.S.] This Letter was to go by Mr. Condit, but he left Town without acquainting me with it.2 ""

  Sir, (Private) Philada. Octr. 23d. 1782. I have received yours of the 5th Instt. you ask my Sentiments respecting a Settlement with the officers for rations &c. I have received a Letter from Lieut. Blanchard in which he informs me that he does not doubt but the wishes of the Officers in that matter will be Complied with, and Requesting me to Transmit him some Resolutions of Congress which I Shall do if there are Such. My Letters to the Honble. the President, which I had reference to in my Letter to you of the 17th Ulto. were of July 17th and Augst. 5th, which by his Letters I am Informed he received, and as Lt. Blanchard writes me that the State have Concluded to finish those Settlements, it is unnecessary for me to Say any thing further on that Subject, Indeed I then wrote my Sentiments fully. As to Rations I don't know of any Resolutions by which the matter is Submitted to the Several States for Settlement. It is my Opinion that the State ought not to make any Settlement, or pay any Monies to be Charged the United States, without seeing Resolutions of Congress authorizing them so to do, unless in Cases of Necessity. It is an Opinion which Many Persons have, that the accounts between the Several States never will be adjusted. I have lately heard some Members of Congress give their Sentiments fully to that purpose, and it is my Opinion that the Conduct of some of the States are much Influenced by those Ideas. That it will be much for the Interest of some States, not to have a Settlement made is Obvious; and with such Ideas, should a Settlement at some very distant period, take place, will it not be very difficult to obtain allowance for Charges which are not Authorized by Congress? I am an advocate for the Accounts being Settled between the Several States, (not on the principle that very great advantage would Accrue to the State of NH. in particular from Such Settlement, as I know the Opinion of some is, but because) Common Justice Demands it and I think the public safety will require it, but if such settlement was to take place to-morrow why Should NH take on herself more of the Debt than is required by Resolutions of Congress. I wish both the Soldiers & Citizens belonging to N.H. and to whom the United States are Indebted, to be provided for, but (when the Necessity of the Case does not require the Contrary) Resolutions authorizing payment should be first had. Notwithstanding the Complaints which have been made by some of the N.H. Officers, It is my Opinion that no State in the Union has made Settlements, with their Troops on more Liberal principles than N.H. has, and that  OCTOBER 23, 1782  Portrait of  John Taylor Gilman  their is but few, if any, of the States whose public Securities are of more Value than those of N.H. were when I left there, and I presume the Liquidateing Act has been pursued, which I think is so well Calculated as to Increase their Value.(1) Perhaps it may be worth while to look into the Resolutions of Congress of Feby 29th, April 10th, Augst. 8th & 12th 1780 respecting Depreciation &c. The Subject of Continental Currency has been taken up, but no Conclusion made. Is it not very Extraordinary that States who have it not, say to those who have more than their proportion; you grasped after it, you had no right to Collect more than was required of you by the Resolutions of Congress. In that Case their would have been Enough left for us to Collect, it had a Currency with us at the rate of 1,000 for One, you have Collected it, you must make the most of it, take little or nothing for it &c. &c. &c.(2) I will Just ask your Attention to some sentences in the Financiers Letter of July 29th.(3) It is (as Congress have it) in the 3d Page of the 4th Sheet, and on the Subject of Borrowing Money from the Dutch, I think the Sentiments there may Serve to Corroborate some of my Ideas in this Letter. I do Assure you Sir that the Subject of this Letter gives me pain. I Should have been much better pleased to have made the Representation Verbally, but as I am favoured with an Oppty. to Send it by a private Conveyance to Boston hope it will go Safe--on the one hand these are Subjects which persons in my Situation should Handle with Caution, and on the other I think it my Duty while in public service to give such Information as may prevent the State from being too much Injured. I have marked this as private, [...] to be as much so as is Consistent with the good of the [State] at any rate it will be Safe with you, and wo[uld have] you make Such Use of it as you think proper. I have not a Single Article of News to give you, I would answer your Letter more fully, but the Gentleman by whom this goes to Boston is Just going.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia 23 Octob 1782. Agreeably to your request I have enclosed your Letter to Genl. Sullivan--He not being in Congress. The enclosed resolve was passed with great unanimity after your Memorial was read & enforced as far as I thought necessary.(1) Congress seemed pleased with an opportunity of giving you an additional Testimony of the very high Sense they entertain of your Singular merit. I have shewed the resolve at the Auditors office he being out of Town. I was told that all obstruction being now removed, your accounts would be settled as Lieut.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 23d Octr. 1782. I received by Mr. Tracey the Letter you were so good as to write me, and am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken about the publication. The matter seems to have subsided, & therefore it will be unnecessary to trouble either you, or myself any more about it. I am not however, insensible of the unjustifiable liberty taken by the Gentleman you mention.1 He seems, by his indiscretion, to have brought himself into trouble: & certainly the best thing he can do, both for his own sake, & that of his friends, will be to withdraw himself, as soon as possible, from the attention of the Public. The last European Letters we have are from Amsterdam of 23d August.(2) Mr. Grenville had returned to London, and Mr. Fitzherbert, the British Minister at Brussels, had taken his place as Plenipotentiary at Paris. This I believe is intended to feel the pulse of the Cabinet of Versailles: I do not think  OCTOBER 23, 1782  that the King of England is yet seriously disposed to make Peace on those terms, which alone can be accepted by this Country. The combined Fleet are said to be gone to Cadiz. Lord Howe will probably attempt the relief of Gibraltar. His numbers are inferior to those of the Allies. But the latter consist chiefly of Spaniards, & therefore I feel a want of confidence in them. Besides they are commanded by Don Louis Cordova, a Spanish Admiral, who is not in general esteemed quite as good an Officer as his Opponent. We flatter ourselves that in the course of a fortnight we shall receive accounts of the evacuation of Charles Town, as we have had repeated intelligence from New York that a considerable number of Transports are gone thither for the purpose of bringing off the Garrison. It is high time that our unhappy Country should be relieved from her distresses. Your State at present is very respectably represented. But I am very sorry to find that Mr. Jackson purposes to set out soon for Boston; & the more so, as I can not learn that there are any hopes of our seeing you here this Winter. It certainly is of considerable importance that your State should be kept properly, & constantly represented; & I wish it were convenient for Mr. Jackson to stay until the arrival of his Successor. Pray present my best regards & Compt. to Mr. Adams; & I beg that you will be assured that I am with very great regard Dr. Sr. Your most obt., humble Servant, Ra. Izard. ""

  Si r, Philadelphia Oct. 23, 1782. The Copy of a Report of a Committee which I had the Honour of transmitting to your Excellency by the last Post, has since that Time been often taken up--Substitutes proposed, amendments made etc. but yesterday the same was agreed to as amended agreable to the inclosed Copy.(1) The Resolution in the said Report recommending Peace and Hoarmony in that District, being a Milk and Water Peace of Business, is committed to a New Committee. A Question will now be put on the Report of the 17th of April last: The Necessity of gitting clear of that Report is urged, and that a Determination on the same will deside the great Question respecting the Jurisdiction of the Grants. I fear it will only create delay, and altho there is no probability of more than four States to the Report of the 17th, it is to be feared that the Votes of seven States cannot be obtained at present to declare in so many Words, that Vermont shall not be received in to the Federal Union, or be suffered to become an Independent State. I have  OCTOBER 23, 1782  thought the present Time very favorable for a Determination against their pretended Claims, but some Circumstances which would be imprudent to mention in a Letter by a Post Conveyance, makes me doubt of the success. I hope I may be mistaken. next week I think will determine what we may expect from Congress on this Subject.(2)... P. S. Your Excellencys officiall Letter with the Inclosures since writing the above, have been received by us in Congress.(3) The Papers are just now read and committed to the Committee I mentioned before.

  Philadelphia Octor. 23d. 1782 I had the Pleasure of recg. your Favor of the 10th Inst. by the Post. I am very happy to learn that you have recd a long Letter by the Post.(1) I was a little concerned least it should miscarry. My other Letter by Colo. Ward I did not expect would be made public(2)--however I perfectly confide in your Discretion. It would mortify me very much indeed if the Army should ever be impress'd with an Idea that I am not their sincere Friend. If I know my own Heart--I am their zealous Friend upon Principle. I find by your Observation wherein you say you differ from me very much in Opinion as to our not having fully complied with all the Requisitions of Congress for old continental Money--that I either did not convey my own Ideas on the Subject or that you did not fully take them. The Opinion I meant to convey, was, that Masstts. had not fully complyed with all those Requisitions.(3) I still adhere to this Opinion--at the same Time I am in your Sentiments that in a comparitive View with the other States we have paid much more than our Proportion upon those Requisitions tho' we have not fully complyed with them. My Inference, to be of Service to the State, from this, is that the Ballance due from our State upon those Requisitions should now be discharged in old Money. I have supposed that there might be a Ballance due of four or five Millions of Dollars--if this is the Case are not those Requisitions against you--can you not provide to discharge the Ballance? What will be the Inconvenience? Masstts. has paid already more than her Proportion. But we hope for a liquidation & Adjustment of Accounts & that those States which have paid less will be charged with their Deficiencies. But it is not probable that this will be effected very speedily. You have a great Plenty of old Money & you know not what to do with it. I have suggested the Idea. If you pay the Ballance--you pay more than your Proportion, if you dont pay it--you have the Money & what will you do with it. If you wait for Congress to move in this Matter you must prepare to exercise a Great Deal of Patience as you have already done. We have nothing of Importance to communicate to you. The New York Delegates attack Congress very warmly for a Decision upon Ver- OCTOBER 23, 1782  mont. We have assigned Wednesday next to take up a Report thereon. When I expect a very warm Debate--several new Faces alter the House against Vermont--But I think we shall not do any Thing about it yet. We cannot obtain a Vote for their Independence. And I am sure no Vote will be obtained to subject them to New York. My Brother Jackson says he will not come into Congress after this Week. Must I be left alone? I have a great Inclination to transgress also. However Patience is a Virtue & mine is not yet so far exhausted as some other Matters are--primum Omnium Querenda est Pecunia!4 I could preach much upon this Text but I am afraid I should not have even one dearly beloved Roger to hear me. Be pleased to accept of my warmest Wishes for the Continuance of your Health. With great Esteem I am, Dear Sir, Your most humble Servant, Samuel Osgood  [P.S.] Mr. Wharton, I ought to have put the President first--each of them desire me to communicate to you their particular Regards. Genl. Cornell has been long in Camp--before he left Congress to countermine the Works of his Colleague he obtained a Certificate from the Delegates of Maryland that he was against half Pay--unfortunately, after he arrived in Camp, he dropt it out of his Pocket. The Army catch'd fire at it. But I have since heard that he is in a fair Way to quench its Fury. His Office is Intendant of Contracts. I recd. a Letter from Mr. Sullivan this Week & have sent an Answer by this Post.(5) I would have enclosed it to you if I could have well done it--he requested Information respecting Mr. F. & the Motives Congress had &ca.

  Sir,(1) Philadelphia Octr. 23d. 1782 I do myself the Honor of desiring the Favor of you to lay this Letter  OCTOBER 23, 1782  before the honorable Council (2) of the Delaware State. It is my Duty and Inclination Sir to make circumstantial Communications to the Representatives of the People, of all foreign Advices received by Congress and their general Transactions, except in such particulars, as the national Council has thought expedient, for the Benefit of the whole Union, to impose Silence upon it's Members; And I trust you will concur in Opinion with Me, as some important & confidential Matters are freely detailed in this Dispatch, That They should be considered in that Light by my honorable Constituents. I beg pardon for the Freedom of this Intimation, and persuade myself, That they will be so indulgent to Me, as to ascribe it to the Delicasy of my Situation. I heartily congratulate the House Upon the Recognition of our Independence by the seven United Provinces of Netherlands. This Event has already produced the happiest Effects upon the Councils of Britain, and upon Mr Adams's Operations among the monied Men. He has opened a Loan, and will soon have it filled, for five Millions of Guilders, or something more, than Ten Millions of Livres Tournois, each of which is ten pence, half Penny Sterling. The Dutch Contractors for this Loan write the Secretary for foreign Affairs on the eleventh of July \""That at the present Moment We have already received More than a Million of Guilders.\"" None of the five Millions of this Money would be subject to the Orders of Congress Until a Ratification of the Agreement, which Mr. Adams had made with the Contractors, was finaly compleated by that Body. This is done, and sent to the Minister Plenipotentiary at the Hague On the Eleventh of this Month. The Loan is for fifteen Years, commencing the first of June 1782 and ending the first of June 1797, and the other Terms of it, are as follow. Five per Centum Interest, Two per Cent Premium, Two per Cent Premium to the Contractors, and half per Centum for Brokerage, and other Charges. \""This four and a half per Centum,\"" Mr. Adams writes Under Date of the 5th of July, \""is to include all Expences of the Loan of every Sort,\"" and adds, \""That these are as moderate Terms as any Loan is done for. France gives at least as much, and the other Powers much more.\"" The Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United provinces has received the Approbation of the Admiralty of Holland, and by the last Advices, it was apprehended, That the Treaty would be signed in the Month of September, or perhaps sooner. The Dutch Nation, Congress are assured, by their Minister at the Hague, would prove Themselves useful, substantial and affectionate Friends. Much has been published in the British and New York Papers and afterwards reprinted in those of the United States, upon the Subject of Peace. Congress have been particularly cautious not to give Credence to these Accounts, But patiently waited to receive Advices themselves from their Servants in Europe. A Correspondent writes, That The Spaniards are going to besiege   Gibralter. Count D' Artois, the King of France's Brother, and the Duke de Bourbon, a Prince of the Blood, are just setting out to serve as Volunteers. They intend to begin the first of September, so that We may expect One Way or other to get rid of that Incumbrance, and let the Siege succeed or miscarry, We may expect hereafter to make Use of the combined Fleet of the House of Bourbon. From what I have collected from Communications, and by private Intelligence, I conclude 1st. That the British Ministers are at Variance between themselves, embarrassed upon the Conduct They ought to hold, and not very firm in their Principles, and Places. 2d. That Negociations will go on slowly; will serve to establish Principles, and facilitate a Treaty, But that the King of England and some of the Ministers have not lost the Idea of Breaking the Union between France and the United States. 3d. That the Situation of England; Want of Men and Money; The Efforts France intends to make, will reduce the former to a Necessity of making Peace before the End of next Spring. Another Correspondent (3) remarks that the Instructions of the British Ministry with respect to the United States are by no Means clear. They are divided upon the Subject. It is said, That Mr. Fox and his Freinds incline to meet on the Terms of Independence, But that Lord Shelburne and his Adherents entertain an Idea of making a Compact with Us, similar to that between Great Britain & Ireland, and there is Reason to apprehend Efforts will be made to open a Negotiation on these Subjects at Philadelphia. A third Correspondent observes,(4) That two Persons have been sent here by the new Ministry to propose treating for Peace. They had at first some Hopes of getting the belligerant Powers to treat separately one after another; But finding that impracticable, They have after several Messengers sent to and fro, come to a Resolution of treating all together for a general Peace, and have agreed, That the place shall be Paris. Mr. Grenville is now here with full Powers for the purpose, if They can be reckoned full with Regard to America till a certain Act can be compleated for enabling his Majesty to treat &c, which has gone through the Commons, And has been read Once in the House of Lords.(5) I shall at Present need to say no More upon this Subject in this Letter, except that tho' I still think They (The British) were at first sincere in the Desire of Peace, yet since their Success in the West Indies I imagine, That I see Marks of their desiring rather to draw the Negotiations into Length, That they may take the Chance of what the rest of the Campaign shall produce in their Favor, And as there are so many Interests to adjust, It will be prudent to suppose, That even another Campaign may pass before all can be agreed. Something may happen to break off the Negotiations, and We should be prepared for the worst. It looks as if the British repented of the Advance They had   made in their Declarations here, respecting the Acknowledgment of our Independence, and We have pretty good Information, That some of the Ministry still flatter the King with the hope of recovering his Sovereignty over the United States, on the same Terms, as are now making with Ireland. The above Acknowledgments, I learn from indisputable Authority was made by Mr. Grenville in these Words. That the King of England being disposed to acknowledge, and declare directly the Independance of America, It would be no longer a conditional Article of the Treaty. Satisfaction was expressed, That the King of Great Britain was in a Disposition to treat with all the belligerant Powers, and that He intended to make a direct acknowledgement of the Independance of the United States of America, and that this power would no longer be a conditional Article of a general Pacification. The preceeding Advices extend to the first of July. None have been received, since Lord Shelburne has been appointed Prime Minister of England except the suceeding Article. Yesterday a Letter was delivered Congress from their Minister plenipotentiary at the Hague, dated the 18th of August,(6) informing, That Mr. Fitzherbert, lately a British Minister at Brussels, was appointed, July the 24th, in the Room of Mr. Grenville, Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailes, To treat of Peace with the King of France and all the belligerant Powers, and states. Doctor Franklin has advised Congress, That the Ambassador from Sweden at the Court of Versailes had applied to Him to know, if He had Powers, that would authorise Him to make a Treaty with his Master, in behalf of the United States. The Doctor recollecting a general Power, that was formerly given to Him, and the other Commissioners, answered in the Affirmative. The Ambassador seemed much pleased, and said, The King had directed Him to ask the Question, and had charged Him to tell the Doctor, That He had so great an Esteem for Him, That it would be a particular satisfaction to his Majesty to have such a Transaction with Him. The Ambassador added, That He hoped it would be rememberd Sweden was the first Power in Europe, which had voluntarily offered it's Friendship to the United States without being solicited. Proper and full Powers were dispatched to the Doctor relative to this Business, The eleventh of this Month. As our Minister at the Court of Versailes earnestly recommends that the above Communication may for obvious Reasons be kept secret. I flatter myself, That the honorable House will admit, & adopt the propriety of the Recommendation. Congress have lately received additional, and the most undoubted Testimonys of the Friendship and firm Attachment of our illustrious Ally to the United States, not only in his decissive answer to the Court of Great Britain respecting a seperate Peace, but in his Majesty's benevolent Consideration of our Situation with Respect to pecuniary Affairs. He has very Kindly dispensed with our Obligation to pay Interest on the national Debt due to this Prince, up   to the Date of the last Dispatch to his Minister here (The 25th of June)--But has also exonerated Us from all Expences (above five hundred Thousand Livres) accruing upon negociating the Loan of Ten Millions of Livres in Holland last year, and for the payment of which, He became Guaranty for the United States. Besides these most friendly Exemptions, his Majesty has directed the Sum of Six Millions of Livres to be at the Disposition and Service of Congress. Under cover you have Sir the printed Journals, continued from the Date of the last, which I had the Honor of transmitting to the former Council, down to the twentieth of August, and the Resolutions of Congress marked No. 1, with Regard to the Supplies for next Year, and No. 2, The Demand from the States, of One Million and Two hundred Thousand Dollars for the payment of Interest to some of the publick Creditors, as is more particularly explained in the Resolve last mentioned. Six Millions of Dollars is in the Opinion of the several Departments of Congress too small a sum for the various Expences of next year, But Congress has only made a Requisition of two Millions of Dollars from all the States. This They have done from a Hope, That They shall be able to borrow the rest in Europe. For this purpose They have resolved, That a Sum not exceeding four Millions of Dollars, exclusive of the Money, which Mr. John Adams may obtain by the Loan now negotiating in Holland be borrowed in Europe on the Faith of the United States of America, and applied towards defraying the Expences which shall be incurred, and of those which during the present War, have been incurred, for carrying on the War. And that the Superintendant of Finance and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs take Order for carrying the above Resolution into Effect, transmitting the same without Delay to the Ministers plenipotentiary of the United States at the Court of Versailes, and at the Hague. Maryland and the smaller States have several Times attempted to bring the Object of the Western Lands to a Decission, But They have failed hitherto for Want of New Hampshire being present, and Connecticut not chusing to become a Party in the Dispute, pending the Adjustment of Preliminarys for establ[ish]ing a Court (agreable to the articles of Confederation) finaly to settle the Claim, it makes upon Pennsylvania. This is now done, and We have Reason to be assured, That the Delegates of Connecticut will unite with Us and the Rest of the smaller States in voting to take up the Report of the Committee upon the Western Lands, and accepting the Cession of New York. If the Honorable House will be pleased to recur to my Letter of the Tenth of June, They will see what Effect the acceptance of the Cession of New York will have upon the unwarrantable Claim of Virginia. It is proposed to move in this important Matter in the Course of next Week, and be assured Sir, I will not fail to keep the House informed of the progress of our proceedings. I have now only to add, That I   pray you will be so kind as to present my respectful Duty to the honorable Council, and to believe that I am with great Regard, Sir, your most Obedient, and most humble Servant, Saml. Wharton  [P.S.] The papers mentioned in page 9, I was not able to procure two setts of; But I have sent the Resolves to the Honorable House of Assembly, certified by the Deputy of Congress.(7) ""

I hope you have before this Time received a Letter from me by Dr Brownson (1) though Experience tells us that Letters by private Conveyances are very precarious. I am not certain to what you refer when you say you have read my Plan for Education (2) having published several different Occasional Essays on that Subject but your Approbation of it is very agreeable. Having had Reason to bless God for a very excellent & well conducted Education my self I have from my youth up given particular Attention to the Theory of Instruction & Government in general & particularly family Government. I have observed in passing through Life that it is not easy for any Person to attain to higher or nobler Principles or a finer Turn of mind and Manners than is to be formed in the family or among the Persons with whom he is cheifly conversant. The Instruction of Masters is occasional & temporary--Daily Intercourse is perpetual and uniform & therefore its Influence  OCTOBER 23, 1782  although insensible is great and lasting. I have also said often that as it is credible to think what the Earth would produce if it were always put in Condition to profit, (so to speak) by every Hour of Vegetation even in the Coldest Climates so it is incredible what early Advances a Child would make if no Opportunity of enlarging the Mind were lost. I not only agree with you that your Son is of an excellent Capacity but I think he has more Things about him that render him fit for profiting upon my System than almost any Boy I ever saw. He is exceedingly lively & active, full of Ambition, remarkably affectionate & familiar, inquisitive & talkative so that those who un[der]take the Pains to answer his Questions and gratify his Curiosity may easily communicate all the Information which his years render him fit for receiving. He is also of a very gentle & tractable Nature so as to be very easy to all that are about him. Finding by your Letter that what I mentioned to Mr Pettit at first is perfectly agreeable to you, I will do my best to answer your Views & laying the Foundation in Piety & Morality shall take all possible Pains to give him every other Accomplishment as he advances in years. At present my Brother in law teaches him and my grandson a little younger than he to read english & I believe all the Family will carefully observe such Directions on the Subject as I shall give them from Time to Time. Mrs Green & you may be assured that he is at present perfectly well & very happy in his Situation. I left home on Monday last & expect to return the End of next Week for altogether. Your leaving it to me to settle the Terms is very generous and I shall after conversing with Mr Pettit write you on that subject particularly in the next Letter. Your Remarks on the State of public Affairs are very just & you could not please me more than by Caution in not writing freely on such Subjects. We have had great Reason to see the Folly of some of our Friends in that Way. The Fate of Letters is very uncertain. Things seem to be at a Stand in Europe till the New english Ministry fix their Plan. The Negotiation however is not broken off. What you see in the News Papers of Allen Fitzherbert Esqr being the english Plenipotentiary I believe is true as also that the Dutch are likely to enter into a commercial Treaty with the united States.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia October 25th. 1782 In our Letter to your Excellence of the 22d Instant we transciently mentioned the Continental Money. On a review of what we then wrote, the subject appears to deserve further explanation. The State of Massachusetts has not only collected by Taxes her full Quota of Continental Money, but she has a considerable balance in hand which she also requires that she may be allowed to pay into the Public Treasury at 40 for one. As every State has been called upon to sink its quota of that paper which was expressly fixed at 40 for one, it seems that Massachusetts has an indubitable right to Discount her quota. She contends that if she did her duty when other States neglected theirs, it does not follow that she ought to suffer by her punctuality. We cannot on principles of honor & good faith dispute her claim, but we contend that Massachusetts shall not be allowed to pay in more than her quota for two very plain reasons the first is that the money is  OCTOBER 25, 1782  not worth the price that it will be valued at. The other is, that if Massachusetts is permitted to pay in more than its quota other States must be speculated upon or what is worse they must make good their quota by one silver Dollar instead of 40 such paper Dollars.(1) Virginia having called in large sums of Paper has also apply'd to Congress that an Inspector be appointed in the State who shall examine the money, destroy Counterfeits & cut or deface the Remainder to save the expence of sending the whole to Philadelphia to be examined. Other States have asked for the same indulgence. It appears that large sums are in the Treasuries of the different States. The Brokers are daily buying up Continental Money in the Town. One hard Dollar is current at 300 Continental Dollars. It may be purchased for 250. Recollecting the fate of our Law for collecting Continental Money and the suspension & subsequent repeal of that Law has left the accounts of every Collector & Treasurer open, we are under strong apprehensions that the State will be speculated upon and injured through that channel. It is certain that 900 State Dollars may be purchased for one hard Dollar. There is nothing to prevent any person from passing those State Dollars to any of our Treasures in Exchange for Continental Dollars. The profit is at least 200 per Cent. This cannot long escape the notice of those Persons, who we observe in all Countries are too numerous, who are willing to make money at the risque of honor & expence of their Country. Might it not be proper for your Excellency forthwith to require the different Treasurers to deliver in upon Oath an Acct. of the Continental Money on hands. Or rather an acct. if such may be required, of the Continental Money they have received. It is very probable or rather certain that the Continental Paper money will, on some future Day, become the subject of much altercation. The news Papers will inform you of the great Stir that is lately made in the general behalf of Paper Creditors. It began in this City with Loan Office Certificate Holders; the disease proved infectious, it extended to all Kinds of paper. A considerable flame has been Kindled but the paper is not consumed. We are particularly informed that the State of New Hamshire has in her Treasury five Millions of paper Contl. Dollars, above her quota. We cannot learn what surplus is in the Treasury of Massachusetts. In mentioning the facts that have presented themselves & the speculations that may possibly be practised upon the State, we have attempted to discharge our duty. We shall steadily endeavor to prevent any resolutions by which our State may suffer. In the mean while your Excellence will be Pleased to take any cautionary steps that you may apprehend the subject deserves.(2) We have the honor to be &ca. Hu Williamson Wm Blount  ""

  Dear Sr. Philadelphia Oct. 28. 1782. By the last Post we were favoured with your Letter of the 19th Instant, and by Colo Gansevolt I was honoured with one of the 20th. I am not a little surprised at the Conversation you relate, when after what passed at Poughkepsie, I made no Doubt but you stood very fair for the office so far as respected them. I have no doubt but the Determination was had here before I came, and I have reason to believe, tho I am not certain, that the Office has been given to Doctor Tillitson some Weeks ago: you will not mention this as you will soon hear of it if my Conjectures be right. I mention it as it will be improper for me further to apply on the subject, considering the Letter wrote by Colo. Floyd & myself (1) & what I mentioned in my former Letter;(2) notwithstanding I am fully in Sentiment with you, that your present office can be no disqualification for this, and that your Eyes might be continental in one Case as well as the other. In respect to an Application for your Demand as Loan officer, I shall readily do it if Mr Duane joins therein,(3) who I beleive has much more Interest with him, than some other Persons. I do not know that he will have any Objections to it: if he should, you will excuse me from applying seperately, as I think it will be of no service, of which I can satisfy you another Time. I should think it advisable for you to write to Mr Morris on the Subject, who I doubt not will give you an Answer, and I cannot think will delay giving you every Satisfaction, in that respect, in his Power. I expect to leave this Place in Ten or Twelve Days. Colo Floyd will soon be here whose Friendship for you will induce him to do you every Service in his Power. The States are greatly deficient in paying the Quotas of the last year, so that the Superintendant has been unable to carry on the Contract for supplying the Army thro' the year with the Contractors. A new Contract is made with Wardsworth & Carter which is disadvantageous--Thirteen Pence per Ration is now given, so that we pay as much for three months as we did before for four months, perhaps he could not have done better under the present Circumstances, they giving a Credit for the money.(4) The Prospects of Peace are not so favorable as they were some time ago. Tis Probable the British Parliament will determine whether the Independence of this Country shall be recognized by them in the present Negociations for Peace & consequently whether we shall have another Campaign or not. A Packet is  OCTOBER 28, 1782  arrived at New York and tis said a Frigate was immediately sent of to Charles Town with Orders not to evacuate that Post, Tis thought these orders will come too late. Tis said the British Men of War are fallen down to the Hook in Number 15, having been plentifully supplied with fresh Provisions from New Jersey. The Inclosed Paper gives you all the News of the Day.

  Dear Sir,(1) Philadelphia 29th Octr. 1782 A few days ago I had the pleasure to receive your favour of the 15th Octr. by Mr. Philip Will. I am really Surprized that you have not heard from me Since my arrival in Philadelphia. I wrote to you by Col Peytons Waggon on the 27 June, & I think again on the 6th July per Mr. McWickers Waggon--who brought Miss McWicker, at least if I did not write to you by this last opportunity--I wrote to Mrs. Peyton, & Inclosed some news papers for you.

I am Sorry we have not had better Success with the Indigo. If you think it would Sell more readily by lowering the price, I should be Satisfied to sell it by retail at Six Shillings or a Dollar per Pound & by the Quantity at Five Shillings. But if that will not encourage the Sale--I must wait till the Spring--the Sale of that article is now very dull here. It Sold very well last Spring. I have enquired concerning the prices of the articles you mention. London Crown Superfine Cloath is Eight Dollars a Yard.

  Sir, Philada. Octr. 29th. 1782. In a Letter which I wrote you on the 25th Ulto. I mentioned that some representations had been made to the Delegates of New-York from the Govr. of that State respecting the Conduct of Vermont.(1) Those papers have been under the Consideration of a Committee,  OCTOBER 29, 1782  and the last Week Congress Assigned the 30th Instt. further to Consider of, and determine this matter. Several Persons are now here who say they have been Robbed of their property, and that their persons are banished, by the authority of Vermont, in Consequence of their adherence to the Government of New York.(2) Without doubt you have full Information of those Transactions so that I need not be particular. The present Situation of these matters seem to require that a Final Determination should now be made, but their are many Obstacles in the way. Various Resolutions on this Subject have been passed at different Periods, and at present their seems to be much division of Sentiment respecting the matter. What will be Concluded on, or when a Final Determination will take place I cannot say, but should be glad that the Honble the Legislature would give such Instructions respecting the matter, as to them Shall seem meet. I Suppose the Tax of Two Million Dollars is forwarded you by the Superintendant of Finance.(3) You will see that the Quota Assigned to New Hampshire is in the same proportion as that of the late Tax of 1,200,000 Dollars, for payment of Interest; This proportion is not so high as that of the last Year to the Eight Million Dollars, but it is my fixed Opinion, that it is much more than it ought to be. Have no late Authentic accounts from Europe. A Packett from Falmouth has lately Arrived at New-York, do not know what Instructions the Commander there may have received but from the Newspaper Accounts It would seem that they are Determined to prosecute the War; whatever their Ideas may be, it is Incumbent on us to be prepared for the Worst. Have no late accounts from Charlestown; whether New-York will be Evacuated this Fall is altogether uncertain, believe they are tolerably well prepared to Stay, or to Embark on Short Notice. The Ministry of Great Britain are Changed so frequently, and their Sentiments so Various respecting American affairs that it is Impossible to Determine what will take place next; the present session of their Parliament, as it respects American Affairs, is Considered as a very Important One. Late accounts from New-York (though not Authentic) Say, that Immediately on the Arrival of the Falmouth Packett, a Frigate was dispatched to Charlestown and that, that place is not to be Evacuated at present. I have for some time past been Daily Expecting the Arrival of Judge White, but am hitherto Disappointed. I Inclose you a News Paper of this day and have the Honor to be, Your most Obedt. Servt.

  Dear Sir Philada. Octr. 29th. 1782 A continuance of Mr. Jones's indisposition has procured me the office of answering yours of the 21st. instant.(1) His relapse has been more severe than I was aware, and will keep him a prisoner in his room for some time to come. His disorder is at present rather troublesome than alarming. Mrs. Jones luckily has got pretty well over her indisposition. You will find from the paper inclosed that a packet has lately arrived at N. York.(2) Rivington labours to dissipate the gloom which the prospect of peace had spread over the Loyalists, but his publications on this head carry no marks of authenticity. It appears indeed that the Shelburne party is struggling hard against the Independence of the U. States: But without a naval victory or a Russian Alliance, neither of which are within the compass of probabilities, the ambition of pursuing the war will not I hope be able to withstand the parliamentary eloquence and national distresses which will be opposed to it. It is reported that immediately on the arrival of the Packet counter-orders were dispatched to Stop the evacuation of Charlestown. The naval victory related in the letter from the Hague of the 17th. of Aug. is probably a fabrication of the Stock Jobbers, several letters of subsequent dates having been recd. from Holland which report nothing of the kind.(3) Some Intelligence has lately come to hand from the Frontiers of N. York which speaks a language less pacific with respect to that quarter than the late letter from Sr. G. Carlton. Which of them speaks most the language of truth must be left to the event. The British fleet at N. York has been very industrious in preparing for sea, and will probably soon leave that place. Its destination can only be conjectured. The West Indies are the object which first presents itself. ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Ocr 29th. 1782. Our Stock of European news has recd. no other addition since my  OCTOBER 29, 1782  last than what has transpired from the packet lately arrived at N. York and is published in the inclosed Gazette. Some intelligence has been recd. from the Frontiers of N. Y. which revive the apprehension of further inroads from Canada and of a cooperation on the part of the Vermonteers. The tenor of Carlton's letter to Genl Washington on this subject and other circumstances render this article at least extremely doubtful. The British fleet at N. Y. has been busy in preparing for sea and will probably soon depart from that Station. The W. Indies most naturally occur as the object of its destination. It is said their preparations have been much expedited by the most direct & undisguised {supplies from the people of New Jersey}.(1) Congress have been occupied for several days past with the case of {Lippencut referred to them} by {General Washington}.(2) On one side it was urged that the disavowal and promises by the {British commander} the {abolition of the} obnoxious {board of refugees} and the general {change of circumstances} rendered {retaliation un}necessary {and in}expedient. On the other side it was contended that a {departure from the resolution} so {solemnly} adopted and {repeated} by {General Washington and} with equal {solemnity ratified by Congress} would be an {indelible blot on our} character, that after the confessions on {the part of the enemy of the deed} complained {of a} greater {inflexibility on our part} would be {looked for}, that after such confessions too {the enemy} would never suffer the {innocent to perish} if {we persisted in demanding the guilty} and finally that if they should suffer it, {the blood} would {be on their heads not on ours}. No definitive {resolution has yet passed on the subject}. All the {intermediate steps} have been very properly entered {on the secret journal}. General Lincoln has just returned from the army. He has not yet made report to Congress.(3) He says I understand that his visit has had a very {salutary operation but} that some {pay must be found for the army}. Where it is to be {found God knows}. The State of the public {finances} has already {compelled the superintendant to} give a discharge to the former contractors, and to accept of a new contract by which {thirty} Per Ct. is added to the price of a ration in consideration of credit for {three months}. He has on this occasion written a pressing exhortation to the States, which I suppose is accessible to you. Mr. {Carrol} moved yesterday a {resolution for accepting the} territorial cession {of New York}. It stands the order for to day.(4) I regret much on this occasion the {absence of Mr Jones}. Mr. Jones's relapse was more severe than my last supposed. He has been since confined to his room & chiefly to his bed, and will remain a prisoner for some time. His disorder however is in a favorable train, and at present rather troublesome than dangerous. Col. Bland returned a few days ago from his excursion to Bethlehem, which has   been very beneficial to his health.(5) Docr. Lee I suppose is with you. The approach of Novr. revives my attention to your return. I communicated to Mrs. T.(6) the paragraph in your favr. of the 18th inst. announcing the birth of your little daughter, and in return am charged to announce her affectionate congratulations.

  My dearest Susan.(1) Philadelphia Octr. 30th. 1782 Your Letter of the 19th Instt. lies unanswered, altho' I am still a Letter ahead of you, but as it is said, in an invaluable Book of Antiquity, that the Elder shall serve the Younger, perhaps you may think it right, that I should go on, bringing you in debt. I propose this Letter as a serious one--I have for some time past been led by Circumstances, to reflect more seriously on the prospect of you launching into life, and leaving your Fathers Roof, as well as his immediate Protection & Guardianship. I have reflected how far, I have done my Duty in executing the Trust committed to me, by the great Governor of the Universe in your Education--in a proper Provision for you in Life, in preparing you for usefulness in whatever Station it may please God to call you--and laying a rational foundation, by the aid of Divine Grace, for your enjoyment of a glorious & happy Immortality in the life to Come. Through the unmerited Blessing of a kind Providence, I cannot blame myself greatly, for any deficiency in your Education and Provision for Life--Nature wants but little and not that little long. I have confidence in you, that if you make good use of and continue improving those Abilities & that knowledge you now possess, your usefulness in this Life under God, may be of some Importance to your Fellow Creatures. But my dear Child, all these are but secondary Objects. How stands it as to your preparation for and hope in the prospects of a joyfull Immortality--I can assure you in all the Sincerity of Truth, that you have been from your first Conception, dedicated to God, as his peculiar Property. At your Birth (which was a Miracle of Mercy, and deserves your whole Soul, as a living Monument thereof) you was repeatedly, by the most solemn Acts of religious Worship in the fear of God, given up to him. Your Baptism in the Face of the Church of Christ, was an Express Covenant with God in Christ on your Behalf, by which you Altogether became the Lord's--Your Parents became bound on your Part, and I devoutly trust that the Contract stands rati- OCTOBER 30, 1782  fied in Heaven. You have been instructed from your Childhood in the knowledge of your Lost State by Nature--the absolute necessity of a Change of Heart, and an entire renovation of Soul, to the Image of Jesus Christ--of Salvation, thro' his meritorious Righteousness only--and the indispensable necessity of personal Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. You are well acquainted that the most perfect & consummate Doctrinal Knowledge, is of no avail, without it operates on & sincerely affects the Heart--Changes the Practice--and totally influences the Will--and that without the almighty Power of the Spirit of God, enlightening your Mind, subduing your Will, and continually drawing you to himself--you can do nothing. Altho' at the same Time, your own Constant unwearied Endeavours after Holiness and perpetual Applications to a merciful Saviour for this Aid, are as necessary as if you could accomplish your own Salvation by your own Works. Blessed be God, this has been your happy Lot, but my dearest Susan, all our Tears, Prayers, Dedications, Instructions, Example, & Admonitions will not accomplish the Event so devoutly to be wished. What have You done, in your own Person, since you have come to the Age of discretion? Have you confirmed the all gracious Covenant. Have you justified your Parents, in the multiplied Acts of devoting you to God? They have travailed in Birth a second time with you, till you should be born again to newness of Life. Your baptismal Covenant was the Act of your Parents, in your Name & Behalf, but it is high Time, that this Act of your Parents should be acknowledged & renewed by you, in the solemn dedication of yourself in the Lords Supper. This is an Ordinance designed as a solemn Seal of the same Covenant, as if designed by your Baptism. They are both Seals of the same Covenant, and a worthy Subject, of one is a worthy subject of the other. I have a most earnest desire, that this important Event in your Life, should take place before you launch into the world, and leave your Father's assiduous care, that he may be blessed, with seeing the work completed, as far as human endeavours can go. That you may go forth under the protection of the God of Heaven, as his peculiar inheritance by your own Act, in Compliance with his positive Command \""Do this in remembrance of me.\"" I was led to this train of reflection by a Sermon I lately heard on this Subject--the only one I remember that fully came up to my Sentiments and which I verily believe is founded on the Truth of the Gospell. My Anxiety for your accomplishing (and that without delay) your whole Duty, made me wish most heartily, you could have heard it delivered, because it might have removed all scruples, which too often injure young & tender minds. To shew you my warmest desires for your Spiritual Growth in Grace and that you may go from under my immediate Care, the Subject of the divine special Grace & Government, I have amidst all the Variety   of my important concerns, by taking from the Hours of the Night, endeavoured to commit the Sermon to Writing for your careful perusal & Improvement. Read it with Attention--Consider it well--It is the Truth and the Truth will set you free. Be not deceived or discouraged. You are in Covenant with God by the Act of your Parents--I hope by your own private Acts. Be not afraid to go to him as you[r] Father--your Friend & your God. Remember that it is in the use of his own Appointed Means, that we are to expect the Blessing. And may the God of your Parents (for many Generations past) seal Instruction to your Soul and lead you to himself thro' the Blood of his too greatly despised Son, who notwithstanding, is still reclaiming the World to God thro' that Blood, not imputing to them their Sins. To him be Glory forever. I have wrote this in Congress, amidst a Warm debate, to which I have been obliged to attend, at the same time, therefore, you must make the necessary corrections yourself.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Octob 30 1782. Your very acceptable favour of 15 Inst. came duly to hand per Post, the enclosures as well as contents were agreeable. I am happy to find that abler pens have at length enlisted in so good a cause. The opposition to the Impost, I am convinced, gains ground in Congress as well as in this City. I have taken great pains to explain the principles of Liberty & to shew how the Confederation will secure it to us, & I can assure you that great Charter of our Liberties is lately more frequently quoted & growing into that sacred veneration to which it is entitled. When I first came here, Genl. Cornell called it a rope of Sand & I found he had catched the expression from others. The States are not to be held together by the strength of penal laws & coercion, but by their mutual intrest--And if a wise & just policy is adopted it will continue in future the intrest of the States to remain confederated as much as it now is, or has been. Every measure which tends to greive one member of the Union, tends to a Dissolution; for nature teaches to seek redress: And Self preservation, among Laws, is Lord paramount. I did not mean to give it as my opinion that no more would be done to inforce the Impost; far otherwise, my Letters will shew the pains I have taken to counteract such efforts. But the tax of 1,200,000 was framed & urged by those, who had little, or no remaining hopes from  OCTOBER 30, 1782  an Impost, while the others consented to the measure. This I conceived at least a confessed judgment in all that the impost was a fund of remote consideration & from which no present hopes could be entertained. Since the recommendation, or rather demand of an immediate & definitive answer of our State in regard to the Impost a motion was made in Congress to appoint a Committee to draw up a spirited address to our State on the Subject & it was suggested that the Delegates ought also to write in favour of a measure so necessary, or they would be chargeable with the consequences. The loss in Mr. Morris's Contracts for want of mony was also laid at our Door. This all together raised me to a pitch. \""Mr. President, The measure now proposed is indeed very extraordinary. You have recommended the Impost; Your Financier has written frequently & largely to the State on the Subject; you have sent to the State a Deputation of two respectable members of this house to referee the measure, to which embassy you have not yet recd an answer. But three days ago you passed a resolve requiring an immediate & definitive answer on this head; Unless the present measure is calculated for downright coercion, or to overawe & terrify the little State of Rhode Island to adopt the impost against their intrest & judgment I am at a loss for its object. \""I hope, Sir, that the State I have the honor to represent, tho the least in the Union & the last to decide upon this Question, will do it with the same deliberation & independance of Spirit, uninfluenced by the determination of the others, as the largest State in the Union and the first which adopted the measure had a right to. Every State, Sir, is equally Sovereign & independant. Every State has an equal right to the advantages of the Confederation & to be bound only by their own consent. I hope we shall never sacrifice the essential object of the war as a means of supporting it. This would rather have a contrary tendancy. We have drawn our Swords in defence of a good Constitution & for the priviledge of being governed by laws of our own making. While you continue to the people these objects they will support you to the last penny in their purse & the last drop of their blood. Infringe their rights, invade the Confederation, & you can no longer assure yourself of the peoples support. I hold in my hand, Sir, a reciept of taxes from the little State I have the Honour to represent for the Month of Septr. to the amount of upwards of 4,000 Dollars which I beg leave to read.-- ____This may be thought a small Sum; but examine the treasury, you will find the State has paid more than five times its avarage proportion of the monies recd. Had all the States in the Union paid in proportion Mr. Morris's loss would not have happened. His calculations were made on the tax of 8 millions constitutionally required & not on an imaginary impost. Who then is accountable for that loss? \""Gentlemen would indirectly blame us for not enforcing the Impost by letters to our State. Every necessary information has been laid   before our Constituents & we confide in their wisdom & virtue, we do not wish to biass their minds by any indirect influence. In return I shall only observe that had the Delegates from other States been equally importunate with their Constituents to pay into the treasury their quota of the 8 million & equally successful with us, the loss complained of would not have happened, our treasury would have been better supplied; before therefore Gentlemen can be entitled to throw blame on us for not enforcing an unconstitutional measure it behoves them to convince the world that they have done their duty in enforcing that which is constitutional.\"" (this part was in answer to Mr. M____n from Virginia). I give the above as a rough Schetch of the mode of speaking to questions with us. It is a true relation & nearly in the terms in which it was spoken. After much altercation & debating the proposition more than an hour, the question was called for. I demanded the yeas & nays to bring it on the journals. The Gentlemen being convinced that it would not make a good appearance there withdrew it, and no vote was taken.(1) Our men in the field & our monthly payment of taxes, while they continue a proof of our zeal in the common cause of our Country, are the most availing weapons to ward off the 5 per Cent and every other attack. I hope the State will continue &, if possible, increase its exertions in collecting taxes. Money must be raised. We shall borrow abroad from 5 to 6 million of Dollars, if such a Loan can be obtained. Nothing appears but what our credit is yet good in Holland & France will never desert us. I am fully impressed with the difficulties of the people in paying taxes. I have done all in my power to lessen expences & lower Salaries. You will see that I divided with Genl. Cornell about adding 20 Dollars per month to the pay of Baron Steuben, Inspector general, who then had that of a Major General.(2) I despise all General Cornells certificates of his good behaviour from Members of Congress.(3) He descended below his dignity if he had any in asking such of them & they in giving them. I have sent to the State attested copies from the journals, which I had a right to by the last clause in Art. 9 of the Confederation, to shew my Constituents the part I took on some capital Questions; if they also disclose the votes of my colleague, I am not to answer for him. If I was capable of serving a party, at my return I could obtain certificates as well as others; but I thank God for giving me a Soul to despise such proceedings altogether. You may learn from the journals & from me, what I have done; I am not a School-boy to take Letters of recommendation from my Masters. Such let those take who need them. Genl. Cornell has to account with the State and the public, how he could accept his present office without violating the 5 Art. Confedn. I believe no private certificates can help him out of this hobble.  Mr Manning will inform you of what is agreed to be done in regard to the College affairs before this will reach you. By the blustering of the British towards the close of this Campaign, you are to be led to expect that the war is to be carried on with renewed vigour & that all the World is about to join them. Regard not such puffing. They are tired of the war. They have as yet no assured friend to assist them. If they meant ever so seriously to make peace the ensuing winter they would throw out all these appearances. The reigning party in the British Cabinet are against Am. Independance. The King gaggs at it as tho' it would choak him, but could other matters be adjusted in regard to a general pacification the bitter pill would be swallowed, as the nation discover a manifest reluctance against paying their money any longer to carry on a war with the professed & sole purpose of subjugating this Country. Yours, &c. David Howell Sir. Our Cozen James is in the City & introduced by Captn. Anthony & others into the best Company. I am so busy that I cannot wait on him so much as I would. You may shew this Letter to any friends as you have occasion--particularly to your Brother, Comdr Hopkins, John Jenckes, Gov. Bowen, our Deputies &c &c &c. With best regards to Mrs. Brown & all friends, you will believe me to be, dear Sir, your sincere friend. David Howell. P.S. You will excuse me for writing so incorrectly.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Octr. 30th. 1782 I had the Pleasure of receiving your Favor of the 17th Inst. per Post--& esteem myself under particular Obligations therefor. I had prepared a Draught of a Letter for you,(1) principally respecting Asgill. I have either mislaid, or Lost it. We have had very lengthy Debates upon this important Subject. I wish I could furnish you with a Copy of the Court martial upon Lippincut--But it is very lengthy. I do not apprehend the Intentions of Congress are sanguinary. If they were,  OCTOBER 30, 1782  the Rect. of a Letter Yesterday via New York from the Count de Vergennes would probably remove them. The Mother of the unfortunate Asgill, with the utmost maternal Tenderness, addressd the Count in Behalf of her Son. He as a private Man, writes, with the Approbation of the King, & much more, even that of the Queen. Tho the Letter does not demand the Liberation of Asgill absolutely--I think it is not much short of it. It is now before a Committee--had not this Letter been recd. there were a thousand Chances to one in Favor of Asgill--now, if we liberate him, we in a Measure loose the Honors of a merciful Disposition. I could have wished to have had the Act noble & conspicuous on our Part, as flowing spontaneously from our own Tenderness. Yesterday on a Motion of the Delegates of Maryland the Cession of New York was taken up & after lengthy Debate the Yeas & Nays were taken upon the Question & seven States were in Favor of accepting that Cession, it is entered in the affirmative. But a Question arises, are seven States competent, by the Confederation, to such Acceptation. It is affirmed by some & denied by others. You will find in the Journals for 81 & 82 Page 334 the following Resolution of New York \""That it is the Sense of this Legislature, that Congress have not any Authority by the Articles of Confederation in any Wise, to intermeddle with the former territorial Extent of Jurisdiction or Property of either of these united States except in Cases of Disputes concerning the same between two or more States in the Union, nor to admit into the Union, even any british Colony except Canada without the Consent of nine States, nor any other State whatsoever, nor above all to create a new State by dismembring one of the thirteen united States without their universal Consent.\""(2) Taking for granted that the Vote of Yesterday was carried in the affirmative--what can Congress do with the Territory? Can they upon the Principles of the Confederation erect & take into the Union a new State? Does the Confederation empower Congress to accept of any Thing that looks like a Fund, independent of the united States? Does it authorize & empower Congress to grant a patent or Charter with Powers of Jurisdiction? Can Congress in any Manner whatever become the Fountain of such Power? If not, what will become of the said Territory? I think many Difficulties will inevitably occur in the Management of this congressional Territory. Indeed, at present, I believe no Friend to these States dare show his Head within a hundred miles of the Country. It is possessed by Indians & some Britons. What a well founded Prospect does this Tract of Country afford the United States for discharging all their Debts? Mr. Jackson will see you probably as soon as this will arrive. Two Days he has been detained by Rain--I don't urge that a Colleague may be forwarded because I must conclude there is one already upon the Road. Permit me to add, that with the greatest Truth & Sincerity, I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood OCTOBER 31, 1782  [P.S.] Yesterday a Note from the Minister of France w[as] handed to Congress, setting forth that immense Quantities of Provisions went in, to the Enemy from New Jersey.(3) I beleive it is too true: it is said they Pay for it in Cash only & give for Beef 2/6 Currency per lb. The above Note will be forwarded to our Governor next Post. The Minister I apprehend supposes that those Provisions will enable the british to operate against our Allies more powerfully in the West lndies. Dyer says such Propects of Gain will carry them thro' Hell Gate--to obtain it. I am rather in Opinion that it cannot be prevented. Capital Laws will not be executed--And others will be evaded. ""

  Dear Sir Philadelphia Octobr 31st 1782 I have for a month or two past began I believe not less than 5 or 6 letters to you, with an expectation the Affair of your late brothers (1) Account would be brot to a Close & to have finishd by letter with that Information but by expectations have been as repeated frustrated & I had to thro my letters in the fire. The First Comtee reported that it was their opinion, that the monies expended, tho all before the Scale of Depreciation should be reduced to its real Value according to a Scale of Depreciation fixd by this State which began Depreciation in Jany 1777 & brot it to (2) for one before Septr 1777, which would reduce the sum & Consequently the Commiss about one quarter & even that was opposed. Congress recommitted it to the same Comtee to advise with the Financier and after about a month they reported again a Gross sum Viz about 29,000 dolls to be due which would be about the same sum as it would amount to by their first report, and that was opposd again, & again Committed to the same Comtee but one of them being Absent they added Another Gentn from North Carolina, a proper representative of Mr Burk who formerly made the opposition. When the Commissions was first Granted, the 2 others Who had had their report so often rejected would not concern themselves but little about the Affair but left it much to Doctr Williamson who had made the most opposition in Congress, and Notwithstanding all my Urging & pressing the Matter he kept the papers I believe about six Weeks before I could get the report in Again. By the way in the last Commitment Congress threw up the Commissions wholly &  OCTOBER 31, 1782  ordered them to report a gross sum what they thot was justly due for his services About 2 years & a half & they finally have reported 12,000 dollars beside the ballance which Stands against him on his Accounts which reduced it from the first report Viz 29,000 to 12,000.(2) This was but a day or two agoe, and as I found I was now to tarry all Winter for special reasons I have not moved to have this last report taken up Waiting some few days for a more favourable oppertunity. I have spared no pains in every proper way out doors & in to obtain justice in the Cause in some measure equal to what they have treated others & hope I have made some Impression, & that Congress may at least Order the sum first reported, but at present uncertain. Shall give you further Intelligence in the affair as soon as ever Compleated.(3) Mrs. Trumble is distressed for want of a little money, begs if possible you could furnish her with some, possibly about $100 dollar as she cannot return this Winter, presents her sincere regards.

At any rate it relieves me from much anxiety to hear from him frequently. My own state of health has been such as has lately obliged me to leave Congress for eight or ten days, and make an excursion to the upper & more healthy parts of this State.(1) I thank God it has been attended with considerable benefit to my health.

  Sir Philadelphia 2d Novr 1782 I did myself the Honor of addressing you on the 23d of last Month, and then gave some Expectation that the Cession of New York to the United States would this Week be taken up and considered.(1) This was done on Thursday, and the same Day Congress approved it. Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Connecticut were for the Acceptance. Massachusets Bay, New Hampshire and Georgia were unrepresented. North and South Carolina were divided, and consequently had no Votes. Virginia was solely in the Negative. There has been a liberal Conference between several Members of different States, and the Delegates of Connecticut, and it issued in a Determination, That a Motion should be made next week, recommending to the last mentioned State, a Reconsideration of their Cession, and to make it free from all Conditions. This We are assured will be done. The Cession of Virginia will not be accepted: But Congress will in the strongest Manner soon call upon that State to make One exempt from every Condition, and at the same Time press North and South Carolina to do the same.

  Dear Sir.(1) Philadelphia Novr. 4th. 1782. I have just received a letter from Dr Randall (my pupil) which informs me of one he had recd from you--partly on business, and partly on friendship, as to the first I can do little more at this distance than bid you Godspeed--the latter no distance can controul those agreable sensations the mind is susceptible of upon such occasions, and it will be my highest pleasure to improve every opportunity in keeping up so desirable a Correspondence. I wrote you lengthily, & as confusedly as lengthily, just before I set out for this place (2) and informed, my intentions of committing Lyndon to your care, where I hope he has arrived before the date of this. We have no news, stirring. Our Grand Army, are already in Winter Quarters--and the prospect of a speedy Peace, is greatly lessened. Congress has done but little business, since my Arrival--they have accepted the Cession of N York to their Western Territory, and thereby acquired the Right of Soil to about four times the quantity of Pennsylvania State. Connecticut, it is expected will make a second step very soon--in the same Way. Virginia & the Carolina's and Georgia--oppose with great temper, every movement of that kind--being apprized that it leads to disencumber them of their unweildy bulk, which now is productive merely of Pride & poverty, but which in the hands of Congress, might become the sources of Wealth & power to the United States, and relieve them from the burthens under which they now groan--for at a moderate calculation those lands, would be a sufficient fund to discharge the National debt, and of course re-establish our National Credit. Mr. Howell, shines on these subjects, he has made himself master of them, and his arguments, tho' unregarded too much when the vote comes on yet strike conviction into & silence his opponents. General Cornell, had quitted Congress before my Arrival--the Superintendant of Finance had given him an Appointment of 2000 Dollars per Ann. (much more than the State allows a Delegate).(3) I should think his conduct will not meet with the approbation of his Constituents upon this Occasion. A Mr. Phelps,(4) an Esquire under N.Y. in Vermont State I expect will be the bearer of this. I wish you to treat him well for doing me the favor if he should. You can by getting a Letter to any Post Office favor me with a return. I shall be anxious to know the state of the good Family--and how business goes on tho' I am prevented from giving that assistance I wish. I directed Dr. Randall to forward to you by Lyndon--a Note against Dr. Hopkins of Bennington payable in Beef or Flour at Winchester the 25th Dec next which I expect he will deliver--by the time, if he should forget to send the Note, by him it will be forwarded when opportunity presents.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 5 Nov. 1782 This day Congress have been deliberating on the affairs of Vermont. Their claims, as well as the claims of other States were stated. The History of the cause traced. The minds of the present Members of Congress sufficiently discovered. The Delegates for New York urged a decision on the main question through expectation that it would be determined in the negative by a decided Majority.(1) It is agreed that 9 States are necessary to recognize their Independance--That number could not be obtained at present. I therefore moved & was seconded by Col. Dyer to postpone the main question to make room for the following resolve, Viz. \""That the preliminary required of the people of Vermont by a resolve of Aug. 1781 as indispensably necessary to a recognition of their Independance has been complied with on their part.\"" Seven States were sufficient to decide upon this proposition: and this being once decided in the affirmative, their Independance would necessarily follow. On the Question to postpone a Division was called for & it was postponed generally & congress adjourned.(2) I expect the Subject will be introduced again tomorrow, but with a view to obtain a vote against Vermont. Such is the present trim of the House  NOVEMBER 5, 1782  that it is not safe to risque a vote on the main question. All that can be done Dr Arnold & myself are doing in perfect Harmony with each other. The Subject of back-lands is taken up in earnest. The cession of New York is accepted; more will soon be done.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novb. [5](1) 1782 Yesterday I was favoured with your Letter of the 20th of last month, which was about a week after Genll. Gansevolt left Town: as he called on us, & brought me Letters I conclude he had forgot or mislaid this, otherwise I should not have omitted writing to you by so direct an oppertunity. I am pleased with the Excuse you make for not writing; you were sure that no objection could be made to it by a Person labouring under the same Infirmity and perhaps not so likely to form Resolutions of Amendment as Those who had been lately tormented with so disagreable a Companion. I am glad to hear you have made so great progress in the purchase of Certificates and that Mr Smith has sent you a Sum in order to make the Deposit for the confiscated Lands. I have Purchased Certificates of Platt & Smith sufficient for the Payment of the Part I agreed to take in those Lands which will be ready at any Time they are called for. Colo Floyd lately informed me by Letter from Poughkipsie that he proposed going to Albany before he came here: I hope I shall see him either at this Place or on the Road when I return, which will be soon, as my Fina[n]ces begin to run very low and the Allowance of the State is not sufficient for my support: least I should not see Colo Floyd you would oblige me by informing what you have agreed on respecting  NOVEMBER 5, 1782  Lands, which you can do by Letter directed to the Care of Governor Clinton, which I shall receive on my Return. I am not surprised to hear that the public Creditors in the state are greatly alarmed least the public Debts should not be discharged, and am glad to find that the Clamors of the public Creditors on that account are so general in the Different States as they appear to be; as it is not for want of Ability, but Inclination, that Funds are not established for the Payment of the Interest of Moneys loaned & liquidated Debts which would give general Satisfaction to the Creditors of the Public. 1,200,000 Dollars is quotaed on the Different States for this Purpose, viz, for the payment of Interest due in the year 1782, and each State is Authorized to pay its Quota towards the Interest of Money loand within the State. It is to be hoped that the Influence of public Creditors in each State will be sufficient to inforce this Act. This was the only resource we had that could be agreed on. No more bills could be drawn on France for the purpose of paying Interest, and our little Sister Rhoad Island hitherto has and probably still will prevent the United States from being benefitted by the proposed five Per Cent Act. Congress are anxious for securing the Public Creditors but what can be done without the Aid of the Several States. The Cession of New York has lately been accepted by the United States, and it is proposed that a Valuable Fund for Discharging Debts & payment of interest may be made from these Lands. This Plan is very popular here & further Southward: I beleive large Tracts might be sold to good advantage for certificates. The Loan that is opened in Holland has hitherto been as successful as could be expected; it is not from Goverment but Individuals, but it cannot be expected it will continue long except permanent funds are established for the punctual discharge of the Interest. I trust our Necessities will compel us to such a Measure before long. The Loan in Holland is as favorable as any Loans in Europe. The Expence of negociating is about four Per Cent & the Interest about 5 Per Cent. None of this money can be applied towards paying Interest or paying Debts except to the Army & for their support. When we shall have Peace God only knows. The Prospect of such an Event has been very great, but the Change of the british Ministry & the Success of their Fleet in the West Indies seems to have put the Period of the War at a greater Distance than was expected; it is not however improbable but a Peace may take Place during the Course of the ensuing Winter, but as this may depend on [the] Temper of the British Parliament, the Influence of the minister & the Events of War, it is hardly safe to hazard a Conjecture--at all events, we ought to be prepared for the worst. It is doubted by many whether Chares Town will be evacuated soon notwithstanding every Preparation seems to have been made by the Enemy for that purpose. It is truly distressing that our state has so long been deprived of a Sea Port but I think no argument can be   drawn from the Enemies keeping Possession of New York. The war will be longer continued than if they had evacuated it this fall; for had they withdrawn their Troops it must have been with Design to have operated against our Ally more to their Advantage than by keeping their present Station. You have no doubt heard that the old Contra[c]t for supplying the army is at an End & that Colo Wardsworth & Charter have taken it till the End of the Year:(2) they have made a good Bargain, necessity compelled it. The States not paying the Taxes as was expected made a Credit necessary. Yesterday a New President was chosen for the ensuing Year, Mr. Botenot of New Jersey, a Gentleman who no doubt will fill the Chair with Reputation.

By Mr. M____(2) opposition was made agst. any partial exchange in the face of the solemn declaration passed on the 16 Ocr. as highly dishonorable to Congress, especially as that declaration was made in order to compel the enemy to a national convention with the U. S. All exchanges had been previously made on the part of the former by the Military authority of their Generals. After the letter of Genl. Carlton & Admiral Digby notifying the purpose of the British King to acknowledge our Independence, it was thought expedient by Congress to assume a higher tone. It was supposed also at the time of changing this mode that it would be a test of the Enemy's sincerity with regard to Independence. As the trial had been made & the British Commander either from a want of power or of will had declined treating of a Cartel on national ground, it would be peculiarly preposterous & pusilanimous in Congress to return to the  NOVEMBER 5, 1782  former mode. An adjournment suspended the vote on the question for referring the case to thc Secy. & Genl. to take order. ""

  Dear Sir Philada. Novr. 4 [i.e. 5]. 1782. In consequence of your letter of 28th. Ult recd. by yesterdays mail,(1) notifying your intended visit to the Courts at Richmond I shall address this to that place, and continue so to do until otherwise instructed. Mr. Jones has once more got abroad, and will resume his alternate pen next week, although it should happen otherwise it will be best for you to observe the rotation last settled in your address. We abound in reports from Europe but are wholly destitute of certain intelligence, other than is contained in the Newspapers. The accidental loss of the Royal George has at length been announ[c]ed circumstancially from N. York, and may be critically felt in the expedition of Admiral How[e] in favor of Gibralter. A letter from Mr. Carmichael of the 8th July as well as more recent advices tell us that the preparations against this Garrison transcend all example and almost all conception. The effect of them is probably decided ere this and will soon be known to us. Mr. C. says he had discovered that the Mediation of the two Imperial Courts had been renewed by their Ministers to that of Madrid and that he suspected England to be at the bottom of it; but the silence of later letters from other sources as to this point leaves it rather improbable. We are informed by a letter from Genl Washington of the 30th. Ulto. that the army is going into its winter cantonments, that a part of the B. fleet composed of 14 Ships of the line 1 of 40 guns & 7 frigates with 14 transports sailed from N. York on the 26th supposed to be going to the W. Indies & to have no troops on board; and that he has been informed that immediately on the arrival of the last packet two vessels were dispatched for Charlestown. Yesterday being the anniversary for the choice of a President, Mr. Boudinot of N. Jersey was placed in the chair for the ensuing year. The principle of rotation, altho' in no instance less proper, is applied with great firmness to the one in question by the States which have not yet filled the chair of Congress or which least expect a turn on any other principle. The territorial cessions have again been a subject of deliberation in  NOVEMBER 5, 1782  Congress and that of N. York separately accepted. The conditions annexed to those of Connecticut & Virginia will probably be sent down for amendment. The policy on foot with respect to this business is explained pretty fully in my letter of this date to Mr. Randolph, and in cypher. You will permit me therefore to refer you to that source for further information. The same letter with the preceding one will also answer your enquiries concerning Lippencut & Asgill. With the sincerest regard I am Dr Sir yr Friend & obt servt J. Madison Jr ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Novr. 5th. 1782 My last informed you that a proposition had been made in Congress for accepting the territorial Cession of N. York. The paper inclosed contains the proceedings which ensued. The acceptance of this Cession singly met with a negative from Virginia for obvious reasons. In the first place such a measure, instead of terminating all controversy as to the western Country, the object proposed by the original plan, introduces new perplexities. And in the 2d place, an assent from us might be hereafter pleaded as a voluntary acceptance of the U. States in the room of N. York, as litigants against Virginia. On the subsequent motion you will find Virga. divided.(1) The proviso expressed in this motion if referred to the territory retained by N. York appeared to me to be at least nugatory, or rather to imply that a Resolution of Congress might operate towards depriving another State of the benefits of the Confederation; and if referred to the territory ceded by N. Y. to imply that the 9th Art. was the constitutional rule of deciding controversies as well where the U. S. as where a particular state were the party. All that Congress could, as I supposed, have properly done, would have been to guard against any biass on future decisions by declaring that their acceptance of the Cession of N. Y. was not to be considered as expressing any opinion as to the rightful claims or limits of that State. But I did not feel myself at liberty to substitute such a proposition because it militated against the guarantee required by Virga. and would have prejudged that condition of her Cession. The success of {the middle states}(2) in obtaining the Cession of N. Y. has given great encouragement; and they are pursuing steadily the means of availing themselves of the other titles. That of Connecticut is proposed for the next object. Virginia will be postponed for the last. By {inlisting the two preceding} into {their party they hope to render their measures more effectual with respect to the last}. NOVEMBER 5, 1782  Besides the effect which may be expected from this {coalition with New York} on {territorial questions in Congress}, it will I surmise prove very {unfriendly to the pretentions of Vermont. Duane} seems not un{apprized of the} advantage which {New York has gained} and is already {takeing measures for a speedy vote on that question}.(3) Upon the {whole New York has either} by {a fortunate} coincidence of circumstances, {or by skilful management or by both} succeeded {in a very important object: by ceding a claim which was tenable} neither {by force nor by law she has} acquired {with Congress the merit of liberality} rendered the {title to her reservation more respectable and} at least dampt {the zeal with which Vermont has been abetted}. If you should be {surprized that} these considerations did not {dissuade Connecticut from an unqualified acceptance of the cession of New York} you will only be {affected} as others {were at the time}. The truth is, {they were surprized at it themselves after it was too late and} would gladly {have revoked their error}. You were also informed in my last of the situation in wch. the affair of Lippencut remained. In the midst of our {perplexities} a letter arrived from Gel. Washington inclosing an intercession from the Count de Vergennes in favor of the life of young Asgill, founded on a most pathetic and importunate Memorial from his Mother. The Ct. writes to Gel. Washington, as he says not in the quality of a public Minister, but of a man who feels the force of Mrs. Asgill's supplications. He backs his intercession however, with the desire of the King & Queen who were much affected with the Memorial, observes that, altho' Asgill is no doubt a prisoner to the U. States, yet as he became such by an event to which the arms of his Majesty contributed, the interest he takes in behalf of this officer, is the more admissible, & signifies that if the British Commander should not in this instance fully comply with the demands of Justice there is reason to believe that future instances of barbarity will be prevented. The judgment {formed of} this {intercession by} different {members is very different}. All {indeed agree that} retaliation {cannot be executed in the face of it. But some} are of {opinion} that {it} luckily {affords and ought to be made the ground of re}treat {from that measure; while others suppose} that {our honour will be more wounded by such a public mark} both {of our obsequiousness to France and of her disapprobation of our views than by a retreat of ourselves on the ground of} Carlton's {promise to continue his pursuit of the} murderer. {Some think also that an omission in our act of the wish} expressed {on the part of the King & Queen of France} may {give umbrage. Others again} infer from the circumstances {of the letter from the Count being} addressed to {General Washington not to Congress and in his private not official quality} that a {public notice of it cannot be expected and} that {a private} explanation {by the secre-  tary of} foreign affairs {to the Minister of France will be as much as will be proper}. The {Minister also} received {an instruction to interest himself in the affair and had even} prepared {a memorial to Congress relative to it}. Having {discovered however the diversity of} sentiments {prevailing in Congress and being apprehensive} that {his interposition} might render {the case more perplexing and} possibly {be not treated with due notice in the final act of Congress, he has very prudently desisted from his purpose}. Untill Congress shall have come to some decision with respect to the notice to be taken of {the intercession above mentioned} I would not wish it to be generally spoken of from this letter. Yesterday being the 1st Monday in Novr. The vacant chair was filled by Mr. Boudinot. The distribution of the votes was as follows, for Mr. B. {New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pensylvania, Delaware, Maryland}, for Mr. {Bland Virginia, South Carolina}, for Mr. {Rutledge} N. C.,(4) (for Mr. {Nash, New York}. Massachusetts had no Delegate present but Mr. Osgood. Georgia was wholly unrepresented. As you were present at the last election I need not recite to you the motives to the one in question. A letter from Carmichael dated 8 July, says that the Resolutions of Congress & the States against separate negociations with the new British Ministry were exceedingly applauded at the Spanish Court; and that he had discovered that the Imperial & Russian Ministers had renewed an offer of the Mediation of their Courts to Spain. The silence of our other Ministers in letters of later date renders the latter article very doubtful. A letter of the 5th of Sepr. from Mr. Laurens at Nantz repeats his purpose to return to America; adding that the risk of capture & the advice of his friends had led him to apply to the Court of London for a passport via Falmouth & N. York, to Philada., that Ld. Cornwallis had interested himself in his case, and that the passport was to be transmitted to him. It was uncertain whether he was to embark t[his] fall, or wait till the spring. {Unless the} embarkation {from a British port was more necessary than I am aware} a {direct passport from France} would {in my view have been more eligible}. The army we are informed by a letter from Gel Washington of the 30th Ult. are going into their winter cantonments. Part of the British fleet, consisting of 14 Ships of the line, 1 of 40 guns, 7 frigates & 14 transports sailed from N. York on the 26th supposed to be bound to the W Indies, and to have no troops [on] board. Two vessels were despatched it is said for Charlestown immediately after the arrival of the last packet, for the purpose of countermanding the evacuation. Mr. Jones has recovered rapidly within a few days past & has once more got about. Your favor of the 26th past was duly received yesterday.(5) I am anx-  ious for the new Cypher which it promises as well for my own use as yours; and for the same reasons. I conclude from your silence as to my late communications in L____ls Cypher that the key I sent you some time ago answered its purpose.6 ""

We are told by a letter from Mr. Carmichael that the firmness of the Answers of the States to the Overtures of the British Court (through S' r Guy Careleton and admiral Digby) has had a very good effect, and has even met with the personal applause of the King of Spain, and that the the Opinion of the foreign Ministers at that Court is that the Wisest thing Great Britain can do is to Conclude a treaty acknowledging the Independence of America.

  My dearest Love, Philadelphia Novr. 6th. 1782 I have wrote you in the hurry & Confusion of the Times, twice since Monday Morning. I therefore need not repeat the important Transactions of that Day. Suffice it to say, that every day will appear a Week till you arrive here. The Office I now fill--your Friends--the Season of the Year--and what, I hope will have its weight, your affectionate Husband--all--all require You to make no delay. I am conscious this is a heavy Task, and how you are to execute it, I know not. God only knows, who can & will help you. In the first Place you must plan the state of your Family during the winter. I think it will be absolutely necessary, for Mr. Remsen to stay in the Office if possible. As to Dickey I scarcely know what is best, but on the whole I think he had best be with his uncle Elisha, as I fear this Town would be ruinous to his Studies--however this must be the Subject of Consideration. Phillis if not Lena too must be brought along, or if Prince can wait on Tea Table perhaps he might do instead of Lena. Every Thing must be sold that you can spare. If you make a Vendue (which I hope will not be necessary) you must give 6 Months Credit for the unsaleable articles, provided Security is given, otherwise the money to be paid down. I mean to keep the small Steers & the youngest Colt. Give directions to Baird to saw the Logs, into weather Boards--Inch Boards and a few Plank & Joice, as the Timber will Suit--and Josey must hale1 them as fast as Sawed. Josey must get as many more Logs in the winter as he can--and must go to School as often as possible. I wish Mr. Pintard could manage it so as to go into the House. You must bring your Plate, best Linnen--particular conveniencies & Family Books with you--dont forget the political Essays & four Volumes of Treaties. I shall want all my Books of Acct--my Will &c. You must muster all the money you can. There is a Bond from a Man in Mendum assigned to me by Mr Conklin, try to get as much on it as possible--and also call on both of the Mr. Conklins who owe for the Plantations and get what you can of them. You must put the Care of my Swamp Lands near home, into the Hands of Mr Southerd, and those over by Long Hill to Mr Ludlow-- and Mr Sayres will take Care of those near him. As to your coming here, my present Plan is for you to load the Waggon which Josey will drive and you & Sukey to come to Prince- NOVEMBER 6, 1782  ton in the Chair escorted by one of your Gallants--where I will send the Coach or perhaps a Phaeton to transport you to the most welcome Place you will meet with in this World, I mean the Arms & Heart of your affectionate Husband. I must know the Day when you will be at Princeton, which I hope will not be far off. Bring with you my black Suit of Cloaths & my Winter Cloathes. I wish already for an under Jackett. I have got an elegant Marseilles Quilt for Susan at £4.10. I have also a dozen pair of Coarse worsted Stockings for Servants. If it will be necessary to buy Blanketts for the Negroes, will get them ready to send by the Waggon. You must prevail on Elisha to pay a most particular attention to my Business, or I shall be totally ruined. I think you had best sell some of the Hogs--sell all the unnecessary Utensils about the House. If you can get the 5 half Joes I gave for the Sulkey (Cash in hand) you may also sell that. Susan had better bring her Saddle & Netting for her Horse, if it can be done with Ease. I would not advise the selling the Hay till spring. If Mr Pintard should so contrive it, as to live in the House this winter, there will be no need of leaving any Horse there if you can get rid of them all--I sell them all, unless Susan would choose to keep the Mare here. I am distressed for a body Servant, that I can put Confidence in. I shall have none but entire strangers round me, unless you can get one with you--and it will be necessary to have one to ride behind the Coach. What would Mr. P. say to coming & staying at Mr Risk's this winter--if he wont--why not go into the House at Elizabeth Town in the Spring and get the Garden in Order. I have recd a Letter from Elias, who informs me he is in want of Cloaths, and that his Grandfather refuses to find him any. I beg you will try to see Mr Van Norder and have this matter, explicitely settled. I promissed to pay for his Schooling, Books &ca and Board for a Year to see what chance he stood of applying himself, but his Grand Father was to find him Cloaths. If this is refused I shall send him back again. I can give him some of my old Cloaths that may help out, but I will not have the Care of his Cloathing on my Shoulders. I must beg you to make Memoranda's in writing of every of your transactions, particularly, the reciept & Payment of all Monies and of all Bargains & Agreements you may make. If Mr Remsen is with you, he must make out an Extract of the Supreme Court Business and endeavour to come down here on Monday next at farthest, that I may give him proper directions. If he is not with you Dickey must do it as well as he can. The Register and the necessary Accts. &c must be brought in order to assess the Damages in any of the Actions. An Extract also of the Suits in Chancery now depending. He must also call on Mr. Morton & know if Mr Lewis has settled the Costs in Chancery--if not the Execution must be issued without more delay. I offered to give up to him near one fourth of my part of the Costs & did accordingly mark them off in the register, but I do not mean this if anxz Execution issues. I am willing to take good Security for my part.  I have so many Things to write, that I cant remember enough to set them down in order. Give my kind Love to all our Friends & Neighbours who I expected to have had the Pleasure of enjoying this Winter but it seems I am not my own Man.

  Kind Friend, Philadelphia Nov. 6 1782. When I wrote you last I was under great oppression of Spirits, which I have suffered much by during the last Summer. My Sentiments on NOVEMBER 6, 1782  some points being singular, in regard to the Impost, half-pay, &c. The business being entirely new--The Members of Congress generally unknown to me. My Colleague (1) opposed to me in important objects, added to other embarrassments too well known to be mentioned, I found it difficult at all times to possess myself in the manner I could have desired. Since Dr. Arnolds arrival & the fine air of Octobr & Nov. I have been well in health & cheerful as usual. I doubt not the Assembly will have rejected the Impost before you will receive this. Half-pay is struck out of the estimate for 1783. The officers I expect will be referred to their several States for gratuities or impositions in lieu thereof. Congress have accepted the cession of claims to Western Territory made by New York a few days ago, & those of Connecticutt & Virginia will be accepted also when they shall have been disencumbred of certain exceptionable conditions. So that there is a good prospect of carrying the most material points I have been labouring after. The Independance of Vermont is the only object that cannot be started. It meets with every opppsition you can imagine. You must have heard that the intended expeditions set on foot by this State against the Indians at Sandusky & Genesee are laid aside. I opposed them in Congress as believing that the Massacreing of the Moravian Indians (2) lead on to the outrages suffered by our Frontiers. Your humanity will lead you to enquire about the facts of Asgill the intended victim to attone for the death of Huddy. His parents have written a most affecting letter to the French Court requesting their intercession in favour of their Son. Count De Vergennes in consequence of it has in his private capacity & not as Minister sent a Letter to Congress interceeding for the life of that unfortunate young officer. He mentions that the King & Queen of France are greatly affected at the expected fate of the victim--that they wished their feelings on the occasion to be known on this side of the water and that should it be consistent with the national honor of this Country his release would be a very grateful event to their Majesties. The Count adds that as Asgill is a Prisoner of York Town, he hopes it will be remembred on this occasion that the laurels of that day were acquired by the joint arms of France & America & that his Intercession may receive some weight from that Consideration. Sir Guy Carleton had ordered a Court-martial on Leppincut, who acquitted him; these proceedings had been sent out to Genl. Washington & enclosed by him in a Letter to Congress. This Letter with all the paper in the case had been referred to a Committee which had made a report in the case & that report had been under consideration in Congress & warmly debated before the arrival of the Letter of Count De Vergennes. The report of the Committee would have taken Asgills life, but it met with opposition. I moved to have that part of the report struck   out which would affect his life; I was seconded by Mr L' homedieu from N. York. A vote was taken & it was struck out, whereupon the report was recommitted. In this Stage the Intercession from the French Count found the business. The Counts Letter with that of Asgills parent to him are referred to the same Committee and they set this day on the business. I hope & <<expect> [don't] doubt but their report will be such as to save the life of the Innocent.(3) I believe, in some possible cases retaliation may be just; but I think the present after what has taken place would rather have the appearance of perpetuating the barbarities of war than of restraining them. I see your Friends Pemberton, Wall, Benezet, &c. sometimes. I frequently attend the 6 O' Clock Evening meeting in Market Street. I have enclosed you a fragment of a piece written by a disowned Quaker--the other part is not by me. In the enclosed News paper you will observe the noble Sentiments of President Dickinson in regard to personal Liberty.(4) He is chosen a member of the Supreme Executive Council in this State; and it is expected will be chosen President of this State tomorrow; there is about to be a change of men & measure I am told in this State.

  S' r, Philadelphia Novr. 5 [i.e. 6], 1782.(1) In my last Letter to your Excelleny (2) I inclosed a Copy of the Report of a Committee respecting the Hostilities which had taken Place in Cumberland County and which was to have been determined on last Wednesday; but the Report of the 17th of April tho often taken up has from Time to Time been postponed and is not yet determined on, and I believe never will be. Yesterday when the Question was ready to be put, The advocates for Vermont, who had brought in this Report and insisted that nothing could be done till the sence of Congress was taken on the Same, which they alledged, ought to as soon as possible, were now as anxious to have it postponed sine Die: and the Question being put, it was carried in the Affirmative. It is not unlikely that at first they supposed a great majority might be in favour of the Report refered to, but finding only Two or Three States inclining to Vote for it, they did not choose to have any Decision upon it. It is possible, from the beginning nothing more was intended by some, than such a Delay of the Business that nothing finally should be done. for my own Part I am not disappointed, it has ended as I had reason to fear of which I informed your Excellency. It is very evident that but three or four States will Vote for the Independence of Vermont and at the same time the Vote of Seven States cannot now be procured to say they shall not be received into the Federal Union. It is strange that even the Criminal Correspondence, with the Enemy of these People, the late violent Acts of Hostility and their Disobedience to the Orders of the United States, is made use of, by their Advocates, as arguments to shew the Necessity of recognizing their Independence. even the Name of an illustruous Carecter has been mentioned as having incoraged those People, that their Independence would be granted by the United States. There can now be no Excuse for not determining what measures shall be taken for Preserving the Peace in that District of Country, and for restoring the unhappy sufferers to their Liberties and Estates. I should be very happy if something could be agreed on which would answer those Valuable Purposes. I hope something effectual will be done and that my fears in that respect are groundless. I think within Two or Three Days we shall know the Result.... The Cession of our Western Territory, after much Debate, has been accepted by Seven States including New York.3 it is proposed by those Lands to establish a Fund for paying Interest of Moneys Loaned and public Debts; but whether the public Creditors will be satisfied with such security, is doubtful.... Reprinted from Burnett, Letters, 6:531, from a document located in the New York State Library before the Albany fire of 1911. 1 Although dated \""Novr. 5,\"" this letter was probably written on November 6, because  NOVEMBER 6, 1782  L' Hommedieu refers in the letter to the debate \""yesterday\"" on Vermont, which is recorded in Secretary Thomson's journal entry for November 5.

  Thursday Novr. 7 [1782] (1) On the reconsideration the Resol. for exchanging the 2 for. officers Its repeal was unanimously agreed to.(2) A motion was made by Mr Osgood to assign an early day for filling up the vacancy in the Court of appeals.(3) It was opposed on the principle of oeconomy, and the expedient suggested by Mr. Duane of empowering a single Judge to make a Court untill the public finances would better bear the expence. In favor of the motion it was argued 1. that the proceedings of the Court were too important to be confided to a single Judge. 2. that the decisions of a single judge would be less satisfactory in cases where a local connection of the judge subsisted with either of the parties. 3. that a single judge would be more apt by erroneous decisions to embroil the U. S. in disputes with foreign powers. 4. that if there were more than one Judge, & one formed a Court, there might at the same time be two interfering jurisdictions, and that if a remedy could be applied to this difficulty, the course of decisions would unavoidably be less uniform, & the provision of the confederation for a Court of universal appellant Jurisdiction so far contravened.  NOVEMBER 7, 1782  5. As there was little reason to expect that the public finances wd. during the war be more equal to the public burdens than at present, and as the cases within the cognizance of this Court would cease with the war, the qualification annexed to the expedient ought to have no effect. The motion was disagreed to & a committee which had been appointed to prepare a new ordinance for constituting the Court of Appeals, was filled up & instructed to make report.(4) On the above motion an opinion was maintained by Mr. Rutlidge that as the Court was according to the ordinance in force to consist of three Judges any two of whom to make a Court, unless three were in actual appointment the decisions of two were illegal. Congress went into the consideration of the Report of the committee on the case of Capt Asgill the British officer allotted to suffer retaliation for the murder of Capt. Huddy. The report proposed \""That considering the letter of the 29th of July last from the Count de Vergennes to Genl Washington interceding for Capt. Asgil, the Commander in chief be directed to set him at liberty.\"" Previous to the receipt of this letter from the Count de Vergennes Congress had been much divided as to the propriety of executing the retaliation, after the professions on the part of the British Commanders, of a desire to carry on the war on humane principles, and the promises of Sr. G. Carlton to pursue as effectually as possible the real authors of the murder: some supposing that these circumstances had so far changed the ground that Congress ought to recede from their denunciation; others supposing that as the condition of the menace had not been complied with, and the promises were manifestly evasive, a perseverance on the part of Congress was essential to their honor & that moreover it would probably compel the enemy to give up the notorious author of the confessed murder. After the receipt of the letter from the Count de Vergennes, Congress were unanimous for a relaxation. Two questions however arose on the report of the committee. The 1st was on what considerations the discharge of Capt. Asgill ought to be grounded. On this question a diversity of opinions existed. Some concurred with the committee in resting the measure entirely on the intercession of the French Court; alledging that this was the only plea that could apologize to the world for such a departure from the solemn declarations made both by Congress and the Commander in chief. Others were of opinion that this plea if publicly recited would mark an obsequiousness to the French Court, and an impeachment of the humanity of Congress, which greatly outweighed the circumstance urged in its favor; and that the disavowal of the outrage, by the British Genl., and a solemn promise to pursue the guilty authors of it, afforded the most honorable ground on which Congress could make their retreat; others again contended for an enumeration of all the reasons which led to the measure; lastly others were against a   recital of any reasons & for leaving the justification of the measure to such reasons as would occur of themselves. This last opinion after considerable discussions prevailed, and the Resol. left as it stands on the Journals. The 2d question was whether this release of Capt. Asgil should be followed by a demand on Gel Carlton to fulfil his engagement to pursue with all possible effect the authors of the Murder. On one side it was urged that such a demand would be nugatory after the only Sanction which could enforce it had been relinquished; that it would not be consistent with the letter of the Count de Vergennes which solicited complete oblivion, and that it would manifest to the public a degree of confidence in British faith which was not felt and ought not to be affected. On the opposite side it was said that after the confession & promise of justice by Gl Carlton, the least that could be done by Gel. Washington would be to claim a fulfilment; that the intercession of Ct. de Vergennes extended no farther than to prevent the execution of Capt. Asgill, and the substitution of any other innocent victim; and by no means was meant to shelter the guilty; that whatever blame might fall on Congress for seeming to confide in the promises of the enemy, they would be more blamed if they not only dismissed the purpose of retaliating on the innocent, but at the same time omitted to challenge a promised vengeance on the guilty; that if the challenge was not followed by a compliance on the part of the enemy, it would at least promulge & perpetuate, in justification of the past measures of Congress; the confessions & promises of the enemy on which the challenge was grounded; & would give weight to the charges both of barbarity & perfidy which had been so often brought agst. them. In the vote on this question 6 States were in favor of the demand & the others either divided or against it. ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, Novr 8th, 1782. Your Excellcy's favor of the 26th Ultmo by Brown came safe to hand, with a most seasonable Relief of 2 hundred dollars.(1) I had receivd my New Appointment a few days before,(2) which must own I should have received with reluctance, had I not been oblidged to tarry so long for the Trial of our Cause with Pensylvania as would have probably brot me to a very uncomfortable and dificult a season to have returned home, but now conclude to tarry through the Winter, as I suppose was the Intention of the Assembly in my appointment. Am very sorry our Delegates delay so long their coming, as the State must be unrepresented, perhaps for near a month, in a Critical Season & when they will be much wanted. Mr Huntington expects to set out on Saturday; he would tarry a few days longer, but as I must set out for Trenton on Monday, if he remained the State could not be represented, & which also must be the case if I should return in 8 or 10 days from Trenton, till the arrival of those Gentlemen who propose to come. We are unhappy in not keeping up a representation of the New England States, which has been the Occasion often of many things passing in Congress very disagreeable to them & Contrary to the Genius of the People there. New Hampshire is but just now represented for the whole time I have been here, but at the same time Massachusetts have lost theirs, & not like to be represented for some time; Rhodisland have been but part of the time. The Winter season is the time to rectefye mistakes, as well as to lay out plans for the Next season, but if the States will not take care of their representation, they must blame themselves. Your Excellcy Supposes the Susqh. Company & those in possession ought to be Notifyed, & to be allowed a Voice in the choice of Judges; it is true they ought & will have when their right comes imediately into Question. The Agreement & Submission of the several Agents was first so drawn as to have the right of the Tenants in possession brot into question and decided at the same time with the general Claim & Jurisdiction of the Contending States; but Congress would not receive it in that form, as Confederation had provided specially for them, & they would be entituled to another hearing and probably other Judges after the rights of the States are determined, in which their particular case & Circumstances will be Considered: therefore not Notefyed in the present cause. The Minister of France was much pleased with the Act of our Assembly you sent me, discovering the firmness & unanimity of our Assembly in declaring against a Seperate Peace & their strict adherence to the Alliance formed, &c.(3) It carries great Weight in the Courts  NOVEMBER 8, 1782  of Europe When they find not only Congress, but the Assemblys of the respective States (which they think more fully demonstrates the sentiments of the people, their firmness & Union) concurring in a matter so Important & Interesting; the King of France, as we are Informed, when he had received Intelligence that not only Congress but several States in the Union had Declared (after overtures had been made to them for a Seperate Peace) their firm adherence to the Alliance, and not to concede to any seperate Peace but in concert with his most Christian Majesty agreable thereto. He, the K____g, mentioned it with peculiar pleasure to the foreign Ministers & with a more audible Voice than common, that he might not fail to be heard. As Mr Huntington will probably arrive as soon as this letter, & will be able to communicate every thing Needfull, I might have spared troubling your Excellency with much I have wrote allready; have Inclosed a list of the proportions of the several States which I mentioned in my former letter, with my Observations thereon, tho after found I had omitted to Inclose it at that time.

  Friday Novr. 8. [1782] The preceeding question having been taken again, (1) on a further discussion of the subject. There were in favor of the demand, N. H., R. I., N. Y., Pa., Del., Maryd., Virga. & of the other States some were divided.(2) A motion was made by Mr. R. of S. C. \""That the Commander in chief & of the S. Department be respectively directed whenever the Enemy shall commit any act of cruelty or violence contrary to the laws & usage of war on the Citizens of these States to demand adequate satisfaction for the same, and in case such satisfaction shall not be immediately given, but refused or evaded under any pretext whatsoever, to cause suitable retaliation to be for[th]with made on British officers without wating for directions from Congress on the subject.\"" When this motion was first made it was espoused by many; with great warmth in particular by the Delegates of N. C. & S. C. as necessary to prevent the delays & uncertainties incident to a resort by the Military Commanders to Congress, and to convince the Enemy that notwithstanding the dismission of Capt. Asgill the general purpose of retaliation was firmly retained. Against the motion it was objected 1. that the time & place in which it stood would certainly convey an indirect reprehension to Gel. Washington for bringing before Congress the case of Capt. Asgill & Huddy. 2. that it manifested a distrust in Congress, which however well founded in [it] might be with respect to retaliation ought not to be proclaimed by themselves. 3. that political & national considerations might render the interference of the supreme authority expedient, of wch. the letter from Ct. de Vergennes in the late case furnished an instance; that the resort of the Military Commanders to the sovereign for direction in great and difficult cases, such as those of retaliation would often prove, was a right of which they ought not to be deprived; but in the exercise of which they ought rather to be countenanced. These objections reduced the patrons of the motion to the Delegates of N. C. & S C alone or nearly so. In place of it the declaratory motion on the Journals was substituted. This again was objected to as implying that in the cases of retaliation taken up by the Mily. commanders they had proceeded on doubtful authority. To remove this objection, the amendment was proposed, limiting the preamble to the single act of discharging Capt. Asgill. This however was not entirely satisfactory because that particular act could have no constructive influence on the reputed authority of the Generals. It was acceded to by the votes of several who were apprehensive that in case of rejecting it, the earnestness of some might obtrude a substitute less harmless, or that  NOVEMBER 8, 1782  the Resolution might pass without the preamble & be more offensive to the Commander in chief. The first apprehension was the prevailing motive with many to agree to the proposition on the final question. This day a letter was rcd. from Gel Washington inclosing one of the 25 of Ocr. from Sr. G. Carlton relative to the demand made on him for a liquidation of accts. and payment of the balance due for maintenance of Prisoners of war; in which the latter used an asperity of language so much the reverse of his preceding correspondence that many regard it as portending a revival of the war against the U.S.(3) ""

11277,dg019252,1782,North Carolina Delegates to Alexander Martin,"""North Carolina Delegates to Alexander Martin
  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Nov. 9th. 1782.  The Resolutions of Congress of 3d October & 10th December 1781(1) have doubtless been forwarded to Government pressing the filling up the Continental Battalions by enlistments for three Years or during the war. Since the dates of the above requisitions Congress have been urged by the dictates of necessity & prudence to make reforms in every department where money could be saved. The Resolves of August 7th, 1782 were in consequence of that plan & are a part of the system.(2) It is clear that almost every Officer in the North Carolina Line would be deranged on the first of January in consequence of those resolves & yet you will find, when the Journals are handed You, that Mr. Blount & myself did not think fit to oppose the measure on general ground nor to marr the Journals by unavailing Yeas & Nays. We yielded to the Storm of Necessity. A measure which the general good of the army demanded, which had been recommended by the Commander in chief & had been digested in Congress was not to be rashly opposed by a State; to whom they would certainly reply, that we had [been] absolutely inattentive to the Requisitions of Congress, while other States, at a great expence, were filling up their Battalions by long inlistments. After two months when the business had subsided sufficiently we presumed that we might with out much opposition obtain relief for the State provided we could couch it under some colourable excuse. Accordingly October 9th 1782 \""On motion of Mr. Williamson Seconded by Mr. Blount, That a Committee be appointed to consider whether the officers & Troops belonging to  NOVEMBER 9, 1782  the Line of some States in the Union may not be so affected by the Resolves of August 7th respecting the army as to injure the Public Service.\"" The same was refered to Mr. Williamson, Mr. Montgomery & Mr. Bland.(3) From what passed in Congress when the motion was made it was very clear that opposition would be made to every measure that might be attempted to give particular Indulgences, as they were called, to particular States. However as all that we desired was to obtain a Vote for keeping our Officers & Men on the establishment, You will observe the means by which we attempted it. The report was drawn up in Terms which could hardly give offence to any Body; and being Chairman of the Committee I gave it in as soon as a report Prevailed that the enemy were about to continue in Charlestown, for, by the way, it has always been questioned whether the enemy would evacuate that Post. Their plan at least appeard doubtful. The report of the Committee after some debate was refered to the Secretary at War to report. The Secretary reported that the general arrangement of the army could not be materially injured by adopting the measure we had proposed. Whence the report after a second debate was agreed to in Congress on the 4th Instant. It was in these words viz.(4) Whereas it is represented that the State of North Carolina was Zealously pressed by the Commander in chief in the southern department at the last setting of the General assembly in May last to send immediate support to the army under his Command whose situation was critical & dangerous & that not being able with the necessary dispatch to raise a sufficient number of Troops for three Years or during the War they caused 1,500 Men to be immediately draughted for 18 Months &--Whereas the Southern States may be endangered while the enemy continue in that quarter by a sudden dimunition of our Army-- Resolved, That the Commander of the Southern army be instructed to retain in the public service so many of the 18 months drafts of the State of North Carolina as he shall think the Public safety may require and that a proportionable number of officers shall be continued in full pay for the Command of those Troops while they are in the field the resolution of the 7th of August notwithstanding, and then retire on the same principles or emoluments on which they would have retired had not the operation of the said Resolve been postpond. Thus you see our Troops continue on the same footing they would have stood if no resolves on this subject had passed, i.e. If the General needs them he will keep them in the service & if a Period should happen when good Troops are not wanted they will be requested to march home & try to replace the numerous Soldiers & Citizens we have lost during the war by getting more. The Mother of Captain Asgil on whom the Lot fell to be punish'd in retaliation for Captain Huddy, having Petitioned the French Court for the life of her Son, The Count Vergennes, has requested at the   intercession of the King & Queen of France that Captain Asgil be spared on the full persuasion that the enemy having disapproved & condemned the murder of Captain Huddy will not repeat such outrages, Congress on so respectable a request have discharged Capt. Asgil & beside requiring that Sir. G. Carlton shall, as he has promised make further attempts to discover & punish the murderers of Captain Huddy, they have given a General Instruction that the Commander Officers of our several armies whenever any outrages are commited by the enemy contrary to the Laws of War, or practices of humanity, after demanding reperation, unless it is immediately made, they Shall forthwith retaliate.(5) We have the honor to be &c, Hu Williamson Wm Blount (6) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, November l0th, 1782. By Mr. Grantham I send you a bundle of newspapers, besides what is contained in this letter. By those of the later date you will perceive the alarm sounded, through these vehicles of abuse, against our old friend. But, to the keen mortification of the opposing party, he was elected President and General Ewing Vice-President, a worthy and intimate friend of Mr. Dickinson, versus General Potter.(1) I never have known so general a joy diffused among all ranks of the people as was exhibited on this choice of our early associate. The procession from the State [House] to the Court-house was very numerous and respectable, and there the people manifested their felicity by affectionate and repeated acclamations. The gentlemen who opposed Mr. Dickinson are low-spirited, and are afraid something effectual will be done to establish his reputation and that of the present Asssembly. Your former neighbor was deep in the politics [of this opposition], but has a certain versatility about him that accommodates [him] to the powers in being. He asked your other old friend to accompany him, after the procession was over, to Mr. D____'s, for the purpose of congratulating him [on his election], etc.; and crowds of other citizens are daily doing the same. What will be done by the State of Delaware in respect of their President I am ignorant of, but he tells me we shall see in the next newspapers what he said to the Assembly here in relation to this matter. Congress has ordered Captain Asgill to be liberated. This was done in consequence of letters from General Washington, by which it was obvious this was his wish, and from a letter he received from Count de Vergennes, expressing an earnest desire from the king and queen of France, who had been prevailed upon to intercede in behalf of Captain Asgill. The mother of this gentleman wrote to the Count de Vergennes one of the most pathetic letters I ever read. Although Congress has freed Asgill from his confinement, yet they have instructed the commander-in-chief to inform Sir Guy Carlton, in the most pointed terms, that they rely upon his promise of making strict inquisition after the murderer of Captain Huddy; and, in order to prevent all further applications to them from any persons, they have resolved that, in case the enemy shall commit any actions contrary to the law of nations, the commander-in-chief, or the general who may command in the Southern department, after retribution has been demanded by them or either of them, and justice refused or delayed beyond the time limited in their requisition, shall have authority to execute retaliation. This will make the enemy very cautious in their future proceedings, and there will not be reliance, as heretofore, upon the various opinions of a large deliberative body. NOVEMBER 10, 1782  No news from Europe, since I wrote you last, except what you will find in the within papers, under the New York head, upon which we place no dependence. The siege of Gibraltar, and the expected conflict between the British and combined fleets, engrosses all our attention; if the event should be favorable to the two branches of the House of Bourbon, or the English should be much worsted in the East Indies, a general pacification will most probably take place next spring or summer. Count Rochambeau's army (I mention this in confidence, not to be repeated) will, we have reason to think, embark for the West Indies. As to South Carolina we can say nothing, as Congress has received no late letters from thence; but it is alleged that part of the garrison of Charleston has embarked, etc.--see the last newspaper. I have not yet received the law you wrote for; President Boudinot has again written to the printer for it. I wait for the index of 1779, which is not yet finished, otherwise I would send you a complete set of the Journals of Congress. Will you wait for the index, or shall I despatch the Journals without it? You can exchange the volume of 1779 for one, when it is printed, with the index. Mrs. Wharton is getting better; she and my children join me in affectionate regards to Mrs. Read, yourself, and children. Adieu. Yours, very sincerely, S. Wharton.

  Dr. Sr. Phila. 12th Nov. 1782 My favor when it reaches you, which probably was left in Caroline, will be found to be the act of my friend Madison at my request, being then unable to fullfill my engagement.(1) I am now better tho' not well, so well however as to entertain hopes of again taking my seat in Congress sometime this week.(2) I shall thank you for the decision of the Court on the great constitutional question you mention, if which, and the adjournment of it from the Genl. Court into the Court of appeals, we were informed by Mr. Randolph.(3) The question is no doubt difficult and important, of which I cannot at this time so well judge, as after perusing the clause of the constitution, which I have not by me, but mean, so soon as I am able, to go out to look over. If my memory does not fail me the constitution vests the power in the Delegates--the difficulty I suppose pro- NOVEMBER 12, 1782  ceeds from the subsequent Law being the act of the two Houses--was there any subsequent resolution of the Delegates independent of the appendage sending it to the Senate for concurrence? Will not a determination of the Court, upon a construction of the meaning of the Constitution, different from that assumed by the two branches of the legislature, exalt the judiciary above the legislative? Does not corrections of abuses and violations of the constitution more properly belong to the people at large than to the Courts of Law? And are not Judges to do the Law, rather than refine upon constitutional principles? These, and other questions, delicate and perplexing, upon a cursory view of the subject, strike me, and no doubt have been learnedly investigated. The controversy must have excited the curiosity and attention of the public and the decision draw after it important consequences. We have been entertained for some time past by Mr. Rivington with the jargon of News you mention, which, together with a late letter of Sr. Guy Carltons to Genl. Washington on the subject of the proposed Cartel, couched in different language and conveying different Sentiments from what he lately held, seems to indicate a change of measures under the Shelbourne Administration more hostile to our claims than those adopted by Ld. Rockingham. Certain it is the King and Shelbourne are averse to the independence of America and from them we are not to expect it, but from necessity--whether that necessity really exists, and they puff off their yet ample resources for prosecuting the war, with the view of obtaining better terms of peace a little time will discover--certain it is also that upon the departure of Mr. Grenville, Mr. Fitzherbert repaired to France with full powers to negociate a peace with the united provinces of the Netherlands, and all princes and States concerned--under these words we conceive America to be comprehended, but it is said such was not the Idea of the King who granted the Commission. The language may serve the purpose of manOEuvre & delay, the object, I think, of Great Britain, to see the events of the Campaign--when if nothing propitious to them turns up, and the parliament shall countenance the measure, peace with independence may be our portion--but good fortune no doubt will urge our proud Foe to a prosecution of the War rather than submit to what she deems ignoble terms of peace. Mr. Asgill, from the delay that has taken place in consequence of the correspondence between Genl. Washington & Genl. Clinton and after with Sr. Guy Carlton on his Case, and the submission of it by the Comd. in Chief to Congress for final decision, will escape the doom to which his lot had consigned him--Congress having lately directed the Genl. to release him, and to demand a compliance of Sr. Guy with his assurances, that every measure in his power shod. be employed to detect and bring to punishmt. the guilty, as by the inquiry instituted by them. Lippincut, the supposed offender, had been acquited of the charge--this busi-  ness will I expect produce no other consequences than reproaches on Congress. The interposition of our good ally & his amiable consort produced by a pathetic address from Lady Asgill and made thro' the Ct. Vergennes to Genl. Washington to extend mercy to Capt. Asgill which had been communicated to Congress but not noticed in their proceedings on the question, has I presume had some weight in the determination.

  Teusday 12 Novr.

Others insisted that it gave authority, but did not absolutely exclude discretion in the Executive Departments. The explanation which was finally acquiesced in as most rational & conformable to practice, was that it not only gave authority, but expressed the sense of Congress that the measure ought to be executed; leaving it so far however in the discretion of the Executive Department, as that in case it differeed in opinion from Congress it might suspend execution & state the objections to Congress that their final direction might be given. In the course of debate it was observed by (4) that the practice of referring matters to take order, especially where money was to be issued, was extremely exceptionable inasmuch as no entry of such proceedings was made on the Journals, but only noted  NOVEMBER 12, 1782  in a Memorandum book kept by the Secretary, and then sent to the Department with the reference to take order indorsed by the Secy. but not signed by him.(5) So that the transaction even where public in its nature, never came before the public eye, & the Dept. was left with a precarious voucher for its justification. The motion was in the end withdrawn, the mover alledging that as he only aimed at rendering an uncertain point clear, & this had been brought about by a satisfactory explanation, he did not wish for any Resolution on the subject.

  [November 12, 1782] (1) \""Young Captain Asgill, some Time ago allotted as a Victim of Retaliation, to atone for the Murder of Captain Huddy, is liberated by Direction of Congress. No Reasons being assigned in this Resolve, the World are left to conjecture at the Motives which induced it. It appears undeniably true that Lippencut was the real Murderer, and that he had many Accomplices with him--some actually assisting in the Fact, others advising, directing and approving it. Subsequent to the Threat of Retaliation, several Things have taken Place to render its Execution less necessary in the Opinion of many. The British Commander in Chief has reprobated the Fact in unequivocal Terms; he has instituted a formal Trial by Court-Martial, in which, after much Parade, Lippencut was acquitted. He has promised to pursue the Inquisition, so far as Justice will admit, to detect and deliver to Punishment the Guilty. He has dissolved the infamous Board of Refugees, and declared it as his Intention, and that of his Court, to conduct the War on liberal and humane Principles; and his official Conduct has not yet belied this Profession. In Consequence of a well written and most moving Letter from the distressed Mother of Asgill, Count de Vergennes, in his private Character, has addressed our Commander in Chief on this Subject.(2) He paints in high Colours the Effects of this Letter on the Court of Versailles--the Youth and Innocence of the Victim--the Tears of the Mother--the Distraction of the Father, and the Ruin of the Family, have excited royal Compassion and Intercession. The Count further adds, that it would not only be a most grateful Thing to their Majesties to have Asgill restored to his inconsolable Parents and Friends, but they hope it will be considered on this Occasion that he is a Capitulant of York-Town, and that the Laurels of that Day were acquired by the joint Arms of France and America. \""How far these Considerations, or any others that may be suggested, will justify this Measure, must be submitted to the Decision of the civilized World, and Posterity; I shall only observe, that as the chief End of Retaliation is to prevent a Repetition of Injuries, when that End is substantially obtained, forbearing to execute a Threat is a double Victory.\"" MS not found; reprinted from the Providence Gazette, December 7, 1782. 1 This document was printed under the following heading: \""Providence, December 7. Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman in Philadelphia, dated November 12.\"" It seems clear from the details about Charles Asgill's fate contained in it, that this letter could only have been written by a delegate to Congress, perhaps one of the Rhode Island delegates attending at this time, Jonathan Arnold or David Howell.

  My dearest Love. Philadelphia Novr. 13th. 1782. It is matter of real grief & sorrow to me that I should ever be the cause of a distressing or uneasy Hour to one who I esteem above all the Honors or Riches of this transitory Life. I feared greatly that the Change of Station would not be pleasing as I was sure the derangement of my Affairs and the additional Labour cast on you, would be perplexing--but I remembered & doubt not but you will remember, that God has ever been the director of our Paths and the Guide of our Ways. It is not the first Time that he has led us in the Way which we knew not--and set our Feet in a strong Place. We have embarked in his Service, and it is our part to see that we do his Will and act with a single Eye to his Glory & all will be well. Your affectionate & tender Letter was recd. as usual with a hearty & earnest welcome. Mr Remsen had arrived here the Evening before, & returned this Morning. As to directions I cannot collect my Thoughts sufficiently to aid you--In general dispose of those Things that you can sell to advantage--especially the Waggon, Plough &c unless they may be wanted. Let the Boards be put under cover, and all the Logs at the Mill properly sawed & secured. The Hay had best be kept & Mr. Pintard to sell it towards the Spring, say Feby. I gave £12 per Ton here & 3 Dollars for Carting. Let the Stack in Mr. Southerds field be first used. As to Servants I have one good Negroe Man & can get another--but on serious Consideration, I think you had best bring Jude as a Chamber maid, on two Conditions--the first she must work very hard--the 2d she must get no more Children, tho I fear her Virtue here. On these Terms I could make out to charge so much for her service as to cloath her very well--say 7/6 per week. She must leave her Child with Mama. I think this would be much best, as Mr Pintard has a Wench--and Phillis will be better under her Mother than a Stranger. I will enclose a list of the general Furniture, which will direct you what to bring. The House is very indifferently furnished, and the Finances are two low to get any more. I suppose the necessary Et cetera's for first begining of the winter such as Wood, Hay, Wine &c will require at least 1500 Dollars. You had best bring one Suit of Curtains, or perhaps Susan must go without. The Horses I wish you could sell provided a tolerable Price could be got for them. The big Horse grows very old & I wish to be rid of him at the proper Price of £30. As to Mr. Remsen, he must either lodge in the Office & board with Mr Pintard, or take a number of Books & all the Papers to his lodging and have the Key of the office to go in occasionally, as you think best. I have referred him to you & he says he will do any Thing you are of opinion will Answer. There are no Broaches of any kind in the  NOVEMBER 13, 1782  House,(1) but if you cannot bring yours with Ease, we can do without. I delivered the Letter you refer to & answers went by Dr. Romaine. If Polly could take the big Horse (if not sold) I should like it, provided she could take Care of him, but how is this possible without a Boy, and where is she to get Hay for him in her Situation. He would be starved. But now as to the grand Point. I cannot think of your staying longer than this Week. You must set off on Monday next at farthest. I am like a Pelican in the wilderness. Mr Hanson is gone. I am quite alone with my Secretary. I shall certainly expect you if the weather is good on Tuesday Night. Your Brother Sammy is to Squire you from Princeton. I observe what you say about Patty, and have no Objection to her lodging with Susan as it will be Company for her, and Mr P. deserves every Thing from us. But how will you get her down, unless her Papa will bring her to Princeton in the Chair. I am very anxious for your arrival lest the weather should change, yet I am loath to hurry you. I have 30 Gentn. to dine with me to day--what a figure I cut all alone. My Time & Paper will only admit of assuring you [. . .] My dearest Love, Your [. . . .] [P.S.] (Bring with you all your Plate). Kind Love to Mr Livingston's Family and all enquiring Friends. Remember me affectionately to our worthy Parson & let him know I have sent him a pair of Spectacles by Mr Remsen, which I hope will suit him. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decemb. [November] 13, 1782. In my Letter to your Excellency, of last week, I mentioned my Expectaitions of knowing in Two or Three Days What Releif the unhappy Sufferers in the County of Cumberland could expect from the Interposition of the United States in their Behalf. I was mistaken--we could not get a Report ' till yesterday.(1) This Report is such an extraordinary a Production, that there does not appear to me the least chance of its being adopted; it will however answer the Purpose of Delaying the Business by committing or postponing the same. Such a Report was unexpected, altho Two of the Committe (the one from Massachusetts and the other from Rhoad Island) (2) are open advocates for the Vermont Independence. I fully believe now, what I have feared, that nothing decisive by Congress will be done. This Report  NOVEMBER 13, 1782  was to have been taken up to day, but there not appearing a Sufficient Number of States by Eleaven oClock, (according to the Rule) an adjornment took Place. Tomorrow it will be taken up, and after that Time I shall advise Mr. Phelps, Shattuck and Evens to return, as it will answer no Purpose for them to continue longer in this expensive Place. They have spent all their Money and are considerably in debt, which in their Petition they have mentioned, but I believe will have no Releif in that respect, more than in the other, from Congress. We proposed setting of[f] for the State this Week had the Vermont Business been finished. We shall stay as long as we see the least Probability of any Thing being done for the Restoration of Property to our unhappy fellow Citizens in Cumberland County, or untill Colo's Floyd and Hambleton(3) arrive, which I hope will be very soon. We have no News exept what is contained in the inclosed Papers. With great Respect and Esteem I am your Excellencys most obedient and Hum' e Servt. Ezra LHommedieu.

I accept your Congratulations with Pleasure, and earnestly pray to God, that I may go through my Year to the advantage of my Country, and be so happy as to retire to private Life at the End of it, with the pleasing reflection, that American Independance was finally established in the Year 1783, by an unequivocal, honorable & lasting Peace. I have run over the Papers you sent me in the affair of the Partition. My design always was, to let Judgment go by Default, provided the Sheriff was to be depended on--and I Still think it best because if you [shou]ld loose it, yet a Writ [. . . .] (1) finished as soon as possible. The Matter in Equity is clearly in Favour of Brown--but you must examine him well as to the whole Story before you will be possessed of all the Facts. It is left on the Broadest Bottom.

Brown never gave me but a small retaining fee; therefore he should pay you fully. I cannot think of trusting Dickey (2) as my Secretary. He is so amazingly careless in his writing, that it would endanger my reputation & the Public Good.

  Thursday. 14 Novr. [1782] (1) The proceedings were confined to the report of the Committee on the case of Vermont entered on the Journal.(2) As it was notorious that Vermont had uniformly disregarded the Recommendation of Congress of 1779, the report which ascribed the evils prevalent in that district to a late act of N. Y. which violated that recommendation was generally admitted to be unjust & unfair. Mr. Howel was the only member who openly supported it. The Delegates from N. Y. denied the fact that any violation had been committed on the part of that State. The temper of Congress on this occasion as the yeas & nays shew was less favorable to Vermont than on any preceding one--the effect probably of the Cession of N. York. In the course of the debate Mr. Howel cited the case of Kentucky as somewhat parallel to that of Vermont, said that the late erection of a separate Court by Virga. for the former resembled the issuing of Commissions by N. Y. to the latter,(3) that the jurisdiction would probably be equally resisted & the same violences would follow as in Vermont.

  Dear Sir. Philadelpa. Novr. 14th. 1782 Is it not the Duty of every sincere Friend to the State of Massachusetts, to examine with more Accuracy & Attention her territorial Interests, than has hitherto been done since the Commencement of the War? I apprehend we have a much fairer Opportunity now, to obtain a Just Decision of the Extent of our Country, than it was possible for us to have, whilst under the irresistable Controul of a Power that could say, thus far shall ye extend & no farther. Power & Policy dictated to Masstts. the most humiliating Submissions to unrighteous & arbitrary Decisions upon her Limits, Decisions destitute of every Principle of Justice, & if once admitted, would destroy every Idea of civil Society: for Compacts & Covenants the most solemnly entered into, would be vain & chimerical. Tho' it may not admit of positive Proof, I think no rational Person can doubt, that for many years previous to the War, the Policy of Great Britain was, to curtail & lessen the Influence of Masstts. as much as possible: Two of the neighbouring Provinces were much better calculated to answer the Views of arbitrary Power, than chartred Governments. Masstts., Rhode Island & Connecticut, could alone, in the thirteen United States, be properly so called. The first, from her Extent of Territory must one Day become formidable of herself, unless she could be reduced to a Tenth Part of her indisputable Boundaries: for it is evident that we do not exercise Jurisdiction over more than a Tenth of the Territory contained in the Indenture made by the Plymouth Company to Sir Henry  NOVEMBER 14, 1782  Roswell & others, which never was pretended to be annull'd or vacated. I am influenced to write respecting Territory, because since my Attendance in Congress, very tedious & disagreeable have been the Debates respecting the Newhampshire Grants.(1) Very much Time has been lost to very little Purpose. We cannot make them independent in Congress. We cannot obtain a Vote to receive them into the Union. What, in this Case, must be done? Shall we suffer that Tract of Country to be an Asylum to all those, who choose to avoid the Burthen of supporting our Independence? Who, in this point of View, will Experience so great a Diminution of its Citizens as Masstts.? It is in my Opinion greatly for our Interest that she should be independent or not immediately. Perhaps upon every Consideration, the last is most for our real Interest. For I cannot suppose Masstts. can wish for an Addition of a Number of small States in the Union. Upon the Principles of the present Confederation, they have a Share of Power much beyond what their Interest entitles them to: And I am perswaded that it was not possible to bring them to consent to proportion their Power by their Interest & Ability. The small States even now, watch the larger with a very Jealous Eye. And all of them unite in Favor of receiving more States into the Union. But I am more seriously impressd with the ill Policy of it on our Part, for many Reasons, than I have heretofore been. It is true that Nine States on the 20th of Augst. 1781 seemed to vote in Favor of the Independence of Vermont.(2) Whoever reads the Journals of Congress, will think that they were seriously in earnest about receiving them into the Union But Congress are much altered, & there must be a great Change, before Nine States can be obtain'd in their Favor. I begin to think there never will be, unless Vermont can make herself so formidable, as to become an Object of much higher Consideration than she seems to be at present. New York is using every conceivable Way to gain Ground in that Country. She protests solemnly as a State, against the Independence of Vermont; & denies the Power of Congress to make her so. Will Masstts. tamely suffer New York to establish civil & military government there, whilst Congress are in vain attempting to decide on a Question, which New York say is not submitted to them. Whilst the last are making as many Friends there as they can, you are rejecting them. This is in every View bad Policy, if the State mean to prosecute their Claim (in Case Vermont is not made independent) which I cannot doubt but they will do. You are not unacquainted with Charles Phelps or his Character at least:(3) he has been here several Weeks; & is one, among a Number of others, whose Property is confiscated & whom Vermont have banished from their State. Charles with two others formerly Inhabitants of Masstts. in a Petition to Congress, declared themselves to be Citizens of the State of New York. I was very well prepared to meet Charles from the Papers you had put into my Hands. I remonstrated to him, against his calling himself a Citizen of the State of New York; & told   him that 1 had his own Arguments in his Hand writing, to prove that, that Part of Vermont, where he lived, was within the indisputable Boundaries of Masstts.--that I was very sorry to find that he persisted in acting inconsistently. It must weaken all his Applications--But as to hurting his Reputation or Credit, I did not suppose it would, for it was too notorious that for a long Course of years, he had been playing himself off upon Newhampshire, Masstts. & New York: that every Body acquainted with his Negociations, must consider him as destitute of every Principle of Consistency. He said he did not know what Papers of his Writing, I might have--But he had not altered his Sentiments as to Masstts. having a clear Right to about fifty Townships in the Country of Vermont. He said he could not submit to the arbitrary Government of Vermont. Masstts. has refused to afford any Protection, she has rejected the People. But New York have not; They have a Claim, & are determined to defend it, & to succour all the People who will acknowledge themselves to be their Citizens. Where else, therefore, can I go but to New York. It is in vain for me to apply to Masstts. However inconsistent Charles may otherwise be, there is Weight in these Observations. They suggest to me that Masstts. ought to have adopted another Mode of Conduct with Respect to those People. If her Delegates in Congress had favoured their Independence, the State should not have rejected the People: for their Disaffection & consequently different Attachment may be a weighty Argument against you, whilst it gives an Ascendancy to the New York Interest. The local Position of the Country favors Masstts. much more than New York. We can either protect or subdue them, which, in her present Situation, the other cannot do. New York make a great Noise about the Resolutions of Congress of the 24th of Sepr. 1779 & the 2d of June 1780.(4) The first of these Resolutions, appears to me to be inconsistent with the Nature of civil Government: It contains a Recommendation both to the State of New York, & the People of Vermont to be peaceable: That neither exercise Jurisdiction over any, but such as chearfully submit to it. The Governor of New York has, within the six Months past, issued Commissions civil & military, without any Restrictions in those Commns. so that he has attempted to establish Government at large. The Legislative Power of Vermont knowing this, make a severe Law to imprison, conficate, & finally banish all such as deny their sovereign Authority. That Law has been executed with Rigor upon many Individuals. Charles was a Judge of an inferior Court under New York, the other two had military Commissions dated the 5th of last June. Whilst the East & West Wings, as they were call'd, continued united with Vermont, the very People now here supported it & would not have taken Commissions from any other State. But as soon as those Wings were cast off, these People cast off Vermont also; and knowing that New York, & no other State, would receive them, they resorted thither. But I believe there is no Doubt but they would have resorted to Masstts. as their Relations &   Acquaintances are all there, if the State would have countenanced them in Vermont. Upon the Principles of the aforesd. Resolution, the People may, as often as they please, change from New York to Vermont, & from Vermont to New York. If New York have not exceeded us in Policy, it is not for Want of any Care & Vigilance of theirs. They possess not only a great Fund of Intrigue, but it is accompanied with unremitted Zeal. New York whilst a royal Government, was moduled upon the Principles of Arbitrary, despotic Power. The Predominancy of british Interest in her Favor on this Account, was very apparent--& New York knew the Advantages of it well; which is a very plain Reason to me, why they appeared at first very cold, not to say opposed to seeking a Redress of Grievances, by the last Appeal. The sensible Men were nearly all, deeply interested in unreasonably large Grants of Land; & tho Truth & Justice were against them, must have considered, that with Britain they could have obtained their Point, & an immense Territory--But with America confederated, her uncertain vague & encroaching Pretensions must be examined with an Eye of Reason, which they will not bear. They could therefore but conclude, that their Interest was closely connected with Britain, & the Moment they relaxed from that hold, the Principles of Tyranny & Injustice would favor them no longer. New York had set their Eye & nearly their Foot, upon a Territory which would have one Day of itself bid Defiance to powerful Nations--very little exposed by Sea, she is by Nature caculated for the best Defence in the World. The Extent of Country which New York Claims, is vastly beyond what I had conceived--well might Doctr. Douglass in his Map published in the Year 1757 (5) Color about one third of the Continent for New York. The Territory claimed contains about one & Twenty Times as much Land, as the old Colonies of Masstts. & Plimouth in their present State. But New York have ceded to the united States all the Land westward of a Meridian Line to be drawn Twenty Miles Westward of Niagara Falls; confining themselves to a State that contains about Nine Times as much Land as the above mentioned Colonies. I am sorry to take up your Time by adding more to an unreasonably long Letter--But I have Just read several Passages in it to Genl. Lincoln. He charges me with being more of the Politician than he suspected. I dont know what he meant to convey by the Word Politician. I am sensible, some Things I have wrote should be perfectly confidential--those I confide to you not as maturely digested Sentiments. I did not doubt but you would consider them as such. I think notwithstanding the General's Charge, his Sentiments do not differ greatly from mine--to your Candor I submit the whole to be Judged & dispos'd of as you may think proper. Since writing the above, I happened to take up a Paper which contained Minutes, in a Hand writing well known.(6) They claim a Place   here, as they seem to confirm some of the Sentiments in this Letter. The Subject of those Minutes was the Report of a Commee. respecting Vermont. Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Howell & myself made the Report.(7) It was like a two edgd Sword. It grieved where Grief would answer a good Purpose, it vexed where Anger would answer a better. The Purport of the Report was this--That the Difficulties lately arisen in Vermont were probably occasioned by the Commissions issued by New York--that it be recommended to the State of New York to recall them--That Vermont make Restitution for Property confiscated, & permit the banished to return; & that, both Parties abide by the Resolution of the 24th of Sepr. 1779.(8) Mr. Duane told Mr. R____ he was very sorry to see his Name to such a Report. Mr. R. answered him with an independent Mind. The Minutes are as follows. 1. The Business has been before Congress near two Months. 2. The final Result is, throwing the whole Blame of the Disturbances on the State of New York. 3. When it is evident that N.Y. have in no Instance violated the Resolves of Congress, & the Vermonteers have not. 4. There is a Contradiction in the Report, first in recalling & then to adhere to the Resolve of the 24th Sepr. 5. The Evil complained of, did not arise from the Commissions how often before have they imposed &ca. 6. It is recommended to Vermont to suffer the banished to return--make Satisfaction to them--intimated Predicament. Quere--Will they Regard the advice? will they not triumph? will they not proceed to greater Excesses when they find Support in all their Measures? 7. It is needless to inform N. Y. of her Insignificancy in the Eyes of the United States as she has been sensible of it for a long Time. Nor to aggravate her by obliging her to call to Remembrance what the Tories told her in the Beginning (viz.) that the State would be over run by her Neighbours they now see the Truth of it. Had they known it before they never would have entered into the Controversy. 8. What Interest at present People can have to support Vermont I cannot tell. The Lands are secure. It must either be to pay no Taxes or procure another Vote to the Eastward. 9. The poor People who have been waiting so long are not only neglected but reprimanded as they have taken Commissions under N.Y. How could N.Y. exercise the Government allowed by the Resolve of the 24th of Sepr. without Officers. These poor People are not the Objects of Compassions. Two Indians the other day who had not suffered, were allowed two hundred Dollrs. to defray their Expences. N. any Violences committed against those Resolves a Breach of the Confederacy. June 2d. 1780 strictly enjoined to obey the above Resolves now after violating them, ' tis recommended to make Restitution: to suffer the   Banished to return.(9) New York will look upon this as an Insult; and Vermont will exult.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 15th. 1782. The inclosed (1) was written in haste in expectation of an opportunity to send it directly but as the person who now takes it by the way of Providence, does not set off ' til afternoon I snatch a moment to make some addition. News we have none more than the inclosed Paper contains. Congress have for several days been on the affair of Vermont, and upon the whole it appears that the present members will do nothing to their Advantage. I have it from the Friends of N.Y. That it is most probable--a new State will be finally formed on Connecticut River, its western line the Chain of Green Mountains and its eastern, they care not where--but I tho' t the Gentn might have imagined that N. Hampr. had its public feelings as well as NY--and would as much conceive themselves injured by a diminution of Territory as they.(2) I think it would not be amiss to suggest this to the Friends of N. Hampr. and let them know, that it is not improbable N.Y. Policy may, if Vermont is not supported in her present claims, set such a project on foot, in order to secure the lands West of the Mountains and on the Lakes, to themselves, at N. Hamp's. expence, and that (as the only sure means of preventing such an event,) it is the Policy of N. Hampr. to concede in the Clearest & most decided manner to Vermont's  NOVEMBER 15, 1782  Independence. Propositions I doubt not have passed between some individuals of your State & New York to divide Vermont between them by the highth of Land, but from what I can discover--it will be dangerous for N.H. to depend upon such a Division--and if NY agrees to it I think it must be with a view to effect a future division of your State. I am the more confirmed in this from the sentiments discoverable in the persons lately banished from Vermont, Viz. Phelps & his Companions--who are now in this City & are daily, & nightly, propagating every false & scandalous rumor, that malice can invent to injure the People of that Country, who have no agent or other person to contradict & oppose them. This man in particular has express'd himself clearly, on the subject, and altho he is now soliciting redress as an Inhabitant of the State of N.Y. yet is in heart for having the New State, on both sides of the River, and giving to N.Y. the Lands west of the Mountains, & as he is the Tool of the N.Y. Party so I have right to conclude he lets out the secret determinations of the Representatives of & sticklers for that state. I must therefore again repeat it that New Hampr. can be only safe in holding Jurisdiction to the River, but by having Vermont to its present Limits Independent. It may be suggested that Congress have guaranteed to N.Hampr. to the West bank of the River in their Resolution of the 7th Augt. 1781. I answer they have so, but it is a Conditional guarantee--and rests only on the acknowledgment of the Independence of Vermont; would it not be the wisest policy in [your] State to yield without reserve to the [indepen]dence of Vermont? This would imm[ediately?] render the conditional guarantee Absolu[te &] destroy the very source of future conten[tion] at a single stroke. Enough of Politics I beg you my dear Sir, to present my most sincere regards to Mrs. Cahoon, & the kind members of your good Family--& my regards to the other Families at Winchester--(including Col. Willard & Mrs. Hannah) and my Paternal regards to Lyndon--from whom I shall expect a Letter, as soon as you have opportunity to write me--and am with the most Perfect friendship, & regard, Your most huml Servt, Jona Arnold ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 15th Novem' r 1782.(1) I had some Reason to hope that a decisive Act might before this have passed respecting the district of the Grants; but as not more than eight States are now represented, and I am under an indispensable necessity of returning home speedily, I despair of it. I trust so entirely to your Excellency's Candour that I do not fear we shall be accused of Want of Zeal for our Jurisdiction, or respect for our official Instructions: every thing on our part has been urged to produce a Determination: but this business, clogged by the heavy pressure of eastern Influence, has always moved heavily. A wish to procrastinate still prevails; even the most candid are apprehensive of the Consequences of driving the Vermont Faction to despair and no Pains are spared by the interested to sound this Alarm and give it every possible Impression. There seems however no danger that many of the States will ever Vote for the Independance of Vermont. If Justice was out of the Question, there are political Obstacles of vast weight: and the favorable Change of our Circumstances entitle us to hope that we shall never again see the dangerous Crisis to which we were reduced when the p____s (2) Resolutions of the 20th of August 1781 unhappily took place. In the mean time the unhappy Sufferers from the late cruel Outrage demand our Compassion and our protection. A Report highly injurious to the Rights and the Honour of our State, fabricated by a Mass. and R. I. Delegate, was this moment rejected by all the States present, Rh. I. only excepted and New Hampshire divided.(3) It has served to shew a clear alteration of Sentiment, with respect to Vermont; and leaves an opening to introduce some Motion in favour of those our distressed and much injured Fellow Citizens: but nothing which promises salutary Effects can be hazarded in so thin a Congress. . . . Be pleasd...to hurry on Hamilton and Floyd my worthy Colleagues. Reprinted from Burnett, Letters, 6:541-42, from a document located in the New York State Library before the Albany fire of 1911. 1 Duane probably drafted this letter on November 14, the date Congress rejected the Vermont report which Duane indicates occurred \""this moment\"" and which is entered on the journals of the 14th.

  Dear Sir Philada. Novr. 15th. I send you as a peice of information of which you will be the best judge of the use to be made, an extract of a letter laid before Congress by the Secy. at War: Extract of a letter from Gl Irvine to the  Secy. at War dated, Fort Pitt Ocr. 28. 1782 (1) \""Short as the time is since the accounts came into this Country that the Savages were to be called in & restrained by the British, the people are in great numbers flocking over the Ohio into what has hitherto been called the Indian Country & are busy in taking up & improving lands as well on what is supposed to be within the bounds of Penna. as beyond the Western line thereof. From the avidity with which they act on this occasion & the industry used by some few to persuade the people to form new States, I am of opinion that unless Congress & the several States, (who have unsettled lands within their limits) immediately take measures for securing them neither the U. S. nor any particular State will reap much advantage from them. Notwithstanding I may be mistaken in this opinion yet I think it my duty to mention the matter. if you think it worthy the attention of Congress, you will doubtless inform them. I will write the Council of Penna. on this subject, as I have reason to think they hope to pay much debt with the lands west of the Ohio.\""(2) To this I may add a report that the inhabitants of this State West of the Alleghany Mountains are openly proceeding towards a separation of Govt. It is certain that they have for some time had such a scheme in contemplation. I have the honr. &c. J Madison ""

  Sir, Philada 17 Nov. 1782. Yours of 4 Inst. came to hand last evening by Dr P. Bowen. The rejection of the Impost by the Independant 54 is an event highly pleas- NOVEMBER 17, 1782  ing to me & will eventually redound to the credit of our State & I hope to the benefit of the whole Union.(1) That this important vote was passed after such a perfect understanding of the subject, with so much deliberation & with entire unanimity are circumstances which bid defiance to all future attempts from the advocates of that measure. I am sorry youd forgot to mention in yours the names of the Committee appointed to write a Letter to Congress on the Subject. Without knowing their names a suitable Letter cannot be written to them & after your next to me I fear it will be too late to address them. You will please to write them not to assign the withholding the Back Lands as a reason. That reason was better calculated to influence the State than to satisfy Congress--And besides, New-York cession of claims has been accepted & that business got into a good train. I wish to receive the Instructions you mention as soon as possible,(2) my stay being short.(3) The Load of ill will, jealousy & envy drawn on me, by the part I have taken in this affair has placed me in a very disagreable Situation. The approbation of the well informed & virtuous of my constituents in addition to that of my own Conscience has hitherto sustained me & is all I expect.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia 17 Nov. 1782. Yours of 29 Ult. came duly to hand by Dr P. Bowen, last evening. I hope, Sir, your apprehensions about the approaches of Tyranys  NOVEMBER 17, 1782  advancing upon us are removed in some measure by the decided conduct of our Independent House of Assembly. Long may the Independant 54 be remembred as the incorruptible Patriots of 1782! I am highly pleased with your Sentiments in regard to the propriety, tendencies & effects of the Impost (of execrable memory) I hope those worthy Sentiments may not only generally prevail in the present day but be transmitted to posterity. With this view I suppose you have undertaken the course of periodical publications you mention; I heartily wish you success in so good a cause. Was it in my power to aid you in the undertaking I should do it with pleasure. The printers here are not fond of republishing pieces against 5 per Cent. Some I have procured to be republished, & shall solicit a place for pieces in this way as opportunity & circumstance may permit & justify. You will see the Bayman, The Countryman & the 1st. No. of the Freeholder republished here.(1) I have attempted to get thoughts on 5 per Cent published here,(2) but they have not yet made their appearance in any papers I have seen; Several copies having been sent me, I dispersed them among the members of Congress by which means they have been generally reced. Some Gentlemen in this City highly approve of them & reprobate the Scheme of a revenue by a Continental impost in unequivocal terms. The Confederation is gaining credit. I wish much joy to the Rev'd Doctor on his intermarriage with such an agreiable Lady. His opinion about an impost shews that he once lived in New Port. You mention a curious speech of a member of Assembly in a neighboring State. That a Massachusetts-man should be willing to trust in God & Mr Morris is nothing strange. The Citizens of our State have always been used to think for themselves & act accordingly. By the 1,200,000 Dolrs tax the ice is broke. The intrest of our domestic debt is apportioned to the States. When we shall find ourselves able to pay any part of the principal, it ought to be done in the same way. A great national debt, national taxgatherers, national duty collectors & national Contstables would be national scourges & prove in the issue our national ruin. Dr Arnold joins me in the most respectful compliments to yourself & good Lady & am, Sir, your most obedient & very humble Servt, David Howell. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 17th November, 1782. I wrote you a few days ago,(1) but, as the Chief Justice is going to New Castle, it affords me an opportunity of conveying the latest public papers. News we have little that can be relied upon, except a person is come from General Green's camp, and says that the 10th of November was publicly fixed for the total evacuation of Charleston. Part of the stores, and some part of the garrison, and some of the inhabitants are sailed for St. Augustine. All the British, he asserts, are to go to New York, and the Hessians to Nova Scotia. It is said a vessel, arrived after a short passage from Jamaica, came to anchor at Sandy Hook, and the captain proceeded to New York. Immediately Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby called a council of war, which lasted nine hours, and then the captain of the vessel returned to it, and she immediately sailed. Some say that she went to the British fleet cruising near Gardner's Island, with orders for it to proceed immediately to Jamaica, as the governor of that island was very apprehensive of an immediate attack from a large force of French and Spaniards. This, I apprehend, is all conjecture, for I think the French and Spaniards would not diminish their European fleet until the fate of Gibraltar was decided. Indeed, it is alleged, but, I believe, without any the least probability, that it had surrendered to the besiegers. It is also asserted, upon better foundation, that Lord Howe had not departed from England, the 27th of September; if so, it affords some grounds to suppose that the garrison of Gibraltar could not long resist the very powerful attack of the French and Spanish army by sea and land. The settlers to the westward of the Alleghany Mountain have declared that the country within that space is independent of Pennsylvania, and they are fast settling the lands westward of the river Ohio. This important circumstance was communicated to Congress and the government of Pennsylvania on Friday last, and the Council and Assembly of this State, and [they will] have a conference upon this intelligence to-morrow.(2) Many, of both bodies, are of opinion that this State would be large enough if it was confined to the Alleghany Mountain, and it would be wisdom to acquiesce in the proposition of an independent State, if it was founded upon the admission of the rights  NOVEMBER 17, 1782  of such as have just claim. Congress could now decide the measures of the new government; but, if the affair is neglected for any length of time, it will be as unmanageable as that of Vermont, which has been and will be fruitful of much vexation to the National Council. Our friend, the President of this State,(3) is extremely desirous of having an interview with you, and therefore has desired me to write to you and know whether you would be so obliging as to give him a meeting at Chester, some day, in about a fortnight or a few days later, as he wishes much to talk to you upon some important matters. He proposes to stay only one night at Chester, and the next day to return, in order that you may not be detained longer than one night from your family. I must desire you to do me the favor of giving me an answer, by Mr. McKean, to this request, and that you would fix the day of meeting, and place, if any should be more agreeable to you than Chester, somewhere not far from it, in this State. My wife and children desire to be affectionately remembered to Mrs. Read, and your children. I am, most sincerely, your faithful friend, Samuel Wharton. MS not found; reprinted from William T. Read, Life and Correspondence of George Read (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1870), pp. 373-74. 1 See Wharton to Read, November 10, 1782. 2 The Pennsylvania assembly voted on November 19 to send \""one or two proper persons\"" to their western counties \""to bring over our deluded fellow Citizens to a proper sense of their Duty.\"" On the following day the assembly passed an act declaring any attempt to organize a new state within Pennsylvania's boundaries to be \""an act of high-treason.\"" See Pa.

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Novr. 17. 1782.(1) By the last Post (2) I transmitted to your Excellency a Copy of a Report (relative to the New Hampshire Grants) which has since been taken up, and the inclosed Copy of the Journals will shew how far Proceedings have been had thereon.(3) Only Seven States being present, and Rhoad Island being determined to push a Decision on the second Resolve, and perhaps to give it a Negative, without any Amendment or suffering it to be committed, we were under the Necessity of calling for an adjournment, between one & Two oClock, which succeeded. Since that Day we have not been able to make a Congress, but tis expected Tomorrow or next Day Eight or Nine States will be represented, when we shall endeavour a Substitute for, or an amendment to the second Resolution, which is so cold & pusalanimous, that  NOVEMBER 17, 1782  should it pass in its present form I fear it would do more hurt than good. I must however confess that I have but little Expectation that any decisive Resolution can be obtained by which the sufferers in Cumberland will be protected, and a Restoration made of the Property taken from them. We do not think there is any Necessity of Majors Shattuck & Evans tarrying longer in this expensive Place. They are already in Debt about Twenty Pounds more than they have money to pay and will want a Sum to carry them on to Poughkipsie. We having no money of our own more than our Necessities require, with the advise of Mr Rosevelt we have presumed to draw on your Excellency in favour of Colo Wardsworth, for One Hundred Dollars, which he has advanced to us for the Purpose of Paying the Debts of these People here & to enable them to return. I trust the State will approve of this proceeding as well as your Excellency. We could not see those unhappy People who had suffered so much before, be now confined for so small a Sum. They have been very prudent in respect to Expences and have behaved with great Propriety. Mr Phelps also must have some of this Money to enable him to get out of Town. Colo Wardsworth thinks it probable that his Agents may now be indebted to the State for Flower, or that they may be glad to make a Discount for this Order (a Copy of which is inclosed). We have nothing New more than Mr. Rosevolt will inform. ' tis generally beleived that Charles Town is evacuated, but no authentic Intelligence of such an Event is yet received; ' tho it is daily expected. We expect Colos. Floyd & Hambleton will be in Town in a few Days when we shall return. If they are necessarily detained, we shall return as soon as we know what Measures will be taken in respect to the New Hampshire Grants. I have the Honor to be with the most respectful attachment Your Excellencys most Humble Servt. Ezra LHommedieu P.S. I am now credibly informed that the State of Rhode Island by a unanimous Vote of the Assembly have disagreed to the Impost of 5 per Cent. which will much embarris the United States in their Finances.

This will be handed to you by Mr. Randell, a merchant formerly of  NOVEMBER 18, 1782  New-York; he is recommended to me by His Excellancy the present President of Congress as a friend to his Country: As such permit me to introduce him to your acquaintance, which he has warmly sollicited. I have little news to communicate, and the sudden departure of the Bearer prevents your knowing what there is from me, but I shall refer you to him. You have no doubt learnt that the Enemy long since evacuated Savannah in Georgia; you may believe they have done the same by Charlestown about the Beginning of this month, tho' we as yet have no official or certain account of it. New-York is still in their possession, but we have just heard they are at present in great consternation there; the cause we can scarce form a conjecture about. Our army is better cloathed, better disciplined, in better spirits and more effective than at any period of the war; Congress is still composed of virtuous men; and the people in general are such as you wish them to be. Money seems to be our greatest want, and salutary steps are prosecuting concerning it; I flatter myself funds will soon be established sufficiently productive for the public exigences, but if this should in part fail, we must rely somewhat on our Allies, our industry, oeconomy & integrity. We long to hear from you, having received no official Accounts from Europe since the 5th Septemr. The last was from Mr. Laurens. His most amiable son, Lieut. Colo.

  Sir Philadelphia November 18t 1782 Inclosed is the Copy of a Letter that is just handed Congress by the Secretary at War.(1) You will excuse me for not having made a fairer Copy of it. The Communications of this week are not in my Tower [Tour] of Duty, but lest Mr. Nash should over look it I have sent the Inteligence as it occurs; If the assembly should sit on this season possibly this Letter may overtake them, if so I hope they will turn their attention to the Western Country; those lands are certainly in a very critical situation. The spirit of migration prevails to a high in these middle States and the Spirit of making new States is become epedemic. It is certain that many of the small states or at least many of the Inhabitants of those States encourage that spirit. They look with an  NOVEMBER 18, 1782  envious eye on the large States & wish to make us all of the Pigmy breed. The assembly of this State have just received accounts that the Inhabitants in General over the Allegany Mountain are disposed to declare themselves Independent. There is the utmost reason to believe that the People of Vermont & their abettors in the minor States are endeavouring to persuade the People in General on the Western Waters to revolt. A Petition was some time ago handed to Congress said to be from some People on the back of Virginia, praying to be erected into a State.2 On enquiry there was much reason to believe that the Petition did not originate in the Western Country & it is doubted whether three of these People had ever seen it. Having mentioned those facts, I flatter myself that you will think with me That the utmost attention is required by our State to prevent if possible any bad impressions from being made on the Citizens of the State on the Western Waters. The Spirit of our Government is so moderate & the general disposition of the Western Inhabitants is so good that I am at least convinced that our subjects will be among the last who will run riot. As the State has shewn &, I am persuaded ever will shew the utmost Inclination to gratify their wishes & provide for the Regular administration of Justice among them.

  My dear Sir Philada. Novr. 19th. 1782. I find by your favor of the 8th that your occupation with the Courts has continued to be a bar to the completion of the Cypher.(1) It is very little missed however on my part as yet, the scantiness of intelligence being still unremoved. We have indeed reports without stint, but they are often most frequent when they have least foundation. Such of them as have the best title to notice, will be found in the newspapers. The proceedings of Congress for a week past have been equally unproductive of epistolary matter. For one half of the time we have failed in making a House, and the remaining half has been spent on minute objects. Col. Bland set out on friday last.(2) He carried with him an official notification to Mr. J____n of his reappointment. I wrote to the latter, informing him of an excellent passage if he could be ready for it in about a month, but urging a previous visit to this place as indispensable.(3) Altho' strictly speaking such a visit may not be essential, since the commission & instructions referred to in his appointment are at  NOVEMBER 19, 1782  the place of his destination, yet, I wish him to be made sensible of the salutary information which may here be added to them. Col. Bland also carried to the Govr. an extract of a letter from Genl. Irwin at Fort Pitt, which displays in full colours the avidity of the Western people for the vacant lands & for separate Govts.(4) On this subject Richmond I suppose will afford better information. I take for granted that every material article of it, with the steps taken by the legislature with respect to Western affairs in general, will fall within your correspondence. The prospect derived from the impost of 5 Per Ct. seems to be pretty thoroughly blasted by a unanimous & final veto by the Assembly of Rhode Island.(5) This State by its Delegates (who fully represent the aversion of their Constituents to the impost) voted in Congress that 6 million of Dollars were necessary for the year 83, that 2 Million were as much as the States could raise & as ought to be required by Congress, and that applications for loans in Europe ought to be relied on for the residue.6 And yet they absolutely refuse the only fund which could be satisfactory to lenders. The indignation against this perverse sister is increased by her shameful delinquency in the constitutional requisitions. The Tribunal erected for the controversy between Connecticut & Pennsa. was I hear to be opened today.(7) The Judges who compose it are Mr. Whipple of N. Hamshire, Mr. Arnold of Rhode Island, the Chief Justice & another gentlemn. of N. Jersey & Mr. C. Griffin of Virga. Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Jones & Genl Nelson have declined the service. On the part of Penna. appear Mr. Wilson, Mr Reed, Mr. Bradford & Mr. Sergeant. Mr. Osburne assists in the capacity of Solicitor. On the part of Connecticut are deputed Mr. Dyer, Mr. Root, & Docr. Saml. Johnson. The first & the last I am told are on the spot. It is supposed that the first object of Cont. will be to adjourn the cause to a distant day on the plea that many of their essential documents are beyond the Atlantic. In a national view it is not perhaps advisable to invalidate the title of this State however defective it may be, untill a more important controversy is terminated. I will make the earliest communication of the issue of this trial. You will not forget a like promise which your letter makes with respect [to] the case lately decided by the Court of Appeals.(8) Mr. Jones ventured yesterday for the first time since his relapse, into Congress. The Representation of Virga. untill a reinforcement arrives will be precarious. Can you give me no encouragement on this occasion from your own purposes? ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 19th. 1782 The pretended territorial Limits & Boundaries of the several States will be a Source of no small Difficulty & Dispute. The constant Object of the small States will be, to lessen the Extent of the great ones. Will any then in the small States be disinterested Judges in Case they should be appointed conformably to the Confederation, to sit in Judgment upon the Limits of a large State? Should, for Instance, Masstts. claim a great Part of the Territory of Country, that N. York has ceded to the confederated States, which Cession Congress or seven States say is accepted; how can she obtain a fair Decision? Not only New York, but all the States, who were in favor of that Acceptance, will be against us, from interested Motives. I see but one Way whereby Masstts. can bring back the States to an Equilibrium: which is for Masstts. to cede all the Land between their North & South Boundaries, Beginning Westward at the Missisippi & extending Eastward about Two hundred Miles farther than the Cession of N. York. This would leave a very large Extent of Territory to N. York & would probably be an effectual Plan to oust them, as it would be a strong Lure to the small States. It would be difficult for them with all their Policy to combat Interest. But would this be a political Measure for Masstts.? If the Chance is against her gaining Ground in that Country, it would be unwise to be at any Expence about it. But if, notwithstanding, she could throw a large Tract of Territory into the Hands of the United States to be appropriated for the Discharge of the public Debt: The Question then with Masstts. must turn upon two Considerations first, What Probability there is, that such a Fund will be productive--& secondly, whether Policy points out any Necessity of restricting New York within smaller Limits. I think it is not to be questioned, but N. York will immediately Proceed to locate the Lands now contained in their assumed Boundaries, which will not be in Favor of Masstts. NOVEMBER 19, 1782  It is well known that Maryland refused to confederate for several years, because that she had no Security that she should enjoy her due Proportion of the vacant Lands within the united States. Congress to obviate this Difficulty, earnestly recommended to the several States having or claiming vacant Lands, to make liberal Cessions to the united States. Virginia, N. York & Connecticut made Cessions. New York Cession was signed & executed by the Delegates of that State in Congress, the same Day that the Delegates of Maryland signed the Confederation--but was not accepted by Congress, till last October. Then a Question arose whether Congress could by the Confederation accept of the Cession of any State. Upon this, one of the Maryland Delegates(1) made the following Observations to me. Maryland refused to confederate, till Congress recommended as above, upon the Strength or expected Success of that Recommendation, she confederated, & took the Risque of the States making Cessions upon herself. If they had made none, she would not have been released from her Obligation. But if Cessions are made, & Congress determine that they have no Power to accept of them--Maryland is not then bound by the Confederation--for Congress know what their Objections were against confederating, (those Objections are now in the Secretary's Office) & took proper Measures to remove them. But if they will not carry those Measures thro, Maryland is not to be bound by what she has done. It was not intimated to me that Maryland would withdraw in Case Congress should reject the Idea of Cessions, but only that they would have a clear Right so to do. I am not so clear in the Matter myself. I am, dear Sir, Your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

It seems to be the prevailing Opinion that our Enemy Intend to relinquish the Idea of carrying on the War on this Continent, perhaps with Intentions to prosecute it with more Vigor against our Allies.

[1782](1) Congress went into consideration of the Report of A Committee consisting of Mr. Carrol, Mr. McKean & Mr. Howel on two Memorials  NOVEMBER 20, 1782  from the Legislature of Pennsylvania.(2) The Memorials imported a disposition to provide for the Creditors of the U. S. within the State of Pena. out of the Revenues allotted for Congress, unless such provision could be made by Congress. The Report as an answer to the Memorials acknowledged the merit of the public Creditors, professed the wishes of Congress to do them justice; referring at the same time to their recommendation of the Impost of 5 PerCt. which had not been acceded to by all the States; to the requisition of 1,200,000 Drs. for the payment of one years interest on the public debt; and to their acceptance of the territorial cession made by N. Y. After some general conversation in which the necessity of the Impost as the only fund on which loans could be expected & the necessity of loans to supply the enormous deficiency of taxes, were urged, as also the fatal tendency of the plan intimated in the memorials, as well to the union itself, as to the system actually adopted by Congress, the Report was committed.(3) A motion was made by Mr. R____g____e, 2ded. by Mr. W____m____s__n (4) to instruct the committee to report the best mode of liquidating the domestic debts, and of obtaining a valuation of the land within the several States, as the Art. of Confederation directs. The first part of the instruction was negatived, provision having been previously made on that head. In place of it the Superintendt. of Finance was instructed to report the causes which impede that provision. (5) The 2d. part was with[d]rawn by the mover. A committee however was afterwards appointed, consisting of Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Nash, Mr. Duane, Mr. Osgood & Mr. Madison, to report the best scheme for a valuation.(6) ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Novr. 20th. 1782 Yesterday the Report of the Committee on the Allowance to be made to Governor Hancock was before Congress--it was postponed at my Request. The Allowance reported, you may remember, is about 2000 Dollrs. I wish you could give me some Information on this Matter.(1) We have now no Court of Appeals in the united States. Mr. Paca is appointed Governor of Maryland & has accepted the Appointment. I shall write you more on this Head hereafter.(2) We are in suspense about Gibralter. Captn. Decatur Arrived here the 18th in 28 Days from Teneriffe--and says that Letters recd. in that Island from Cadiz mention that Gibralter surrendered the 17th of September--But less Credit is to be given to this News, as the Ship Alexander arrived with you, left L' Orient the first of October & had not heard of the Surrender, which Mr. Marboise, thinks must have been the Case if the Surrender had taken Place on the 17th of Sepr.--he says the News must have arrived at Paris in six or seven Days at farthest. It is reported in New York that the Surrender is made, & it is said there is considerable Confusion in the City, but whether it arises from the Surrender of Gibralter, or from the Marquis Bouille's having saild for the West Indies with seven or Eight thousand Troops which is said to be true--is uncertain. A short Time will give us the Truth of the Report. I recd. a Letter from Doctr. Holten this Week--in which he informs me that he expects to be here with Mr. Gorham by the middle of December next.(3) I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

  Sir, Philadelphia November 20th. 1782. I did myself the Honor of writing to the Council and House of Assembly on the of last Month, and advised Them, That Congress had accepted the Cession of New York;(1) flatter myself these honorable Bodys received that Communication before They adjourned. On the seventeenth Instant, I was favoured with the Commands of the two Houses, conveyed to Me by Mr. Booth, in a Letter dated the 6th of this Month. In the Absence of my Colleagues, I acquainted the president and several Members of Congress, with the purport of the joint Resolutions of the Council and Assembly, and they were of Opinion That their Desire was reasonable, and That it would be best to delay presenting the Resolutions; and moving, That the State of Delaware should be credited by the United States with the Money &c. furnished the Officers & Soldiers of the Delaware Regiment, Until your Delegates were possessed of the Account of particulars. If you approve, Sir, of this Measure, I beg leave to solicit the Favor of You to direct the State Treasurer to transmit to your Delegates an Account, as expressed in the second Resolution of the honorable Council and Assembly, dated the 31st of October 1782.(2) Congress is yet without any Advices from their Ministers in Europe, and remain uninformed of the real Intention of the British, in Respect to the Evacuation of Charles Town; But from Circumstances, They are disposed to think that Event has taken place. The State of Rhode Island has refused to comply with the earnest Recommendation of Congress, relative to the five per Centum Duty upon Foreign imported Goods &ca., although (3) all the States have vested the United States in Congress assembled, with the power of levying that Duty for the purpose of discharging the principal and Interest of the National Debts already contracted, or which may be contracted, On the Faith of the United States, for supporting the present War. The Assembly of Rhode Island, I hear, ground their principal Objection against passing such a Law for the above End, upon the Clause in the 8th Article of the Confederation, which provides, That \""a common Treasury shall be supplied by the several States in proportion to the Value of all Land within each State granted to, or surveyed for any Person, as such Land, and the Buildings and Improvements thereon shall be estimated\"" &ca. Effective Taxes upon real Property, Experience has taught every Citizen of the United States, are extremely burdensome, and difficult to collect, and at the same Time not sufficiently productive, nor paid with that Exactitude, necessary for the pressing and constant Demands of the Financier, exclusive of those of the very urgent and  NOVEMBER 21, 1782  distressed Creditors of the Union. Besides How is the Credit of of the United States to be maintained with our domestick Friends, and Foreigners, and How improbable is it, That The Latter will lend their Money when They know, That the United States have not a Power in Themselves to inforce the Collection of any, not Even sufficient to pay the Interest of the Money, which They may lend? If the Refusal of Rhode Island continues, and it is too probable it will, I fear the most unhappy Consequences will result from their unseasonable Pertinacity. I have the Honor to be, with great Respect, & Consideration, Sir, Your most Obedient and most humble Servant. Saml. Wharton ""

  Thursday Novr. 21. [1782] A report was made by a Committee to whom had been referred several previous reports & propositions, relative to the salaries of foreign Ministers, delivering it as the opinion of the Committee that the Salaries allowed to Ministers Plenipo. to wit £2500 Sterlg. would not admit of reduction; but that the Sal. allowed to Secretaries to legations, to wit £1000 Sterlg. ought to be reduced to £500. This Committee consisted of Mr. Duane, Mr. Izard & Mr. Madison, the last of whom disagreed to the opinion of his colleagues as to the reduction of the £25,00 allowed to Ministers Plenipoy.(1) Agst. a reduction it was argued that not only justice, but the dignity of the U. S. required a liberal allowance to foreign Servants; that gentlemen who had experienced the expence of living in Europe did not think that a less sum would be sufficient for a decent style; and that in the instance of Mr. A. L. the expences claimed by him & allowed by Congress exceeded the fixed salary in question. In favor of a reduction were urged the poverty of the U. S. the simplicity of Republican Governments, the inconsistency of splendid allowances to Ministers whose chief duty lay in displaying the wants of their constituents and soliciting a supply of them: and above all, the policy of reconciling the army to the oeconomical arrangements imposed on them, by extending the reforms to every other Department. The result of this discussion was a referance of the Report to another Committee consisting of Mr. Williamson, Mr. Osgood & Mr. Carroll.(2) A motion was made by Mr. Howel, 2ded by Mr. Arnold, recommending to the several States, \""to settle with & satisfy at the charge of the U. S. all such temporary corps as had been raised by them respectively with the approbation of Congress.\"" The repugnance which  NOVEMBER 22, 1782  appeared in Congress to go into so extensive & important a measure at this time, led the mover to withdraw it.(3) A motion was made by Mr. Madison, seconded by Mr. Jones, \""That the Secy of F. Affairs be authorized to communicate to Forn. Ministers who may reside near Congress, all such articles of Intelligence recd. by Congress as he shall judge fit, & that he have like authority with respect to acts & Resolutions passed by Congress; reporting nevertheless the communications which in all such cases he shall have made. [\""]4 It was objected by some that such a Resolution was unnecessary, the Secy. being already possessed of the authority; it was contended by others that he ought previously to such communication, to report his intention to do so; others again were of opinion that it was unnecessary to report at all. The motion was suggested by casual information from the Secy. that he had not communicated to the French Minister the reappointment of Mr. Jefferson, no act of Congress having empowered or instructed him to do so.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Novr. 22d 1782 I have not been able to get time to write, till it is so late, that I have but little Heart for the Business. My Rib with her Cavalcade arrived here last Evening abt. 7 oClock, where I had been waiting for two or three Evenings hearkening to the Noise of every Carriage that passed. I am under great Obligations to you for all your Labours of Love, in aiding them off. I am glad to hear that you are not much troubled with Horned Cattle with you, & especially that Hanny is so fortunate, as to get rid of such dangerous Animals, before she comes to a Town where they are tolerable plenty. So much for Horned Cattle. Hanny informs me that, one Cow is to be sent down to Pangburn, the other two was to be left with you. The oldest Colt, Hanny says Mr. Price offered £20 for. I beg you will let him have it & take his Bond for the money (unless he can pay the Cash) payable in a reasonable Time with interest. The Mare Colt is half Elisha's and as I have kept her now  NOVEMBER 22, 1782  3½ Years, Josey must carry her to him and leave her there. The Young Colt must also be sent to Elisha & he must agree with Mr Burrows to keep him for me. The two Horses I know not what to do with them--I am swamped. If you can sell either of them for £25, or both for double the Sum, do take it. I should wish Josey to go home to his Mother, if these affairs were all settled, but I must leave this to you. As to the fat Cow, Hogs, Corn &c do with them as you Please, what you do not want, sell for the best Price in Cash you can including the Hay also--but sell a Stack of the Hay at a Time, least it should be spoiled, what remains of a Stack I mean. If the Horses cannot be disposed of, I wish Elisha to get some Person to take them at a certain Price but to keep them well--but don't let them go till you know something certain about them; as some Persons are easily imposed on. Hanny left a Box of Sweet meats behind. These with the Japanned Tea Waiter & my Camp Candlesticks which are in the Chest of Drawers upstairs (Jude knows them) we beg to be sent by the first safe Conveyance. As to Cent per Cent, he means to take you in. I suspect if you attempt to withdraw your Cash, he will alter his Tone. Much more may be made of the money, by lending if a Person who understood it was here--but his offer is better than nothing. The sending for the goods would be no bad Scheme, unless Peace was at Hand, which I still hope & expect. I believe you will be obliged to come here for Instructions at last--there begins now a Clamour to know why the Commrs do not go on--and it is alledged here that the Salary is not high enough. Mr F____ pays nothing, at which am much surprised, wish you would write him very pressingly. I fear it is in a bad way, and yet it is almost impossible. My kind Love to Mrs. P. & Johnny. Patty sends Love &c as do all the rest. As to the Hay you engaged to take at the Buildings, that may remain there as tho' you had never said any thing about it, as I never mentioned it to any Body--this can be done as you please. I scarcely know what I write. I am my Dr Sir, Yours most Afftly Elias Boudinot [P.S.] Remember me particularly to Capt Dennis, Mr Livingston & Capt. Prince. Young Mr Ludlow told Hanny if I would take his Bond for the Money, he would give me £30 for Sukeys Mare, if he agrees to it he shall have her, but would rather he took the young Horse.(1) ""

  Friday Novr. 22. [1782] A considerable time previous to this date a letter had been recd. by Congress from Mr. H. Laurens informing them of his discharge from captivity, and of his having authorised in the British Ministry, an expectation that Earl Cornwallis sd. in return be absolved from his parole.(1) Shortly after a letter from Docr. Franklin informed Congress that at the pressing instance of Mr. L. and in consideration of the offer of Genl Burgoyne for Mr. L. by Congress, as well as the apparent reasonableness of the thing, he had executed an instrument setting Cornwallis at liberty from his parole, untill the pleasure of Congress should be known. These papers had been committed to Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Mongomery & Mr. M[adison] who reported in favor of the ratification of the measure, against the opinion however of Mr. R. the first member of the Committee.(2) The Report after some discussion had been recommitted & had lain in their hands, untill being called for, it was thought proper by the Committee to obtain the sense of Congress on the main question whether the act sd. be ratified or annulled; in order that a report might be made correspondent thereto.(3) With this view a motion was this day made by Mr. M[adison], 2ded. by Mr. Osgood that the Committee be instructed to report a proper act for a ratification of the measure.(4) In support of this motion it was alledged, that whenever a public minister entered into engagements without authority from His Sovereign, the alternative which presented itself was either to recall the Minister, or to support his proceedings, or perhaps both; that Congress had by their Resolution of day of refused to accept the resignation of Mr. L. and had insisted on his executing the office of a Minister Plenipo. and that on the day of they had rejected a motion for suspending the said Resolution;(5) that they had no option therefore but to fulfil the engagement entered into on the part of that Minister; that it would be in the highest degree preposterous to retain him in so dignified and confidential a service, and at the same time stigmatize him by a disavowal of his conduct and thereby disqualify him for a proper execution of the service; that it was improper to send him into negociations with the Enemy under an impression of supposed obligations; that this reasoning was in a great degree applicable to the part which Docr.  NOVEMBER 22, 1782  Franklin had taken in the measure; that finally the Marquis de la Fayette, who in consequence of the liberation of Cornwallis had undertaken an exchange of several officers of his family, would also participate in the mortification; that it was overrating far the importance of Cornwallis, to sacrifice all these considerations to the policy or gratification of prolonging his captivity. On the opposite side it was said that the British Govt. having treated Mr. L. as a Traytor not as a Prisoner of war, having refused to exchange him for Genl Burgoyne, and having declared by the British Genl at N. York that he had been freely discharged, neither Mr. L. nor Congress could be bound either in honor or justice to render an equivalent; and that policy absolutely required that so barbarous an instrumt. of war, and so odious an object to the people of the U. S. should be kept as long as possible in the chains of captivity; that as the latest advices rendered it probable that Mr. L. was on his return to America, the commission for peace would not be affected by any mark of disapprobation which might fall on his conduct; that no injury could accrue to Docr. Franklin, because he had guarded his act by an express reservation for the confirmation or disallowance of Congress; that the case was the same with the Marquis de la Fayette; that the declaration agst. partial exchanges6 untill a Cartel on national principles sd. be established wd. not admit even an exchange antecedt. thereto. These considerations were no doubt with some the sole motives to their respective votes. There were others however who at least blended with them, on one side, a personal attachment to Mr. L. and on the other, a dislike to his character, and a jealousy excited by his supposed predilection for G. B., by his intimacy with some of the new Ministry, by his frequent passing to & from G. B. by the eulogiums pronounccd on him by Mr. Burke in the House of Commons, and by his memorial whilst in the Tower to the Parliamt. The last consideration was the chief ground on which the motion had been made for suspending the resolution which requested his continuance in the Commission for peace. In this stage of the business a motion was made by Mr. Duane, 2ded. by Mr. Rutlidge to postpone the consideration of it; which being lost, a motion was made by Mr. Williamson to substitute a Resolution declaring that as the B. Govt. had treated Mr. L. with so unwarrantable a rigor & even as a Traitor, and Cornwallis had rendered himself so execrable by his barbarities, Congress could not ratify his exchange.(7) An adjournment was called for in order to prevent a vote with so thin & divided a house.(8) ""

  Dear Sir. Philadelphia Novr. 23d. 1782 We have this Week had Debates in Congress upon two Subjects of great Importance; I flatter myself, that some of the Observations contained in this Letter, will not be unacceptable. One, was the Necessity of a speedy Liquidation of the Accounts of the several States with the united States. The other was, respecting the Mode prescribed by the Confederation, to ascertain what proportion each State in the Union ought to bear in the Requisitions for Money. The Debates arose upon the Report of a Committee upon a Memorial of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, respecting Interest due on public Securities. To satisfy the State, the Committee observed, That Congress had taken Measures to obtain an Impost, That they had lately accepted the Cession of Land from New York--And as to the Liquidation & Adjustment of Accounts, they referred the State to the Act of Congress of the 20th of Feby. last. This Report was attacked from several Quarters, but from none so warmly as from South Carolina. Mr. Rutledge observed, that the first Thing taken Notice of, could afford no Satisfaction to the State; for we had not obtain'd the Impost; & if we had, the Amount of it must be appropriated to the Discharge of the Interest on the foreign Loans. Those Loans must be placed on safe Ground. Our Honor & future Interest will require it. As to an Impost, he lik'd it very well in this View. But what does it signify to be constantly talking about an Impost--& placing our whole Dependence upon it? have not Rhode Island lately declared unanimously that they will not grant it? & consequently no State has granted it. As to the accepted Cession of Land, it was an idle chimerical Notion, to suppose that, that would afford any Hope or Satisfaction to our Creditors. He had no Faith in it: It would prove to be nothing, but another South Sea, or Mississippi Scheme. Besides, what Right have those to the Land who made the Cession. It is my clear Opinion, that they have none at all. Why should we deceive ourselves, by hoping or expecting any Aid from it--surely we ought not. NOVEMBER 23, 1782  As to referring the Assembly to the Act of Congress of the 20th of Feby. they were already possess'd of it. But it will not to do to pass over this Matter so lightly. We must know the Reason why the Intention of that Act is frustrated. It is in vain to tell us that Commissioners cannot be obtained for fifteen hundred Dollars per Year to go to the several States & liquidate the Accounts. But if they cannot, (which I cannot suppose to be the Case) the Accounts must be adjusted & the Act must be made more effectual. This is the first Thing to be attended to. It is the general Complaint of a great Number of the States, that they have large Accounts against the Continent unadjusted. This Adjustment is absolutely necessary, as we cannot provide Funds for our Debts, till we know the Amo. of them. The Obstructions therefore, must be examined into & removed immediately. The next Step is to ascertain the Proportions of the several States according to the 8th Article of the Confederation. Why is this only constitutional Mode of calling for Money delayed? It is true that some Part of some of the States, is in the Hands of the Enemy. But it is probable, that a Part of New York only, will be so in a short Time. But if it was otherwise, it is no Reason for our not pursuing the Mode pointed out to us. It is the only sure Ground on which we can stand. It is said not to be a good Mode. But will the States unanimously alter it? No they will not. What can Congress then do? Nothing but to pursue the Plan prescribed to them. When they have obtained a Valuation of the States, & the Amount of the Debts due to their own Citizens, they can call for the requisite Sums of Money with Authority. Here they stand on safe Ground And I have no doubt either of the Ability or Intention of the United States, to discharge all their Debts honestly. It is in vain to think to force the smallest State in the Union into Measures which they dislike. The Confederation has not given to Congress an Impost, Excise, or Pole Tax. Nor can they speak authoritatively on these Matters to the States. There will be many Difficulties undoubtedly in obtaining a Just Valuation of the States--and I am of Opinion, that a better & much easier Mode, would have been, to have made Numbers the governing Rule of Proportion, including Whites & Blacks; there is no good Reason why Blacks should not be included. But there is only one Way left us--& notwithstanding it is attended with Difficulties, I don't conceive them insurmountable. We must make the Attempt, & I have no doubt we shall succeed, so far as to obtain a Valuation. It may not be a true one; perhaps this is impossible in the Nature of Things--But we must at all Events obtain the best we can. These Observations are so nearly conformable to my own Sentiments, that I thot it better to give you the Purport of Mr. R's than my own. He appears to me very liberal & disinterested.  The Report of the Committee was recommitted, in order to remove the Obstructions in the Way of a speedy Settlement of Accounts. A Committee was appointed to Report a Plan for taking a Valuation. Whilst this Matter was debating, I tho' t I discovered an Indifference in some of the Members towards a speedy Liquidation of Accounts. The first Part of the Motion was, to Report a more effectual Mode for the Settlement of Accounts. This was opposed & negatived. The other Part of the Motion, being a Direction to the Committee to Report a Plan for taking a Valuation. Mr. R. withdrew it. He said he wanted no Valuation, if there was to be no Adjustment of Accounts. This bro' t about an Accommodation. The first was recommitted; & the second was committed. I am on the last, & have been enquiring for the Laws of Massatts. to see our Valuation Acts but cannot find them. They know very little about such Acts this Way. I am induced to beleive that the 8th Art. of the Confederation is favourable to Masstts. provided we can obtain a Valuation as nearly Right,1 as we have Reason to expect. A View of the Number of Square Miles in each State will enable you to form a Judgment upon the same Principles that I do. But whether the Rule is equal or unequal, is not the Question. It is the only Rule & we shall obtain no other, unless upon a fair Experiment it is clearly found to be altogether inadequate to our national Purposes. It is as preposterous, as vain & triffling, to be constantly exclaiming against the Confederation, because it has not vested Congress with a Power of Taxing & coercing &ca. Let us try it's full Strength before we pass a hasty Judgment upon it. Altho the Powers are not competent to all Things--Time may discover such latent Powers in the Confederation, as may in vain be wished to be altered. I have taken considerable Pains to collect from the Maps, the Extent of the several States in the Union. I find the Claims of the united States make a Square of Eight hundred & forty two Miles on every Side. In this View, I think it is as near the Truth as can be expected. The Sum total of the following Number of Square Miles set against the several States &ca will give a Territory of the above Dimentions. Square Miles New Hampshire 10,425 21(2) 403 Old Colonies of Masstts. & Plymouth 8,750 as now limited Eastern Country 20,000 56 160 Rhode Island 2,700 5 24 Connecticut 5,100 10 111 New York 70,560 141 45  New Jersey 6,625 13 55 Pennsylvania 39,000 78 150 Delaware 1,750 4 14 Maryland 10,350 21 110 Virginia 138,000 276 145 N.

I have enclosed you too much for once: I am afraid you will Think that I am unreasonably tedious: I doubt not your Goodness will induce you to pardon an Error which has cost me some Labor & Trouble. I am very much pleased to find by a Letter recd. by this Weeks Post from the State directed to their Delegates that they seem to be alarmed about their Territory. Two other Letters also came to hand by the same Conveyence. I was much pleased with all of them. They are Letters well wrote upon very important Subjects. The State have assigned their Delegates a Task to answer fully all their Queries respecting old Money. But it is such a one, as whilst I am here, I shall attend to with great Pleasure & Satisfaction. I will as soon as possible forward the best Account I can collect. Novr. 26th next Monday is assigned for choosing two Judges of the Court of Appeals. Genl.

  Monday Novr. 25. [1782] A letter from the Lt. Govr. of R. I. was read containing evidence that some of the leaders in Vermt., and particularly Luke Nolton who had been deputed in the year 1780 to Congress as Agent for that party opposed to its independence but who had since changed sides, had been intriguing with the enemy in N. Y. The letter was Committed.(1) See Nov. 27. The consideration of the motion for ratifying the discharge of Cornwallis was resumed.(2) Mr. Williamson renewed his motion which failed.(3) Mr. McKean suggested the expedient of ratifying the discharge, on condition that a General Cartel should be acceded to. This was relished at first by several members, but a developement of its inefficacy and inconsistency with national dignity stifled it. A motion was made by Mr. Rutledge, 2ded. by Mr. Ramsay, that the discharge should be ratified in case Mr. L.(4) should undertake the office of Commissioner for peace. This proposition was generally considered as of a very extraordinary nature, and after a brief discussion withdrawn.(5) NOVEMBER 25, 1782  In the course of these several propositions most of the arguments stated on friday last were repeated. Col. Hamilton (6) who warmly & cogently espoused the ratification, as an additional argument mentioned, that some intimations had been given by Col. L.(7) with the p[r]ivity of Genl. W. to Cornwallis previous to his capitulation, that he might be exchanged for his father, then in the Tower. The Rept. of the Committee of Mr. M. motion on the 21 inst. relative to Secy. of F.

  Teusday Novr. 26. [1782] No Congress but a Grand Committee composed of a member from each State.(1) The States of N. H. & Masts. having redeemed more than their quotas of the Emissions prior to the 18th of March 1780, had called on Congress to be credited for the surplus, on which the Superintendt of Finance reported that they ought to be credited at the rate of 1 Dollar specie for 40 of the sd. Emission, according to the act of March aforesaid.(2) This report being judged by Congress unjust as the money had been called in by those States at a greater depreciation, was disagreed to. Whereupon a Motion was made by Mr. Osgood, that the States who had redeemed a surplus should be credited for the same according to its current value at the time of This motion with a letter afterwards rcd. from the State of Mass. on the same subject, were referred to the grand committee in question.(3) The Committee were unanimous that Justice required an allowance to the States who sd. sink a surplus, to be apportioned on the deficient States; The different expedients suggested were NOVEMBER 26, 1782  1. That Congress sd. renew their call on the States to execute the Acts of the 18th of M. 1780 and leave it to the states to level the money by negociations among themselves. This was Mr. Hamilton's idea. The objections against it were that either nothing wd be done in the case or the deficient States wd. be at the mercy of the hoarding States; altho' the former were perhaps prevented from doing their part by invasions; & the prosperity of the latter enabled them to absorb an undue proportion. By M (4) It was proposed that Congress should declare that whenever it sd. appear that the whole of the bills emitted prior to the 18th of M. 1780 shall have been collected into the Treasuries of the several States, Congress wd. proceed to give such credit for any surplus above the quotas assigned as equity might require, and debit the deficient States accordingly. In favor of this expedient it was supposed that it would give a general encouragement to the States to draw the money outstanding among individuals into the public treasuries, and render a future equitable arrangemt. by Congress easy. The objections were that it gave no satisfaction immediately to the complaining States, & would prolong the internal embarrassments which have hindered the States from a due compliance with the requisitions of Congress. It was lastly proposed by Mr. Fitzimmons that the Commissioners appointed to traverse the U.

The same rule to determine the credit for redemptions by the States. This proposition was on the whole generally thought by the Committee least objectionable and was referred to a sub committee composed of Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Fitzimmons & Mr. Hamilton to be matured & laid before the GC.(5) One consideration suggested by Mr. H.(6) in favor was that it would multiply the advocates for federal funds for discharging the public debts, and tend to cement the Union.

  My dear Friend Philada. Novr. 26th. 1782 The Governor in his letter to the Delegates of the 8th of the prest. month,(1) after observing that the great scarcity of cash in Virga. will put it out of her power to comply with the demands of Congress, unless the Financier will accept Tobo. in payment, desires us to sound the latter on that subject. We accordingly called on Mr. Morris, and to our astonishment were told that a proposition to this very effect, and to the amount of {sixty thousand dollars}(2) had been a considerable time {lying before the executive}, that his Agent had been instructed to {allow the current price} and that he wished to have obtained {the tobacco} because it could be immediately sent under a {fortunate convoy to Holland where} its influence on {public credit might be} critical and important.(3) Either therefore Mr. M. must have been basely {deceived by his agent} which can {hardly be supposed or the governor must in the first place} have rejected a fair {offer and in the next} imposed {on us a very} nugatory and {awkward negotiation}.(4) As we concealed from the Superintendt. that our enquiries originated with {the governor he} escaped {the risk to} which he had {exposed his} character {with that minister}. I cannot pass over this circumstance without a lamentation on the {obloquy which Virginia} brings {on herself by} submitting to be {eclipsed by} even {the} feeble {efforts of other states}. The monthly {lash of the} Receiver's proclamation, which has {roused so many other states} into {some degree of emulation} has produced {no effect on her}. In our conversation with Mr. M. we were indeed told that Mr. {Webb} had a prospect of {between two and three thousand dollars}. But if any thing can add to the mortification which {we feel at the receipt of nothing} it will be {the receipt of so beggarly a sum}. I confide therefore that there is at least {enough of pride in the state to prevent it}. We are likely to have on our hands near 200 souls carried from Kentucky about 2 years ago into captivity in Canada, and lately discharged by the Governor of that Province.(5) A part of them are already arrived. They are all in great distress and have been enabled to proceed this far only by the benevolent provisions of the Commander in cheif. Humanity will not suffer us to leave them unassisted with the means of reaching their homes, or at least their State. But whence are the means to be derived? To draw bills for a sufficient sum without warrant, and even without a certainty that they can be honoured is a very painful experiment. To resort to the Coffers of Congress into which we shall probably be reminded that not a single shilling has been contributed by Virga. in favor of Citizens too whose misfortunes will be traced up to disrespect to recommendations of Congress, will be far from relieving our feelings.(6) Having not yet con- NOVEMBER 26, 1782  ferred with my Colleague (7) the subject, the result of these perplexities is uncertain. For want of something more interesting, I will epitomize for you the proceedings of Congress on Friday last.(8) I have already informed you, if my recollection does not fail me, that Congress long since recd. a letter from Mr. H. L. informing them of his di[s]charge from captivity, and of his having authorized an expectation in the {British ministry that} Cornwallis should {in return be discharged from his parole}. Shortly after a letter from Docr. F. acquainted Congress that at the pressing instance of Mr. L. in consideration of the {power given him to} exchange B____g____e (9) for him and of the reasonableness of the {thing he had executed an} instrument setting Cornwallis at full liberty, untill the pleasure of Congress should be known. These papers had been committed, and the Committee had reported a {ratification} of the instrument. After some debate a recommittment took place. In this state the business remained untill the day abovementioned, when in order to satisfy some members who had called for a report, and to enable the Committee to adapt their report to the sense of Congress, a motion was made to instruct the Committee to report a proper act of {rati.} &c. On this motion the merits of the case, which as connected with our national character may be deemed of some moment, fell under general discussion. In support of the motion it was argued that whenever a public Minister entered into unauthorized engagements, the only alternative which presented itself to the Sovereign, was either to {ratify the engagements} or {to recall the minister} unless indeed he should prefer both: that Congress, having even refused {to permit the minister} in question {to decline} his {appointment} had therefore no {option left but to support him in what} he had {taken upon himself}: that nothing could be more {preposterous} than to detain him in so dignified & confidential a service, and at the same time to degrade him in the estimation both of his friends and enemies, by a {public disavowal of his} conduct: that it was particularly improper to {send him into} negociations with {the latter} under the impression of {supposed obligations to them}; that a part of this reasoning was applicable to the part which Dr. F. another {minister had taken in the measure}; that the Marquis de la Fayette who in consequence of the liberation of Cornwallis had with the approbation of the Ministers, undertaken an exchange of several of his family, would {also participate in the mortification}; that finally it was greatly overrating the importance of Cornwallis to {sacrifice all these} considerations {to the policy or gratification of prolonging his} captivity. On the adverse side it was said that the British Govt. having treated Mr. L. not as a prisoner of war but as a Traitor, having refused to exchange him for Genl. B____g____e when the offer was made, and having declared by the British commanders at N. Y. that he had been freely discharged, neither Mr. L. nor Congress could be bound either   in honor or justice, to render an equivalent, whilst policy strongly inculcated that so barbarous an instrument of war and so odious an object to the people of the U. S. should be held as long as possible in the chains of captivity; that as the latest advices rendered it probable that Mr. L. was at this time on his return to America, the dignity of the Commission for peace could not suffer from any mark of disapprobation which might lie on his public conduct; that Docr. F.'s character was guarded against injury in the case by an express reservation in his act for the allowance or disapprobation of Congress; that the same might be said with respect to the Marquis de la Fayette; that the solemn declaration made by Congress agst. any partial exchanges untill a cartell should be established on national principles would not admit even of a ratification of an exchange antecedent to that declaration. These were the ostensible reasons for the opposite opinions on this question. We may well suppose however, that with some members at least they were secretly corroberated, on one side by {personal attachment to} Mr. L. and on the other by a dislike {to his character and a distrust excited by circumstances} which I some time ago related to you. It is to be observed at the same time that several members who admitted the force of this last consideration, were led by the arguments first stated, to oppose the opinion of those who urged it. The Question was at length suspended at the request of some new members who wished for further information.(10) There is some reason to believe that it will be followed by an attempt to {rescind the appointment}. The obstinacy of Rhode Island in rejecting the Impost, is a subject of very general and {pointed crimination} not only among {the public creditors and their friends} who deem it equivalent to a {denial of justice} but among the most {enlightened patrons of the foederal interests} who pronounce it a {blow to our credit abroad} as well as {our future credit at home}. And in truth who can combine this consideration with the paltry {payments on the last requisition of Congress and not shudder at the prospect}. This obstinacy on the part of R. I. is supposed, on good grounds, to be much {cherished by the} limited manner in which other {states have acceded to the impost} from which she infers a latent repugnance to the measure. Would it not then be prudent {in Virginia to} revise and {enlarge her act of compliance}? If {her example} should prove {less efficatious} than might {be wished} it would at least {have a conciliating effect on other states and gain her general credit}. I see no possible objection; unless indeed, she wishes the {plan to be frustrated}; in which case I can only give it as my firm opinion that a thorough knowledge of public affairs would speedily   reconcile her to it. If your own ideas correspond with those here expressed, and the temper of the Legislature be not unfavorable, you will give such suggestions as may be best adapted to the object, and make them the subject of a future paragraph. The copiousness of your favor of the 16th (11) is a flattering presage of legislative communications. The reply of Mr. Jefferson to Mr. M____s's queries (12) is more accessible than you were aware. I have had a perusal of it, and have taken a few extracts. All therefore that will be necessary on your part will be to specify your commands. A transcript of the entire work I presume might be obtained, but it is too voluminous for any other pen than a hired one, to wch. perhaps objections might arise from delicacy. My extracts would have been fuller had I not taken it for granted that Mr. J. had retained a copy of which I might herafter avail myself. A letter from Genl W. of the 19th informs Congress that the residue of the B. fleet was about leaving N. Y. that 25 transports had arrived there from Quebec prepared before their sailing for the reception of troops, and that he had rcd. thro' two channels intelligence that troops were actually embarking, altho' he cd. not vouch for it. Another acct. had also arrived of the evacuation of Charlestown, the foreign troops having gone to Halifax & the British to the West Indies. Col. Hamilton took his seat in Congress yesterday as a Delegate for the State of N. Y. Mr. Peters, Mr. Fitsimmons & Genl. Mifflin have attended some days as members for Pennsa.(13) ""

  Sir Philada. Novr. 26th. 1782 In answer to your Excellency's letter of the 8th(1) as far as it relates to Capt. Pierce, we inclose the late Acts of Congress making further reductions in the army, with the remarks of the Secy at War on the operation of these acts in the case of that officer.(2) In the latter will also be found such information as the War office affords on the subject of cloathing for the Virginia troops. In pursuance of your request we sounded the disposition of the Superintendt. of Finance as to an acceptance of Tobo. from Virginia at the current prices in place of cash. His reply was that his Agent in consequence of instructions from him had made a proposition to that very effect to the amount of 60,000 Dollars, which had been lying some time before the Executive unanswered.(3) A letter of the 19th instant from Genl. Washington informs Congress that another account had been received at N. York of the evacuation of Charleston, the British part of the Garrison having proceeded to the West Indies, & the remaining part to Halifax; that the last division of the British fleet was about leaving N. York; that 25 transports from Qu[e]bec prepared before their sailing for the reception of troops, had arrived at that place, and that intelligence had come to him through two channels for which however he could not vouch, that an embarkation was actually on foot. Among the captives lately discharged from Canada and now returning to their several homes are included we understand near 200 of men, women and children, who belong to the Kentucky and other back settlements of Virginia. A few of them have already reached this place through the benevolent assistance of the Commander in chief. On the application of the Secretary at War Congress have authorised such further assistance as will convey them to their own State. The letter from the Commander in chief above referred to speaks of a number of captives from the same quarter being brought to N. York in the transports from Quebec, and the same account is given by those now here.(4) If the case of the latter had not been taken up when it was, it would have necessarily devolved on the hands of the Delegates. But although we have escaped this perplexity, it is not improbable that those who may be sent out from N. York may be thrown upon us, in which case draughts on the Treasury will we foresee be unavoidable. To resort to the Treasury of the U. S. for a supply would probably be unsuccessfull, and would certainly lead to remarks which need not be pointed out to your Excellency. We take the liberty of mentioning these circumstances, as well that the Treasury may be apprised of the contingent demand upon it, as that we may know the will of the State in this and similar cases.

  Wednesday Novr. 27th [1782]. The report of the Committee on the letter from the Lt. Govr. of R. Island (see Novr. 25) was made & taken into consideration.(1) It was moved by Mr. McKean to insert in the first clause on the Journal, after directing the apprehension by Genl W. \""in order that the sd persons may be brought to trial.\"" The reason urged for the motion was that it might appear that the interposition was not meant to supercede civil process farther than the necessity of the case required. Agst. the motion it urged that it would lead to discussions extremely perplexing & dilatory, & that it would be more proper after the apprehension sd have taken place. The motion was lost 6 States only being for it. With respect to the main question it was agreed on all sides that it was indispensable to the safety of the U. S. that a traiterous intercourse between the inhabitants of Vermont & the Enemy should be suppressed. There were however two modes proposed for the purpose viz the direct & immediate interposition of the military force according to the Report, and 2dly. A reference in the first instance to the acting Authority in Vermont, to be followed in case of refusal or neglect of Justice on the offenders, by an exertion of compulsive measures against the whole body. In favor of the 1st mode it was sd. that it would be the only effectual one & the only one consistent with the part Congress had observed with regard to Vermont; Since a reference to the Authority of Vermont which had itself been suspected & accused would certainly be followed at the best by a mere mock trial; and would more over be a stronger recognition of its independence than Congress had made or meant to make. In favor of the 2d mode it was alledged that the body of the people in Vermont were well attached to the Revolution, that a sudden march of military force into the Country might alarm them, that if their Rulers abetted the Traitors, it wd. disgrace them in the eyes of their own people, and that Congress would be justified in that event to \""split Vermont up among the other States.\"" This expression as well as the arguments on this side in general came from Mr. Howell of R. I. whose object was to render the proceedings of Congress as favorable as possible to the Independence of Vermont. In order to compromise the matter Mr. Arnold moved that the Commander in chief sd. be directed to make a previous communication of his intentions & the evidence on which they were founded to the persons exercising authority within the district in question. NOVEMBER 27, 1782  It was suggested by Mr. (2) as a better expedient that he sd. be authorized to make the communication if he should deem it conducive to the more certain apprehension of the suspected persons. The Delegates from N. Y. said they would agree that after the apprehension should have been effected, the Commander might give notice thereof to the Persons exercising authority in Vermont. It was finally compromised as it stands on the Journal.(3) In the course of the Debate Mr. Clark informed Congress that the Delegates of N. Jersey could not vote for any act which might oppose forces to the Authority of Vermont, the Legislature of that State, having so construed the Resolutions of the 7 & 20th of Aug. as to be incompatible therewith & accordingly instructed their Delegates.(4) The communication directed to the States on this occasion thro' the Commander in Chief was objected to by several members as an improper innovation. The object of it was to prevent the risk of discovery, if sent before the plans which might be taken by Genl W. were sufficiently advanced, of which he was the proper Judge.5 ""

  Sir, Philadelphia 30th November 1782. I had the honor of writing your Excellency by the last Post, since which a Captain Reed, late of one of our Frigates,(1) arrived from Charles-Town, where he had been carried a Prisoner. He informs me that he left that Town on the 4th instant. Two divisions of Transports had sailed, one for St. Augustine, the other for Halifax, with Stores and foreign Troops--That every thing looked like a speedy evacuation of the Town. All their Artillery, except three or four, were gone and on board--The baggage of the Officers all packed and ready for embarkation--All sales forbid and the shops shut up--The transports were expected every moment from Augustine, which were to take off the last division. The Citizens of Carolina were admitted to come into the Town with flags and to search the Transports and other vessels for their Negroes. The Officers did very little duty, there being only a small guard kept up at the gates. The Captain of the Frigate in the harbour informed Capt. Reed, that they were to be all gone by the 25th instant. Thus we are yet in uncertainty as to the final evacuation of the City, tho' under the highest probable expectation of that event. A Frigate arrived in the harbour from New-York just before Capt. Reed left it. There is an appearance of a Convention or some Agreement between Genl. Greene and the enemy, as they behaved generally as in a State of perfect security, tho' without being in any apparent state of defence. This is confirmed by a private letter, mentioning that Governor Matthews had summoned his Assembly to meet in Charles-Town in January next.

I directed the Letter to the Care of Mr. Roper, if you should not have received it yet I Suppose it will be found  DECEMBER 2, 1782  at his house. I mentioned in that Letter that I was Surprized you had not heard from me Since my arrival in Philadelphia, as I had wrote to you, either by Tony, or the return of the Waggon, that brought Miss McWicker--on the 6th July.(2) I wrote also by both these Conveyances to Mrs Peyton(3)--& inclosed Some News papers. I particularly requested that the Waggon Cover which I sent Tony at his desire might be sent to Mrs. Sullivan, who had bought it with my Waggon; she has informed me, that she has not received it. I will be much obliged to you to enquire on the Subject, & request Mrs. Peyton to have it sent. With respect to the Indigo, if you think lowering the price will occasion a quick Sale--I should have no objection to retail it at One Dollar per Pound & at Whole Sale at five Shillings per Pound; nay to get rid of it I should have no objection to sell it at Four Shilling per Pound. It is a loosing bargain, but this place requires all the Money a Man can rake & Scrape. However if nothing can be done in it till the Spring we must have patience. I also sent you the prices of Blankets, Sheeting, Irish Linen, & best Cloth--ordinary Bristol Blankets Sold sometime ago four Dollars a piece--But broad Cloath about Eight Dollars a Yard, Sheeting from five Shillings to a Dollar a yard, very good Irish Linens from one Dollar to ten Shilling a yard.

  Dear Sir Philadelphia 2d December 1782. I was favoured a day, or two ago with your Letter of 8th October, written in full confidence that the Enemy were on the point of evacuating the Town. Their words, & their actions have certainly given every reason for that opinion; & yet my mind can not be at ease until I am sure that they are gone. Had Lord Rockingham lived, the blessings of Peace would have been restored to the World. His Successor is ambitious, & treacherous, & as long as it shall be necessary to indulge the malignant heart of his Master with the effusion of human blood, the war will be continued. The most solemn assurances were given by Sr. Guy Carleton to Genl. Washington that the King of England was determined on the acknowledgment of the Independence of America, & that there was no object for the continuance of the War. The subsequent proceedings of the British Court have shewn that those declarations were founded in deception, and falsehood. We have no intelligence from Europe of any importance that can be depended on. Reports from New York say that Gibraltar has surrendered. If so, the great force which has so long been employed there, may be drawn forth, & made useful against the common Enemy. A vigorous exertion of it in the West Indies, may compel them to evacuate New York, & Charles Town. M. de Grasse might easily have relieved the latter; & that is a subject on which I never can think without sorrow, & astonishment. The Campaign has past away to the Northward in total inactivity. The Enemy have kept with[in] their Lines, & General Washington has not been strong enough to attempt anything. A few of DeLancey's Corps took two of Sheldon's Dragoons Prisoners three, or four weeks ago. The Dragoons were sent out to their Officer, with a Letter from DeLancey, informing him that they had no orders to take any Prisoners. This, I believe, is intended to amuse, & deceive. The Season with you, I am told, has been very sickly, & that you have had your share of the Fall Fever. I am happy to hear that you are recovered, & hope that neither you, nor Mrs. Greene will have any more cause to be dissatisfied with our Climate. The next September that you pass in South Carolina, I hope will be in a spot much more healthy, within a few Miles of your late Head Quarters. Congress are exceedingly embarrassed about their Finances. The 5 per Cent duty would lay the foundation for pay- DECEMBER 2, 1782  Portrait of Ralph Izard  ing the Interest due to the public Creditors. All the States have agreed to the measure, except Rhode Island, & Georgia. The latter, I expect, will acquiese; but the Legislature of Rhode Island pertinaciously refuse to concur. When our present stock of money shall be exhausted, we can not expect that anybody in Europe will lend us more, unless proper funds [be] established for the repayment of it. Mr. Howell, the Professor of Mathematicks in Rhode Island, & Delegate in Congress from that State, has been, & still continues to be, the principal cause of our distress on this subject.

  Dear Sir: Philadelphia, Dec. 2, 1782. Your favor of the 13th ultimo came to hand by this day's post. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs had called on me some days ago to know what answer I had got on the subject of the memoir,(1) and, supposing that it had missed its passage, I had made out another copy which would have been sent on to-morrow. I had not recollected the circuit of courts. Of news, there is none in town, civil or military, foreign or domestic, since a foolish fellow, four months ago, blew out his brains, as a proof that he had none; or what is nearly the same thing, he killed himself, because a coquette proved to be nothing but a coquette. Since that event nobody has ever killed themselves for the amusement of the public, nor does this town produce any news! To say that balls and dances are frequent is saying little, for we have them every night. Should I say that such are the late improvements in luxury, and the true style of living, that many of the citizens have found the means of spending more in one year than they make in two, you might be surprised, for \""nemo dat quod non habet,\""(2) but they contrive to spend what they have not. I hope the unsociable mode of making entertainments where the face of a lady does not appear, will not reach our country. This body is torn to pieces with factions, not Whig and Tory, but Whig and better Whig. The Tory is a third party, and I think rather more numerous than either of the others. I become daily more in love with our own State, and should I become more in love with the ladies of our State, you would readily believe me, especially should I give you the description of a true city lady in full dress--head, hoop, and all, but I don't love caricature; to draw after the life might obtain that name. Now that I have naturally mentioned women, pray, how is your fair kinswoman on the other side of the Sound? Is she almost half French, half American? for as the wife is half, often the better half of her husband, I suppose the husband should be half of his wife. I wish I could think of this matter with a pulse perfectly regular. But a thousand things will happen not exactly as a lady could wish, and if we are not philosophers, we ought to be. I shall hardly hear whether dances or any other amusements held you in Edenton to pass the evenings, in fact I can hear of no domestic occurrences. Nobody has ever written me whether any vessel, prize, or merchant ship, has arrived at Edenton for the last six weeks. Be assured that I am with the utmost esteem, Your obedient servant, H. Williamson.

  Sir, Decr. 3d. 1782. In Answer to your favour of the 30th Ulto. with a Copy of the Charges exhibited Against the late Commsy. of Military stores,(1) I must inform you, that the first Charge is to be proved by William Thorne paymaster of the department, and by receipts now or of late in his possession, if not at present with him, he can inform where they may be found. Mr Thorne can also inform respecting the mode of payments made to some of the Officers & others having demands upon the department, that after orders were given for payment, the Commissary restrained such payment unless upon his Special Order after wards given, thereby making partial payments to the great injury of those deprived of their pay. The second Charge respects the Commissarys calling from Massachusets Mr. Hay to Command the Company from which Mr. Godfrey was discharged by the Act of Congress of the 30th of August 1780 As An Unnecessary Officer, founded on a report of the board of War of the 26 of the same month. A Copy of the report Accompanies this. Boyer a Clerk in the department, as also Mr Hay himself may be called upon to inform the manner of Mr. Hays coming to the Command. I well remember that at the time of dismissing Godfrey the members from the board of War attending Congress, declared that his removal was not to give place to any other, but purely as an Office unnecessary agreable to a resolution of Congress of the 12th of August, and it cannot be Supposed that the board of War intended to deceive Congress. The third Charge relates to the Commsys. removing from his trust and employ Major Jonathan Gostelowe by his own Authority, placing one of his Clerks in the Military store. The Letters of removal were put into the hands of a Committee of Congress where it is supposed they yet remain. No Order of the board of War hath appeared or was mentioned in the Letters, to justifie such a procedure, Nor does even the board of War Appear to have such a power without reporting to and Obtaining the Concurrence of Congress; this appears to have been their sense respecting their powers as expressed in their report of the 26th of August Accompanying this, for it is Observable that Charles Lukens and Jona. Gostelowe were both Appointed at the same time on the 11th of Novr. 1777 and both under Similar Circumstances as to their appointments, the former of which the board did not think themselves impowered to remove. Gostelowe can be called to Witness  DECEMBER 3, 1782  as to his dismission, the Letters being as is said out of Town. Mr. Boyer also may know something of this matter. The fourth Charge, intended to be proved principally by Capt. Jordan who is now absent. Jona Gostelowe, Moses Gistland a late Clerk to the Commissary, Mr. McFee a late Conductor, can be called to testifie on this head. Mr. Boyer may also know something of this business and produce the books, where, I am told, it will appear that the Commissary and the Officers about him received their pay, while others were deprived of it; the Commissarys receiving more than his pay will appear by the rects. under the first Charge.

  Teusday Decr. 3. [1782] After a verbal report of the Committee above mentioned,(1) who acquainted Congress that in a conference with Mr. Livingston he professed a willingness to remain in office till the 1st of Jany. to give time for the choice of a Successor, Mr. McKean proposed the Resolution, which stands on the Journals; several alterations having been made however in the course of its consideration. With respect to the Preamble particularly, a change took place.(2) As it was first moved it recited as the ground of the resignation the incompatibility of the office of foreign affairs with the Chancellorship of N. Y. To this recital it was objected by Mr [Madison] that such a publication of preference of the office of the Chan[c]ellor of a particular State, to the office of foreign Affairs under U. S. tended to degrade the latter, whereupon the Preamble on the Journal was substituted.(3) In the course of this business the expediency of augmenting the Salary was suggested, but not much supported. Mr. Howel & Clarke opposed it strenuously. DECEMBER 3, 1782  The Report of the Committee on the case of Vermont mentioned on Thursday the 14 of Novr.(4) was called for by Mr. McKean, & postponed on his motion to make way for a set of Resolutions declaring that as Vermont in contempt of the Authority of Congress & their Recommendations of 1779 (5) exercised jurisdiction over sundry persons professing allegiance to the State of N. Y. banishing them and stripping them of their possessions, the former be required to make restitution &c., and that in case of refusal or neglect Congress will enforce the same, &c. A motion was made by Mr. Clark 2ded by Mr. Howel to strike out the latter clause, in favor of which it was said that such a menace ought to be suspended untill Vermont should refuse to comply with the Requisition; especially said Mr. Howell as the present proceeding being at the instance of Phelps & other exiles was an exparte one.(6) Against the motion for expunging the clause, it was observed that a requisition on Vermont without such a menace wd. have no effect, that if Congress interposed they ought to do it with a decisive tone; that as it only enforced restitution in cases where spoliations had been committed and therefore was conditional, the circumstance of its being exparte was of no weight, especially as Congress cd. not call on Vermt. to appear as a party after her repeated protestations agst. appearing. On this occasion Mr. Carroll informed Congress that he had entirely changed his opinion with regard to the policy requisite with regard to Vermt. being thoroughly persuaded that its leaders were perfidious men & that the interest of U. S. required their pretensions to be discountenanced; that in this opinion he was not a little confirmed by a late conversation with Genl. Whipple of N. Hamshire at Trenton (7) in which this Gentleman assured him that the Governing party in Vermont were perfidiously devoted to the British interest, & that he had reason to believe that a British Commision for a Govr. of that district had come over & was ready to be produced at a convenient season. Some of the members having gone out of Congress & it being uncertain whether there would be more than six States for the clause,(8) an adjourmnent was moved for & voted. The proceedings on this subject evinced still more the conciliating effect of the territorial cession of N. York, on several States & the effect of the scheme of an ultramontane State within Pennsa. on the latter State. The only States in Congress which stood by Vermont were Rhode Island which is supposed to be interested in lands in Vermt. and N. Jersey whose Delegates were under instructions on the subject.(9) ""

11337,dg019312,1782,James Madison to Edmund Randolph,"""James Madison to Edmund Randolph
  My dear friend Philada. Decr. 3d. 1782. Applications from the States of N. Hamshire & Massachusetts concerning {the old paper}(1) of which they {hold a surplus} have called the attention of Congress once more to that subject.(2) The Superintendant on a Reference to him reported in {rigid adherence to his} maxims of {public faith} that credit should {be given for all surpluses at the rate of one for forty}. This proposition was readily {negatived by Congress}. Whereupon a motion was made by Mr. {Osgood} that {the states} should {be credit[ed]} according to the {current value at the time of redemption} which with one of the {letters from Massachusetts was refered to a grand committee}. The {commi} &c. {are unanimous} that {the burden of redeeming the old paper} as well as all other {public burdens} ought to be equitably apportioned on the States. On the {mode and the rate a diversity of ideas prevail}. One expedient suggested was to {call anew on the states to} sink {the money} and leave them {to level its} in{equalities by} negociations {among themselves}. This met with very little countenance. Another was to declare that as soon as the entire {sum should be taken up by the states from their} respect{ive citizens Congress} would proceed to charge the several {surpluses on the} deficient {states at such rate as equity might prescribe}. The objections against this were that it gave no immediate satisfaction to the {complaining states and} would prolong the internal {embarrassments of the states} which obstructed {the requisitions of Congress}. Lastly it was {proposed to} authorise the Commissioners who are {to traverse [the] country} for another {purpose to take up the un}redeemed {bills and} form them into a part {of the common debt} by {issuing to the} individuals {specie certificates at the rate of} ; and to apply the like rule to an {adjustment of disproportionate} redemptions {of the states}. This expedient was upon the {whole least disrelished by the committee and is now under their} consideration. Its reasonableness, and its {fate both} will depend much on the scale by which as well the {redeem[ed] as the outstanding bills is to be val- DECEMBER 3, 1782  ued}.(3) In all questions relative to this subject, the defect of information under which we lie makes it difficult for us to deduce the general interest from a just & fair comparison of particular interests. To supply in some degree this defect with regard to Virginia I shall enclose to Mr. Ambler for his answers, a number of queries, of which I herein add a copy for you.(4) Some of the queries indeed have a greater reference to other subjects. If you can assist Mr. A. or can enlarge the plan by other queries I beg you to do it. If the sense of the {leading members of the assembly} can be conveniently {gathered it} might {also be of use}. A public {consultation} would {violate the secresy} which is judged necessary {to prevent a revival of Speculation and} which {led me to the use of the} cypher on this occasion. The Secy. of F. Affairs communicated to me a few days ago his determination speedily {to resign his office}. He asked me in the course of conversation whether I thought Mr. {Jefferson} would {prefer the vacancy to his foreign appointment}. I answered him in the negative. He then asked whether I supposed he would {accept the} commission of {Jay at Madrid in case the latter} should prefer {the secretariship of foreign affairs and be} appointed to it. I told him I could not answer that question but doubted much whether {Congress} would {consent to part with the} services of {Mr. Jay as a negociator of peace}. I wish you to mention this conversation to and acquaint me with the result. The want of a Cypher with him will be an apology for omitting a direct communication. Through your hands also it may be accompanied with explanations if requisite. I leave it to your self to decide how far it may be worth while to {feel the pulse of our friend Mclurg} with respect to the {vacancy in question}. Mr. M____s apprized me two evenings ago that a French {frigate will sail from this port in about three weeks and that it is probable} Ct. R____u and the Chevr. Chatt____x {will take their passage in her than in the frigate in the Chesapeak}.(5) If the {river} should not {be threatened with ice the time of her sailing} may possibly {be procrastinated}. Should this obstruction not take place {before the middle of January} there will {be some chance of another frigate at this port}. These circumstances may {be very interesting to Mr. Jefferson and} I beg you to give him the earliest notice of them. If I could suppose that these and other considerations could leave any uncertainty, as to {his coming hither} in the first instance, I would press that point anew, being more & more convinced of its utility, not to say necessity, and finding that it is generally viewed in the same light. The merits of the Controversy are like to be brought under trial of the Court at Trenton, the Agents for Connecticut having been foiled in every plea for an adjournment. But I do not hear that any progress is made from which the issue can be presumed.6 The Legislature of this State has just published for consideration a bill subjecting to the penalties of Treason all attempts for erecting an  DECEMBER 3 1782  independent State within its charter-Limits.(7) This circumstance with some votes which have been lately taken in Congress with reference to {Vermont} leave no doubt that the policy of Penna. will in future be reversed. Your favor of the 22d Ulto.(8) with the cypher enclosed came by yesterdays post; but very unluckily without having ever been sealed. This omission lessens much my confidence in the Cypher; altho, it seems scarcely possible for any advantage to have been taken unless the letter lay longer out of your hands before the mail was closed, than the interval between its arrival here, and its coming into my hands; to say nothing of the honor of the post offices. I enquired of Mr. Hazard, without mentioning the fact, how far the regulations of the mail admitted of such frauds.(9) His answer altho' not absolutely conclusive favors the purity of the Cypher; & I shall venture to make use of it unless you recommend the contrary, or untill you transmit a new one.(10) The paragraph which touches the subject of your return does not altogether please me. I disrelish exceedingly any idea of your resignation. I can not perceive the necessity of such a step in any view, and I see a manifest inexpediency in putting it out of your power throughout the present critical year to lend your aid in any emergency whatever. I hope you will soon relieve my anxiety on this subject. On the article of news I must again deal entirely in negatives; no arrivals from Europe or the W. Indies affording any positive matter, and the domestic sources being equally deficient. There is indeed a report that the Octr. packet has arrived at N. Y. and a rumor that it authenticates the fall of Gibralter. E N C L O S U R E 1. What is the amount of the old Contl. bills actually sunk by Virga. in pursuance of the Act of the 18th. of March? 2.

  Sir Philada. Decr. 3d. 1782. From a consultation with the Secy at War we concluded that it would be fruitless, and therefore unadvisable to solicit either a repayment or sale of powder from the Magazines of the U. States.(1) We were informed by him however that there are {in the magazine within Virginia three hundred thirty six barrels of loose powder}(2) and {seventy of fixed} ammunition; that additional supplies will be forwarded as  DECEMBER 3, 1782  prudence may suggest; that this resource will on all emergenc[i]es be open to the State, and to ensure it the more satisfactorily that orders will be given to the Keepers in cases of invasion particularly, to comply with requisitions from the Executive. The Secy. added a request to be informed through us of the productiveness of the Lead Mines in their present State, with an intimation that powder may perhaps be obtained from the general Stock by barter for any surplus of that article. We have judged it prudent to suspend making a purchase here from individuals, untill the Executive can decide how far the expediency of such a measure may be superceded by the foregoing information; supposing it to be neither for the interest of Virginia nor of the U. States, that the resources should be superfluously expended in Stores, and that it is particularly against the interest of the former to take upon herself a burden which ought & probably will be borne by the latter. Should the Executive view the subject differently We shall readily conform to their original plan. That we might not unnecessarily repeat our solicitations to the Chevr. de la Luzerne with respect to the transportation of the arms & ammunition from France, We thought it best to confer in the first instance with Mr. Morris on the chance of effecting it under his auspices. We found that a previous application from your Excellency had led his thoughts to the same subject. It is uncertain as yet how far this channel is to be relied on.(3) By the next post we hope to be able to give you more satisfactory information. Your Excellency's favor of the 23d Ulto.,(4) has come duly to hand. An omission of the paper referred to as inclosed renders the first paragraph unintelligible, and consequently an answer to it must be postponed untill the omission shall be supplied.

It hath long been the Custom, in the Eastern states especially, to exchange for their Citizens such as are not Strictly Speaking Continental Prisoners, by which I mean those not taken at a Continental expence, they even exchange those taken by Privateers under Continental Commissions, this hath long been their practice. I cannot say what their conduct is at present but suppose the same they have heretofore practised: in this View of the matter I should not hesitate were I in your Excellencys place to send into New York for Capt.

Most of the prisoners coming out on Parole are to stay it is said untill called for, any sent in for such would not exchange them, but be Creditted in the general Account for past Arrears. Mr. Deharts parole entitles him to a discharge upon one's being sent in for him and should he return to New York and wait till all Arrears are paid up, and those taken before him exchanged, it is pretty certain he must remain a prisoner till the end of the War: his only prospect of exchange rests with your Excellency, who I am persuaded will grant him every favour his case may entitle him to, any other than such I would not Ask or even wish for.

  Wednesday Decr. 4. [1782] After the passing of the Resolution concerning Cap. P. Jones (1) a motion was made by Mr. [Madison] to reconsider the same, that it might be referred to the Agent of Marine to take order, as a better mode of answering the same purpose; since it did not become the sovereign body to give public sanction to a recommendation of Capt. Jones to the Commander of the French Squadron, especially as there was no written evidence that the latter had signified a disposition to concur in the project of Capt. Jones. The motion was lost; a few States only being in favor of it.(2) The reason assigned by those who voted against the promotion of Cols. to Brigadrs. according to districts was that such a division of the U. S. tends to foster local ideas, and might lead to a dismemberment.(3) The Delegates from Penna. reminded Congress that no answer had been given to the Memorials (see Novr. 20) from that State,(4) that the Legislature were proceeding in the measure intimated in the said Memorials and that they meant to finish it & adjourn this evening. The reasons mentioned by the Delegates as prevailing with the Legislature were 1st. the delay of Congress to give an answer which was deemed disrespectful. 2d. the little chance of any funds being provided by Congress for their internal debts. 3dly. the assurance [given by one of their members [Mr. Jos. Mont-gomery, mentioned privately not on the floor] that no impediment to the support of the war cd. arise from it, since Congress had provided means for that purpose in Europe. A Committee consisting of Mr. Rutledge Mr. M[adison] & Mr. Hamilton was appointed to confer immediately with a Committee from the Legislature on the subject of the Memorials, (5) & were instructed to make such communications relative to our affairs abroad as would correct misinformations. The Comittee which met them on the part of the Legislature were Mr. Jos. Montgomery, Mr. Hill (6) & Mr. Jacob Rush. The Committee of Congress in the conference observed that the delay of an answer had proceeded in part from the nature of so large an assembly of which the Committee of the Legislature cd. not be insensible, but principally from the difficulty of giving a satisfactory one untill Rhode Island sd. accede to the Impost of 5 PerCt. of which  DECEMBER 4, 1782  they had been in constant expectation; That with respect to the prospect from Congress for the public Creditors Congress had required of the States interest for the ensuing year, had accepted the territorial Cession of N. Y. and meant still to pursue the scheme of the impost; that as to their affairs in Europe the loan of 6 Million of livres only last year had been procured from France by Dr. Franklyn in place of 12 asked by him, the whole of which had been applied; that the loan of 5,000,000 Guelders opened by Mr. Adams had advanced to abt. 1½ Million only and there seemed little progress to have been made of late; that the application for 4 Million as part of the estimate for the ensuing year was not founded on any previous information in favor but against every intimation on the subject, & was dictated entirely by our necessities; so that if even no part of the requisitions from the States sd. be denied, or diverted, the support of the war, the primary object, might be but deficiently provided for. That if this example which violated the right of appropriation delegated to Congress by the federal Articles,(7) should be set by Pa. it would be both followed by other States & extended to other instances; that in consequence our system of administration, and even our bond of Union wd. be dissolved; that the enemy would take courage from such a prospect and the war be prolonged if not the object of it endangered; that our national credit would fail with other powers, & the loans from abroad which had been our cheif resource fail with it. That an assumption by individual States of the prerogative of paying to their own Citizens the debts of the U. S. out of the money required by the latter was not only a breach of the federal system but of the faith pledged to the public Creditors; since payment was mutually guaranteed to each & all of the Creditors by each & all of the States; and that lastly it was unjust with respect to the States themselves on whom the burden would fall not in proportion to their respective abilities, but to the debts due to their respective Citizens; and that at least it deserved the consideration of Pa. whether she would not be loser by such an arrangement. On the side of the other Comittee it was answered that the measure cd. not violate the confederation because the requisition had not been founded on a valuation of land; that it would not be the first example, N. H. & N. Y. havg. appropriated mony raised under requisitions of Congress;(8) that if the other States did their duty in complying with the demands of Congress no inconveniency would arise from it, that the discontents of the Creditors wd. prevent the payment of taxes; Mr. Hill finally asking whether it had been considered in Congress how far delinquent States cd. be eventually coerced to do justice to those who performed their part? To all which it was replied that a valuation of land had been manifestly impossible during the war--that the apportionments made had been acquiesced in by Pa. and therefore the appropriation could not be objected to: that altho other   States might have set previous examples, these had never come before Congress, that it wd be [more] honorable for Pa. to counteract than abet them especially as the example from her weight in the Union & the residence of Congress wd. be so powerful; that if other States did their duty the measure wd. be superfluous; that the discontents of the Creditors might always be answered by the equal justice & more pressing necessity which pleaded in favor of the army, who had lent their blood & services to their Country, and on whom its defence still rested; that Congress unwilling to presume a refusal in any of the States to do justice cd. not anticipate it by a consideration of the steps wch. such refusal might require, & that ruin must ensue if the States suffered their policy to be swayed by such distrusts. The Committee appeared to be considerably impressed with these remarks, & the Legislature suspended their plan.(9) ""

  My dear Sir Philadelphia 4 Decr. 1782 This Morning I Recd. your Favor of the 2d of November: It gave me the more sensible Pleasure, because I began to repent that I had wrote you with Respect to the System for the Adjutant Genls. Department.(1) And more especially, as you have mentioned with Freedom, a Matter which has given me no small Degree of Anxiety. I must acknowledge it as a particular Mark of Friendship in you, so candidly to give me one of the Reasons, why the Application of the Officers of the Masstts. Line to the Legislature thereof fail'd: you mention my Letter to Mr. Lowell,(2) as having conduced to prevent a Plan which would have given much Dignity to the State, & Contentment to the Army. Upon this Observation I am extremely sorry that I ever wrote  DECEMBER 4, 1782  that Letter; which was never intended for the public Eye; It was wrote to a Friend in whom I had never discovered any Thing but the most cordial Affection for the Army, & consequently was not wrote with that Accuracy & Attention which I should have otherwise aimed at. If I us'd the Word \""excessive\"" I think the Tenor of my Letter will fully show in what Sense I us'd it. If I do not misremember, it stands in this View. If, for Instance, the state of Masstts should promise to pay a hundred Pounds when they were only able to pay fifty, it would exceed their Ability & on their Part be an excessive Promise. It did not give my Opinion that half Pay was more than the united States will be able to discharge; but aimed particularly to show the Inequality of Rewarding an Officer for one, or two years Service, with as great pecuniary Emoluments, as one who may have served Eight or ten years. This appeared to me then & still appears to me excessive. It does not seem to me to be founded in Reason. From all the information I have been able to collect of the Sentiments of the Officers of the Masstts. Line, I do not find that mine differs from theirs in Substance & Mode. They may differ as to Time; which probably arises from my Situation, where I have an Opportunity of discovering the Sentiments of the States from their Delegates more fully than the Army can possibly do. I have endeavored to convince the Members of Congress that it would be best to recommend to the States individually, to satisfy their Officers on Acct. of half Pay. My ill Success on this Head, induced me to write Mr. Lowell--for altho' no particular Question in Congress has been taken on the Matter of referring it to the several States, yet when the Memorial of the deranged Officers of the Connecticut Line was before Congress last Summer, the Subject was largely debated; & it was declared from various Quarters of the House, that if any State undertook to satisfy their Officers for half pay, they would do it in their own way, & that it could not discharge such State from Requisitions of Congress for half Pay. In this View could you have advised Masstts. to have compromised with her Officers, & have thereby probably laid the Foundation of a very serious dispute with the fOEderal Union. I sincerely wish to render the Officers of the Masstts. Line every Service in my Power: & nothing will give me greater Pleasure, than to let them know all my Views respecting them, & the Reasons on which I found them; & if, in their Opinion, they should not be Right, to hear their Objections. Heaven forbid that I should be obstinate or illiberal, in any System respecting them. I am fully of Opinion that an Officer who has been in the Service for seven or Eight years, must have almost entirely disqualified himself for private Business. I have little Idea of Roman Virtue contented with a few Acres. But my dear Friend, what can a Person have suffered in one or two years by mere Absence from private Business? Do you think the Damage to him in the exact Proportion of two to Eight, sup-  posing those to be the different Periods of Service? Indeed I esteem Eight to be much more than four Times two, in this View of the Matter. It has appeared to me that from the great Number of Officers which have been commissioned many of whom cannot have performed much Service in the Field, that it would be necessary to make some Distinction. And I can assure you I feel a hearty Disposition to reward those very liberally who have hitherto gone thro all the Distress, Fatigue, Want, & Danger of their Duty in the Field. I am, Dear Sir, with Sentiments of the highest Esteem, your most obedient Servant, Samuel Osgood ""

President, on the affair of Vermont, the Day before I arrived here, since which I gave a few hints respecting the same,(1) it appears that something should be done soon, it looks likely to me, that the final Desision will greatly depend on the inclination of New Hampshire, & New York, for which reason it is highly necessary that we have instructions. If nothing was done on the subject the last session of the Genl. Court, I hope there will be something done, the begining of the next. The Deligates from N. York appear to be very earnest to have a final determination, the Members from said State at present are Mr. Floyd, and Mr. Hambleton, who we think are more cordial than some others have been &c. No official account from the southward, people are in doubt respecting the evacuation of Charleston. We hear that Murrimitism prevails among you, and that several worthy members of the Genl. Court are converted, if so, doubtless they can give a reason of their hope. I remain with sincere respect Sir your Huml. Servt, P. White P.S. I would not have you think that I am covetous, by my sending only half a sheet, the reason of my doing it, is on account of a complaint that the members incumber the mail, with large Letters, &c &c.

  Thursday Decr. 5th. 1782 Mr. Lowel & Mr. Reed were elected Judges of the Court of Appeals.(1) Mr. P. Smith of N. Jersey had the vote of that State; and Mr. Merchant of Rhode Island the vote of that State. The Resolutions respecting Vermont moved by Mr. McKean on the day of were taken into Consideration. They were seconded by Mr. Hamilton, as entered on the Journal of this day.(2) Previous to the question on the coercive clause, Mr. M. observed that as the preceding clause was involved in it,3 & the fOEderal articles did not delegate to Congress the authority about to be enforced, it would be proper in the first place to amend the recital in the preceding clause, by inserting the ground on which the Authority of Congress had been interposed. Some who voted against this motion in this stage having done so from a doubt as to the point of order, it was revived in a subsequent stage when that objection did not lie.(4) The objections to the motion itself were urged chiefly by the Delegates from Rhode Island,  DECEMBER 5, 1782  and with a view in this, as in all other instances, to perplex & protract the business.(5) The objections were 1st. that the proposed insertion was not warranted by the Act of N. Hampshire which submitted to the judgment of Congress, merely the question of jurisdiction. 2dly. That the Resolutions of Aug. 1781, concerning Vermont, havg. been acceded to by Vermont, annulled all antecedent acts founded on the doubtfulness of its claim to independence. In answer To the 1st objn. the Act of N.H. was read wch. in the utmost latitude adopted the Resolvs. of Congress which extended expressly to the preservation of peace & order & prevention of acts of confiscation by one party agst. another. To the 2d. objn. it was answered 1st. that the sd. Resons. of Aug. being conditional not absolute, the accession of Vermont cd. not render them definitive; but 2dly. that prior to this accession, Vermont havg in due form rejected the Resolns. and notified the rejection to Congress, the accession cd. be of no avail unless subsequently admitted by Congress. 3dly. that this doctrine had been maintained by Vermont itself wch. had declared that inasmuch as the Resolns. of Aug. did not correspond wth. their overtures previously made to Congress these ceased to be obligatory; wch. act it was to be observed was merely declaratory, not creative, of the annulment.(6) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia December 6th. 1782. I have nothing more to communicate in respect to Public, affairs but what the Extracts from the Journals of Congress, and my Colleague's & my joint Letter will do.(1) Yet I cannot refrain from troubling your Excellency, with a few observations upon the Conduct of Mr. Howell, (2) since my Arrival in this City and which I believe, from various reasons, has been invariably the same ever since he had a seat in Congress. It appears to have been his first & only wish to serve his Country, generally, and especially his Constituents, with unshaken fidelity. He has had no separate interested views, to lead him from those Objects. He  DECEMBER 6, 1782  clearly understood the Force of the Articles of Confederation, and distinguished between the rights relinquished by the Separate States and those retained, & on this appeared desirous to fix his decisions on such questions as were discussed. On other occasional & detached pointshe ever shewed a desire to Justice, consistent with Honor & OEconomy--and judging that in many instances--the gratuities & Salaries of the Civil Officers was beyond what the present Circumstances of the people could well bear--he has missed no proper Opportunities of speaking freely his Opinion thereon, and to enforce the necessity of their reduction. He has been zealous and Active in endeavouring to obtain Justice in regard to the western Territory--part of which is already Ceded. He has also exerted himself to obtain some effectual measures whereby the Public Accounts might be collected & settled, upon Constitutional principles, and the Public Credit thereby restored, without the necessity of recurrence to measures unknown in & Contrary to such Principles. But I am sorry to say in this his exertions have hitherto proved fruitless. For his conduct in the preceeding matters--he has been looked upon in an invidious light by those, whose principles and Conduct have been opposed to him. He has been treated with a Coldness & indifference, which must have been extremely mortifying to his feelings--and which to avoid, would have swerved from the Purpose, any one, not endowed with an uncommon share of Firmness. As he is soon to return, I have reason to expect the inveterate enmity which his honest and patriotic Zeal in his countrys cause has raised in the breasts of those to whom he has necessarily been opposed, will be exerted, and follow him to his home and that the most unremitted industry will be used to injure him in the State, he has with so much integrity represented. My duty therefore to the State to prevent impositions upon them, and to him as a Colleague in whose confidence & friendship I have been singularly happy during my residence here, and with whom I have on most Occasions been united in sentiment, as to public measures, obliged me--unknown to him to give this public Testimony of his Conduct. Hoping & trusting, whilst his principles and Conduct continue as at Present, he will have the love & esteem, as well as the Approbation & Support of his Constituents, and be considered as he really is a very worthy and able defender of their Rights & Liberties, I have the Honor to be, with the highest sentiments of respect & esteem, Your Excellency's Very huml Servt.

  Friday 6 Decr. [1782] An ordinance extending the privilege of Franking letters to the Heads of all the Departments was reported & taken up.(1) Various ideas were thrown out on the subject at large; some contending for the extension proposed, some for a partial adoption of it, some for a total abolition of the privilege as well in members of Congress as in others; some for a limitation of the privilege to a definite number or weight of letters. Those who contended for a total abolition, represented the privilege as productive of abuses, as reducing the profits so low as to prevent the extension of the establishment throughout the U.S. and as throwing the whole burden of the establishment on the mercantile intercourse. On the other side it was contended that in Case of an abolition the Delegates, or their Constituents, would be taxed just in proportion to their distance from the seat of Congress; which was neither just nor politic, considering the many other disadvantages which were inseparable from that distance; that as the correspondence of the Delegates was the principal channel through which a general knowledge of public affairs, was diffused, any abridgment of it would so far confine this advantage to the States within the neighbourhood of Congress: & that as the correspondence at present however voluminous did not exclude from the mail any private letters which wd. be subject to postage, and if postage was extended to the letters now franked the no. & size of them would be essentially reduced, the revenue was not affected in the manner represented. The Ordinance was disagreed to & the subject recom- DECEMBER 6, 1782  mitted wth. the instruction to the Committee giving them ample latitude for such Report as they should think fit. A Boston Newspaper containing under the Providence Head an extract of a letter purporting to be written by a Gentleman in Philada. and misrepresenting the state of our loans, as well as betraying the secret proposal of the Sweedish Court to enter into a Treaty with the U.S.; with the view of disproving to the people of R. Island the necessity of the Impost of 5 PerCt.; had been handed about for several days. From style and other circumstances, it carried strongly the appearance of being written by a member of Congress.(2) The unanimous suspicions were fixed on Mr. Howel. The mischevous tendency of such publications & the necessity of the interposition of Congress were also general subjects of conversation. It was imagined too that a detection of the person suspected would destroy in his state that influence which he exerted in misleading its counsels with respect to the Impost. These circumstances led Mr. W____a____n (3) to move the proposition on this subject. It was opposed by no one. Mr. Clarke supposing it to be levelled in part at him, rose & informed Congress, that not considering the article relative to Sweeden as secret in its nature, and considering himself at liberty to make any communications to his Constituents he had disclosed it to the Assembly of N. Jersey. He was told that the motion was not aimed at him, but the doctrine advanced by him was utterly inadmissible. Mr. R____d____e (4) observed that after this frankness on the part of Mr. C____e as well as from the respect due from every member to Congress & to himself, it might be concluded that if no member present should own the letter in question, no member present was the author of it. Mr. H. was visibly perturbated, but remained silent. The Conference with the Committee of the Legislature of Penna. with subsequent information had rendered it very evident that unless some effectual measures were taken against separate appropriations & in favor of the public Creditors, the Legislature of that State, at its next meeting, would resume the plan which they had suspended. (5) Mr R____d____e in pursuance of this conviction moved that the Superintendt of Finance be instructed to represent to the several States the mischeifs which such appropriations would produce. It was observed with respect to this motion that however proper it might be as one expedient, it was of itself inadequate; that nothing but a permanent fund for discharging the debts of the public would divert the States from providing for their own Citizens; that a renewal of the call on R. Island for the impost ought to accompany the motion; that such a combination of these plans would mutually give efficacy to them, since R. Island would be solicitous to prevent separate appropriations & the other States would be soothed with the hope of the Impost. These observations gave rise to a Motion of Mr. Hamilton, which stands on the Journal.(6) Against Mr. Rutledge's part of the motion no objection was made, But The sending a deputation to Rhode Island was a subject of considerable debate, in which the necessity of the   impost, in order to prevent separate appropriations by the States, to do equal justice to the public creditors, to maintain our national character & credit abroad, to obtain the loans essential for supplying the deficiencies of revenue, to prevent the encouragement which a failure of the scheme would give the Enemy to persevere in the war, were at length set forth. The objections, except those wch. came agst. the scheme itself from the Delegates of R. Island, were drawn from the unseasonableness of the proposition. Congress ought it was said to wait for an official answer to their demand of an explicit answer from R.I. before they could with propriety repeat their exhortations. To which it was replied that altho' this objection might have some weight, yet the urgency of our situation, and the chance of giving a favorable turn to the negociations on foot for peace, rendered it of little comparative signification. The objections were finally retracted, and both the propositions agreed to. The Deputation elected were Mr. Osgood, Mr. Mifflin & Mr. Nash taken from different parts of the U.S. & each from States which had fully adopted the Impost, and represented in Congress without them; except Mr. O whose State, he being alone, was not represented without him.

  Dear Sir, Confidential at present. Philadelphia. Decemr. 7th. 1782. I wrote you not long since a lengthy Letter (1)--containing but little besides conjectures--since which no foreign intelligence has transpired. But my dear friend, I am sorry to say Domestic matters afford a much larger field of disagreable intelligence, than I can at this time improve--shall therefore content my self at present with giving the Outlines. I will suppose a system adopted wch. in the end, if not prevented, will ruin the Liberties we have so dearly purchased & so nearly secured. If the Appointment of a Civil list, with such enormous Salaries, as swallow up a very considerable part of all the Taxes which the people now pay--and to which Salaries additions are made or solicited to be made--as fast as new sources of revenue can be invented. If the entire neglect of settling and Liquidating public debts, whereby the Creditors may be satisfied & public Credit restored, upon the Constitutional principles of Confederation. If the seeking not only by recommendations but by positive demands (accompanied by threats of vengeance in Case of non compliance--tho' not in a Public capacity, yet by Persons in the first Public Stations, spoken in private Capacities). An enlargement of Powers, beyond the Confederation and which amount to nothing short of a total surrender of their Liberties--without any other plea--for such requisition--but Necessity (which necessity--has been in a great measure it is to be feared designedly created in order to found the plea upon) and if the most illegal, arbitrary, & unconstitutional measures pursued and pursuing, contrary to the faith of a Nation solemnly & sacred pledged, merely on a wanton supposition that Power is possessed, sufficient to carry such measures into execution and to this and Edicts, and Peremptory Mandates are Issued--to be immediately complied with and in case of non compliance--the Military force of the Nation--directed to compel it, when the People against whom this Edict has passed--has never been notified, of the charges against them--or had an Opportunity to defend & exculpate themselves--from those Charges--but are condemned ex parte--their Accusers, being the only Witnesses--and who are also the Party said to be aggrieved! If the Continually appointing or promoting new Officers of high Rank in the Military Line & dismissing them upon half pay for Life--because they were confessedly unnecessary, in the Army at the time of their Appointment or Promotion and who by this means, become dependant on those who appointed them--for their half Pay & emoluments--and are therefore of necessity--interested to enlarge the powers of Government, so as to enable them to fulfil their engage- DECEMBER 7, 1782  ments with them--however hard, disagreable & burthensome it may be to the Industrious Citizen, Artizan or Farmer--to have monies for such purposes--drawn from them--(and who never will unless debased to a state of Abject Slavery). I say sir--if these, and many other circumstances, equally striking and alarming--will warrant the supposition aforesd.--it no longer remains a doubt. These truths will very soon be announced to the public--in whom I yet maintain a Confidence, that there is sufficient Virtue to effectually oppose & prevent the Evil which impends. I should have added above another Circumstance, not less suspicious than any mentioned, which is the Neglect of Paying the Army, who are kept in a suffering state for want of it and who are constantly told, the deficiency arises from the inattention of the several States, their inability to raise the necessary sums by constitutional Taxation, and that they are not to expect it, unless the States can be prevailed with to invest Government with the powers before mentioned--by this means an undue & unjust jealousy is excited in the Army against the Citizens--who they are by such Artifice taught to consider in the light of enemies--and their whole Affection absorbed in the Measures of Goverment who they are taught to look up to as their Fathers & protectors & who would also be their generous supporters, were they duly empowered by the States for that purpose And It should be particularly noticed that during this time the Army is unpaid--the Salaries of the Civil List, from One to four or five Thousand Dollars per Annum are supposed to be regularly satisfied!!! I do not know positively that the whole of the sd. Salaries are paid--but from circumstances have reason to suppose it. I will trouble you with one Circumstance more. Upon a Friday Mr. Howell & myself (& I believe every other Member) had Cards to dine with a Certain Officer in the Civil List (2)--(who has 4000 Dollars PerAnn.--exclusive of larger Allowances for Subs[istence]). The Thursday following--on Monday between--the sd. Officer made known by a Lengthy Memorial--in which Matters were accurately stated--his desire to Resign--for this Reason, That he held another Office in a certain State--which interfered with this and from which his State would not or did not release him. So far (you will say) is very good--true--but the Memorial closed with a hint, that the expences of the Office the last year had been, If memory fails not, more than Three Thousand Dollars over the 4000, allowed!!! and a wish was expressed to this effect, that if it was judged proper to release him--whoever should be appointed as a successor might be considered in expences--by a due increase of Salary!!! Upon considering the Case We tho' t fit, ie Mr H & myself, to decline his invitation--which has   been considered as an Affront--but I have the satisfaction to add--that thro' Mr. Howells influence--in which I most heartily concurred, contrary to the expectation not to say of him, but of his Friends--His resignation was Accepted. This was so mortifying a Circumstance, that, it cannot be forgiven, and we are both in a Situation--disagreable enough. But from an Inward Consciousness of having Acted from upright Principles, & for the Interest of Our Constituents--we console ourselves with these lines of the Poet. One Self approving hour whole years outweighs Of stupid starers & of loud Huzzas-- And more true joy, Marcellus exil'd feels Than Caesar, with a Senate at his heels.(3) God bless & preserve you & yours, My dear sir. Adieu. Jona Arnold NB. As my last was fill'd with Conjectures, I thought best to give in this only naked facts & submit to you as Commentator.

  Saturday Decr. 7. [1782] No Congress The Grand Committee met again on the business of the old paper emissions, and agreed to the plan reported by the subcommittee in pursuance of Mr. Fitzimmon's motion,(1) vz. that the outstanding bills should be taken up & certificates issued in place thereof at the rate of 1 real Dollar for nominal ds. and that the surpluses redeemed by particular states shod. be credited to them at the same rate. Mr. Carroll alone dissented to the plan, alledging that a law of Maryland was adverse to it which he considered as equipollent to an instruc-tion.(2) For filling up the blank several rates were proposed 1st. 1 for 40 on which all the votes were no except Mr. Howell--2d. 1 for 75 no. Mr. White & Mr. Howel ay. 3d. 1 for 100. no. Mr. Hamilton & Mr. Fitzimmons ay. 4th. 1 for 150. no. Mr. Fitz. & H. ay. The reasons urged in favor of 1 for 40 were first an adherence to public faith, secondly that the depreciation of the certificates would reduce the rate sufficiently low, they being now negociated at the rate of three or four for one. The reason for 1 for 75 was that the bills passed at that rate when they were called in, in the Eastern States for 1 for 100--that as popular ideas were opposed to the stipulated rate, and as adopting the current rate might hurt the credit of other securities which derived their value  DECEMBER 7, 1782  from an opinion that they would be strictly redeemed, it was best to take an arbitrary rate, leaning to the side of liberality--for 1 for 150 that this was the medium depreciation when the circulation ceased. The opposition to these several rates came from the Southem Delegates, in some of whose States none, in others but little had been redeemed, & in all of which the depreciation had been much greater.(3) On this side it was observed by that the States which had redeemed a surplus, or even their quotas, had not done it within the period fixed by Congress but in the last stages of depreciation, & in a great degree, even after the money had ceased to circulate; that since the supposed Cessation the money had generally changed hands at a value far below any rate that had been named; that the principle established by the plan of the 18th of March 1780, with respect to the money in question was, that the Holder of it sd. receive the value at which it was current & at which it was presumed he had received it; that a different rule adopted with regard to the same money in different stages of its downfal wd. give general dissatisfaction. The Committee adjourned without coming to any decision.(4) ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, Decr. 9th, 1782. Inclosed we have the honor to transmit Your Excellency sundry resolutions of Congress of the 5th instant;(1) by which you will judge of the present temper of that body, respecting the affairs of the grants. We cannot, however, absolutely rely upon the execution of the coercive part of them if the matter should require an exertion of force. Many who at a distance adopt very decisive ideas, might shrink from a measure replete with consequences at least delicate, if not dangerous. The principal advantage we promise ourselves from these resolutions is, that they will give a complexion to the future deliberations on the subject and may induce Congress the more readily to adopt some moderate medium. It, therefore, becomes the policy of the State to facilitate as much as lies in its power this object, by doing everything (if anything remains undone) that may tend to conciliate the inhabitants of the Grants, and to take away all motives of opposition from the private interests of individuals in the other States. It is to be recollected in particular that a considerable part of the army is interested in grants of land to a large extent under the usurped government of Vermont. Much will depend upon their disposition in the progress of the business, and it is, therefore, of primary importance that they should be secured at all events. We apprehend there should be a confirmation of their titles unfettered by any condition whatsoever; if any are annexed by the acts of last Winter relative to that subject (which we do not find among our papers) we take the liberty to suggest that they will be worthy the future consideration of the legislature.(2) We enlarge the less on these topics as we are persuaded the wisdom of the State will distinguish and pursue the true line of policy upon this occasion, and will clearly perceive the propriety of moderation. Congress have resolved to send a deputation of three members to the State of Rhode Island to urge their compliance with the requisition of the five per Cent duty as a measure essential to the safety and reputation of these states. The members chosen are Mr. Mifflin, Mr. Nash and Mr. Osgood. We have the honor to be With perfect respect, Yr Excellency's Most Obedt. Hum. Serv.

I had the honor of opening the Captains to gratify her Excys. Curiosity which I hope will not be unpardonable. She has got about again this day & I hope will be entirely relieved from her Pains in the Teeth. I am sorry the Colts will be so much Trouble, but I do not know what to do with them. If there is stable Room, I wish all of them were stabled to prevent their Injuring the Neighbours. I will try hard to dispose of the oldest if possible. As to the Hay I am not uneasy about it, as I know it will be very high in the Spring. I have been already applied to for five Tons by a Person 15 Miles from the Ridge, who proposed carting it that distance. It will be £7 & £8 per Ton in the Spring. We have recd the Sweet Meats, Candle Sticks &ca. We now want the Broaches only, having purchased the others.

The Siege is raised & we hope now that they will be ready to act in the West Indies. This is unpalatable News--to Counterbalance it, the French have succeeded in an Expedition to Hudsons Bay, where they have taken of the Company's property to the amount of £500,000 Sterl. & destroyed all the Companys Settlements & brought off the Inhabitants.(1) I recd Letters this day from Genl Greene of the 12th  DECEMBER 10, 1782  Ultimo--he speaks of the Evacuation as a certainty.

On the opposite side it was exclaimed agst. as a degradation of so high a servt. of the U. S. as exposing him to the temerity of leaders who were on good grounds suspected of being hostile to the U.

  My dear Sir Philada. 10th Decr. 1782. The Assembly of Penna. have with much difficulty been prevailed on to desist from a plan in which a part of the Requisition of Congress allotted for other uses was to be appropriated to their citizens creditors of the U.S.(1) The consequences apprehended by Congress from such an example, and the probability that the plan will be renewed at the next meeting unless some intermediate provision be made for the credit of the U.S. have produced two Resolutions 1st. an instruction to the Superintendt of Finance to represent to the States the pernicious tendency of such unconstitutional appropriations; 2dly. a deputation of Mr. Osgood, Mr. Mifflin & Mr. Nash to enforce on Rhode the impost of 5 perCt.(2) The latter Resolution besides its tendency to the immediate end proposed by the first, was called for (3) {the general pressure of our necessities}.(4) Our official letter incloses these Resolutions to the Executive, and hazards some {very free and alarming} remarks for {the legislature} directly pointing to {a fuller compliance} with {the impost}.(5) I have added a private letter to the Governor (6) which is still more explicit & pointed on the subject. In the present situation of our affairs, we did not think less would justify us to ourselves or to our Constituents. Mr. Harrison at Cadiz has advised the Secy. of Foreign Affairs that the British fleet under Admiral Howe had effected the relief of Gibralter, by decoying the combined fleets from their station, & throwing in succours, before the weather would allow the latter to regain it. He says the British fleet on its return was pursued by the Combined fleet.(7) The Vessel by which this letter came reports that she passed through the Combined fleet after she left Cadiz, and that two Spanish ships had been lost, one having fallen into the hands of the Enemy & the other chased on shore by them. Mr. Harrison adds as a more welcome article that a detachment of Frigates &c which had been sent from Cape Francois for the demolition of the British Factories on Hudson's Bay had arrived in Europe with a report of complete success, having destroyed & taken effects to the value of half a million Sterlg. The Secy. of F.A. has resigned his office in form, but will continue to act for the present month, to prevent an interregnum in the Department. The 19th instant is fixed for the choice of a Successor. No one has yet been put in nomination.(8) DECEMBER 10, 1782  By Mr. Jefferson's letter to the Office of F.A. and a private one to myself, he may be expected here about the end of this month.(9) It is improper therefore to address any thing to him. The Grand Committee have had another meeting on the subject mentioned in a late letter. The scheme of Mr. Fitz____n's was adopted with the {rates of} depreciation {left blank}. The ideas on this point varied from forty to one hundred and fifty and upwards for one.(10) ""

  [December 10, 1782] (1) The public Creditors have for sometime past been extremely urgent for some effectual & permanent provision in their favor; and seeing but little prospect of obtaining it from the United States are turning their applications to their own States. Those who are Citizens of Pennsylvania in particular have adopted this policy and the Legislature having recd. no Satisfactory answer to two Memorials presented to Congress in their favor have been on the point of appropriating to their use a part of the requisition of Congress allotted for more essential Objects. Should such a measure be resorted to by one State it would probably be received by the Others as a Signal to take care each of its separate interest. The Effects of such a Step on the Union itself, on the Common Defence, on our national Character and on the Councils of the Enemy need not be traced. The apprehension of them by Congress produced the inclosed Instructions to the Superintendant of finance. The resolution which follows deputing three of their Members to Rhode Island to enforce the impost of 5 per Ct. was thought a precausion no less essential.(2) For besides the tendency of  DECEMBER 10, 1782  this Fund if vested in the United States to prevent undue appropriations by the States we find by Melancholly experience that the annual contributions of the States if left to the entire appropriation of Congress are not only unequal to the annual expence, but unequal in point both of amount & punctuality to the interest of the annual expence. Unless some more effectual provision therefore be made for public credit every one must preconceive the dangers and perplexities which await us. The enemy already take courage from the prospect and the little progress made by Mr. Adams's Loan between his Letter in June & his last in August makes it probable that the attention of our friends has also been drawn to this subject.(3) Indeed their disposition to lend at all can only have resulted from an ignorance of our affairs which the enemy would take care should not be of long continuance. How far the repugnance of Rhode island to the impost will yield to these considerations is uncertain, as it is how far they will further reconcile to that measure the States which have but partially acceded to it. Our Duty however requires that we should submit them thus--thro' your Excellency to the Judgment of our constituents. ""

  Sir, Philadelphia, December 11th. 1782. Congress are equally affected and alarmed by the information they have received, that the Legislature of your State, at their last meeting, have refused their concurrence in the establishment of a duty upon Imposts. They consider this measure as so indispensible to the prosecution of the War, that a sense of duty and regard to the common safety compel them to renew their efforts to engage a compliance with it; and in this view they have determined to send a Deputation of three of their Members to your State, as expressed in the inclosed Resolution.(1) The Gentlemen they have appointed will be able to lay before you a full and just representation of the public affairs, from which they flatter themselves will result a conviction of the propriety of their solicitude upon the present occasion. Convinced by past experience of the zeal and patriotism of the State of Rhode-Island, they cannot doubt that it will yield to those urgent considerations which flow from a knowledge of our true situation. They will only briefly observe, that the increasing discontents of the army, the loud clamours of the public creditors, and the extreme disproportion between the current supplies and the demands of the public service, are so many invincible arguments for the fund recommended by Congress. They feel themselves unable to devise any other, that will be more efficacious, less exceptionable or more generally agreeable; and if this is rejected they anticipate calamities of a most menacing nature, with this consolation however, that they have faithfully discharged their trust, and that the mischiefs which may follow cannot be attributed to them. A principal object of the proposed fund is to procure loans abroad. If no security can be held out to Lenders, the success of these must necessarily be very limited. The last accounts upon the subject were not flattering; and when intelligence shall arrive in Europe that the State of Rhode-Island has disagreed to the only fund, which has yet been devised, there is every reason to apprehend it will have a fatal influence on their future progress. Deprived of this resource our affairs must, in all probability, rapidly hasten to a dangerous crisis, and these States be involved in greater embarrassments than they have yet experienced, and from which it may be much more difficult to emerge. Congress will only add a request to your Excellency, that if the Legislature should not be sitting, it may be called together as speedily as possible to enable the Gentlemen whom they have deputed to perform the purpose of their mission. I have the honor to be, with sentiments of high respect and esteem, your Excellency's, &c. E. B. DECEMBER 11, 1782  ""

The substance of the Report is that Settlements should be Immediately made by the United States up to the last Day of December 1781. The propriety of this measure and the Impropriety of Such Settlements being made by the States Individually is much Urged; we Shall Endeavour to have this matter determined as soon as possible, and (for Sundry reasons) are Induced to Urge that Settlements Should be made by the States Individually up to the last Day of Decr. 1781. You have Inclosed Sundry Resolutions passed the 5th Instt. Respecting the affairs of Vermont; a Resolution is now under Consideration for Assigning a Day when Congress will make their Final Determination respecting that Territory. This we Endeavoured to have determined in season to be Transmitted by this Post, but it has met with such Obstructions as has hitherto prevented, it will probably be done in few Days--as the final Determination of this matter is of very great  DECEMBER 11, 1782  Importance we have to repeat the request, that the Honorable the Legislature would be pleased to give their Explicit Instructions on the Subject. They will Undoubtedly Examine the Act of November 1779, and other Resolutions and Instructions now in force, on this Subject. It is probable the first Question will be whether they shall be a Seperate and Independent State; if this Should be Determined in the Negative we should then wish to know whether the Honorable The Legislature would desire to have the matter determined in the Mode prescribed by the Ninth Article of Confederation, or Attempt an Agreement and Accomodation repecting the Same with New-York & Massachusetts. We have frequently heard while in the State that this Affair might be Easily Settled, but although much has been done by the State to obtain a Settlement; Special Agents have been Appointed for the purpose; and it is now more than Three Years Since the Act passed Submitting the affair to Congress, Still it remains Unsettled and is greatly Embarrassed. Inclosed is an Extract of a Letter from Genl. Greene to the Secretary at War respecting the Evacuation of Charlestown.(2) Three Members of Congress Viz Mr. Osgood of Massachtts., Genl.

  Novemr. [i.e., December] 12th. [1782] (1) I was equally sorry My Dear friend that you were absent when I called at your house: I should have been happy to have seen you to converse on many things.  DECEMBER 12, 1782  You seem to wish a further explanation of the reasons which prevented the success of my application on a certain head.(2) They were purely what I conjectured--a desire to conciliate a certain Gentleman on the spot and gain his influence in some matters of importance; but this I mention in confidence.  There is nothing I can recommend to your attention at your next meeting, so interesting as your system of taxation. In all probability the war will not end here and to carry it on we require absolutely more solid arrangements of finance, besides you ought to adopt them with a view to your own internal prosperity and to your future security as a state. I should also be glad to see a good establishment for your militia adopted, something like that of Swisserland. God grant the union may last, but it is too frail now to be relied on, and we ought to be prepared for the worst. I inclose you a few outlines on the subject. Show them to our friend Malcolm, and under the character of Adjutant General or Inspector or whatever else you please, put the execution in his hands. The affairs of Vermont will engage your attention; be moderate by all means. You will see our ideas in a late letter to the Governor.(3) They certainly will have a good effect if adopted. Meet New Hampshire on compromising grounds. I wish the two states would appoint commissioners and make a division; if a slice were given to Massachusettes it would be good policy and silence all opposition. A measure of this nature will meet the general support of Congress. I believe something will be recommended with a view to it, so soon as we have a fuller representation.

  My dear Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 16th 1782 I am obliged to write to you whenever I can catch a Moment, tho'  DECEMBER 16, 1782  several days before Post day, or loose the Opportunity, my Time no longer being at my own disposal. You[r] favour per Post is before me, and am really sorry that the Capt's Letter was omitted, which was never discovered till the rect of yours this Morning--It is now remedied. We have as usual had a hearty Laugh at your Letter--and diverted ourselves at the Idea of your seeing it in Rivingtons Paper. I think it is most time to expect another Capture of the Mail & therefore you should begin to consider, how you would relish becoming so public a Man. A Frigate will go for Brest in about 8 or 10 Days, in which is a Capt of my Acquaintance. I can send Letters to Madeira very frequently. I am clear you had best stable the Colts &c. Mr Wallace will call on you for 5 Tons of Hay; if you think it can be spared, let him have it out of my Stacks--if not he can get it of Ricky on Mr Livingston's Estate acct. Mrs. B. engaged to let Southerd exchange a Cow. Manage the foddering of the Hay in such Manner as you think best. I recd. the Bills of Exchange, but had not adverted to my part of the money remitted being some in the Hands of Mr Donaldson & some in Mess Cromelines--So that I cannot proceed unless you can manage it so that I can get at that in Mr Donaldsons Hand too. Sammy has remitted monies to Holland & drawn a Bill in Favour of Mr D. to pay off his Debt--now as Mr D. is dead, could not Sammy give you a Bill in full of Mr D's Debt, and you let me have it on the acct of my part of the monies in his Hands, or any how else, so that I could get the Cash in Holland or France. As to News the Charles Town Garrison is said to be arrived at N York but it wants Confirmation. Our Advices from Europe are still flattering. I am not at liberty to say more--you know I have been a Prophet abt. the Events of this Year--I still am sanguine. Capt Barry in a Conty Frigate,(1) taken 5 Jamaica Men & some American Privateers. 12 or 14 More--several others with two British Line of Battle Ships, went to the Bottom in a violent Storm. I will take Care of the rent. Patty is bravely, tho' you seem to forget her. All well and desire to be remembered. Am my Dr Sir, Yours Afftly (2) [P.S.] You will see by this, that tho Presidt. I am still under petticoat Government and dare not contradict, tho' it is some Comfort that no body will believe her. Her Character is as bad here as it was at the Ridge--were she is well known. Pray remember that the office in snowy weather is leaky and that my Papers & Books may be injured. I must beg the Favour of you to get Mr Southerd to see that the Boards at Bairds saw Mill are brought home & properly put away in the waggon House, as fast as my Logs are sawed and also to get as many more Logs out of the swamp as possible & charge it to me.

  Dear Sir, Philada. Decr. 16. 1782 Congress last Thursday took up the report for establishing a Line of promotion for Brigadiers Similar to the one I lately informed you was rejected, which, owing to a Number of New members or some other Cause, was passed: to this was added a Clause for promoting your self & Colonels Grattan & Putman (1)--but as the former part of the report had passed it was thought improper to pass this as it might not agree with the plan just established especially with regard to your self, as your Appointment would depend upon what state whose troops those of New Jersey may be Brigaded with. If it should be with New York, you can have nothing to expect, but if with Delaware I suppose you will succeed of Course. This the secretary at War gives me strong reasons to believe will be the case--but however must rest with the Commander in Chief; As the secretary at War set off yesterday for Boston (2) & will call at head quarters, by which time the General will be in possession of the Resolutions, you may be able to know on what gound you stand by applying to the Commander in Chief.

(Respecting Mr. Blanchard's Memorial) with the Inclosure's came to hand on the 9th Instt. and was Answered on the 11th (per Post) which hope you will timely receive.(1) Those Two are all the Letters have been favored with from you Since that of the 14th Septr. I Expected an Answer to mine of 29th Octr. respecting the affairs of Vermont, but we are Intirely Ignorant of all the Transactions of the Honble. the Legislature at their November Session (Except that of Mr Blanchards Memorial). By the latest accounts from Europe, it appears probable that Negociations for Peace will be seriously Entered upon soon, but their are many (Seperate) Interests to be adjusted which will probably require much time. The present designs of our Enemy are not known to us with so much Certainty as could wish, but it is the general Sentiment that they have relinquished the Idea of further prosecuting the war on this Continent. Indeed it is time for them for they have persisted in it to their Own (as well as our) great Injury. The Importance of the United States is daily Increasing (abroad) But our affairs at Home are not in a pleasing Situation by any means. The want of Revenue is very great, our Army are unpaid, public Creditors Clamorous, and when we add to this a want of Confidence in the public and in the Several States towards each other our Embarrassments will appear (as they are in fact) very great, but we have Struggled through many difficulties, and our present trouble's  DECEMBER 17, 1782  should by no means Operate as an Encouragement to our Enemy to prosecute the war, for they have repeatedly Seen (and I doubt not will again if necessity requires it) these United States rise Superior to all difficulties. From some Information already received, are daily Expecting further Information respecting Negociations for Peace. I Have (few Days Since) been informed that application has been made to New Hampr. for Compleating their Two Battalions; this was unknown to Congress, and had I been informed of it Seasonably should have given my Sentiments on the Subject. I Sent a list of the Army to Collo. Bartlett some Months Since, (2) my Views were that you might know what number of the Troops in service belonged to N.H. I am Sure the State has made Exertions the year past (in raising Troops much beyond their abilities, and as I See no real Necessity for raising men at present, shall be pleased if they have rejected the proposition. No accounts from Charlestown since our Letter of the 11th Instt.; nor further proceedures respecting Vermont. Genl. Whipple is at Trenton, I Expect he will be here sometime next Week. [Public securities here, are sold at about Three, for One in Specie]. You will receive by Mr. White's Servant the Journals of Congress (which are Just published) from April to Novr.--if the State has not a Compleat Sett to that time, and I am informed what are deficient, I will Endeavour to procure and Send them if Opporty offers. You will receive a Bottle of Dr. Hill's Balsam. I wrote Collo. Bartlett on the 23d Octr. but have had no answer to that Letter; It is very agreeable to be informed of the Transactions in the State from time to time. I return you my most Sincere thanks for your Letter by Genl. Whipple and shall Esteem it a happiness to serve you in what I may. I have marked this as private, my meaning is that it is not Intended for the perusal of the Honble. the Legislature, but you will please to make such other Communication of it as you may think proper. Please to give my Compliments to my Friends with you. I am, with great Respect, Your Obedt. & Hum. Servt. John Taylor Gilman P.S.

  My dear Sir Philada. 17th Decr. 1782. Since the appointment of the deputation to Rho. Island Congress have recd. a copy of the refusal of the Legislature of that State to concur in the impost, with the reasons on which the refusal is grounded. The reasons assigned are 1st. the inequality of the tax which will bear hardest on the commercial States, and peculiarly hard on Rho. Island which is the most commercial. 2dly. the inexpediency of admitting to a collection within the State of so large a tax an officer unknown to the Constitution, and unaccountable to the authority of the State. 3dly. the danger to public liberty from such an accession of weight to the foederal Government. I give this recital from memory and therefore only as the substance of the objections. They are in the hands of a Committee who will report such observations as they may deem a fit answer to them.(1) The deputation has not yet set out, but probably will in the course of the week.(2) Vermont has been again on the tapis. Its only advocates were the delegates of Rho. Island who are charged with interested views in the case, and those of N. Jersey who are fettered by instructions from their  DECEMBER 17, 1782  Constituents.(3) I understand that a Mr. Titchner one of the Agents formerly here is arrived from Vermont, probably in consequence of a signal given of the revolution wch. is taking place in the foederal Councils with respect to them. A little time will display his errand.(4) General Greene has referred to Congress a case which admonishes them of the necessity of a code for captures & recaptures on land as well as on water. A detachment of the continental forces having retaken a number of Horses which had been taken by the enemy from Citizens of S. Carolina, the Executive Authority of the State demanded a restitution, on the general principle that the Original owners were entitled to all recaptured property. This demand was laid before a Council of officers which decided against its validity. The General has submitted the case to Congress for their final judgment.(5) It appears from a review of the proceedings of Congress, that a very defective provision only has been made for captures, and no provision at all for recaptures, on land.(6) The opinion of the Council of war is conformable to the practice of the Army in like cases, and to the rules observed by other nations. The demand of restitution in favor of the original proprietors is warranted by the principles of equity and the Spirit of the Ordinance relating to Captures on Water. All that Congress can do in the case will be to remit to the Original owners the prize which has been adjudged to the U.S. But some general provision for future cases will be necessary in which it will be not easy to define the species of property of which restitution may be claimed. To extend the rule to every species of property would open a door to innumerable disputes and abuses. I observe on this occasion what had escaped me before, that if Congress should establish a Court for Captures on land, such cases can come before it only on appeal.(7) (Official Cypher) Letters from {Franklin and Jay dated late in September shew that a commission has been issued to Oswald to treat with commissioners of the thirteen United States by which some precedent obstacles were surmounted and that Spain mediates an immoderate defalcation of our western ter[r]itory}.(8) All this {intelligence however has come to us in obscure fragment[s].(9) I commi[t] it to you as to a member of Congress on whom secresy is enjoined and in this} cypher {as} certainly unknown {to all but official persons}. The inclosed gazette will inform you of the good fortune of the Capt. Barry of the Alliance Frigate. It appears from various letters from Europe that the Jamaica fleet has suffered severely from privateers & the storm. The Court at Trenton will finish their business this week it is said. The Pennsylvanians alledge that the cause is going hollow in their favor.(10) I have no letter from you by this post which I impute to your visit to Williamsbg.  ""

  Wednesday Decr. 18th.

If the affair could have been closed without an insertion of his name on the Journal, He seemed willing to withdraw his protest; (2) but the impropriety which appeared to some & particularly to Mr. H____n in suppressing the name of the author of a peice wch.

  Friday Decr. 20th. [1782] (1) A motion was made by Mr. H____n (2) for revising the requisitions of the preceding and present years, in order to reduce them more within the faculties of the States.(3) In support of the motion it was urged that the exorbitancy of the demands produced a despair of fulfilling them which benumbed the efforts for that purpose. On the other side it was alledged that a relaxation of the demand would be followed by a relaxation of the efforts; that unless other resources were substituted either the States would be deluded by such a measure into false expectations; or in case the truth sd. be disclosed to prevent that effort, that the Enemy wd. be encouraged to Persevere in the war agst. us. The motion meeting with little patronage was withdrawn. The Report of the Committee on the motion of Mr. H.(4) proposed that the Secy. of Congress should transmit the several acts of Congress with a state of foreign loans. The object of the Committee was that in case Rho. Island should abet or not resent the misconduct of their Representative, as wd. most likely be the event, Congress might commit themselves as little as possible in the mode of referring it to that State. When the Report came under consideration it was observed, that the Presidt. had always transmitted acts of Congress to the Executives of the States, and that such a change on the present occasion might afford a pretext if not excite a disposition in Rho. Island, not to vindicate the honor of Congress. The matter was compromised by substi[tu]ting the Secy. of Fn.

  Monday 23d. December [1782].

  Sir. Philadelphia, 23rd. December 1782 I take the earliest opportunity of advising your Honor, That this Day Congress received Dispatches from their Ministers for Peace at Paris,(1) giving Them the agreeable Intelligence of the British King having granted a plenery Commission, under the great Seal of Great Britain, to Mr. Oswald of London, constituting Him a Commission in his behalf \""to make a Peace or Truce with the Thirteen United States of America,\"" Viz. \""New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay &c.\"" This Commission (a certified copy whereof is received by Congress) revokes in  DECEMBER 23, 1782  express words ONE which was made in August last, empowering Mr. Oswald to treat &c. with the Commission, or Commissioners of the THIRTEEN UNITED COLONIES of America, Messrs Franklin, Jay &c. refused to negotiate with the British Commissioner under any Commission, which did not precisely admit, and recognize the Independence of America. This Refusal operated so powerfully upon Mr. Oswald That He immediately dispatched a Courier to his Court, and He was soon invested with authority to make the explicit Designation, and acknowledgment of our respective, independent Governments. Congress has charged the Minister of Foreign Affairs to transmit to the several Executives of the States a Copy of Mr. Oswald's Commission and an Extract from Dr. Franklin's letter.(2) I am not at Liberty Sir to enter into the particulars of the Dispatches received, Congress having for wise purposes enjoined the Members to Secrecy: But your Honor may be assured, That our Affairs in Europe wear a pleasing and most promising Aspect.

Her dispatches are just come up and I heartily congratulate you on Great Brittain's having admitted our Independance, by sending Mr. Oswald to Paris with a Commission to treat of Peace with Commissioners from the 13  DECEMBER 24, 1782  Colonies, which our Commissioners absolutely refused to treat upon--in Consequence whereof Great Brittain has given up the Matter and issued a formal Commission to treat with \""any Commissioner or Commissioners from the 13 united States of America\"" and to enter into all the necessary Stipulations as with an Independant Nation. The Rubicon is therefore Past and I am happy that my Expectations are likely to be fulfilled. It is also said that Madrass is taken. I am not at liberty to say more than is contained in the following Extract. \""From several asiatic Accts. there is great probability that Madrass has been taken by the French Troops which have landed at Porto Neuvo and the Army of Hyder Ally with whom they have made a Junction, but no official Acct has come to hand, and this Intelligence cannot be given as a certainty.\"" From Mr. Adams--\""We have at length the Consent of all the Cities & Provinces, and have adjusted & agreed upon every Article, Word, Syllable, Letter & Point in the Treaty of Commerce and Clerks are employed in making out fair Copies for Signature, which will be done this week.

  Teusday 24 Decr. [1782] The letter from Mr. Jay inclosing copy of the intercepted letter from (1) was laid before Congress.(2) The tenor of it with the comments of Mr. J affected deeply the sentiments of Congress with regard to {France}.(3) The policy in particular manifested by {France} of keeping us tractable by leaving the British in possession of posts in this country awakened strong jealousies, corroborated the charges on that subject, and with concomitant circumstances may engender the opposite extreme of the gratitude & cordiality towards {France}; as the closest friends on a rupture are apt to become the bitterest foes. Much will depend however on the course pursued by Britain. The liberal one (4) seems to be pursuing will much promote an alienation of temper in A.(5) from {France}. It is not improbable that the intercepted letter from Marbois came thro' his hands. If G.B. therefore yields the Fitsheries & the back territory, A. will feel the obligation to her not to {France} who appears to be illiberal as to the 1st & favorable to Spain as to the 2d object; and consequently has forfeited the confidence of the States interested in either of them. Candor will suggest however that the situation of {France} is & has been extremely perplexing. The object of her blood & money was not only the independence, but the commerce and gratitude of America; the commerce to render Independence the more useful, the gratitude to render that Commerce the more permanent. It was necessary therefore she supposed that America should be exposed to the cruelties of her Enemies, and be made sensible of her own weakness in order to be grateful to the hand which relieved her. This policy if discovered tended, on the other hand to spoil the whole. Experience shews that her truest policy would have been to relieve A. by the most direct & generous means, & to have mingled with them no artifice whatever. With respect to Spain also the situation of {France} has been & is peculiarly delicate. The claims & views of Spn & A. interfere. The former attempts of B. to seduce Sp. to a separate peace, & the ties of {France} with the latter required of her to favor Spain, at least to a certain  DECEMBER 24, 1782  degree, at the expence of A. Of this G.B. is taking advantage. If {France} adheres to Sp., G.B. espouses the views of A.; & endeavours to draw her off from {France}. If {France} sd. adhere to A. in her claims, B. might espouse those of Sp & produce a breach between her {France}, and in either case B. wd. divide her enemies. If {France} acts wisely she will prefer the friendship of A. to that of Spain. If A. acts wisely she will see that she is with respect to her great interests, more in danger of being seduced by B. than sacrificed by {France}. The deputation to R.I. had set out on the 22d & proceeded ½ days journey. Mr. N. casually mentioned a private letter from Mr. P. to Mr. M.(6) informing that the Legislature of Virga. had in consequence of the final refusal of R.I. repealed her law for the impost. As this circumstance if true destroyed in the opinion of the deputies the chief argt. to be used by them viz the unanimity of the other States, they determined to return & wait for the Southern post to know the truth of it. The post failing to arrive on the 23d the usual day, the deputies on this day came in to Congress and stated the case. Mr. M. read to Congress the paragraph in the letter from Mr. P. Congress verbally resolved that the departure of the Deputies for R.I. sd. be suspended untill the further order of Congress;(7) Mr. M. promising to give any information he might receive by the post. The arrival of the post immediately ensued. A letter to Mr M. from Mr. R. confirmed the fact, & was communicated to Congress.(8) The most intelligent members were deeply affected & prognosticated a failure of the scheme, & the most pernicious effects to the character, the duration, & the interests of the confederacy. It was at length, notwithstanding, determined to persist in the attempt for permanent revenue, and a Committee was appointed to report the steps proper to be taken.(9) A motion was made by Mr. R____dge to strike out the salvage for recaptures on land, on the same principle as he did the words \""accruing to the use of the U.S.\"" As the latter had been retained by barely 7 States, and one of these was not present the motion of Mr. R. succeeded. Some of Those who were on the other side, in consequence, voted agst. the whole resolution & it failed. By compromise it passed as reported by the Committee.(10) The grand Committee reported after another meeting with respect to the old money. that it sd. be rated at 40 for 1. The Chair decided on a question raised, that according to rule the blank sd. not have been filled by the Committee, so the rate was expunged.(11) ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Decr. 24th. 1782 Since my last the Danae a French frigate has arrived from France with money for the French army and public despatches. A snow storm drove her on shore in this Bay where she was in danger of following the fate of one the last Frigates from France. The accident as it turned out only cost her all her masts. The despatches for Congress are from Mr. Franklin, Mr. Jay & the Marquis de la Fayette, and come down to the 14th Ocr.(1) They advise that the 1st Commission issued to Mr. Oswald empowered him to treat with certain Colonies &c. which being objected, another issued explicitly empowering him to Treat with Commisrs. from the thirteen United States. The latter, of which a copy was inclosed, and which will be transmitted to the Executives,(2) is grounded on the Act of Parliament, but is to continue in force no longer than July 1783. It is no doubt on the whole a source of very soothing expectations, But if we view on one side the instability & insidiousness of the British Cabinet, and on the other the complication of interests and pretensions among the Allies, prudence calls upon us to temper our expectations with much distrust. Mr. Adams concluded his Treaty of Amity & Commerce on the 7th of Ocr. and had in hand 1½ Million of Florins out of the 5 Million for which subscriptions had been opened. As this however was the sum subscribed in June last, it is no certain evidence of any other progress than that of the payments. DECEMBER 24, 1782  There are accounts but neither official nor certain that Madrass had been taken by the combined arms of France & Hyder Ally. 3/5 of Constantinople had been reduced to ashes by incendiaries inspired with the desperate purpose by the public distresses and a blind revenge agst. the Vizier who was regarded as the cause of them. The havoc suffered by the French & Spaniards in the attempt to storm Gibralter before its relief, appears to have been dreadful indeed. The loss on the English side which amounted to about 500 is a proof that the effort was a bloody one. Mr. Livingston has been prevailed on to hold his office for this winter.(3) The election of a successor was within a moment of being made when the practicability of retaining his services was discovered. The Gentlemen in nomination were {General Schuyler}(4) & Mr. {Clymer}. Mr. {Reed} had been nominated but withdrawn. The deputation for Rhode Island is still here. A report that Maryland is receding with respect to the object of their mission, and information conveyed in a letter from Mr. Pendleton to me that Virga. on hearing of the unanimous refusal of R.I. had repealed her accession, by disarming them of their most pointed argument has produced great hesitation. They wait at present however only for intelligence with respect to Md. & Va. which was expected by yesterday's post. But the post is not even yet come. The inferences which R.I. will probably draw from Oswalds Commission are another source of apprehension. If justice & honor however preside in her Councils she will feel as much the obligation of providing for the discharge of past engagements as for contracting those which may be necessary in future. Our debts at this moment liquidated & unliquidated, cannot I conceive be less than {forty million} Dollars. The interest therefore alone is a very serious object, and I am persuaded that unless it be raised by some plan which will operate at the same time & in due proportion throughout the Union, that neither its amount nor punctuality can be confided in. Besides the other obvious causes, a jealousy is already perceived among some States that others will eventually {elude their share of the burden}. The interest on the sum borrowed by Mr. A. is now running and soon will, if a part hath not already, become due. Nor is their any fund in contemplation for its payment but that of the Impost. Of[ficia]l Cy[phe]r. {The french army} are {embarking for the West Indies count R[ochambea]u} says that in case {the war} sd. {be renewed against us they will instantly return}. Great efforts will I fancy be {made on that theatre unless arrested by peace}. I need not give other intimations of secrecy of these points than the nature of them & the use of the Cypher p[ermits]. J.M. [P.S.] I intended the paper inclosed to Mr. A.(5) for you. You may exchange if worth while.  ""

These new powers were given in consequence of the absolute refusal of our Comrs. to treat under the first Commission to Mr. Oswald. You will receive a copy of the Commission transmitted to Congress from the Secretary of foreign affairs.(3) Some steps have been taken by the Comrs. subsequent to the receipt of these new powers but nothing so determined as to authorise the forming any conclusion, or what may ultimately be the issue of the negociations. When we reflect upon The different interests to be considered and the time necessary for their discussion and adjustment, we ought not to entertain too sanguine hopes of a speedy conclusion, even if it should ultimately be a favourable one, on the contrary prudence and sound policy dictate that we pursue with unremitting attention the measures proper for War untill we are certain they are no longer necessary.

DECEMBER 26, 1782  You will perceive by the Papers that his Brittanick Majesty has issued a Commission to Mr Oswald to conclude a Peace with the States of America, this Commission which is signed by the King amounts to an explicit Acknowledgment of our Independence. But the Duplicity of the british Court, Their Variation of Measures upon every Turn of Fortune, And the different Interests which are to be adjusted, renders the speedy establishment of Peace an Event farr from being certain. The Copy of the Commission made to Oswald has been given to our Ministers, and consequently the Avowal of our Independence having implicitly been clearly made, every Neutral Power can justify itself, by treating us as an independent Sovereignty.

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 26. 82 I had the pleasure to receive your's of the 13th Instant by Post. Mr. Nash is quite uneasy about his Bill as he has much Need of the Mony.(1) The Bill drawn by Mallett and Jewkes (2) on you for One hundred and Seventy Odd Dollars in favour of myself which I shewed to you before you left this, was sent me by Mr. Henry Toomer to raise Mony to assist his Brother Anthony Toomer with his Family Home (to the Southward) as I believe I told you when I presented it, and I have been obliged to advance him that and a larger Sum to enable him to leave this place. By the last Post, say on the 24th Inst. I received another Bill drawn by Mallett and Jewkes on you for 535¾ Dollars at thirty Days Sight. I hope you will not be disappointed in getting here by the last January as I purpose to set out for Carolina at all Events on the first Day of February and it is next to the Performance of Impossibilities for me to  DECEMBER 26, 1782  leave this without receiving the Mony from you on those two Bills. The Bills are both drawn on you at this place Philadelphia, and as you are absent I expect that you will admit of an Acceptance of the first from the Day I shewed to you and of the last from the Day that I received it here consequently the last will be payable the 24th January. I am informed that I have also another Set of Bills drawn on you for the same Sum that is for 535 ¾ Dols. at thirty Days Sight which have been on their Way to me Since September and I am in hourly Expectation of receiving them. I shall have quite as much Need of that Sum as of the other two. What News this place affords the Papers contain. I am, your most Obt. Humble Sevt. Wm. Blount ""

  My Dear Philadelpa. 26th Decr 1782 I wrote to you by the last Post (1) informing you of my Safe Arrival at Philadelpa. and that I had taken private Lodgings with Mr Ellsworth where I expect my Situation will be as agreable as my Solicitude for an absent Family will admit. I hope that amidst your Cares for the Family you will take all possible Care of your own Health, which is an Object of too much Importance to be neglected, and which ought to have the preferance of  DECEMBER 26, 1782  Considorations of farr less Consequence--And wish that you would let me hear from you as often as oppertunities will admit. I mentioned in my last that his Britannick Majesty had issued a Commission to treat with the States of America under that Description, which necessarily implys our Independence--but considering the Duplicity of the Enemy, the Volatility of their Councils, the Various Interests to be adjusted, the speedy settlement of Peace is an Event that cannot be depended upon, but perhaps We have more Reason to expect that the present Negot[iat]ion which is now going forward, will conclude in that Manner, than We have had at any former Period. No News of the Evacuation of Charlestown, and I think that it will not take place till Peace shall be settled. Things here at present bear in general a Very high Price--and shall therefore buy nothing at present but what is indispensably necessary--if a Peace shall soon take Place every foraign Article will instantly fall as low as it was before the War, as mony must fall, and probably such an Event would ruin Many. By the Blessing of God I enjoy Health. May you possess the like Favour. My Love to my Children and be Assured of my inviolable Regard for you. Yours affectionately, Oliver Wolcott ""

  My Dear Wife Triplicate Philadelphia 28th Decr. 1782. General Du Portail is arrived here, & has delivered me a packet of Newspapers from you. The Danae Frigate in which he came ran ashore in the Delaware. He came to Town several days ago, & informed me that he had seen you immediately before he left Paris, but that you had given him no Letter for me, which was a great disappointment. The Frigate is got off, & come up to the City, & he has found your Letter of 13th October, which was delivered to me yesterday. It would have been very unlucky, if it had been lost, as that of 4th Augt. by Mr. Cochran was the last I had received from you. The Ship Congress, & the Intrepid are both arrived from L' Orient; by neither of those Vessels have I received a line from you. Mr. Barclay by the latter, informs me that you gave him a Letter for me, which he forwarded by the Congress; but it has unfortunately miscarried. I have observed that since your arrival at Paris, you have not so frequently sent copies of your Letters, as you used to do when you were at Brussels, which has prevented my hearing from you as often as I wish to  DECEMBER 28, 1782  do. The Letter by General Du Portail should have enclosed a Copy of that which was lost in the Congress; & that by Mr. Cochran should have been accompanied by a copy of the one you wrote a fortnight before, & delivered to Mr. Cuming, which I have never received. Mr. Barclay's Letter by the Intrepid, & yours of 13th Octr. inform me of the death of M. de Clonard, for which I am exceedingly sorry. Pray present my affectionate regards to his Lady, & assure her that I most sincerely participate in the affliction which must be felt by all the friends of so valuable a man. The kindness, & attention which you have repeatedly informed me you have received from Madame de Clonard, will always endear her to me. The last accounts from Europe flatter us with the prospect of Peace; I most ardently hope that we may not be disappointed. Should that happy event take place before you leave France, it will be a Thousand times more welcome to me, as it will enable you to come over in greater safety. We have not yet received an account of the evacuation of Charles Town. Above two Months ago the Enemy abandoned all their outworks, & confined themselves to the Town. They likewise embarked all their stores, & the greatest part of their Cannon, & sent off a part of the Garrison. The remainder must have been detained by counterorders: if we do not hear soon of their having left it, I fear they will endeavour to keep it during the War. If they evacuate it, I shall once more be enabled to support my family comfortably at home, which will be a degree of happiness to which I have for several years been a stranger. If Peace should be concluded this Winter, you will come either to Philadelphia or New York. If the War is to be continued, & you leave France as early as March, I should be glad that you would come to Baltimore. If you embark so late as that you may probably come on the coast of America in June, or July, I think Boston would be the best place for you to come to. Mr. Barclay has been very kind in offering to afford you any service in his power. He is a worthy man, & very capable of advising, & assisting you, & therefore I desire that you will apply to him to procure you the accommodations of a proper Vessel. Bring with you a Machine to copy Letters, if you can get one, & some of the paper proper to be used with it. Dr. Franklin copies his Letters with a Machine. It is a very useful contrivance, & saves a great deal of trouble. My health continues very good; but I am tired of public business, & am anxious to return home with my family, to my Farm at Goose Creek. Make haste then my Dear Wife to assist me in carrying this plan into execution. I am pleased with the account you give of your German Servant, & wish that you would bring him with you instead of Richard. The piteous application the latter made to me before I left Europe, was one of the strongest reasons for my wishing to have him. As he seems satisfied with living with Mr. French, I am by no means desirous that he should come to me. On the contrary; for if his   inducement would be what Mrs. Blake mentions, he would rather be an incumbrance. A personal attachment to me would be his principal recommendation; & if that does not exist, I had rather that he should stay where he is. I hope Mrs. Blake took particular care in her application to Richard, not to give any offence to Mr. French. Frank continues to behave very well, & I do not at all feel the loss of DuprÄ. As your Letter of 4th August mentioned that Charlotte was almost entirely reinstated, & Peggy a great deal better, I was in hopes that by this time I should have the satisfaction of hearing that they were both perfectly recovered. The strictest attention should be continued till the evil is entirely removed. I am very happy to hear that you, & the Children are all well; I hope they continue their improvements, & that you have reason to be satisfied with them in everything. Give my Love, & Blessing to them all, & I hope you remember always to give my Compliments to the persons you mention at the end of your Letter, as if they were particularly named. I am My Dear Wife, Your affectionate Husband, Ra. Izard. [P.S.] I fear that many of my things at Marseilles are lost; particularly my Sulphurs. They were not, I think, in the Catalogue which Mr. Cathalan sent me, & which you will find among my papers left in Paris. Jany 2d. 1783. I congratulate you on the return of this day, & hope in the sincerity of my heart that you may enjoy many of them in health, & happiness. Mr. Du Bouchet the Deputy Adjutant General of the French Army will deliver this Letter to you. He was a fellow Passenger of mine on board of the Amazon Frigate, & I have a great regard for him; you will therefore I am sure be glad to see him. Mr. Jefferson, a joint Commissioner with Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, & Mr. Jay, for negotiating Peace; I believe goes, with his Daughter, who is about Ten years old, in the same Frigate with Mr. DuBouchet. He is a worthy, & sensible man, & has lately lost a very amiable Wife, to whom he was greatly attached. I wish there may be an appartment vacant in your Hotel, which may suit him. His daughter is a very sensible little Girl, & I hope you may have it in your power to be of service to her. Peggy is now arrived at such an age, that I can not help being alarmed about her. I should be exceedingly unhappy if she were to form any attachment in Europe, & therefore I hope you take particular care to prevent it. The Count de Rochambeau, & the Chevalier de Chattellux (the last a great Partizan of Dr. Franklin) will sail for France at the same time that Mr. Jefferson goes, but in another Frigate. I send by Mr. Du Bouchet a Snuff Box, which he promises to get mended for me at the Hotel de Jabac. Pray pay him for it; & bring it with you. Gillon's Ship is taken by a British 44 & two other Frigates. He was not himself on board: Joyner commanded. Gillon was on his  DECEMBER 29, 1782  journey by land to South Carolina at the time. He has been infamously persecuted by Usher, & Horner. This entre nous. ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia Decr. 29th 1782 Your's of the 23d Novr. I received by [. . .] last Post and is the only one that I have received since the One by Mr. Blackledge. The one you mention to have wrote me \""as early as September\"" and sent to Col. Ashe inclosing a \""Sett of Bills\"" drawn by Mallett & Jewkes on Oliver Pollock for 53534 Dollars nor the letter of Advice I have not seen nor heard of. Inclosed I found a Bill for 53534 Dollars which you call the first of the other Set, drawn by Mallett and Jewkes on Oliver Pollock Philadelphia. Soon after my Arrival here Mr. Nash sent me a Bill for 500 Dollars drawn by Mallett and Jewkes on Oliver Pollock (at some few days sight).(1) I presented the Bill and Mr. Pollock refused to accept it to be paid at the Sight it was drawn at but said he would accept it to be paid in Novr. or Decr. which I permited him to do. In Novr. he went to Virginia soon after Mr. Nash arrived here to whom I delivered the Bill. As the time of Payment drew near Mr Nash wrote him requesting to Know to whom he should here apply for the Mony when it became due in Case it should be inconvenient for himself (O.P.) to return here by that time and the following is his Answer. \""Richmond Decr. 13th 1782. Sir, Your favour of the 3d Inst. is now before me and with Respect to the Bill in your favour for 500 Dollars, I am sorry to inform you it will be out of my power to discharge it before the later End of next month at which time I hope to have the Honor to hand the amt. in Person. I am &c. O.P. To the Honble A Nash Esqr.\"" I have recited the Circumstance respecting Mr Nashe's Bill to prove two Things to you, the first is that he does not pay the Bills in Novr. or Decr. the time chosen and fixed on by himself and the other is that he will not be here before the later End of January but the Day before I purpose to set out for Carolina. Another Bill in favour of H. Toomer came into my Hands drawn by Mallett and Jewkes on O. Pollock for One hundred and Seventy Odd Dollars at ten days Sight. Before he went to Virginia I waited on him and presented the Bills for Acceptance which he refused to do unless I would admit of an Acceptance to be paid in Decr. which I declined. This Bill was by H. Toomer intended to reimburse me in part for the Mony I advanced his Brother Anthony. Mr. Pollock is a Man who unfortunately for him has a great Deal of Mony due to him both by the U. States and the S. of  DECEMBER 29, 1782  Virginia on which I fear he too much depends for the raising of Mony to discharge his debts or Bills; tho' when he first arrived here he told me that he had a quantity of Beaver Furr in the Hands of some Gentlemen of this place on which he principally depended to raise Cash and yesterday Inquiry was made of One of them about that Furr and from the Answer received No Hopes can be entertained of that fund producing any thing. I have put the Bills the ones you sent me and the One Toomer sent me into the Notary's Hands and they are noted for Nonacceptance and when the days expire at which they respectively become due they will be protested for Non-payment. Should the other Set arrive I shall put them in the same Train. Observe this Protest will be founded upon Mr. Pollock being not to be found at the place mentioned as his Residence in the Bill Viz. Philadelphia therefore I hope it will not affect his Credit as it certainly would was he on the Spot and should he arrive here as he says he will by the last of January I shall offer him the Bills protested as they certainly will be without Damage or Charge of Protest and if he takes them up it will be fortunate for me if not they must recoil on the Endorsor & Drawers. I am &c & Wm. Blount Philadelphia January 4th 1783. The above is in Substance a Copy of a letter written to you by the last Post but I expect this will reach you before that does. By the last Post I also wrote you several other letters.(2) Wm. Blount ""

  [December 30, 1782] From Teusday 24 Decr. the journals suffice untill Monday 30 Decr. A motion was made by Mr. Clarke seconded by Mr. Rutlidge to revise the instructions relative to negociations for peace, with a view to exempt the american Plenipotentiaries from the obligation to conform to the advice of France.(1) This motion was the effect of impressions left by Mr. Jay's letters & the intercepted one from Marbois.(2) This evidence of separate views in our ally, and the inconsistency of that instruction with our national dignity, were urged in support of the motion. In opposing the motion many considerations were suggested, and the original expediency of submitting the commission for peace to the counsels of France discanted upon. The reasons assigned  DECEMBER 30, 1782  for this expediency were that at the juncture when that measure took place, the American affairs were in the most deplorable situation, the Southern States being over run & exhausted by the enemy, & the others more inclined to repose after their own fatigues than to exert their resources for the relief of those which were the seat of the war; that the old paper currency had failed, & wth. it public credit itself to such a degree that no new currency could be substituted; & that there was then no prospect of introducing specie for the purpose, our trade being in the most ruinous condition, & the intercourse with the Havannah in particular unopened. In the midst of these distresses, the mediation of the two Imperial Courts was announced. The general idea was that the two most respectable powers of Europe would not interpose without a serious desire of peace, and without the energy requisite to effect it. The hope of peace was therefore mingled with an apprehension that considerable concessions might be exacted from America by the Mediators, as a compensation for the essential one which Britain was to submit to. Congress on a trial found it impossible from the diversity of opinions & interests to define any other claims than those of independence & the alliance. A discretionary power therefore was to be delegated with regard to all other claims. Mr. Adams was the sole minister for peace, he was personally at variance wth. the French Ministry; his judgment had not the confidence of some, and his impartiality in case of an interference of claims espoused by different quarters of the U.S. the confidence of others; a motion to associate with him two colleagues, to wit, Mr. F[ranklin] & Mr. Jay had been disagreed to by Congress; The former of these being interested (3) in territorial claims which had less chance of being made good in any other way, than by a repossession of the vacant country by the British Crown; the latter belonging to a State interested in such arrangements as would deprive the U.S. of the navigation of the Mississippi & turn the wartime trade thro' N.Y.; and neither of them being connected with the So. States. The idea of having five Ministers taken from the whole union, was not suggested until the measure had been adopted, and communicated to the Chevr. de Luzerne to be forwarded to France, when it was too late to revoke it.(4) It was supposed also that Mr. Laurens then in the tower wd not be out, & Mr. Jefferson wd. not go &. that the greater the no. of Ministers, the greater the danger of discords & indiscretions, add that as it was expected that nothing would be yielded by G.B. which was not extorted by the address of France in managing the Mediators, and that it was the intention of Congress that their minister should not from the sentiments of France oppose a peace recommended by the latter & approved by the former it was thought good policy to make the declaration to France, & by such a mark of confidence to render her friendship the more responsible for the issue. At the worst it could only be considered as a sacrifice of our pride to our interest.  These considerations still justified the original measure in the view of the members who were present & voted for it. All the new members who had not participated in the impressions which dictated it and viewed the subject only under circumstances of an opposite nature disapproved it.(5) In general however the latter joined with the former in opposing the motion arguing with them that supposing the instruction to be wrong, it was less dishonorable, than the instability tht wd. be denoted by rescinding it; that if G.B. was disposed to give us what we claimed, France could not prevent it; that if G.B. struggled agst. those claims our only chance of getting them was thro' the aid of France; that to withdraw our confidence would lessen the chance & degree of this aid; that if we were in a prosperous or safe condition compared with that in which we adopted the expedient in question, this change had been effected by the friendly succours of our ally, & that to take advantage of it to loosen the tie, would not only bring on us the reproach of ingratitude but induce France to believe that she had no hold on our affections but only in our necessities; that in all possible situations we sd. be more in danger of being seduced by G.B. than of being sacrificed by France; the interests of the latter in the main necessarily coinciding with ours; those of the former being diametrically opposed to them. That as to the intercepted letter, there were many reasons which indicated that it came through the hands of the Enemy to Mr. J. that it ought therefore to be regarded even if genuine, as communicated for insidious purposes; but that there was strong reason to suspect that it had been adulterated if not forged; and that on the worst supposition, it did not appear that the doctrines maintained or the measures recommended in it had been adopted by the French Ministry and consequently that they ought not to be held responsible for them. Upon these considerations it was proposed by Mr. Wolcott 2ded. by Mr. Hamilton that the motion of Mr. Clarke should be postponed, which took place without a vote. Mr. M[adison] added that the letter from Docr. Franklin of the 14 Oct. 1782 (6) shd. be referred to a Committee with a view of bringing into consideration the preliminary article proposing that British subjects & American Citizens sd. reciprocally have in matters of commerce the privileges of natives of the other party; and of giving to the American Ministers the instruction which ensued on that subject. This motion succeeded and the Committee appointed consisted of Mr. Madison, Mr. Rutlidge, Mr. Clarke, Mr. Hamilton, & Mr. Osgood.(7) The contract of Gel. Wayne was confirmed with great reluctance; being considered as improper with respect to its being made with individuals, as admitting of infinite abuses, as out of his military line, & as founded on a principle that a present commerce with G.B. was favorable to the U.S. a principle reprobated by Congress & all the   States. Congress however supposed that these considerations ought to yield to the necessity of supporting the measures which a valuable officer from good motives had taken upon himself.(8) ""

  My dear Sir Philada. Decr. 30th. 1782 Your favor of the 13th instant arrived a few minutes after I sealed my last. That of the 20th came duly to hand yesterday.(1) The sensations excited in Mr. Jones and myself by the Repeal of the law in favor of the Impost were such as you anticipated. Previous to the receipt of your information a letter from Mr. Pendleton to me had suspended the progress of the Deputies to Rhode Island. Yours put an entire stop to the mission, untill the plan or some other can be m[ade &] extended to the case of Virga.(2) The letter from the Govr. of the same date with your last,(3) gives a hope that our representations may regain her support to the Impost, without further steps from Congress. Your doubt as to her power of revoking her accession, would I think have been better founded, if she had not been virtually absolved by the definitive rejection by Rho. Island; altho' that rejection ought perhaps to have been previously authenticated to her. I beg you to be circum- DECEMBER 30, 1782  stancial on this subject especially as to the parties and motives which led to the repeal, and may oppose a reconsideration. Mr. {Jefferson}(4) arrived here on Friday last, and is industriously arming himself for the field of negociation. The commission issued to Mr. Oswald impresses him with a hope that he may have nothing to do on his arrival but join in the celebrations of victory & peace. {Congress} however anxiously espouse the expediency of his hastening to his destination. General McDougal, Col. Ogden & Col Brooks arrived yesterday on a mission from the army to Congress. The representations with which they are charged have not yet been handed in but I am told they breathe a proper spirit and are full of good sense.(5) I presume they will furnish new topics in favor of the Impost which alone promises a chance of establishing that credit, by which alone the inadequacy of taxation can be supplied. The French fleet and army sailed a few days ago from Boston {for the West Indies}. A Storm happened soon after their departure from which it is feared they may have suffered. The Ship South Carolina procured in Europe for the State after wch. she was called was taken by three British Ships & carried into N. Y. a few days ago. Besides the loss sustained by those interested immediately in her, her fitness for annoying our trade renders the capture a general misfortune. The Instructions referred to in your last favor relative to a union of Councils with our ally and to confiscated property were not transmitted as you supposed.(6) The first I imagine was intended to guard against any possibility of misconstruing a late incident.(7) I will comply with your desire as to the extract from Mr. Jefferson's observations, as soon as possible, perhaps by the next post, but more [prob]ably by the succeeding one.(8) Mr. Ambler has not yet supplied me with answers to any of the queries. His apology is a satisfactory one, but I wish you to urge & assist his speedy compliance.(9) The Lawyers, some of them at least have I hear returned from Trenton, from which it is inferred that it only remains for the Court to frame & promulge its decree. My next will probably transmit the tenor of it. You have not I hope forgot your [pro]mise of the case agitated so much in Virga. Mr. Pendleton's state of it has been recd. by Mr. Jones and has increased my curiosity to see yours.(10) ""

  Dear Sir, Philadelphia, January 22, 1782 [l783](1) The repeal of the impost act by Virginia is still considered as covered with some degree of mystery. Colonel Bland's representations do not remove the veil. Indeed, seems as much astonished at it, and as unable to penetrate it, as any of us.(2) Many have surmised that the enmity of Doctor Lee against Morris is at the bottom of it. But had that been the case, it can scarcely be supposed that the repeal would have passed so quietly. By this time, I presume, you will be able to furnish me with its true history, and I ask the favor of you to do it.(3) Virginia could never have cut off this source of public relief at a more unlucky crisis than when she is protesting her inability to comply with the continental requisitions. She will, I hope, be yet made sensible of the impropriety of the step she has taken, and make amends by a more liberal grant. Congress cannot abandon the plan as long as there is a spark of hope. Nay, other plans on a like principle must be added. Justice, gratitude, our reputation abroad, and our tranquillity at home, require provision for a debt of not less than fifty millions of dollars, and I pronounce that this provision will not be adequately met by separate acts of the States. If there are not revenue laws which  JANUARY 22, 1783  operate at the same time through all the States, and are exempt from the control of each--the mutual jealousies which begin already to appear among them will assuredly defraud both our foreign and domestic creditors of their just claims. The deputies of the army are still here, urging the objects of their mission. Congress are thoroughly impressed with the justice of them, and are disposed to do every thing which depends on them. But what can a Virginia Delegate say to them, whose constituents declare that they are unable to make the necessary contributions, and unwilling to establish funds for obtaining them elsewhere? The valuation of lands is still under consideration. MS not found; reprinted from The Papers of James Madison, ed. Henry D. Gilpin, 3 vols.

  Dear Tucker Philada. March 24th 1782 [i.e., 1783] Peace is certainly concluded--a General Peace. Congress have been this moment informd of it--by a Corvette which arrived last night in this River, detachd from Count d'Estaings fleet at Cadiz--at the request of the Marquis de La Fayette--the Sailing of that fleet is countermanded--and the Capt.

  My worthy Friend Annapolis June 17th. 1782 [1784] The last post bro't me your's of the 11th inst. from Philadelphia. I am glad you had so agreable a journey from hence, and so good an op- JUNE 17, 1784  portunity of entertaining yourself on the way with reflecting upon the congressional scenes; You have acted one of the principal parts in them, & cannot but derive much solid satisfaction from this reflection, \""that what has been done, is pro bono publico, well done.\"" The interested views, absurd projects, prejudices, & partialities, of which you speak, are so many irresistable arguments against your conclusion, viz. that your own happiness can never be promoted by partaking in the politics of such an extensive republican government &c. Reflect, my dear Sir, again upon these things, and you will be convinced, that altho a Man shou'd not be able to effect much positive good, in such a heterogeneous a body, yet if he can prevent mischief, 'tis his duty to struggle hard to do it: And what it is our duty to do, that upon due reflection we shall find productive of our happiness. But you are out of your element when you are out of politicks: to talk of making pleasure your business, is to attempt a violence upon your disposition. You have not that levity of mind which is alone fitted for the pursuits of pleasure. Be yourself Man, and you will be happy. When I seem to interdict to you pleasurable pursuits, remember I do not mean to oppose an inkling, or as the French say the penchant, you seem to have to Matrimony. No, quite the contrary, I wou'd encourage it by every means in my power. This is a duty you still owe to God & your Country. \""Take unto thyself a wife, & obey the ordinance of God.\"" But look well to your choice, in that indeed is involv'd much happiness or much misery. I have communicated your advice to P____ upon this subject, & endeavoured to enforce it upon her. She wonders what we mean, or wou'd affect to be at a loss about it. Tell Mrs. C & Miss Polly that I shou'd certainly have done myself the pleasure of waitg. upon them: but Crosby never told me any thing of them till I had left Philadelphia & I knew not where to find them. I will do as I ought to do, upon my return. Pray bear in mind my bank Bills. I shall soon be in want of Cash. Colo. Blanchard & myself have been constantly engaged at our writing tables, ever since you left us, & have still many days labour of that sort before us. You may see the fruits of it, when I shall see you again. I have had a letter from Mrs. Dana. It is probable you will not find her at home if you go to Cambridge on Commencement week. She proposes to spend it at Hingham in Genl. Lincoln's family. Shou'd this be the case, you must favour us with a visit on my return. Which I still flatter myself will be in all July, or the beginning of Augt. There seems to be an apprehension generally prevailg. here, that we shall not make up a Committee of the States. I am very indifferent about it, because I am satisfied the public Interests will receive no prejudice from the circumstance of their not meeting. I shall endeavour shortly after the day of our adjournment, if we have not a sufficient number to proceed to business, to push on an adjournment to Trenton, to sometime in Septr. We can consider the legality of this measure afterwards, whether our   power to adjourn from day to day, is sufficient for this purpose. The records shou'd be removed there, & arranged, prior to the Meeting of the next Congress, as the want of 9 States in the Committee, must be no obstruction to such a necessary step. That some persons shou'd appear to be hurt by our late regulations is very natural. I think you have done perfectly right, for that reason, to accept of your invitation. That the circumstances attendg. our debates shou'd be pretty well known at Philadelphia, was to be expected. I am pleased to hear however that the personal altercations are greatly reprobated: and so shou'd be the personal Altercators.(1) Such indecencies are highly derogatory to the honour of such an Assembly, & ought to meet with its most pointed censures. I have carefully read over the Virginia & S. Carolina Delegates protest.(2) It contains positions which strike at some of the fundamental principles of the Union, & the Rights of each particular State. For those reasons I wish to see them discussed with a decent liberality in the public prints in our State. The proceedings are entered on the printed Journals, & are therefore fair Game. A measure of this sort wou'd make known to those Legislatures the conduct of their Delegates, & wou'd be productive of happy effects in future. I think the proceedings of Congress shou'd more engage the attention of some of our best political characters & writers. They shou'd however be always treated with a marked respect. This the dignity of the Union requires: and this it is the Interest of all to maintain. The conduct of Individual Members, especially where opposed to the sense of a Majority, might be animadverted upon with more [free]dom. Adieu, time & room both fail me. Yours affectionately, F.D. ""

  My dear Sir Annapolis June 18th. 1782 [1784] I wrote you by the last post. This is meerly to acknowledge the receipt of your second, of the 14th with the Bank Bills to the amount of 160 Dollrs. & Mr. Monroe's letter, enclosed. The latter I shall deliver to Mr. Hardy, who has continued here. Mr. B[lanchard] desires me to acquaint you that in his letter of this day he has forgotten the Copies you mention to him, but that he will attend to them. Shou'd the Delaware Delegates, as well as the Georgia ones, come on, I fear they will carry the vote against us for Philadelphia. They may possibly carry some other matters while Connecticut & Rhode Island shall be unrepresented in the Committee of the States. We shall watch over them with a jealous eye, to prevent what mischief we can, tho' we may not be able to do much more than to prevent mischief. I hope the Dutch Minister will have more prudence than to follow the advice which, it seems, has been given to him. If the other person shou'd take it into his head to think full satisfaction is not given in his case, when, I believe, a proper punishment will be inflicted by the Court in virtue of the established Laws of the Land, which in such Cases leave much to the discretion of the Court, let him decamp. It will work well in the end. Yours affectionately, F Dana ""
