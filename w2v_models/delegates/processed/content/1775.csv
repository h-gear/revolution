United We stand, divided We fall, is our motto and must be. One general Congress has brought the Colonies to be acquainted with each other, and I am in hopes another may effect a lasting Confederation which will need nothing, perhaps, but time, to mature it into a complete & perfect American Constitution, the only proper one for Us, whether connect ed with Great Britain, or Not.

227,dg001239,1775,South Carolina Delegates Report to the Carolina Provincial Congress,"""South Carolina Delegates' Report to the Carolina Provincial Congress   [Charlestown, January 11, 1775] Our Delegates from Congress being present, the proceedings of that body at Philadelphia were taken into consideration; and many questions were proposed to them relative to various parts of the proceedings; to which, answers and explanations were given by them. One of the most important of these was, why, at a time when a number of gentlemen were sent to Congress, from all parts of America, for the express purpose of considering and stating the American grievances; and for devising the proper means, of redressing them; why, did they limit their researches to the year 1763; and not trace back, as could easily have been done, the many aggressions which JANUARY 11, 1775  had been committed by Great Britain upon her infant Colonies; in the jealousies, monopolies, and prohibitions, with which she was so prodigal towards them; for the express purpose of depressing their population--confining their trade--and crippling their attempts, at even the most domestic and necessary manufactures? To this it was answered, that our Delegates were willing to have stated all the griev- ances, as were the greater part of the other Delegates; but the people of Virginia would not retrospect farther back, than 1763, being limited in their powers.(1) And, although they did not avow the reason; yet, it was privately declared, it had been agreed upon at home, not to go beyond that year, as thereby, the greater odium would be thrown upon the reign of George III--which was so fatal to the peace of America. The Delegates farther answered, it was then pressed in Congress, that the other Colonies should, in this measure, act independently of Virginia; but Maryland and North-Carolina represented, that as their exports were similar to those of Virginia, so, they could not with any advantage to the common cause act independently of her; for, their own commodities would be carried to the Virginian ports; which, would run away with all their trade. And, that in this manner, was the measure of stating all the grievances, defeated. The articles of association determined upon by Congress, and recommended to the Provincial Conventions and Congresses to be carried into execution, now came on to be considered: and the four last words of the fourth article of that instrument, (\""except rice to Europe,\"") gave room for a long and a violent debate. This exception had created an alarming disunion, throughout the whole Colony; in consequence of which, the Representatives had met, with jealous feelings on the subject; as by that article of the Association, it was contracted that, after the 10th day of September 1775, America \""will not directly or indirectly export any merchandize or commodity whatsoever, to Great Britain, Ireland, or the West Indies, except rice to Europe.\"" This exception had given so general a disgust, that the whole interior of the province, considered their interests as sacrificed to the emolument of the rice planters; and, accordingly, a motion was made and seconded \""that the Delegates to be elected, use their utmost endeavours at the ensuing Congress at Philadelphia to cause those words to be expunged.\""(2) Mr. Gadsden, then rose, and explained to the Congress, what had taken place in the Continental Congress, during the passage of the obnoxious exception. He said he thought it was his duty to declare, he had not any hand in causing those words to stand in the instrument of association--that, they had well nigh occasioned a division in Congress And, so ill was a proposition of that nature received, that it had occasioned a cessation from business for several days; in  order to give our deputies time, to recollect themselves. That when the association was completing, and the members of Congress were signing that instrument, all our Deputies, but himself, withdrew. That he would have been glad of the honour, of signing his name alone, and for doing so, would have trusted to the generosity of his constituents. That he had offered to do so: and, that Carolina was on the point of being excluded the association, when our Deputies being again summoned by the Secretary, they returned into Congress, yielding up the article of indigo: and that Congress only for the sake of preserving the union of America, allowed the article rice to be added to the association. That this however, was illy received by the other Colonies, who had thence, become jealous of the rice Colonies: and therefore, it was his opinion, that for the common good, as well as our own honour, we ought to remove this as soon as possible, by having the words \""except rice to Europe\"" struck out, of the fourth article of the association. Mr. John Rutledge now undertook his own defence, and that of his three associates. He said, that at an early period he and the other Delegates from this Colony had warmly pressed an immediate non importation, and total non-exportation. That, as a non-exportation to Great Britain and Ireland, was to withhold from thence, the advantages their people might acquire from a receipt of American com modities; so, the end would be more surely effected, by retaining those commodities altogether in America. Such measures however, could not be effected; the Northern Colonies resolving to remit to England, as usual, to pay their debts by the circuitous mode of their flour and fish trade to the rest of Europe. In short, the commodities they usually sent to the mother country were but trifling; and their real trade, would be but little affected by the association. For instance, Philadelphia carried on a trade of export, to the amount of £700,000 Sterling; whereas, scarce £50,000 value of it, went to the market of the mother country. That, as it was evident, those Colonies were less intent to annoy the mother country in the article of trade, than to preserve their own trade: so, he thought it was but justice to his constituents, to preserve to them their trade, as entire as possible. That, as the Northern trade would be but little affected by the association, he saw no reason why ours should be almost ruined; for, nearly all our indigo, and two thirds of our rice, went to the ports of the mother country. That, if we must bear burdens in the cause of America, they ought to be as equally laid as possible. Upon the whole, he said the affair seemed rather like a commercial scheme, among the flour Colonies, to find a better vent for their flour through the British Channel; by preventing, if possible, any rice from being sent to those markets: and, that for his part, he could never consent to our becoming dupes to the people of the north; or, in the least, to JANUARY 14, 1775  yield to their unreasonable expectations. That, as by the association, the rice planters preserved their property; so it had been the idea of the Delegates at the Congress, that they should make compensation to the indigo planters, who could not send their crops to the mother country. Such a plan, was just, and practicable; and it ought to be the subject of our debate--rather than expunging the means of exporting a great part of our annual crop; and therewith, supplying ourselves with those necessaries we might require.(3) MS not found; reprinted from John Drayton, ed., Memoirs of the American Revolution . . ., 2 vols. (Charleston, S. C.: A. E. Miller, 1821), 1:167-71. 1 On this point, see Samuel Ward to John Dickinson, December 14, 1774, note 3. 2 Not only did the Provincial Congress fail to adopt this motion, but on January 12 it defeated, by a vote of 87 to 75, the motion by Christopher Gadsden, mentioned in the next paragraph, to approve the association only after deleting from it the provision exempting rice from the nonexportation agreement.

229,dg001241,1775,John Adams to a Friend in London,"""John Adams to a Friend in London   January 21, 1775 You have no doubt, long before this time, heard the particulars of the General Congress, and that the court and the country have digested their thoughts upon them, if not adopted their consequent plans of conduct.(1) God grant that the nation and parliament may think favourably of them, and grant the prayer of our petition to the King. Britain and America are made to be friends; and it is the most unnatural, detestable quarrel between them that ever happened in the world. Britons and Americans may write or say what will, but this JANUARY 21, 1775  quarrel never will and never can be made up, but by restoring us to the state we were in, in 1763. It is as certain as that London or Boston exist, that no other plan or scheme of policy that ever can be invented will keep the two countries together, but that which nature dictated, and which experience found useful for 150 years. It is in vain, it is delirium, it is frenzy to think of dragooning three millions of English people out of their liberties, at the distance of 3000 miles. It is still more extravagantly wild for a nation to think of doing it, when itself is sinking down into a bottomless gulph of debt, in order to make the conquered lift her out of it. The Congress have drawn a line by the banks of the ocean. They have claimed their own exclusive jurisdiction in all interior concerns, and in all cases of taxation. They have left to Great Britain the exclusive sovereignty of the ocean, and over their trade. They have placed both upon constitutional principles; and if Britons are not content with all we have but our liberty, we say as the corporation of London said to the King in 1770, \""We call God and men to witness, that as we do not owe our liberty to those nice and subtle distinctions which pensions and lucrative employments have invented, so neither will we be deprived of it by them; but as it was gained by the stern virtue of our ancestors, by the virtue of their descendants it shall be preserved.\"" The Congress consisted of the representatives of twelve colonies.(2) Three millions of free white people were there represented. Many of the members were gentlemen of ample fortunes and eminent abilities. Neither corruption nor intrigue had any share, I believe, in their elections to this service, and in their proceedings you may see the sense, the temper and principles of America, and which she will support and defend, ever by force of arms, if no other means will do. The state of this province is a great curiosity: I wish the pen of some able historian may transmit it to posterity. Four hundred thou sand people are in a state of nature, and yet as still and peaceable at present as ever they were when government was in full vigour. We have neither legislators nor magistrates, nor executive officers. We have no officers but military ones. Of these we have a multitude chosen by the people, and exercising them with more authority and spirit than ever any did who had commissions from a Governor. The town of Boston is a spectacle worthy of the attention of a deity, suffering amazing distress, yet determined to endure as much as human nature can, rather than betray America and posterity. General Gage's army is sickly, and extremely addicted to desertion. What would they be if things were brought to extremities? Do you think such an army would march through our woods and thickets and country villages to cut the throats of honest people contending for liberty?  The neighbouring colonies of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, are arming and training themselves with great spirit, and if they must be driven to the last appeal, devoutly praying for the protection of heaven. There is a spirit prevailing here, such as I never saw before. I remember the conquest of Louisburg in 1745; I remember the spirit here when the Duke d'Anville's squadron was upon this coast, when forty thousand men marched down to Boston, and were mustered and numbered upon the common, compleat in arms, from this province only in three weeks; but I remember nothing like what I have seen these six months past.

I do not know who besides Mr Cushing I could with any propriety write to. I have however not forborn writing to others from a meer point of Delecasy but because if a Letter from me can weigh a single Grain I am almost sure Mr Cushing will candidly show it, let him be of what Sentim [en] t he may himself, though I am apt to believe you (1) and he and I could very nearly say our political prayers together. I dare say if J Dickenson knows any Thing of choosing a Govr. is in Agitation he has already wrote his Sentimts. If not a single Line from you will I dare say induce both him & Mr. Mifflin to write but I question not only whether Ltrs from any of us may not be too late but also whether there may not be such an Alteration of Circumstances as to make letters even prudent; if Intelligence from England is any way favourable I don't imagine that the Quest [io] n will be strained at all in their Congress, but if the Resolu[tion]s of parl. JANUARY 23, 1775  cutt off all Hope of a peaceable Settlemt. & they shd. be advised of them as they [are] expected by Febry. you may depend on it the N E people will try their Strength even were they sure to go alone and will endeavr. if possible to get rid of the Troops now at Boston before they can be joined by any more. They will you may be sure resume and endeavour to settle an internal Governmt. to collect and draw their Strength to a point which will be most essentially necessary in Case of any Misfortune or Disappoint[ment] in the Outset. You will be pleased to peruse the Ltr I write to Mr. Cushing and if my Sentimts. correspond with yours seal and forward it. We now stand on a very ticklish point of Time. I really wish every Thing could be kept just moving till we hear from thence & that if the least prospect of Accomod[atio]n opens we may prudently cultivate & improve the Occasion. But if no Hope is left our own Resolutions ought to be ready formed in our own Minds. It will be a great Question whether we shall resolve to continue the present Appearances of Governmt. which indeed is not strong enough to protect agt. Violence and is only treated with Respect from principle by those from whom Violences need not be apprehended & which must necessarily be a Clogg in our Motions so long as it continues, or whether a real substantial active Governmt. coinciding with the Views of America shall be established by Consent. I need not observe to you that the freedom with which I write to you claims your utmost Discretion and the Subject your mature Thoughts. No Man in the British Dominions more passionately wishes for a Reconciliation than myself but if the terms are so hard as Slavery to America I have formed my Resolution and am clear for employing every Means of Self Defence. If the Report is true that 10 or even 4,000 Men more are to be sent to Boston I do not know that we ought if we could to stay the Hands of the N E people till their Arrival. The Season of the Year may afford an Oppty that if lost may be lost forever. I am sure if they must fight it out I cannot blame them for taking every Advantage, and the Time appointed for their Convention with what I have collected of the Dispo [sition] of the people pretty well explain to me their Intentions. I heard some Time since of the Appointmt of field Officers. I am very sorry to understand that Ammunition is wanting. I wish some of the Ingenious amongst you would bestow some Thoughts and Experiments on Salt Petre & Sulphur. I have little Doubt but that we might supply ourselves amply with both. You judged right that I had Nothing to do with the cursed Hand Bills.(2) The ill timed Resolution here has done us a real Disservice. I as well as many others are greatly embarrassed by it. I cannot execute a Measure so flatly agt. my best informed Opinion & am sure a pursuit of it will throw us into Divisions which we shall not be able to erase within Ourselves. S[amuel] C[hase] went alone in it not only  witht. any of the Comee except M[atthias] Hammond (3) that I know of but the Sentiment was expressly disapproved by several of us. I do not know any more likely Way to put the people on thinking than for several of us to withdraw from the Commee which I believe we shall do. They will at first Beware but I am in Hopes it will make them a little more cautious. This Humour of serving people will if not checked Spread itself so as to be very inconvenient. I learn from Fred[cric]k that small parties of unthinking Men are forcing others to enrol who are principled agt. bearing Arms. The people at large are not a Body fit for Deliberation, they are gen[era]lly carried away with a warmth of Zeal that overleaps sedate & wise policy. Several with us will not subscribe meerly because of the Threat & some who very freely subscribed declare they will not pay their Money for the same Reason; had it not been for this unlucky flight I beleive we shd. have raised our Money witht. difficulty. As it is I am afraid we shall not. Genl. Lees Observations (4) will soon be printed but he esteems the manual Exercise (5) of very little Consequence he does not even touch upon it: his chief view is to prove the best Line of Fire consists only of two deep and Major Gates is fully in Sentimt with him & to give the simplest and easiest Directions for forming a Line of Impression or Resistance of 4, 6, or 8 Deep.

Why should a prudent People take a Step so full of the most dangerous Disunion? Will it add a single Man to our Cause? Will it not take off many from it?

The Instructions to your Delegates appointed for the next Congress, appear to me, to be exceedingly proper, and I heartily wish, every Colony may give as full Authority to her Delegates. On this Subject, We have some Apprehensions in our Province. A Party who have considerable Weight in our Assembly, have been greatly alarm'd at the vote, approving generally the proceedings of the late Congress, and are determined, if it be possible, to stop all vigorous proceedings, by prevailing on the Assembly to give very restrictive Instructions to the Delegates appointed for the next Congress. Our Assembly meets on the 20th of next Month; and according to the best Opinion I can form, a good Deal of Delicacy will be requir'd in managing this Affair.(2) Our Provincial Convention has lately been called; and considering FEBRUARY 4, 1775  the peculiar Circumstances of this Province, I heartily wish, their Meeting had been delayed. You will see their proceedings in the Paper. Nothing more could be done at this Time, with Prudence. The great Point, at present, is to keep up the appearance of an unbroken Harmony in public measures, for fear of encouraging Great Britain to Hostilities, which, otherwise, she would avoid. When she has made her Choice, and it proves inimical, I hope every Man of Sense & Virtue in America will draw his Sword, without any Regard for the yet respectable Doctrine of Disunion.

From an entire & perfect Approbation of the Resolve of the Congress, that if the late Acts of Parliamt. relative to the Massachusetts Bay should be attempted to be carried into Execution by force, that in such Case all America ought to support that Colony in her Opposition; From the Declaration by the Congress to the Throne, that our accumulated Injuries were too severe to be any longer tolerable, & that our Militia would protect Us in Time of Peace; From a Concurrence with the Sentiments expressed to the Inhabitants of Quebec, that We were resolved never to resign our Rights but with our Lives, and to the People of G. Britain, that We never would submit to be Hewers of Wood or Drawers of Water for any Ministry or Nation in the World; In Compliance with the advice of the Congress, to extend our Views to the most unhappy Event, & to be in all Respects prepared for every Contingency; From the Consideration of our defenceless State, unable to protect Ourselves, or assist our Friends; From a firm persuasion that a Militia was the proper military force, & Arms and Ammunition the only Means, to defend & secure our Liberties; From a Conviction that to be prepared for a Civil War, is the finest & most effectual Means to prevent one, and for many other Reasons, our provincial Convention passed the Resolutions, which I enclosed You in my last Letter.

Delay must ruin the Minister. Some decisive Mode must be adopted, & instantly executed, or he must fail. Lord North is too well ac quainted with his Weakness; he must be convinced that the Colonies, if they adhere to their association, must succeed. If the Question was to be decided by Justice or Policy, I should not doubt, that our in dubitable Rights would be restored, our Capital Grievances redressed, and peace and Harmony once more established with the Mother Country; but when I reflect on the enormous Influence of The Crown, the System of Corruption introduced as the Art of Government, The Venality of the Electors (the radical Source of every other Evil) the open & repeated Violations, by Parliament, of the Constitution, at Home, The regular, arbitrary System of Colony administration, The several Acts relative to the Massachusetts, The Quebec Bill, and The Re-election of the Members of the last Parliament, I have not the least Dawn of Hope in the Justice, Humanity, Wisdom or Virtue of the British Nation. I consider them as one of the most abandon'd & wicked People under the Sun. They openly sell themselves & their Posterity to their Representatives, who as openly traffic their Integrety & Honor to The Minister. The Roman Senate in the Reigns of Claudius Caesar, Domitian or Nero, were not more servilely wicked, than the present House of Commons. They no longer regard even the Appearance of Virtue. Our Dependance must be on God & ourselves. I still retain my Opinion, that the Right of Parliamt. to regulate our Trade ought to be acknowledged in the most precise and explicit Terms, and shall deliver the same Sentiment, if called on, in my leg- islative Capacity. You are pleased to ask Me, what plan of Union is to be adopted, or what Conduct an Assembly can pursue, which wod. be acceptable in every Colony. Your Candor entitles You to an Answer. If our Assembly was called, & those Questions proposed, I should be very averse to take them into Consideration; I would, if possible, decline Giving any pointed Answers, & endeavor to refer a Subject of such Importance & in which all America is so deeply interested, to the next Congress. If I could not prevail, I would claim a free & exclusive power of Legislation, in all Cases of Taxation & internal Polity; I would expressly deny a Right in Parliament to make any Laws to bind the Colonies, except only for the Regulation of their Trade: The Right bona fide to regulate our Commerce [ would recognize in the most clear and express Terms. Without such Claim by the Colonists they can neither be free nor happy; without such  Admission to Parliament they must be independent, &, in my Opinion, Justice and Policy require the Concession. As the power to regulate our Trade would, in many Instances, be ineffectual, without a Right also to lay Duties for that purpose, I wod. also allow an Imposition of Duties, on this express Condition, that the Duties so laid should be collected by the old Officers of the Customs, & to be at the sole Disposal of the provincial assembly, where such Duties were payable. I would demand a Repeal of all Acts of Parliament inconsistent with those Principles, I mean, which any Way interfere with our internal Polity or impose Taxes. I would engage in Case of War to raise forces, and grant Supplies, according to our ability. You seem to have well considered the Arguments for and against a certain Plan for an American Legislature. Such plan can only be necessary to remedy a Defect in the Constitution of the Colonies, to provide for Cases which respect G. B. & the Colonies jointly, and in which it wod. be dangerous to admit the Parliament to interfere, & for which the provincial Legislatures are not competent. The Cases which at present occur, are, the Regulation of Trade, and the Granting Supplies & raising Troops in Case of War. As to the first. The plan wod. be unnecessary by an admission of a Right in Parliament, where I would chuse to lodge it, if I had my Election. The Interests of the No[r]thern & Southern Colonies, as to their Trade, from local & other Circumstances, would frequently interfere. The Argument, that Parliament would abuse their Power, has no Weight with Me, & would equally extend to the Vesting of it in any Body. As to the second. It is founded on a Supposition, which I can never admit, that the Colonies would not do their Duty, would not consider their Interests as connected with the Welfare & prosperity of G. B. & would not provide for their own safety. I am convinced it is only a Pretence by the Minister, & that if a Right to tax America was once given up, We should hear no more on that Head. I am greatly alarmed at the Vote of your House of Commons, & am anxious to hear the Result of their proceedings.(1) The martial Ardor prevails very generally here. Above 100 Companies, of 81 Men each, are already formed on the western Shore of this Province. Colo. Washington in a Letter of 6th Jany, writes \""In this County, Prince William, Loudoun, Faquier, Berkely, & many others round about them, a noble Ardour prevails.

It [is] with Pleasure I acknowledge the Receipt of your Letter of the 29th of January. From an entire and perfect Approbation of the Resolve of the Congress, that if the late Acts of Parliament, relative to the Massa- chusetts Bay, should be attempted to be carried into Execution by force, that in such Case all America ought to support that Colony in her Opposition; From the Declaration, by the Congress, to the Throne, that our accumulated Injuries were too severe to be any longer tolerable, and that our Militia would protect Us in Time of Peace; From a Concurrence with the Sentiments expressed to the Inhabitants of Quebec, that We were resolved never to resign our Rights, but with our Lives, and to the People of G. Britain, that We never would submit to be Hewers of Wood or Drawers of Water for any Ministry or Nation in the World; In Compliance with the Advice of the Congress, to extend our Views to the most unhappy Event, and to be in all Respects prepared for every Contingency; From a Consideration of our defenceless State, unable to protect Ourselves or assist our Friends, and for many other Reasons, our Provincial Convention passed the Resolutions, which I enclosed You in my last Letter. We must either resist or infamously submit. If We are resolved to resist, and to defend our Liberties at the Risque of our Lives, a mili- tary force appears to Me to be necessary, and Arms and Ammunition the only Means; to resolve to resist, without preparing a military force & Arms will be, in my Opinion, of little Consequence. I therefore wish your Province had resolved instantly to arm. If the attempt had been made, & failed, it would have encouraged our Enemies, & alarmed our Friends. Our Province was very desirous to receive some Assurance, from her Sister Colonies, of Assistance, if attacked & will remain in perfect Confidence of their Support if necessary. I have been for some Time strongly impressed with a Belief, that FEBRUARY 6, 1775  the present unhappy Dispute with G. Britain would not wait the Event of a Commercial Opposition, and that she must either give up the Right of Taxing America, or enforce obedience by the Sword; Delay must ruin the Ministry. If the Question was to be decided by Justice or Policy, I should not doubt, that our indisputable Rights would be restored, our capital Grievances redressed, and Peace & Harmony once more established with the Mother Country; but when I reflect on the enormous Influence of the Crown, the System of Corruption introduced as the Art of Government, the Venality of the Electors (the radical Source of every other Evil) The open and repeated Violations of the Constitution, at Home, the regular, arbitrary System of Colony Administration, the several cruel and barbarous Acts relative to the Massachusetts, The Quebec Bill, And the Reelection of the Members of the last Parliament, I have not the least Dawn of Hope in the Justice, Humanity, Wisdom or Virtue of the British Nation. I consider them as one of the most abandoned & wicked People under the Sun. They openly sell themselves to their Representatives, who as openly traffic their Integrety & Honor to the Ministry. Our Dependance must be on God and Ourselves. Nihil ab extra quaesumus. The Conduct of the Commons of New York is very alarming, if they attempt to act separately Confidence will be destroyed. You have in our last Weeks Gazette his Majestys Speech and the Address of the Lords and Commons. From an Apprehension that the Protest of the Lords may not have reached You before this, I have enclosed You a Copy. The Proceedings of the Congress had not arrived in London, the 9th of December. By a private Letter We are informed, that Lord North is greatly enraged against the Colonies, and has declared that he will sh-lt up all our Ports, and decide the Dispute with the Sword. The Martial Ardor prevails very generally here, above 100 Companies, of 81 Men each, are already formed on the Western Shore. Honoured with a Communication of your Sentiments, I will pay due Regard to your Request, and endeavor to merit your Confidence. I am with great Esteem Dear Sir Your affectionate & obedient Servt.

237,dg001249,1775,John Adams to a Friend in London,"""John Adams to a Friend in London   Feb. 10, 1775 The account you give of an overbearing influence in the house, (1) and the want of feeling and spirit out of it, is of a very serious and FEBRUARY 10, 1775  melancholy kind: Americans are very sensible that such accounts are true, and expect to fall a sacrifice to the knavery in the cabinet and the folly out of it, unless preserved by their own virtue, their frugality, or valour, or both. Shorter parliaments, a more equitable representation, the abolition of taxes and the payment of the debt, the reduction of placemen and pensioners, the annihilation of bribery and corruption, the reformation of luxury, dissipation and effeminacy, the disbanding the army, are all necessary to restore your country to a free government, and to a safe, honourable, and happy life. But is this practicable, is there a resource in human nature for hope of such a miraculous change? is there one example of it in history or experience? a nation is easily corrupted, but not so easily reformed. The present reign may be that of Augustus, but upon my honour I expect twelve Caesars will succeed it. What is to become of America if they should? ought she not to think in time, and prepare for the worst. I have a great curiosity to know how the proceedings of the Congress at Philadelphia are relished in London, at St. James's, and St. Stephens. I think it may be seen from them, that America is not in sensible of her danger, nor inattentive to the means of her safety. I am also very anxious to know what the friends of liberty think of the hasty dissolution of parliament; for my own part, I have ever thought this the most insidious and artful step of the present reign, it seems to betray more contempt of the people, at the same time that it betrays a dread of some remaining sense and integrity among them, than any thing else which has been done. You will allow, Sir, that the broil with America is a very great national concern. At a time when America was assembled to concert measures relative this great concern, a new parliament is called of a sudden, before the people could hear from America, as if the minister disdained or dreaded that the nation should have opportunity to judge of the state of America, and choose or instruct their representatives accordingly; as if the minister scorned or feared that the people, the electors, should have opportunity to hear and converse together upon facts, before they chose their members. The design of the ministry seems to have been likewise to give the friends of liberty the go-by, in England as well as in America; determined to pursue their system, they would not suffer the friends of the constitution to converse or correspond together before the day of election, lest the constituents should bind the candidates to act an honest part. It is not easy to convey to you, Sir, an adequate idea of the state of this province. It is now at last true, that we have no government, legislative, executive, or judicial. The people determined never to submit to the act for destroying their charter, so dearly purchased, preserved and defended by the toil, treasure and blood of  their ancestors, are every where devoting themselves to arms. Our Duke of Alva is shut up with his troops, and his forlorn Mandamus Counsellors in Boston. What the ministry will do is uncertain,--all the British fleet and army cannot change mens opinions; they cannot make a juror serve, nor a representative. An attempt to cram a form of government sown the throats of a people, to impose a constitution upon all united and determined people by force, is not within the omnipotence of an English parliament. If they attempt a campaign like that of Kirk, if they send the sword and fire to ravage in this country, they will find in New England an hundred thousand descendants of the puritans in the Charles's and James's days, who have not yet lost entirely the spirit of Englishmen under the English commonwealth. Our enemies give out that persons who have distinguished themselves here, in Opposition to the power of parliament, will be arrested and sent to some County in England, to be tried for treason; if this should be attempted, it will produce resistance and reprisals, and a flame through all America, such as eye have not seen nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of the minister or his minions to conceive. I beg the continuance of your favours, and am, wit the warmest wishes for the safety of both countries.

I am extreamly oblidged to you for your much esteemed favor of the 26th Ultimo. and for your sentiments Upon so Important a Question as that of the assumption of Government; I agree with you that such a measure would evidently tend to break the present harmony of the Colonies and would embarrass our freinds in England.(1) It has never been moved in our Provincial Congress. While a Committee had under Consideration, what were the most proper means to place ourselves in a posture of Defence, so that in case Administration is FEBRUARY 13, 1775  so determined to execute the late Acts by force, we might be able to make an Effectual Resistance, Agreable to the advice of the Conti- nental Congress, It was moved for the Consideration of the Commit tee, Whether in order to do this Effectually it would not be necessary to take up some form of Government, but after mature and deliberate Consideration it was Rejected, & the Committee agreed that it was by no means expedient at present to go into any such measure, and you may depend upon it, no such thing will be moved at the present Congress.(2) Whenever it has been mentioned I have strenuously opposed it as a measure pregnant with mischeif & the most fatal Con sequences. Our People are very generally against the measure & I shall Continue to discountenance it--at the same time I cannot refrain from observing that it is an arduous peice of work to keep a numerous brave & free People, who are dayly Injured & Insulted quietly waiting the event of peaceable applications for a restoration of their Rights and at the same time with unremitting Diligence preparing to support those Rights. We are Suffering greatly in the Common Cause, we are without Law, without Courts, without the administration of Justice, which is Essentially necessary in Society---under these pressing difficulties, I assure You, Sir, I am astonished at the peace & good order observed amoung our People, at the calm temperate & fixed Spirit with which they undergo these hardships. You may rest assured that they never will assume Government unless the Ministry should determine and Execute the late Acts by a Military force & it should thereby become absolutely necessary for our Defence & preservation, in which Case they presume from the Resolution of the Congress that they shall be justified by the Whole Continent in so doing. We are Waiting with great sollicitude for the resolutions of Parliament. What Course they will pursue is as yet utterly uncertain.

I kindly thank you also for Informing me, what, you apprehend, would be the Sentiments of the other Colonies upon such Maneauvre.

Feby. 24th 1775 All America has received with astonishment and concern the Speech to Parliament.(1) The wicked violence of Ministry is so clearly expressed, as to leave no doubt of their fatal determination to ruin both Countries, unless a powerful and timely check is interposed by the Body of the people. A very small corrupted Junto in New York excepted, all N. America is now most firmly united and as firmly resolved to defend their Liberties ad infinitum against every power on Earth that may attempt to take them away. The most effectual measures are every where taking to secure a sacred observance of the Association. Manufactures go rapidly on, and the means of repelling force by force are universally adopting. The inclosed Address to the Virginia Delegates published a few days since in the Gazette will shew you the spirit of the Frontier Men. This one County of Fincas- FEBRUARY 24, 1775  tle can furnish 1000 Rifle Men that for their number make the most formidable light Infantry in the world. The six frontier Counties can produce 6000 of these Men who from their amazing hardihood, their method of living so long in the woods without carrying provisions with them, the exceeding quickness with which they can march to distant parts, and above all, the dexterity to which they have arrived in the use of the Rifle Gun. Their is not one of these Men who wish a distance less than 200 yards on a larger object than an Orange. Every shot is fatal. The Virginia Colony Congress meets the 20th of next month for the appointment of Delegates to the Continental Congress in May next, and for other purposes of public security. The Ministry who are both foolish and wicked, think by depriving us of Assemblies to take away the advantage that results from united and collected counsels. But they are grievously mistaken. In despight of all their machinations, public Councils will be held and public measures adopted for general security. Still we hope that the proceedings of the last Continental Congress when communicated to the people of England will rouse a spirit that proving fatal to an abandoned Ministry may save the whole Empire from Its impending destruction. The honerable Coll. Lee of Stratford was buried this day, he died the 21st ultimo after a months painful illness. He is a public loss, and if the Ministry go on filling up these vacancies in the Council with raw boys and hotheaded senseless people, the affairs of Virginia must be in perpetual confusion, altho the present dispute should be accommodated. It is absolutely necessary that some grave sensible Men should now be placed there in order to temper the present body. The pamphlet entitled an Appeal &c. is, I think the best I have read on the subject amidst such a variety of finely reasoned ones.(2) Farewell. P.S. By authentic accounts just come to hand, all the Ministerial ef forts with New York and the Jersey Governments have failed, both Assemblies have highly approved the proceedings of the Continental Congress, thanked their Delegates, and appointed them to represent their respective Colonies in the next May Congress.(3) From N. York we have lately sent back a Ship from Glasgow with goods that arrived after 1st of Feby. scarcely allowing the Vessel time to get fresh provisions. It is now therefore certain that without a redress of Grievances, G. Britain must prepare to do entirely without the N. American trade, nor will the British Isles in the W. Indies get their usual necessary supplies from the Continent. Georgia has ac- ceeded to the Continental Association, and we understand Canada will have Delegates in the next Congress.

I cannot concieve on what principle it is that the Torys should tryumph in the late Conduct of Portsmouth & other places securing FEBRUARY 25, 1775  their Guns & Ammunition; no freind of Government can rejoyce in anything that disturbs Government, much less in what they call Acts of Rebellion, and their tryumph must spring from a malicious, diabolical desire, that the Vengeance of G. Britain may be reaked on the American Colonys; we are very much obliged to you for every hint you give of any danger of dividing the Colonys; our Freinds from one End of the Continent, to the other may depend upon it, that in this Colony no step is taken of any Importance with [ou] t considering how it will be approved of by the other Colonys, & our earnest desire to do nothing that might give Uneasiness, has prevented some steps being taken which perhaps might have been Salutary. With regard to the particular matter of moving the Guns &c, any person who attends to the Current of affairs must know the reason of it was the forbidding Arms & Ammunition being imported, & the Conduct of Administration wearing so hostile an Appearance as to loudly call upon the natural inherent principle of Self preservation. Those who hold the Doctrines of passive Obedience & non resistance will fault their Conduct, whilst others who view these transactions as Connected with the rights of mankind & Englishmen, will have more liberal apprehensions from them.

The Story you mention is one of this Sort, no such motion was made or thought of as I know of much less did Mr. Cushing ever in his life use such language, & as for the dissolution of the Congress, it was done upon the same principle the Grand Congress was dissolved Vizt. to give the Inhabitants Opportunity of Sending Other men if they pleased, after they had done every thing which they then thought proper to do & a new one has just sat.

Poor weak sighted Men, who are floating with the Tide of Licentiousness & Sedition, which they expect will run forever, when a little common Sense wou'd tell them that it must soon change, and that with it they must change their Language & embrace your friendly Advice. I am happy in telling you, that the People of this Province (Pennsylvania) are altering their Sentiments & Conduct with amazing rapidity. We have been successful in baffling all the Attempts of the violent Party to prevail on the People to prepare for War against the Mother Country. The Quakers, the high & low Dutch, the Baptists, Menonists, Dumplers &c. are promoting Moderate Measures; in so FEBRUARY 28, 1775  much that I hope, with some Trouble, all Violence will soon cease, & Peace & Order take Place of Licentiousness & Sedition. The Tories (as they are called) make it a Point to visit the Coffee House dayly & maintain their Ground--while the violent Independents are less bold & insolent, as their Adherents are greatly diminished. On Thursday & Friday last, determined to abide the Consequences what ever they might be either in respect to my Person or Estate, I spoke my Sentiments in Assembly without the least reserve. I censured & con- demned the Measures of the Congress in every Thing--aver'd that they all tended to incite America to Sedition & terminated in Inde- pendence--contended for, & proved the Necessity of Parliamentary Jurisdiction over the Colonies in all Cases whatsoever--exposed the Folly of those who hoped, that the British State would suffer its Au- thority to be in the least impaired, much less totally given up explained the rights of America, & pointed out the Necessity of our taking different Measures from those already taken for a recovery of them. I stood single & unsupported, among a Set of Men every one of whom had approved of the Measures I was censuring, reprobating their own Conduct to them--& endeavouring by cool & dispassionate reason & Argument to convince them of their Errors. The Opposition as I expected was violent & indecent. I kept my Temper unruffled & firm which gave me no small Advantage. My Opponents were, The Governor's father-in-Law (our late chief Justice) the Pennsylvania Farmer,(1) Chs. Thompson, Thos. Mifflin & Geo. Ross. The Motion was to petition the King agreeably to the Governor's Advice in his Message, for which we are more indebted to you & Gov. Colden than to him. The Success my Arguments met with; greatly exceeded my most sanguine Expectations. Fourteen Members came over to me; but there being 38 in the House, & finding I should lose the Vote without four more Converts--I was obliged to alter my Plan, & to move to postpone the Debate untill next Wednesday week hoping that Procrastination & News by the next Pacquet might assist me. My Design being suspected a warm Opposition succeeded--however we carried the Question, 19 for it, 18 against it.(2) But after all the Issue yet re mains uncertain I rather think as the independent Party will exert every Nerve, & at last die hard, it will take more Time to defeat them. And that I shall not be able at this Time to carry such a Petition as I wish to send, as none should go, but one which may render it consistent with the Dignity of Government to receive.

One Paragraph which alarms me I have not disclosd to any one; it is this--'I have been in the Country with Lord Chatham to shew him the Petition of the Congress of which he highly approves. He is of Opinion that a solemn Renunciation of the Right to tax on the one side, and an Acknowledgment of the Supremacy on the other, should accompany the repeal of all the obnoxious Acts. Without this, he says, the Hearts of the two Countries will not openly embrace each other with unfeigned Affection and Reconcilement.' In this short Sentence I think it is easy to see, that his Lordships plan of Reconciliation is the same with that which he held forth in his Speech at the time of the Repeal of the Stamp Act. However highly I think of his Lordships Integrity, I confess I am chagrind to find, that he expects an Acknowledgment of Supremacy in terms on our part. I imagine that after such Acknowledgment, there may be a variety of Ways by which Great Britain may enslave us besides that of taxing us without our Consent. The possibility of it should greatly awaken our Apprehensions. Let us take Care lest America in Lieu of a Thorn in the Foot should have a Dagger in her heart.

I am pleased with the Attack because it has given me an Opportunity of supporting the Principles of the Pamphlet by some new Arguments, & of exposing the Ignorance & independant Notions of the Pennsylvania Farmer & his Colleague Mr. Thompson. Mr. Rivington will send you one as soon as it is published. \""As I seldom keep Copies of my Letters, I know not particularly how far I communicated the Proceedings in our Assembly.... I think I wrote you the substance & the Event of the two first Days Debate upon the [Governor's] Message, & that the further Consideration of it was postponed for near 10 Days. I need not therefore repeat it here. On the Saturday before the Day of the further Debate the independent party despairing of Success in preventing a Petition to his Majesty, moved that the Doors should be thrown open, & the Mob let in upon me. I was secretly advertised of this Design, & had spoke to a Number of Friends to be there in Case the Motion should succeed, being determined it should have no other Effect, but to prepare myself better & to speak with more Firmness & more fully upon the Measures of the Congress. However upon debating the Motion, we carried it in the Negative 24 to 14. This was an humiliating Blow to my Opponents. I had hitherto carried every Question, & constantly by an increased Majority. And yet altho' I had brought a Number of the Members (not less than 16 out of 39) to petition upon proper Grounds, I found it impossible, as there were very little hopes of gaining four more. I therefore resolved to change my Ground & to prevail on the House to adjourn to some Day between this & the 10th of May, the Time of Meeting of the next Congress; In Expectation that by the Change of the Peoples Sentiments out of Doors, which had already undergone an amazing Alteration, and the Intelligence MARCH 26, 1775  of Firm Measures being determined on by Parliament, that I might at that Time succeed in more rational & salutary Measures. Under this resolution, I went to the House on the Day appointed for the Debate; & proposed 4 Heads as the Substance of an Answer to the Governor's Message. The 3 first, after violent Opposition, were at length unanimously agreed to. The fourth, in which I had mentioned the Adjournment, produced a warm & long debate, the Independents op posing any Adjournment till after the sitting of the Congress. Upon this a Question was put, & we carried it in the Affirmative, 24 to 14. Thus my great Point was gained which did not a little distress the other Party. And upon this a Committee was appointed to bring in an Answer to the Governor's Message founded on my Propositions, with only an Amendment proposed by Mr. Dickinson to the Fourth. When the House adjourned Dickinson came to me and agreed that I should reduce the Answer to Form & bring it in the next Morning. This I engaged to do. But I should here inform you, that the Speaker acted the most shamefull & particular Part in the Appointment of the Committee--taking 12 of the 14 Negatives & only 2 of the 24 Af- firmatives for the Adjournment--i.e. 12 of one side & only 2 of the other. I saw the Partiality, but as things seem'd to be settled, & not suspecting the dirty Manceuvre which followed, I disregarded it. \""At this unlucky Moment a Ship from Bristol arrived, & bro't those partial & fictitious Accounts published in the Papers. The Inde- pendents sounded it thro' all the Streets in the City that all the Acts must be repealed, That the Measures of the Congress were the Measures of Consummate Wisdom &c. &c. This gave rise to one of the most dirty & scandalous Measures which ever was transacted in public Life. In my Absence, & while I was engaged in drawing up the Answer--The Committee met--Thompson & Ross, & I suspect with the privity of Dickenson, had previously drawn up the Message you see published. This was laid before Committee of Independents, where it was resolved that that Message should be considered without sending for me. It was agreed to, carried into the House--read the first Time--& moved to have a second & final reading. This was opposed by my Friends, but they had not Brass enough to insist upon it. In the Evening I was informed that a Member of the Committee had bragged how the Committee had deceived, or, to use his own Expression, flung Galloway. On the next morning I moved that the Answer should be recommitted; And, after giving a short Accot. of the Facts, I assigned as reasons--1st. That the Committee had acted a dishonourable, disingenuous, dirty & fraudulent Part, one unbecoming Men in public Character--That they had by Art & Fraud deprived me of the priviledge of voting in Committee: That they knew I was absent on my Duty to the House on the very Business before them, And that if they did not choose I should do it, they should at  least have sent for me &c. 2dly. That they had treated the House with insolent Disregard & Disobedience; for that they had not inserted in the Answer either Sentiment or Word of what was Yesterday unanimously agreed upon. 3dly. That it contained palpable Untruths. To these I added many other Arguments, But all was in vain. This was not a Time when reason was to prevail. The great News of Yesterday had altered the Minds of some of the weak & irresolute of the Chester & Philada. Members & upon the Question they carried it against the Commitment 20 to 16. The answer went thro' the House. I opposed it in every stage--And upon the Question whether it should be transcribed it was carried 22 to 14. And in Order to shew that the House was divided--which they much dreaded--I insisted upon the Yeas & Nays to be taken down & published as you have seen. The House stands adjourned to the first of May. \""I intimated before, that I had met with Insults during my Stay in the City. Shortly after the two first Days Debates--late in the Evening a Box was left at my Lodgings nail'd & directed to me. Upon opening it next Morning I found in it a Halter, with a threatening Letter. I read the Letter & nail'd up the Box--lock'd it carefully in my Charriott Box, determined not to mention it to any Body--as I knew it would be impossible that the Person sending it should keep it long a Secret & hoping by that Means to discover them. I waited a Fortnight & nothing transpired. At length it came out from two of the Persons whom I verily believe sent it--And from the Clue, so far as I have traced it, it comes from two Members of Assembly, a discarded Assembly Officer & a Head of the White Oaks. However it had no other Effect on me than to fix me in my former resolutions to oppose those lawless Measures at all Events. \""I am happy in your Approbation of my Pamphlet. I find from all Quarters it is universally applauded by Men of Candor & Abilities. Your Sentiments & mine are not different respecting the proper Union with G. Britain, nor respecting the Addition to my proposed Plan. I thought of it at the Time, but omitted it because I knew the Plan would be less exceptionable to those Democratic Spirits to whom it was to be proposed, & by whom adopted in the first Instance, & because I thought it might be added in the Negotiation. The great End I had in View in offering the Plan, I have often before told you was to prevail on the Congress to take the Ground of Negotiation & Proposition.... I am Confident no Endeavours will be used by Government here, only \""to save Appearances,\"" to prevent the Appointment of Deputies for the intended Congress. When I refused to accept of the Appointment in December I could not prevail on Judge Morton to join me in the refusal. However, I am determined to oppose the appointment in our sitting in May, & exert every Nerve to prevent it.\""(2) APRIL 1, 1775  ""

249,dg001261,1775,Georgia Delegates to Peyton Randolph,"""Georgia Delegates to Peyton Randolph   Sir Savannah in Georgia 6th April 1775 The unworthy Part which the Province of Georgia has acted in the great and general Contest, leaves Room to expect little less than the Censure or even Indignation of every virtuous Man in America.(1) Altho on the one hand we feel the Justice of such a Consequence with respect to the Province in General, yet on the other we claim an Exemption from it in favor of some Individuals who wished a better Conduct. Permit us therefore in Behalf of ourselves, and many others our Fellow Citizens warmly attached to the Cause, to lay before the respectable Body over which you preside, a few Facts which we trust will not only acquit us of Supineness, but also render our Conduct to be approved by all candid and dispationate Men. At the Time the late Congress did this Province the Honor to transmit to it an Extract from their proceedings, inclosed in a friendly Letter from the Honble Mr. Middleton,(2) the Sense and Disposition of the People in general seemed to fluctuate, and as it were waver between Liberty and Conveniency. In order to bring on a Deter- mination respecting the Measures recommended a few well affected Persons in Savannah by publick Advertisement in the Gazette, re quested a Meeting of all the Parishes and Districts, by Delegates or Representatives in provincial Congress. On the Day appointed for this meeting with Concern they found, that only five out of twelve Parishes to which they had particularly wrote, had nominated and sent down Delegates and even some of these five had laid their Representatives under Injunctions as to the Form of an Association. Under those Circumstances those who met saw themselves a good deal embarrassed, however one Expedient seemed still to present itself. The House of Assembly was then sitting, and it was hoped there wou'd be no doubt of a Majority in favour of American Freedom. The Plan therefore was to go thro' what Business they cou'd in Provincial Congress, and then with a short Address present the same to the House of Assembly, who it was hoped wou'd by Vote, in a few Minutes, and before Prerogative shou'd interfere, make it the Act of the whole Province. Accordingly the Congress framed and agreed to such an Association and did such other Business as appeared practicable with the People, and had the whole just ready to be presented, when The Governor, either treacherously informed of, or shrewdly suspecting the Step, put an End to the session. What then cou'd the Congress do. On the one hand Truth forbid them to call their Proceedings the Voice of the Province, there being but five out of twelve Parishes concerned, and on the other they wanted Strength sufficient to enforce them upon a Principle of Necessity to which all ought for a Time to submit. They found the Inhabitants of Savannah not likely APRIL 6, 1775  soon to give Matters a favorable Turn. The Importers were mostly against any Interruption and the Consumers very much divided. There were some of the latter virtuously for the Measures, others strenuously against them, but more who called themselves Neutrals than either. Thus situated there appeared Nothing before us, but the Alternative of either immediately commencing a Civil War among ourselves, or else of patiently waiting the Measures to be recommended by the next General Congress. Among a powerful People, provided with Men Money and Conveniencies, and by whose Conduct others were to be regulated the former wou'd certainly be the Resolution that wou'd suggest itself to every Man removed from the Condition of a Coward; but in a small Community like that of Savannah (where Members are mostly in their first Advance towards Wealth or Independence, destitute of even the Necessaries of Life within themselves, and from whose Junction or Silence so little wou'd be added or lost to the General Cause,) the latter presented itself as the most eligible Plan, and was adopted by the People. From that Time to the present nothing worthy of Notice in a publick Way has been done. Party disputes and Animosities have occasionally prevailed which shew that the Spirit of Freedom is not extinguished, but only restrained for a Time till an Opportunity shall offer for calling it forth. The Congress convened in Savannah did us the honor of choosing us Delegates to meet your respectable Body at Philadelphia on the tenth of next Month. We were sensible of the Honor and Weight of the Appointment and wou'd gladly have rendered our Country any Services our poor Abilities wou'd have admitted of, but alas! with what Face cou'd we have appeared for a Province whose Inhabitants had refused to sacrifice the most triffling advantage to the publick Cause, and in whose behalf we did not think we cou'd safely pledge ourselves for the Execution of any one Measure whatsoever. We do not mean to insinuate that those who appointed us wou'd prove Apostates, or desert their Opinion, but that the Tide of Opposition and Interest were so great that all the Strength and Virtue of these our Friends might be insufficient for the Purpose. We very early saw the Difficulties that wou'd here occur, and therefore repeatedly and constantly requested the People to proceed to the Choice of other Delegates in our Stead, but this they refused to do. We beg Sir you will view our Reasons for not attending in a liberal Point of Light.(3) Be pleased to make the most favorable Representation of them to the Honble The Members of the Congress.

We begin to have the Tory Accounts of the Action. All of them lessen the Success, and increase the Loss of the New England Men, and some of them have drubbed the Yankees most woundily, but I believe all agree that the Regulars marched from Charles Town to Concord & back again the same day, and that in their Return they came 15 Miles of the Distance, in about three Hours, though the Yankees gave them very warm Invitations to stay longer, which were accepted by a part of the Regulars, who still remain there. I am much more alarmed at the Situation of N. York than the Massachusetts. Every Man who will reflect must think it of the utmost Consequence in every View to keep possession of that Province. By the last of this Month we may expect the Arrival of the Troops who are to occupy that post. I indeed wished to have immediately sent about 2000 picked Men to N York and have pressed my Neighbours on either Side to a proportional Exertion but the Motions of Numbers are too slow and their Counsels too cautious to act effectual. Nothing can be done till the Meeting of the Congress. I expect we shall be plagued at the Congress with plans of Reconciliation thrown out, not indeed to obtain that Desirable End but to revive Hopes of Liberty and Peace, retard our Operations, and di- vide us, when at the same Time they are pushing us vigorously on every Side, and the firm N. England Govts in particular are to be sur rounded in such a Manner as to be starved into Submission. I am in Hopes the Neighbourhood of N. York will have Virtue enough to take more upon themselves than their own Share for a little while and that my Countrymen will act in Time enough to relieve some of the Jersey or Connecticut people who may be forward in the Business. I imagine Questions of immense Consequence must come before the Contl. Congress. The Ministry have so conducted themselves that it seems to me all Men must be satisfied they do not intend to heal the Distractions Divisions & wounds in the British Empire. I intirely agree with you that when the Hope of peace is lost the preparation, if so long delayed, for Defence ought to be with the utmost Vigour. I am obliged to add but and yet I hate the word, but I cannot say I am sorry that Lord Dunmore has begun in Virginia since we have no prospect of any Thing but Extremities.

261,dg001273,1775,Richard Henry Lee to William Lee,"""Richard Henry Lee to William Lee   Dear Brother Philadelphia 10 May 1775 I am exceedingly pressed with business and therefore must be short, and for this time mix politics with business of a private nature. The Virga. Delegates arived here yesterday where they find all those from the Southward of this, with the Deputies from N. Hamshire. In an hour all from the Colonies north of this will be here and then the Congress will be opened. There never appeared more perfect unanimity among any sett of Men than among the Delegates, and indeed all the old Provinces, not one excepted, are directed by the same firmness of union, and determination to resist by all ways and to every extremity. The Province of N. York is at last alarmed.(1) The Tory Ministerial faction are driven from their influence and virtuous patriotism taken place. The shameful defeat of General Gages Troops near Boston (after a wanton and cruel Attack on unarmed people, after they had brutally killed Old Men, Women, & Children) has rivitted such union, roused such a universal Military spirit thro out all the Colonies, and excited such universal resentment against this Savage Ministry and their detestable Agents, that now no doubt remains of their destruction with the establishment of American Rights. 800 of the Regulars commanded by a Colo. Smith was defeated by 600 provincials hastily gathered together--Altho tis agreed the Colo. personally behaved with the true spirit of a good Soldier. These 800 were afterwards supported by 1200 under command of Ld. Piercy, but the whole were compelled (upon a reenforcement coming up to the Provincials) to retreat to Boston having had several Men killed, MAY 10, 1775  wounded, and taken prisoners. The Provincials are since increased to 20,000 and lay now encamped before Boston. All communication is cut off between Town & Country. The Troops, by way of insult, marched first out of Town to the tune of Yankey doodle, and some time after fired unprovoked upon some people who were exercising, as they told the Regulars for amusement without having any ammunition with them. This is the most authentic account we have here of this business. The Connecticut people with the N. Yorkers are pre paring to prevent any bad designs of the Troops coming to the latter place. I expect Capt. Brown will soon be loaded, as he has Toba[cco] enough ready. You will please insure for Colo. George Mason one hundred hogsheads in the Adventure to recover £ 10. sterling in case of loss. 22 hhds of Colo. P. L. Lee's estate & 5 of mine at what you judge proper. The proceeds of these 22 hhds are to be applied to the use of our brother Doctor Lee. 15 of them are Top stem'd heavy hhds. So that you may advance the Doctor at least 200 Guineas on the whole. Mr. Willings Tobacco's were all engaged another way before your application. Loudon [Francis L. Lee] & Mr. Brown will take care of yr. Virga business. The Doctors family here send their love.

263,dg001275,1775,Richard Caswell to William Caswell,"""Richard Caswell to William Caswell   My Dear Son Philadelphia 11th May 1775. By a Gentleman Bound to Tar River I now Write to inform you,(1) that after I parted with you at Halifax Mr. Hewes & myself proceeded on our Journey, as follows. Sunday evening we Arrived at Petersburg in Virginia where we met the express with an Accot. of a Battle between the Kings Troops & the Bostonians. The next day we crossed James River & Lodged at Hanover Court House, where we had an Accot of 1500 Men being under Arms to proceed to Williamsburg in Order to Oblige Lord Dunmore to return some powder he had taken out of the Magazine & lodged on Board of a Man of War in James River; what was done in that matter we have not since Heard. The next day we were constantly meeting Armed men who had been to Escort the delegates for Virginia on their Way towards this place. We Lodged that night at Port Royal and were only 2 or 3 Hours after the Virginia Gentn. The next day we got down to Potowmack Side before the Boats returned that had carried the Virginians over. Here were part of the Militia of three Counties under Arms & in the Uniform of hunting shirts, they received us & Conducted us, on the return of the Boats, to the waters edge with all the Military honors due to General Officers, we then crossed the River and learned at the Ferry on Maryland side that a Company of Independants in Charles County had Attended the Virginia delegates from there under Arms, we proceeded & overtook them at Port Tobacco, where indeed the Independants made a Most Glorious Appearance. Their Company consisted of 68 Men beside officers all Genteelly drest in Scarlet & well equiped with Arms & Warlike Implements with drum & Fife, Sentinels were placed at the doors & occasionally releived during the Time we stayed there. The next Morning We all set out together & were Attended by the Independants to the Verge of their County, where they delivered us to another Company of Independants in Prince George's & they in  MAY 11, 1775  like Manner to a second and that to a Third which brot us through their County. We Lodged that night at Malborough & the next day tho we met with a Most Terible Gust of Lightining, thunder, wind, Hail & rain. Arrived at Baltimore at the enterance of Which Town we were received by four Independant Companies who Conducted us with their Colours Flying, drums Beating & Fifes playing to our Lodgings at the Fountain Tavern (Grants). The next day we were prevailed on to stay at Baltimore, where Colo. Washington Accompanied by the rest of the delegates reviewed the Troops. They have four Companies of 68 Men each Compleat, who go thro their Exercises extremely Clever, they are raising in that Town three other Companies which they say will soon be full. We were very Genteelly entertained here in the Court House. The next day we Breakfasted at My old Master Cheynes & dined at Susquehanah, crossed the River & Lodged at the Ferry House. As I had in some Measure been the cause of the Virginia Gentn. going round the Bay by recommending that road & being the only person in the Company Acquainted with the road I was Obliged to keep with them so that I did not call on any of my relations. I sent George in to Jos. Dallams where he left the Letters I brot. for our Friends and was informed my Grand Mother & all Friends were Well except Mrs. Dallam who had been poorly some Time. The next day we got to Wilmington where we fell in with Several of The Maryland delegates & came all into this City to Dinner on the 7th Instant. Yesterday the Congress met Agreable to Appointment & this day it was Resolved that they enter upon the Consideration of American grievances Monday next. Here a Greater Martial Spirit prevails if possible, than I have been describing in Virginia & Maryland. They have 28 Companies Compleat which make near 2000 Men who March out to the Common & go thro their Exercises twice a Day regularly. Scarce any thing But Warlike Musick is to be heard in the Streets, there are Several Com- panies of Quakers only, and many of them beside enrolled in Other Companies promiscuously. Tis sayed they will in a few days have 3000 Men under Arms ready to defend their Liberties. They are raising Men in New York & all the Northern Governments, the Yorkers I am told by their Delegates are determined to Defend their Liberties & since the Action between the Kings Troops & the Provincials scarcely a Tory is to be found amongst them. I herewith inclose you a paper in which is a List of the Killed & Wounded of the Kings Troops, But 'tis said this is not Genuine, a Much greater Number being Actually Killed. On the side of the Bostonians 37 were Killed outright 4 are Missing & I forget The Number of Wounded I think thirty odd. Thus you have the fullest Account I am Able to give of these matters and as the Accot. is so long twill not be in my power to Commun-  nicate the same to any other of my Countrymen & friends but thro'you. You may therefore remember me in the Strongest manner to Your Uncles, Capt Bright & others of my particular Friends. Shew them this Letter, and tell them it will be a Reflection on their Country to be Behind their neighbours, that it is Indispensibly necessary for them to Arm & form into a Company or Companies of Independants. When their Companies are full, 68 private Men each to Elect Officers Viz a Capt. 2 Leut. an Ensign & Subalterns, And to meet so often as possible & go thro the exercise, receive no Man but such as can be depended on, at the same Time reject none who will not discredit the Company. If I live to return I shall most Chearfully Join any of my Countrymen even as a rank and file man, And as in the Common cause I am here exposed to danger that or any other difficulties I shall not shun whilst I have any Blood in my Veins, But freely offer it in Support of the Liberties of my Country. Tell Your Uncles (the Clk & Sher.) it may not be prudent for them so far to engage, yet awhile, in any Company as to risk the losses of their offices. But you, my Dear Boy, must become a Soldier & risk your life in Support of those invaluable Blessings, which once lost Posterity will never be able to regain. Some men I fear will start objections to the enrolling of Companies & exercising the Men & will say it will be acting against Government, that may be Answered \""That it is not so\"" That we are only Qualifying ourselves and preparing to defend our Country & Support our Liberties. I can say no more at present But that May God Almighty protect you all & his Blessing Attend your good endeavors, is the Ardent prayer of, My Dear Child, Your Affectionate Father Rd Caswell P.S. Only shew this Letter to such as I have described above & don't let it be Copied, Consult Capt Bright &c. ""

264,dg001276,1775,Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston,"""Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston   Dear Sir Philadelphia 11th May 1775 I arived here the 9th, in company with the Virginia delegates. Yesterday the Congress met when all the Provinces that sent delagates before were Represented except Rhode Island, the two Governors from that Colony are expected in a day or two. Mr Randolph is Chosen President & C. Thompson Secretary. Doctr. Franklin arived here on Fryday last and on Saturday was appointed a Delagate, by the assembly of this Province. They also added Mr. Thomas Willing & Mr. Wilson to the number. Galloway has turned apostate; he struggled hard in the House of assembly to get a majority to Condemn the proceedings of the late Congress, & to Petition the King &c. as the assembly of New York had done. By this Step he has lost the Confidence of all ranks of People. A few days ago a Box was left at his Lodgings in this City directed for Jos. Galloway Esqr. He opened it before several Gentleman then present and was much surprised to find it contained a Halter with a note in these words \""all the Satisfaction you can now give your injured Country is to make a proper use of this and rid the World of a Damned Scoundrell.\"" He is gone off no body can tell where tho it is thought to New York.(1) All kinds of business is at hand here. Nothing is heard but the sound of Drums & Fifes, all Ranks & Degrees of men are in Arms learning the Manual Exercise Evolution & the management of Artillery. They have now in this City Twenty eight Companies of Foot of 68 men each including Officers all of whom are out twice every day in Training. Several more Companies are forming, they have also two Companies of Light Horse in short it is impossible to describe the Spirit of these people and the alteration they have undergone since I left them in December last. All the Quakers except a few of the old Rigid ones have taken up arms, there is not one Company without several of these people in it, and I am told one or two of the Companies are composed entirely of Quakers. The people of this Province in general MAY 11, 1775  are associating in Companies and employing Sarjants to teach them the exercise. I find all the Provinces are in Arms Except No. Carolina. New York has been Converted almost as instantaneously as St Paul was of old, a Tory dare not open his mouth either in that Province or this. The Battle near Boston & the Act of Parliament for restraining the Trade of all the Colonies except New York & N. Carolina has wrought the Conversion of New York. I wish to God it may have the same affect on our Province, I tremble for No. Carolina, every County ought to have at least one Company formed & exercised, pray encourage it. Speak to the people, write to them, urge strongly the necessity of it, I had rather perish Ten thousand times than they should give up the matter now in the time of tryal. The Bearer Mr Reed is in quest of some Effects of his Father's who died lately in Pitt County, he is related to some of the first Char- acters here.

265,dg001277,1775,Caesar Rodney to Thomas Rodney,"""Caesar Rodney to Thomas Rodney   Sir, Philada. May the 11th 1775 I have verry little News (as Yet) to Write you, More Than What the printers (Who are verry apt to get the Whip-hand of their neighbours in that way) have set forth in their papers, Which you will get per Posts. Billy Rodney will give you a discription of the public entry of the Bostonian deligates into this City Yesterday, it was verry grand and Intended to Shew their approbation of the Conduct of the good people of that Government, in the distressing situation of Affairs there. I believe, from the best accounts, That General Gage Was forced upon the plan of Sending Troops to Concord, by the other of MAY 11, 1775  ficers of Note, together with the Tory party in Boston, Mandamus Councellors &c.--Alledging that the people would Address, Resolve and threaten, but Would not fight. The general tho over-ruled it Seems was not Convinced, therefore Sent a Second Brigade. The purpose of the Expedition was to destroy the Amunition, Arms, pro visions and Bridges, and some say to take Hancock and the other delegates Who they know to be in that part of the Country. Mr. Han cock told me he had been to See that Small Company at Lexington Exercise, and had not left them more [than] ten Minutes, When the Troops came up, and that they had no Suspition of any. Last Evening I see a verry intelligent man from Massachusetts Government Who was in the engagement, and got him to relate the Story. He says they fired on the people at Lexington as related, and Killed Seven on the Spot, they dispersed without returning The fire, That the Troops went on to Concord, distroyed [meat?] flower & pork, throw a Quantaty of Ball in the River, Broke two Cannon, and did other damage, That by this time one hundred and fifty Provincials had Collected near the Bridge, that the Troops fired on them and Killed three, That the provincials for the first time Returned the fire, Which they Continued and Encreasing in their number drove the Troops back as far as Lexington--Where when Joined by the second Brigade they made some Stand but Soon Retired again, Which they Continued without making any Stop till they got to Charles-Town. He says they retreated at the rate of Near Six Miles an Hour--That there never was more than four hundred Provincials Who See them till they got to Buncar's Hill at the Edge of Charles-Town, That there were better than two Thousand provincial who had way-laid them but were on the Wrong Road, and about two Thousand more Who followed verry fast but Could not Come up till at Buncar's Hill-That the Provincialls had thirty Six Killed, That he Cannot tell how many Regulars were Killed, But that the provincials buried one hundred and three of them Which they found dead on the Road from Concord to Charles-Town. I Should be glad you Would Call upon Joseph Pryor And know Whether I Can have that Room of his Next Doctor Ridgely's on Rent in Case I Should Stand in Need of it, & know of him What the rent must be. There is Such a Martial Spirit prevails in the province, that I Can't get you a Drum & Colours in less that two Weeks by Which time Fleeson says they Shall be ready. The packet I desired Mr. Maurice to Call at my house for, I have since found in my Trunk. The Congress met Yesterday Chose Peyton Raldolp President, & Charles Thomson Secretary.

267,dg001279,1775,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   My Dear Friday May l2th [1775] I wrote you a long Letter from New York which conclude You recd.(1) On Monday morning, the Company of Grenadiers under Capt. Lasher formed before Our head Quarters and the principal Gentlemen of the City with their Delegates being Assembled, a procession was made to the Ferry, where the Rhode Island packet lay to receive us. The Crowd had become almost as great, as on the Saturday before, & we pass'd the Ferry, (after Three Huzza's from the Shore,) just above the Man of Warr, music playing, on board, & armed Boats on each Side. When arrived the Grenadiers landed first, & formed, then We landed, & parted. On Our arrival within Three Miles of Newark a Troop of Horse, & a Company of Grenadiers met Us, but to Mr. Hancock's, & the Peoples extreme disappointment, he in his haste took another road and pass'd the Ferry direct to Elisabeth Town. At Newark, we were received, in the most polite manner, MAY 12, 1775  & by as genteel a Company of Gentlemen as any I have seen, with whom we dined, and rode to Elisabeth Town; joined Col. Hancock, recd. a Salute from Four Companies of Militia, and went off for Woodbrige, where all were in arms; but these were very rough Troops & afforded us some Diversion, but they meant well, & we spent half an hour with Them, after which we rode to Brunswic, cross'd the Ferry & lodged, but with a Strong Guard. Early in the Next morning, the militia Mustered, & guarded Us to Princetown, where We were received by a Company under Arms, the president, and Students, &c. Hence we rode to Trenton, and dined, thence to Bristol, & lodged with a Guard. The Next Morning set out for Philadelphia, & were met at about Six Miles on this side the City by about Two Hundred of the principal Gentlemen on Horseback with their Swords Drawn. Here We alighted, & baited. Thence, began a most lengthy procession, half the Gentlemen on horseback, in the Van; next to them, Ten Men on horseback with Bayonets fixed; Then, Hancock & Adams, then Payne, next Mr. Dehart, Next Col. Floyd & Mr. Boerum in a Phaeton with two most elegant white English horses, Then Your humble Servant, & Col. Dyer, then Father Cushing & Jno. Adams, Mr. Sherman next, then Mr. P. Livingston, who took Jno. Webb into his Carriage, as one of his Servants had tired his horse, & took John's. Mr. Alsop tired all Four of his fine bay Horses, and was with Mr. Duane put into other Carriages. Our rear closed, with the remainder of the Gentlemen on horseback, with Swords drawn, and then the Carriages, from the City. At about Two Miles distance We were met, by a Company on Foot, & then by a Company of rifle Men in their Uniform which is very Curious. Thus rolling & gathering like a Snowball, we approached the City which was full of people, & the Crowd, as great as at New York, the Bells all ringing, and the air rent with Shouts & huzza's. My little bay Horses were put in such a Fright that I was in fear of killing several of the spectators, however No harm was done, and after much fatigue, We were landed at the New City Tavern. Happily a Rain had laid the Dust, & we were not so troubled as at New York. We found all Our Freinds from the Southward (Mr. Henry excepted) arrived, he is hourly expected. Caesar is well, and as handsome as ever. Thus I have given You a circumstantial relation, of Our March in state for Two Hundred Miles, not thro any vanity, but to give Your Curiosity Satisfaction, and to Shew you how high the Spirit of the People is, in these parts. In this City they say they have Three Thou sand of the principal Young Men exercising Twice every Day, among whom is a large Number of the Freinds or Quakers. Dr. Franklin is of the Congress the proceedings of which as before will be kept a Secret--Galloway is fled as they say. You think Your Spirit is high, believe Me it is as much warmer here as the Climate and  every kind of preparation goes on rapidly; and I seriously believe Pennsylvania will in one Month, have more then Twenty Thousand well disciplined Troops ready to take the Feild, they exercise here Twice every Day, at Five in the Morning, & Five in the Afternoon, and are extremely well armed. Mr. Mifflin is a Captn. of one Company, Mr. Wykoff his Lt. & Mr. Mifflin's brother an Ensign. The Com mons west of the City, is every Morning & Afternoon, full of Troops, & Spectators, of all Ranks. The delay of the Rhode Island Delegates as to coming up prevents Our entering at once, deeply on Business,(2) but You may depend all will be well, that is if I may Judge from Appearance, but believe Nothing You hear reported of Us, for Our doings will not be published but by Authority of the Whole. The scenes before us are so vast, That I can give no kind of Judgement as to The Term We Shall be detained here, and I tremble when I think of their vast importance --may the God of Wisdom presided Mr. Dushay made a most pathetic, & pertinent prayer at Our Opening--Presidt. and Secry. the same as before. I pray you send Me a paper, Mr. Hosmer has a Copy--Articles of Confederation of the United New England Colonies. It will help Me in an important Matter, it is dated 1642. I think but Mr. Hosmer will know, I have one in my Desk but it may be misfiled in the Confusion. I have no Time in This Letter to write on Business, the Drum, & Fife are hourly sounding in every Street, & my brainpan, is this moment echoing, to the beat, parading under my Window. The Southern Colonies are also all in Arms, & if I may venture a Conjecture on the Whole America has Now more than One Hundred Thousand, ready to take the Feild. Pray let good Care be taken of my Letters, & of those sent Me all must go under Cover to Mr. Hazard. You may shew my Lettrs. but let no Copies, of any paragraph, be Taken. I had determined to write, of sundry matters, on the Road, but the bustle of Attendance prevented, and I am not yet, so Settled as to recollect them, but a part of each Day shall be spent in writing to You & I may add to this before it goes.

You will have heard before this reaches you, of a march stolen by the regulars into the country by night, and of their expedition back again. They retreated 20 miles in [6] hours. The Governor had called the Assembly to propose Lord North's pacific plan; but before the time of their meeting, began cutting of throats;--You know it was said he carried the sword in one hand, and the olive branch in the other; and it seems he chose to give them a taste of the sword first. He is doubling his fortifications at Boston, and hopes to secure his troops till succour arrives. The place indeed is naturally so defensi- ble, that I think them in no danger. All America is exasperated by his conduct, and more firmly united than ever. The breach between the two countries is grown wider, and in danger of becoming irreparable. I had a passage of six weeks; the weather constantly so moderate that a London wherry might have accompanied us all the way. I got home in the evening, and the next morning was unanimously chosen by the Assembly a delegate to the Congress, now sitting. In coming over I made a valuable philosophical discovery,(1) which I shall communicate to you, when I can get a little time. At present am extremely hurried....(2) Yours most affectionately. B. F. ""

If I could have communicated any thing by the last Post certain and satisfactory, I should most assuredly have done it agreeable to my promise, but the only articles of Intelligence which came to my hands were containd in the Gazetees & went regularly to you. This is pretty much the case at present, and leaves me little to add as the Congress are again under the Tye of Secrecy in respect to their proceedings till the business is finish'd, or particular parts of it publish'd by Order. The principal design therefore of my writing to you at this time, & under these circumstances is, to recommend strongly, in case a Convention of the Virga. Delegates should be called (as the Treasurer has been advis'd to do) in my absence, that some other person may be chosen Pro: tem to serve in my Room; in order that the County may, at this important Crisis, be fully represented. The necessity of a full, and able Representation at such a juncture as this, must be too obvious to need a comment, or words to enforce the Recommendation. We have a very full Congress, and I flatter myself that great unanimity will prevail among the Members of it. The Colony of New York is said, not only to be hearty, but zealous in the cause. I wish, & I hope it may be so but, as I never entertaind a very high opinion of your sudden Repentances, I will suspend my opinion till the arrival of the Troops there. The Provencial Congress of the Massachusetts bay have voted 13,600 Men. The other Governments of New Engd. have followed their example in proportionate numbers, & the Troops at Boston are confind within the neck by about 9000 of them, Intrenchd, by which means all Communication between the Town & Country is cut off, and the Army and Inhabitants of Boston, it is said, somewhat distressd for Provisions. We have no late Acct. from thence; but it is supposed Genl. Gage will keep close till he receives his reinforcemt, to consist, our Accts. say of abt. 2000 Men to be expected the last of this Month. What he will then do, time only can tell. The Depositions taken after the Action at Lexington I inclose you, when opp[ortunit] y offers please to forwd a copy or two into the back Counties.

I hope and expect that the Time for Exportation will continue as it did though I have some Expectation that it will be moved to shorten it. As the Event of any Motion of that Sort ought & I suppose will be allowed to be made public you shall have early Notice. Ticonderoga has been surprized by a small party of New England men & is now in their possession without drawing one Drop of Blood.

You too justly hint at my inattention to this kind of Correspondence, but the life I lead here in some measure will Account for it. I prepare in the Morning for the Meeting at 9 O'Clock and often do not return to my lodgings 'till that time at Night. We sit in Congress generally to half past 3 O'Clock, and once 'till after 5 O'Clock & then dine at the City Tavern where a few of us have established A table for each day in the Week save Saturday when there is A general dinner. Our daily table is formed by the following persons at present, to wit Messrs. Randolph, Lee, Washington, and Harrison of Virginia, Alsop of New York, Chase of Maryland, and Rodney & Read. A MAY 18, 1775  dinner is ordered for the number 8 and whatever is deficient of that number is to be paid for at 2/6 A head and each that attends pays only the Expense of the day. I have dined there thrice in this Way as I find it very disagreeable to keep A table covered for me to these late Hours at my brother's. However I am so apt to put off the beginning to write to [the] last Moment that I miss my opportunity that I must break thro' the Practise or I shall not mend. At this Moment the Sun is rising tho I got into my bed the last Evening just as the Clock Struck 12 being told that the Stage sets off at 6 this morning. I send my Linnen &c and am to depend on Miss Bedford's engagement about what Katy Bradford is making up. I just saw them on Sunday Evening. I drank Coffee with Mrs. Vining yesterday having seen her at the Commencement of the College in this place where the Members of the Congress attended by special Invitation.

Arnold informing that with A detachment of Men from the Colony of Connecticut &c [he] had taken Possession of the Fort at Ticonderoga, an important pass on Lake Champlain which if kept, will prevent any Army from Canada. I have not heard the particulars.(1) It is reported that Dr. Cooper the President of the College at N. York & J. Riving ton have retired on board A Man of War there--that James Delancey, Peggy Allen's husband, is shouting thro the bye roads towards Colo. Johnston's in the Mohawk's Country--and that a Son of Oliver Delancey's, Captain of a Troop of Horse that is Coming over, had been on A Visit to his father but secretly retired and is travelling in disguise thro' the back parts of the Country towards Boston--that intelligence thereof is spread before him & [. . .] if he is not intercepted before he gets to his Journey's End.(2) Your friends that are here are all well.

301,dg001313,1775,Richard Henry Lee to Francis Lightfoot Lee,"""Richard Henry Lee to Francis Lightfoot Lee   Dear Brother Philadelphia 21st May 1775 An Express is just arrived here from Williamsburg informing of the Assembly being called to the 1st of June, Which carries our Speaker away. We suppose the design is chiefly to lay Ld. Norths conciliatory plan before the house. Tis most [sure?] that if this is done you should, after making [. . .] proper spirited observations on the folly, injury and insidiousness of the proposition; refer him to the united opinion of N. America in Congress. Many and powerful are the reasons that render it necessary you should fully approve in Gen. Assembly of the proceedings of last Continentl. Congress, of this present appointment and of your Delegates. Ministry and their Tools have constantly informed the Nation that the Provincial Conventions were factious meetings, that their proceedings were not the sense of the people, and that the Constitutional Assemblies (as they contrast the two) would not be of such opinion. To prevent a contradiction of this they have prevented the meeting of Assemblies, unless when they had some special wicked purpose to answer. The Assemblies that have been allowed to meet, all except New York, have reprobated this Ministerial lye, and have resolved as above mentioned. For heavens sake avoid compliments (except to the Soldiery) on the Indian expedition last summer. Nothing has given more concern and disgust to these northern Colonies than our unhappy vote of that sort in last Convention.(1) Yesterday one of the first Men on the Continent for wisdom sound judgment, good information, and integrity said to me \""1 was much grieved and concerned for the honor and good sense of Virginia, when I saw that ill founded ill judged Compliment.\"" Perhaps the scheme is to get another invasion Law and your approbation of another ruinously expensive excursion on the frontiers. A few [inter-loping?] Indians will never be wanting to commit irregularties for the encouragement of these Land exploring schemes. But the Land hunter ought to accomplish his purpose upon terms less destructive than £100,000 charge to the public annually. Never encourage by complimenting the last, a second tour among the Indians MAY 21, 1775  and Frontier men. The Continent looks with jealous eyes on the visits of Governors to such places at this crisis. \""We know the plan of ministry is to bring Canadians and Indians down upon us. For this reason the Provincial Troops of Connecticut & Massachusetts have wisely taken by a brave coup de Main, possession of the Forts at Ticonderoga & Crown Point. In the former they got 200 pieces of large Cannon, some field pieces, Swivels, Powder &c. The Congress have directed N. York, Connecticut & Massachusetts to remove these Stores &c. to the South end of Lake George and take strong post there to intercept the communication and march of Canadian & Indian forces into those Colonies. The taking of Ticonderoga last war cost CT. Britain many thousand lives and an immense expence, but now it has been taken from them, tho strong & well garrisoned, by the bravery and enterprise of a few Provincials and at a very small expence. There never was a more total revolution at any place than at New York. The Tory's have been obliged to fly, the Province is arming, and the Governor dares not call his prostituted Assembly to receive Ld. Norths foolish plan. Two Delances, Watts, Cooper, Riv ington, Colo. Philips & the rest of the Tory Leaders are fled some to England and some to private places in the Country where they are not known.(2) The Congress have advised the Yorkers to make provision for carrying their Women & Children into the Country, and to remove their warlike stores before the arrival of Troops there, whom they are not to suffer to encamp, or commit with impunity any hostilities against the people.(3) The latest and best accounts from Boston make the loss of Regulars in killed, wounded, & missing 1000 Men. The Provincial loss was trifling. 10,000 Men are now encamped before the Town between which and the Country there is no intercourse. G. Gage refuses to let the people out in consequence of which their distress presently must be grievous indeed. The Beseiging Army keep the one Beseiged in constant alarm, so that 'tis said, they rest neither Night nor day. Every day is expected to bring 2000 Men more from Ireland, and seven Regiments to N. York where the Torys had informed Ministers they would be well received, but now behold they come to a Country universally hostile, and in Arms to receive them. Connecticut has 12000 Men in Arms, the Jerseys a good many, and this Province at least 8000. There are 2000 in this City well armed and disciplined Men. In short every Colony this way is well prepared for War and appear to be secure against any Force likely to be sent against them. It would seem as if the Southern Colonies were alone vulnerable at present, and this should be remedied as soon as possible.\""(4) We are just informed that the Dutch have imported a large quantity of powder into Statia and that two English Men of War are laying off the Island to prevent its exportation to N. America--That a large quantity is also landed at Cape Francois  where no guard is yet placed. The Treasurer should be prevailed with to employ a Mr. Goodrich in Norfolk, a famous Contraband Man, to send immediately some swift sailing Pilot Boats for 20 or 30000 weight to supply the Counties whose money will no doubt be collect ed before the powder arrives. I hope Capt Brown is near full by this time and I suppose Mr. Lees charterd Ship, as well as Outram, is ar rived in York River. You will have time to load these Vessels as it is not now probable that the Congress will stop the Exports sooner than the 10th of September, except provision to the British fishery on the Banks of Newfoundland. \""It seems the Bill for restraining the Trade of the Colonies is not to have force until a certain time after its arrival in N. America. So that in this instance the whole power of the Legislature is given to Ministry, for it will depend on them when the Act shall arrive here since they may send it when, or never, as they please.\"" Mr. Brown should be immediately informed that there is no prospect of exportation being stopt, that he may act on full knowledge about buying or not Tobacco. \""We find by the late accounts that Ministry will be more puzzled than they imagine to accomplish their detestable purposes against us. Mr. (Lee) (5) writes the 26 March, that the embarquement from England has been delayed by the impossibility of getting Seamen for the Ships, but he adds, let not this delay your vigorous efforts for defence. From Ireland we learn, that the people there have interposed to prevent the embarquement, and that a contest has happened in which several lives were lost on both sides. The other clay G. Gage (hearing that all the provincial Troops, except 1500 were retired to sign an association prepared for them at some distance from the Encampment,) marched with his whole force out of Boston, but seeing the 1500 Provincials drawn up in order of Battle, and disliking their Countenance, he returned within his Lines. A Man of Wars Tender at Rhode Island lately Seized a Vessel loaded with provisions for the Army at Boston and the Country People in Boats attacked and took both the provision Vessel and the Tender, having wounded the Lieutenant of the M. of War and taken his Men prisoners whom they conveyed Captives into the Country. Thus you see our infant Struggles on the water are not unsuccessful.\"" You have all the news of this place. I am hurried, as I suppose you will be tired, with the length of this Letter. Let me know by every Post how you go on at Williamsburg & the objects of your deliberations. Remember me to all Friends and particularly to Mr. Treasurer. Farewell. Richard Henry Lee ""

307,dg001319,1775,John Dickinson s Notes for a Speech in Congress,"""John Dickinson's Notes for a Speech in Congress   [May 23-25? 1775] (1) We may act in any of these 3 Ways. 1st. We may prepare with the utmost Diligence for War, without pe- titioning, or sending Agents to England, to treat of an Accommodation. MAY 23, 1775  2d. We may prepare as mentioned and also petition, but without sending Agents &c. 3d. We may prepare, petition, and send Agents &c. The 1st Measure will hold up the Appearance of an undaunted Firmness ready & not afraid to meet the utmost Indignation of Great Britain. This may encourage our Friends--terrify our Enemies--per- suade the Nation that they will have a bloody & tedious Contest at tended with Injury to their Trade, if they persevere in violence-which contest may become more dreadful by France, Spain & other powers falling upon her. And these apprehensions may procure Relief of all our Grievances. But on the other Hand, if the Ministry stand their Ground & persevere, We have the War instantly brought upon Us with greater Fury before We are properly prepared--and in the mean Time it rages & many valuable Lives lost that perhaps may otherwise be saved & much other Destruction that might perhaps he prevented. Many Reasons to think the Ministry will stand: 1. Their having stood so long a Time against so many shocks [. . .] Men's Character [. . .] by Opposition. 2. Their artful Conduct in changing the old Custom of promising Support from Parliament into the new one of only executing Advice of Parliament. 3. Great Majority in both Houses. 4. Year 7 Yet to come of this Parliament. 5. The Resolution of the Ministry apparent from their treating the most respectable Bodies--the principle Cities of England, with London at their Head --The Merchants &c who have petitioned in our Favor. 6. If a Change it must be to bring in our Friends--but the Chief of them are personally odious to the King, Chatham, Cambden, &c. The Principal of our Friends are detested at Court. They are Whigs & old Whig Families. Revolution principled Men. The Tories & old Tory Families are the Court Servants. 7. The general opinion of Parliament is, that Great Britain is contesting for her very Existence in this Dispute with America. \""As a Member of Parliament I hold myself indispensibly called upon to take Up the Question upon this important, now this unparalled moment in English History, when we tamely suffered Government to be suspended, when we sit here the mere shadow of Authority, the Phantom of a Parliament, assembling only to lament the substance we have lost, & to propose & subtilise Questions of our own impotency. On the Support of these Sentiments (i.e. the Supreme Authority of Parliament) both here & on the other side of the Atlantic, the Existence of this Country & Constitution directly, emphatically, & conclusively depends.\"" Genl. Burgoynes Speech.(2) \""We are contending in the Crisis & for the Fate of the British Empire\"" id. \""This is a Crisis in which this Country has not been involv'd in a more intricate one since the Revolution. T he more Americans struggle to be independent, the more it is our Duty as Englishmen to  watch over them, & not let the evil Day be anticipated by any Re- missness or Want of firmness on our Part--for that would not only be highly criminal towards our King & Country, but also leave an everlasting Stain on the present Age, if We meanly shake off the Task of preventing it from Ourselves & leave it for Posterity to struggle with as they can.\"" Captain Harvey's Speech. \""I should not rise to trouble You this Day, could I reconcile to my own breast the giving a silent Vote on a Question upon which depends not only the Existence of this Country but the Happiness of Millions. If conciliatory Measures shall fail, this Country has no Al- ternative left, but to make use of that power they enjoy, under Heaven, for the protection of the whole Empire; & to shew the Americans that as our Ancestors deluged this Country with their Blood, to gain this Constitution for Us, We like Men, in Defence of faction at Home & Rebellion abroad, are determined, in glorious Emulation of their Example to transmit it perfect & unimpair'd to Posterity or perish in the Attempt.\"" Sir Wm. Mayne's Speech. \""Whether the Americans will accede to this (meaning his Motion 20th of February) I know not. If they reject it, their Blood must be on their own Heads.\"" Ld. North's Speech. \""The Question lies within a very narrow Compass. It is simply whether We shall abandon our Claims and at once give Up every Advantage arising both from the Sovereignty & the Commerce; or whether to ensure both We shall resort to the Measures indispensably necessary on such an occasion.\"" id. \""Life itself is not worth keeping in a State of Uncertainty & Fear. Things are now brought to a Crisis. The Conflict must be borne, & I hope will never end, but in relinquishing our Connection with America, or fixing them on a sure & lasting Basis.\"" Sir Wm. Meredith's Speech. Yet he is against the Taxation of America. \""If the Colonies reject just Conditions, they must be reduced to unconditional Obedience.\"" id. [i.e. Ld North's Speech]. Even Governor Pownall so long advocating our Cause now ap proves of the Ministerial Violence. A great Number of other Speakers. It is evident that these Persons spoke not only their own Sentiment's but those of the whole House. A proof of this & [. . .] of a most memorable Nature. A 9th Reason.(3) When Lord North made his Motion on 20 February, the whole Body of Court Troops in the House were likely to desert him--only because his proposal had something like the Appearance of a conciliatory Measure, till Sir George Elliot rose & \""desired them not to divide among themselves\""--& afforded Mr. Dunning an opportunity of exercising his severest Wit upon him.(4) 10. The Measures of Administration are popular at Home. A  great Number of indisputable Evidences to this proposition now in Town from Friends to America. Almost the whole landed Interest is against Us--the whole Hosts of persons in Office, with their immense Connections composing the vast Mass of People breathed upon & tainted by Ministerial Influence--almost the whole trading & manufac- turing parts of the Nation not intimately connected with America--& very many of those who are thus connected. I can procure clear Evidence of these Facts. Who then are on our side? The Dissenters --parts of the Traders & Manufacturers immediately concerned in our Commerce--and the small Band of independent virtuous Spirits in the Kingdom. Besides the very Motion which appears so contemptible to us &c was not calculated merely for the Mind of America. It had 2 Objects. To divide [....](5) The other was To render the Measures of Ad ministration still more popular in that Kingdom by holding up to the People there the Appearance of Humanity, Condescension, Forbear- ance & I know not what gentle, generous Virtues--in descending from the dignified Preeminence of the Supreme Imperial State--& offering us a Plan of Reconciliation--& a Plan formed on the most equitable Principles of bringing the rich & luxurious Colonists to bear an equal share with the People of Great Britain of the heavy & oppressive Burthens under which the latter labour & ease them at least of one half of their Loads, or as the Motion artfully expresses it-\""contributing their proportion to the Common Defense.\"" A motion so reasonable says Mr. Jenkinson \""that if the Americans reject it, it leaves them without Excuse in the Eyes of all Mankind.\""(6) And in Case this mild system of Negotiation, Reconciliation & Benignity is rejected by the Colonies, to kindle the People of Great Britain into tenfold Rage against Us. This system is level to the understanding of every Porter & Chairman, and who knows here, but this may be the Effect of this Maneuvre? Who knows, but this may be the Effect of their receiving Intelligence of the unhappy Hostages in Massachussets Bay--it may terrify but it may also irritate. General Gage has procured Depositions to prove our brave Brethren fired first. This Circumstance, contemptible as it is, &c, may cause them to be regarded as Aggressors. They may be provoked at such a Dishonor to their Arms returned from despised America & may be the more animated to restore their Lustre by revenging the Disgrace. No person here knows with Certainty how these several Events may operate on the Minds of a high spirited People--drunk with Success. The Reliance of Administration on N.Y. has led them into a great Error. In Policy they should have sent a greater Force. They may correct their Error. The most stupid Pilots will shun the Shoals upon which they have once been aground. They will know they have nothing now but their own  strength to trust to. Will so great an Empire give up such a Cause in gloriously? The whole Band of Ministers will know that nothing but the utmost vigor & Dispatch can save them. They will remember that the last glorious War began with British Defeat--& this of Colonel Smith will be called a Trifle in Comparison with that Misfortune.(7) We have been once already deceived in our Calculations of the Effects to be produced by Our Firmness. The Impression made at Home by the Magnanimity of the late Congress was not so great as there was Reason to apprehend. The only Rescript We have received to our humble Petition to our Sovereign was written in Blood. Yet notwithstanding all these Reasons, I am inclined to think that the Unanimity & Firmness of these Colonies will within a 12 month dethrone the Ministry. Yet I fear there is more of Hope than Reason in that Expectation. One Thing I am sure of--that no Man here is sure--that our Firmness & Unanimity let it be ever so extraordinary, will procure Us immediate Relief of our Grievances by a change of Ministry or of ministerial Measures. It is impolitic then in the utmost Degree to depend on the realizing an Event, which is indisputably uncertain. Our Firmness & Unanimity may conduct Us into the Miseries of War or the Blessings of Peace. We have no Prophet among us who can predict which part of the alternative will take Place. In this Situation our Affairs will stand if We only prepare vigorously for War. There is another Mode We may pursue. 2dly. We may prepare as has been mentioned and also petition. There is great Reason to believe that a Petition may be so framed as to be more likely to open a Way to our Relief than the former. That dwelt on our Rights--several of which are denied at Home. Those Rights have therein been fully & recently set forth & claimed. A Repetition is needless. A Petition now may proceed on the single unexceptionable Ground of praying Relief from our Fears & Jealousies occasioned by the System of Colonial Administration adopted since the Conclusion of the late War. To this prayer may be added Expression of Loyalty to the King--Attachment to his person, Family & Government-Love lo our Parent State--our Readiness & Willingness at all Times with our Lives & Fortunes to support, maintain & defend the Interests of his Majesty & our Mother Country by every Effort that can be reasonably expected from the most faithful Subjects & the most affectionate Colonists that for this purpose We shall always be dis posed cheerfully to contribute to the Common Defence as the public Exigencies may require and our Circumstances will permit, & earnestly beseech that by doing Justice to the Sincerity of these professions in believing them to be as they are most strictly true; we may be restored by the abolishing our apprehensions to the happy & fer-  vently wished for Opportunity of expressing in the most acceptable Manner our unfeigned Devotion to his Majesty & the State from which We derive our Origin. I have very particular Reasons to believe it will produce good Ef- fects. But still it will be uncertain how far such a Petition may be sat- isfactory. If it produces no favourable Effect; the same Events must happen as if We had only prepared for War. And while Great Britain is silent from Notions of Dignity & America from Notions of Firmness each rushes on blind with their respective Passions to the Destruction of the other. Is there a Necessity for this Mode of Conduct that may lead Us into an useless Effusion of Blood? Or can any thing less than absolute Necessity justify such a Conduct in the Sight of the Creator not only of Us but of our Enemies? While We are expecting Concessions from them, & they are ex- pecting Concessions from Us--our Trade stagnates--our Merchants & Citizens, our helpless Women & Children & aged are reduced to Distress--some to poverty--& every Species of Wretchedness--our best & dearest Blood is sluicing from our Veins--& all the Variegated Miseries & Horrors of War are advancing & surrounding Us--& offers to us not even the Choice of Calamities--shocking as such a Choice might be--but close compacted Complication of them--circularly complete & utterly inevitable. 3dly. We may prepare, petition, & send Agents to treat of an Accom- modation. In order to determine whether this is not the proper Time to treat, I would beg Leave to call the Attention of Gentlemen to 3 Points relating immediately to ourselves--& to 3 other Points relating to Great Britain. As to the 3 for America. 1st. We are now successful in the first Engagement. 2. We are united from one End of the Continent to the other. We are vigorously preparing for Resistance--If not fully prepared already. 3. Common Sense & soundness declare, that We ought therefore to treat if no other Reason offered. Certain it is that Delay is as much our Ally as Winter was the Ally of the King of Prussia in the late War. It is almost universally so in defensive Wars. This is a defensive War on our Part. Three Points immediately relating to Great Britain to be regarded. 1. Changes or Accidents in the Court or Kingdom. 2. Alterations in the Affairs of Europe. 3. Our Commercial Opposition should be allowed Time to be felt. Blisters applied to extract Humours from gross diseased Bodies sometimes prevent the Necessity of bleeding. But after applying Blis- ters, a prudent Physician will certainly strive to avoid bleeding if there is any Danger in the Operation untill the Blisters have been allowed Time to draw--& during that Interval he will endeavour to keep the Patient in as calm a Temper as may be possible.  There are some other Considerations that deserve the Attention of Gentlemen. We have not yet tasted deeply of that bitter Cup called the Fortunes of War. A bloody Battle lost--The peculiar Distress of the brave Defenders of American Liberties in the Massachusetts Bay --The Multitude thrown out of Employ by the Loss of their Fisheries & the stoppage of their other Trade--Disease breaking out among their Troops unaccustomed to the Confinement of an Encampment --Divisions in any one province which might interrupt provisions or Relief going to their Aid by Land--the Enemies superiority forbidding it by Sea--The Difficulties from Distance if no other Objections --The Danger of Insurrection by Negroes in Southern Colonies--Incursions of Canadians & Indians upon the Northern Colonies--Incidental Proposals to disunite Us--false Hopes--selfish Designs--Giving up the Point of Taxation or some other partial Concession that might be greedily catched at by a peaceable People jaded out with the tedium of Civil Discords--may all operate hereafter to our Disadvantage. Great Britain lately had the golden Opportunity in her own Hands. Had any mighty spirit presided over her Colonies, he would have sent over 20,000 Men & a formidable naval Armament to Boston. The bravest Man in this Assembly would have then felt his seat not quite so easy as it is now. Then thus armed He should have pre pared Terms fit for Freemen to offer & for Freemen to receive. She missed the lucky Moments--Thanks be to the Traytors, so far meritorious even in their Guilt, who persuaded her We were a divided People & she is sending over 3 Generals & 3 thousand Men to conquer this Continent. She has lost a Battle--& all America is more united & more determined beyond all Comparison than We were during the Course of the last Winter. Now the Turn is in our Favor. Let us improve it. I suppose no Gentleman will deny, that one of these Events will take place, if the War continues. Either it will be on our Part successful, or unsuccessful. If unsuccessful We may pretty well guess the Consequences I leave them to every Gentleman's Guess. But suppose We have every Success our warmest Wishes & Resentments could prompt us to desire--over whom shall We triumph? Our Fath- ers--From whom We derive our Lives--& every Blessing of our Lives. We know the Value of their protection against the Powers of Europe. Our Fathers are high spirited. An ill directed Courage may so far exhaust her strength already tottering under an enormous Bur then of Debt, as to render her an unequal Match for her old Enemies. I must confess my greatest Fear for America in this Contest is least she should receive the deepest Wounds thro the sides of Great Britain For whatever may be the Events of this Contest, We must at last return to the Place from which We set off. The Ship of Our  State, whatever weather she meets with must at last return to the Port from which she sailed, & I trust in Heaven it may be with all the Pre- cious Cargo, however shattered her Condition. My Principles were formed very early in the Course of this unhappy Controversy. I have not yet found Cause to change a single Iota of my political Creed. I have never had & now have not any Idea of Happiness for these Colonies for several ages to come, but in a State of Dependence upon & subordination to our Parent State. Every other aspect presents to me an Ocean perpetually tempestuous without Bottom & without Shore. If there are in it any Islands, or Spots of Terra firma, they are too distant & too small to be discovered by my weak Sight. I cannot perceive a speck where a Dove might pick up any green [. . . .] I believe these Words are not so pleasing to the Ears of some worthy Members as they are to mine. I'm sorry for it. For I know the Men who differ from Me on this Point to be Gentlemen of such clear Integrity, such perfect Affection to the Liberty of America, & of such enlightened Understandings, that while the Dictates of my Conscience command Me boldly to speak on the naked Sentiments of my Soul in a Time of such Exigence on a Point of such Moment to my Country, I greatly fear least the slightness of my knowledge may have betrayed Me into an Error--& I feel an Awe upon my Mind justly proportioned to my Reverence for the Qualities & abilities of those who dissent from Me & the Magnitude of the Question in which they so dissent. By Dependence & Subordination I mean, that the King as King of England has a power in making Laws--a power in executing them --a power of finally determining on appeals--a power of calling for supplies in Time of War or any Emergency--the Powers of Prerogative--& the Power of Parliament to regulate our Intercourse with Foreigners exclusive of every Idea of Taxation. These are Powers our Parent State has been always in the possession & Exercise of-and 1 cannot forget thinking from what I have lately seen & heard, that if the late Congress had acknowledged this last Power to be rightfully vested in her, the two Nations would not at this Instant regard each other with such hostile Eyes. That Honor of Human Nature Lord Chatham declares, if he was American, he would acknowledge it. Sir, I came into the late Congress &c. It is both just & politic to acknowledge it. It is just--because it arises from the very Nature of the Constitution. These Colonies were settled under the protection of their Parent State. They ever looked up for it--& received it- sometimes in [Actuality?], always in Effect. The Terms imposed by her Power on other Kingdoms & States has silently & [continually?] protected them. Besides who can reconcile it to Reason or [Equity?] that Colonists emigrating from a State, undeniably with her permis-  sion, should be at full Liberty to carry on their Settlements & their Commerce in such a Manner as to wound & perhaps destroy the Mother Country. If their Intercourse with foreign Nations is thus un- limited & unrestrained, that must be the inevitable Consequence, for such is human Nature that Men will seek immediate profit without attending sufficiently to remoter Consequences. We should therefore deal unboundedly with foreign Nations--& such in the Circle of Eu- ropean Powers at this Time--that their prosperity depends on the Extent of an advantageous Commerce. The advantages Great Britain has reaped from our Commerce, other Nations would have reaped. The advantages she will receive from our Commerce being restrained to her, other Nations will receive if it is not restrained. I tremble at the Consequences. I detest & abhorr them. I would dye cheerfully to prevent them. This is the Ground America has always stood upon. Our Mother Country has not only exercised this Power without Objection from our very Infancy--but it has been expressly recognized by every Colony, the Constitution, & by the Congress of 1765. But I not only think these Colonies dependent & subordinate, but I wish they may continue so, and that Wish implies another--that our Mother Country may continue a fit Head for such Members--that her Wealth, Power, & Fame may be equal to the vast Charge & high Dignity. And the wish comes from my Heart. And if Gentlemen will seriously consider the Matter--Whether they use the Terms Depend- ent, Subordinate, or Coordinate I believe they will all agree in this Point--that the martial Power of Great Britain has been & may be a mighty Blessing to these Colonies in securing their Commerce & pro- tecting them from the proud rapacious & ambitious Nations of the World & from civil Convulsions among ourselves--and such Power depends on the Right of Regulation. It would be the Height of Im prudence to push a Quarrel with Great Britain to Extremity--untill these Colonies are grown so strong & united, that in Case she should be ruined, We should have nothing to fear from any other Power. That Time is not yet arrived. This is the Substance, the rest is but Name. We are engaged then in a War of so unnatural & astonishing peculiarity, that the very Object aimed at, as all other Wars, Success, may to Us become a Mis fortune. Our Victories may be worse than Defeats--& like the Macedonian Monarch, We may conquer--but to--Weep. Sir, I may be singular in these Sentiments at this Time, but be as- sured, they will be the Sentiments of many an honest American here after. They will soon begin to think themselves in the same Case with the two Generals of the great Gustavus Adolphus. They asked Leave of the King to fight a Duel to vindicate their honor--tho he had publickly forbidden such Duels on Pain of death. However he granted their Request. A Day was appointed & the Combatants ap-  peared in View of the whole Army to decide their Quarrel. The King said to them--\""Gentlemen, fight bravely & vindicate your Honor--& do You (says he turning to the Executioner, who attended with all his Apparatus) as soon as one falls, immediately behead the other.\"" They embraced & became Friends. This will be thought the Nature of our Feuds. In order to strengthen & conform the Minds of our Countrymen for this Contest, Let Us try every Method of avoiding Extremities, that when the Wheels of War shall begin to grind a little harder upon Us, People may not upbraid Us with having omitted proper applications for obtaining Peace--for Man is a variable Animal--and if once that Notion is produced & fed by the Disasters & Differences of a continued War, it will grow with irresistable Force, & in a tumultuary Passion or rather Phrenzy for Peace, the whole advantage gained by Years of Blood may be cast away in one Day of Haste & Weakness--as memorably appear'd in the Instance of the Restoration. Sir, I am well informed what will be one of the greatest Difficulties in obtaining Accommodation. It will be the Act for changing the Government of Massachusetts Bay. We must come to treat some Time or other. Will this whole Continent be more disposed to insist on that Article after being tired of a dreadful War--or now. For my part my Sentiments & Resolutions are decisive--to endure all the Extremities of even an unsuccessful War rather than sacrifice the Constitution of that generous, glorious Colony. But will this be the Opinion of Men in general under Such Circumstances. Let this Point be deliberately considered. When Peace after a bloody & afflicting War comes to be weighed against that Constitution--there will be Reason to dread the general Opinion of America. Let Us imitate Administration in this single Article. Let Us propose Terms of Accommodation, which, if they answer no other purpose, may convince the World & particularly America that We have done every Thing in our Power to avoid the War. This was the Policy of that experienced Statesman Lewis 14th--in the Terms he offered at Gertruydenburgh. And well he was repaid for them. For the Rejection of them excited such a Spirit among his Subjects as enabled him to hold out to the End of the War against Armies flushed with a Campaign of uninterrupted Victories, with a Marlborough & an Eugene at their Head--& at last to conclude an advantageous Peace. But it may be said, that treating now will shew Fear, & may thereby encourage Administration to rise in their Demands upon Us. If We cannot treat without shewing Fear, let Us avoid it as We would Infamy. But I beg Leave to deny the Consequence. I say We may treat in such a Manner as to shew our Courage--& that We are influenced not by Timidity or Despondence, but by such Sentiments as ought to animate Men, Freemen, Christians. I go further--I say, We  may treat in such a Manner as to shew our Magnanimity and yet most exactly to regulate our Demands with the Precision of a Burleigh, according to the Dictates of Reason & Policy, by the Exigencies of Affairs, whatever they may be, and to calculate the Concessions We will make, in every Event favorable or unfavorable, that can possibly occurr. My Position is This--a treaty may do Us Good. It can do Us no Harm. Without it, We have only 2 Things to look for: A Change of Men & Measures produced by the Unanimity & Firmness of these Colonies--or 2. A severe Civil War. We are not sure which will be our Lott. A Treaty opens a new Prospect of Relief. This is a Civil War. No Mediator to interpose good Offices. Our Silence & Stiffness may only enrage & encrease our Enemies. If a Treaty does not immediately produce all the good Effects We desire, by obtaining immediate Redress of our Grievances, [it] may yet produce some very valuable Effects. It may prevent Effusion of Blood. It may prevent more Reinforcements from being sent over. It will allow Time for our Commercial Opposition to operate. It may enable Us to be better prepared. It may enable Us to form Confederations with the Minority & our Friends in England. A Point of first Importance. Bad Effects it cannot Produce. If We send Agents to treat--they certainly will find on their Arrival, Administration & Parliament enraged & resolved to prosecute the War--or fluctuating--or rather inclining to Accommodation. Suppose the 1st. It becomes this Assembly to consider well what they wish done & what they would be willing to do in that Case. Whether there is any Concessions whatever which in such Case We should be willing to make in Order to procure--& what those Con cessions are. I will only say at present--I am clear to acknowledge the Right of Regulation--if absolutely necessary for obtaining Peace. Whatever they are--let your instructions to your Agents in the most minute & exact Detail, what You would have done. Otherwise the Storm comes upon Us, merely because We offer them no other Mode of Conference than in the Din of Battles. Suppose the 2d. Our Instructions may be so framed for that Event, as to strike I error into the boldest Administration--& convince them, it is not Timidity induces Us to treat. I will not now descend to particulars--tho the Mode is clearly conceived in my Mind--but your Instructions may be formed with such an honest Art as to be accommodated to every Event that can turn up. Besides in Case of such a Disposition as is last mentioned, our Agents may be instructed, & by being on the Spot may take Advan- tage of the Opportunity which once seen it may never return again --to obtain some further Terms not insisted on in our late Petition. The Anxiety, Trouble, & Expense of Treasure & Blood to which this  Continent has been put since that Petition was sent Home, gives Us a Right to ask for more than We then asked. We ought to secure to our Countrymen by profiting of their noble spirit now roused among them --by gaining a fixed Establishment of some other Points. I will mention only two--The Independence of our Judges by their holding their Commissions during Good Behaviour and a permanent & unalterable Settlement of the most important parts of our Commerce--to be confirmed by Statutes & Acts of our Assemblies. Acknowledging Right of Regulation will lead to this Establishment. I mean not to de part absolutely from the Ground taken by the late Congress but to quit it gradually by Treaty. I move, that it be resolved--(8) ""

That Directions be given for putting these Colonies immediately into the best State of Defence--that on a short Day We will enter into Consideration of the Ways & Means of raising Money and embodying Troops, particularly for affording the speediest Assistance to the Colonies of Massachusetts Bay [and?] New York And in the mean Time, that all the [Colonies] be requested immediately to send out several vessels to France, Holland, the West Indies and other proper Places, to procure Arms and Ammunition. 2. But as the only Objects We propose to ourselves by the Measures before mentioned, are the Defence & Preservation of ourselves from the utter Destruction of our Lives and Liberties, meditated against Us & in part already executed by the British Ministry, and as We most ardently wish for a Restoration of the Harmony formerly subsisting between our Mother Country & these Colonies, the Interruption of which must at all Events be exceedingly injurious & may MAY 23, 1775  in the Conclusion be destructive to both Countries, that for the purpose of contributing by all the Means in our Power to the Promotion and Completion of this most desirable Accommodation We will present an humble & dutiful Petition to his Majesty, praying Relief from our Fears and Jealousies occasioned by the System of Colonial Administration adopted since the Conclusion of the late War- expressing our Loyalty to the King--our Attachment to his person, Family and Government--our Love to our Parent State-our Desire to preserve our usual Connection with her--our Readiness & Willingness at all Times with our Lives & Fortunes to support maintain & defend the Interests & Rights of his Majesty and of that State by every Effort that can be reasonably expected from the most faithful Subjects & the most affectionate Colonists--that for effecting these purposes we shall ever be cheerfully dispos'd to contribute to the Common Defence by Aids of Money, and also of Men, as the public Exegencies and our Circumstances will permit. Earnestly beseeching his Majesty, that Justice may be done to [the] Sincerity of these professions by believing them to be as We solemnly declare them to be, strictly true, that so the Relief for which We supplicate being afforded us by the Wisdom & Goodness of his Majesty & Parliament We may be restored to the happy and ardently wished for Opportunity of demonstrating, as we are resolved with one Mind to do, in the [most] acceptable Manner, our Gratitude for the attention given to our prayers, and our [. . .] Majesty & that beloved Country from [. . .] rejoice & glory that we derive our Origin. 3. That we will send Home part of our Body in behalf of them selves & the other Petitioners to present the said Petition & to treat of an Accommodation. That for this purpose, we will give Instructions to our said Agents, suited as nearly as may be to every possible State of Affairs that may exist on their Arrival in England, or may after wards happen there, containing full & most exact Directions how they are to conduct themselves in every Part of their Behaviour, and what Concessions and what Demands they are to make in every Event favorable or unfavorable that shall occurr, reserving to ourselves an Exemption from all Obligation upon Ourselves or our Constituents by any Act of our said Agents untill the same shall be ratified by this Body. 4. That after We have resolv'd and agreed upon the said Demands & Concessions, and have thereby fully settled the Conditions of Accommodation, the obtaining of which we are determined to persevere in our Opposition to the Measures of the British Ministry, at all Hazards, we will associate and confederate with one another in our own Names & in the Name & on the behalf of our respective Constituents, in the most solemn Manner, by the Ties of Honour, Virtue, & the Wellfare of our Country, to continue our said opposition in the Man  ner that shall be directed by this Congress and by any succeeding Congress to be appointed by the Inhabitants of the Colonies repre- sented in this Congress, by our most Strenuous efforts & utmost vig our, untill we obtain such Redress of the Grievances of these Colonies, which this Congress shall determine as aforesaid to insist on. That we will furnish in due Time our respective Quotas of Men & Money, for the Service and during the Time, to be agreed on, and that We or our respective Colonies shall not & will not accommodate or treat of an Accommodation but jointly with all the Colonies represented in this Congress. 5. That We will write a Letter to General Gage, informing him that we are making the most vigorous preparations for Resistance against the British Forces & the Defence and Preservation of our Lives & Liberties, that the Colonies represented in this Congress have entered into a solemn association & Confederacy, to carry on their Opposition to the Measures of the British Ministry, at all Hazards, and never to treat of an Accommodation unless it be jointly. That we have a strong Hope founded on an humble Confidence in the protecting Goodness of Divine Providence, and the Means which he has graciously been pleased to put into our Hands, of a successful Issue to our just Exertions, should We be reduced to the Necessity of employing them, yet at the same Time We most earnesly desire, that a Period may be put to this unhappy Dispute. That for this purpose, We intend to present an humble & dutiful Petition to his Majesty, & to send over some Members of this Congress with proposals of Accommodation which, we hope, will bring this Contest to an End, & restore the former Harmony between the Mother Country & these Colonies. That We judge it proper to give him this Information, that if he can think it consistent with the Orders he has receiv'd from Ad ministration, to forbear further Hostilities against the Inhabitants of these Colonies or any of them, and to remove the Apprehensions of such hostilities, untill an answer can be receiv'd to our Answer & proposals, the farther Effusion of British Blood by British Hands may be stopt--& mutual Resentments be no more heighten'd by mutual sufferings. That he will favour Us with an Answer to this Letter as 50011 as possible--and if he does not chuse to return an answer, that we will consider this Silence [as a] Refusal to forbear Hostilities as is above mentioned. 6. That we will approve of the Resistance that has been made & is now making in the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay against the British Forces, and that We with our Lives & Fortunes support them therein. 7. That the Delegates of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay be requested to procure & give to this Congress Information of the Names and Places of Abode while living of the Officers & Men who  fell fighting for their Country in the late Engagement in that Colony, in order, that their Memory may be perpetuated, as far as it is in the power of this Congress to preserve it; that their Families may receive our Thanks for the patriotic Spirit of their deceas'd Relatives, our brave Country men, our Condolence for their private Afflictions, and such Compensations for their particular Losses, as their respective Circumstances may require, and the Situation of public Affairs may enable us to make.

It is most respectful, may soften the Minds of our Enemies. I know it to be salutary. My Name mentioned. I detest ambition in such a Cause. Too unhappy. But if this not approved, The other may be adopted. We have many Friends. Natives hearty in our Cause & as able as any We can send. As to extent & Cautions, Not interested that they [....] If We can agree to any Concessions that we will absolutely offer. There they may be at Liberty to propose as what we will certainly confirm, and some such there may be. But my Idea is that our Instructions should be suited to all possible Contingencies favorable or unfavorable that may occurr & our proposals to be accommodated to them--with a Liberty of actually conceding what We shall agree to concede at first if thought necessary by Us. One of those Points may be the Right of Regulation--but that has not been taken up with the Restrictions I meant--which are the Exclusion of every Idea of Taxation, internal or external, as in the 4th Resolve of late Congress--which in fact will be granting the same MAY 23, 1775  Power & no more but in the most acceptable & pacifying Manner. Another Restriction I mentioned is--at the same Time settling the great Outlines or most important Parts of our Commerce on an unalterable Establishment--to mention only one Part for Example, our free & [....] [Transportation?] of every kind & [...] other articles with the southern parts of Europe & [. . .] shores. I have Evidence that the Offer of some such Compact has been expected by Administration. As to a standing Army--if that Point of Prerogative cannot be settled--at least for the sake of Peace--& under the Idea of satisfying Minds at present, the Troops may be removd--& I believe We shall not have the same Cause of Complaint soon again. As to Quebec Bill--if We cannot obtain a total Repeal, We may a Contraction of Boundaries. Letter to that purpose. Courts of Admiralty--Established before 1763, perhaps something may be done as to a better Regulation of them by vesting the Powers or a Controul of them by appeal in the Councils of the several Provinces--which [is] preferable to an appeal to England. As to Independence of Judges, Means may be agreed upon for settling that Point in a satisfactory Manner. I cant recollect all the Instructions, but these are sufficient to shew the Importance & Necessity of treating. And these Points never can be settled but in a Treaty--unless We state every particular we de- mand--& then confederate never to end the War unless they are every one granted to Us--a Plan full of insurmountable Difficulties. But suppose We do not gain Relief from our Grievances. That is not the only Point aimed. I would treat if I was sure of being treated with Contempt--for that very purpose. The most desperate prosecution of the War & the most pacific Negotiations at the same Time. Heroes in the Field, Philosophers & Christians in the Cabinet. Stamp the Character of our Country for every brave Quality & every good one. That We may take Rank among the Nations of the Earth for undaunted assertion of our Liberty & the most passionate Lovers of Peace.(3) If We dont obtain a Redress of Grievances, We may gain these Advantages. So much at present on this Head. 2. Objection. If We grant the Right--They may distrust Us or Answer a Counter for a shilling. I always have declared, that I mean that a Concession of the Right should be attended with a settlement of the Capital Branches of our Commerce on a permanent Foundation so that tho We leave them the Right, it never can deeply affect Us. 3[r]dly. A Member from Boston acknowledges it just & equitable that Great Britain should have this Right--but he says they may plague Us with Acts like the Boston Port Bill. Answer, That is not a  Regulation of foreign Trade. Briefly--Time will settle this Matter fully in our Favor. Let us only keep quiet for 40 or 50 Years. 4 [thl] y.

The acknowledgment now the Ought of Parliament & essential to shew to our Friends. Confirmation of Acts of Navigation --by Acts of Assembly. If denied it opens a bad omen to our Union & Success. I have the like Complaint to make on the Arguments I offered concerning a Treaty. Gentlemen have confined themselves singly to this Question, Whether it would procure Us Redress of our Grievances. That is not the Ground on which I offered it to Consideration. I say--1st. It may open a Channel to Accommodation. 2[nd]ly. If it does not procure an Accommodation & a Redress of Grievances, Yet it will be attended with such other Advantages that it would be an inexcusable Want of Policy to omit it--(1) Encreasing our Friends in England (2) confirming our People here. 3[rd]1y. It may prevent Reinforcements coming over. 4 [th] ly. It may prevent Effusion of Blood. 5. It will enable Us to be better prepared. 6. It will allow Time for our Commercial opposition to work its Effects. 7. It will give us an opportunity to consult with Ld. Chatham & our Friends in general in England to form Agreements with them [. . .] act in Concert with [them?], stipulating strenuously to support them, pave the way to some bold Steps on the other side of the Atlantic that may be decisive. A Point of vast Magnitude. As to Letter to General Gage, it will be attended with the happiest Effects, let him answer it as he will. If he agrees to stop Hostilities till an Answer comes, nothing can be done this summer & all the Time We are preparing & exercising, &c. If he refuses--the Question of defense & offense is at End. Every American & every Englishman  Portrait of John Dickinson  after such a Request & Refusal will think Us justifiable in taking every advantage. It will evidence a humane & considerate Disposition. Throw into this Letter all the bold Expressions of our unalterable Resolutions--& Trust of Success--rather than into our Petition &c. It will be more respectful. As to Confederation, We must see our Way clear in Reason & Conscience to an Iota, before We proceed to Extremities. I shall not stir a Step till every Thing is thus adjusted. That being done, I will stand or fall by that solemn Compact.(4) ""

311,dg001323,1775,James Duane s Notes for a Speech in Congress,"""James Duane's Notes for a Speech in Congress   [May 23-25? 1775] (1) On the State of the Colonies I. The importance of the subject--it concerns our liberties, our lives our property. II. The eyes of Europe and America are fixed on this Assembly, and the fate of one of the greatest empires on earth, in no small degree, depends on the issue of their deliberations. III. We are contending with the State from whence we sprung, with those who were once our fathers, our guardians, our brethren, with those fleets and armies which were lately our protection, and contributed to rescue us from Gallic tyranny and oppression. IV. Cemented by the ties of blood, religion and interest, victory itself however decided must be fatal: and whichever side prevails must weep over its conquests. On our side we tremble for the dearest and most inestimable of all earthly blessings, our liberty and for those rights and that most excellent constitution and free government, which (resources) (2) were procured by the blood and handed down to us by the wisdom and the bravery of our renowned ancestors. V. Doubly exposed to the cruel projects of an unrelenting and despotic Ministry, and if they are defeated to the danger of foreign invasions from bigots and tyrants, no condition can be more alarming. VI. How necessary then while we summon up all our fortitude and rise superior to fear and every selfish regard while we are ready to lay down our fortunes and even our lives in the defence of the best of causes, that at the same time we restrain every emotion of intemperate zeal--every sally of anger and passion; and coolly and deliberately examine and consider the state of the Colonies uniting with one heart and one voice our best and wisest counsels for the preservation of our country. MAY 23, 1775  VII. However diffident of my own abilities, and conscious that I can contribute but very little in this great and arduous enquiry, silence on this momentous occasion would ill requite the confidence reposed in me by my constituents. VIII. I am the more encouraged to offer my sentiments, because I have the happiness to find, that they are confirmed by some of the most respectable authorities which distinguish the bright catalogue of American Patriots and in whose steps I may tread with some degree of confidence. IX. I shall not spend the time in reviewing that wicked system of ministerial oppression which has reduced America to its present de- plorable situation. It has been done with precision and elegance by the Worthy member from Virginia.(3) X. Nor need I enter upon the question whether all the united Colonies are to be considered as in a state of War, or Peace? Xl. It is a sufficient ground for my conduct, that the sword of ministerial vengeance has been drawn against our Brethren in the Massachusetts Bay and their innocent blood been shed. That they suffer in our common cause; and that we are bound by the most solemn engagements by every tie of duty interest and policy to succur and support them and to hazard our all in the tremenduous conflict. Xll. One common danger therefore awaits us and we must share one common fortune. May that gracious being upon whom we depend inspire our councils with wisdom and bless our efforts with success! and speedily restore US to that Peace and harmony with Great Britain on principles of liberty and mutual advantage--which is the ultimate wish of every virtuous patriot. XIII. The subject of our debate divides itself into two general heads. 1st. A vigorous preparation for our common defence--for Sir, I wish we may never part with the idea that every hostile measure on our part is undertaken for and shall be conducted to our own self preservation: and that however injured and provoked the desire of conquest, of independence and much less of revenge may be banished from every American breast. Let this be ever considered as a family quarrel, unnatural, disgraceful and ruinous into which we are innocently plunged by intolerable oppression, and which we are sincerely disposed to appease and reconcile, whenever the good providence of God shall put it in our power, consistent with the preservation of our just rights. This loyal and benevolent sentiment which to the honor of injured Americans under all her grievances so universally prevails will open the next head of debate vizt. 2dly. Whether any means of reconciliation are left in our power which we can propose with a prospect of success, and a just regard to  Portrait of James Duane  our invaded Rights. As to the 1st point--a vigorous preparation for our common defence. I have no military skill and considering the critical state of the Colony which gave me birth, I have reason to lament it. Our capital may be surrounded with ships of war, which we are wholly incapable of resisting--Hudson's River affords an easy com- munication for vessels of force upwards of 100 miles into the heart of our best settlements. Our western frontier covered with scattered villages interspersed to the distance of 100 miles from Albany are exposed to the ravages of the Western nations of Indians while our northern and Eastern frontiers are at the mercy of the Canadians and the savages long in their alliance. The fertility of the Colony, its advantageous situation to supply the ministerial armament and to cut off the communication between the Eastern and Western provinces are circumstances which render it of the utmost moment to the contending powers. We must therefore expect that every effort will be put in practice to secure it for the Ministry. The force of America must consequently be divided into two bodies--one to defend the Massachusetts the other to secure New York. Two large armies must be kept on foot for these purposes; sufficient to overawe the Ministerial troops and confine them to the port they may under cover of the fleet be able to secure. The army which is to defend New York must again be subdivided --a sufficient number to overawe and confine the troops which may be landed in the City of New York, and the rest to oppose the attempts of the Indians & Canadians. In our operations we must hazard all upon the success of our small arms--there is no prospect that we shall be able to erect forts or batteries which will prove the least serviceable. We have some cannon but no engineers; no apparatus necessary for fortifying and what is worse very little powder of any kind, and no cannon powder or ball though with the latter we might speedily be supplied. Besides if we had both materials and capacity to construct fortifications they would probably only serve as decoys to ensnare us, for it would be opposing inexperience to discipline and meeting regular troops in their own way and on their own guard. In short the examples and success of the Massachusetts point out the only way in which we can meet our tyrants with any prospect of success. Under this head of preparation for defence will be considered- 2dly. The number of men to be raised in each Colony and  3dly. The means of their support. But these are subjects which can only be investigated by a thorough knowledge of the abilities and circumstances of each Colony of which I am too ignorant to venture any estimate. [As to the] (4) I come now to the II. General Head--whether any means of reconciliation are still left in our power which we can prepare with a prospect of success, or a just regard to our invaded rights. Many are the reasons which ought to induce us while we are preparing vigorously for the last appeal to open a door for reconcilia tion. I shall mention only three. 1.

I know your anxiety to be informed what is doing in Congress, and wish I was at liberty to gratify it, but the secrecy enjoined the members puts it out of my power to give you any information worth your attention. You will see by the papers which I send to Mr. Smith, the advice that is given to the people of New York relative to their city; to those papers I must beg leave to refer you for news; you will find by them the New Yorkers have taken an active share in the opposition; a tory dare not show his head amongst them; the cry of liberty is irresistible in most of the colonies; a military spirit has seized all orders of people; this city is full of armed men; they have now 28 companies of foot and two of horse; each company consists of 68 men including officers; they are called out twice every day to learn the military discipline, and I can assure you some of the companies perform it equal to any regular troops. Capt. Gillis makes so short a stay here that I fear I shall not have it in my power to send any shoes by him. I have urged the shoe makers to get them done, but they had so many orders not completed when I applied, that I fear the ladies and yourself must wait till the next opportunity for them.

314,dg001326,1775,Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston,"""Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston   Dear Sir Philadelphia 23d May 1775 I wrote to you (1) some days ago by a Mr. Reed who said he should MAY 23, 1775  pass thro' Edenton, but he went off before I had finished my Letter. I sent it by a vessel to Currituck. We have done very little in Congress, the Secrecy injoyned the Members puts it out of my power to communicate any thing worth your attention. The Congress had entered into a Resolve that no Vessel shall be suffered to Load for Newfoundland, St Johns, Nova Scotia, or the British Fishery on any of the Coasts of America, to take place immediately, thereby to pre vent the British Fishery from being supplied with Provisions & Stores. It was moved to amend this resolve by prohibiting all importation from these places to take place instantly, to this it was objected and very Justly too, that many persons in these places were indebted to the other Colonies and that such a resolve would prevent them from sending their Effects to this & other of our ports, and would injure ourselves. So the whole matter was put of[f] for some days in order to debate the latter part of the resolve, the first part being agreed to Unanimously, this prevents me from sending the resolve to the Edenton and Chowan Committee. Advice has been given to the People of New York, this you will see in the papers which I have sent to Mr. Smith.(2) The New Yorkers have stepped forward and taken an Active share on the opposition, not a Tory to be seen amongst them, all ranks of People are embarked in the Common cause deter mined to oppose ministerial Vengeance. A military spirit has diffused itself in an extraordinary manner thro' this Province, it is said a Majority of the Quakers have taken up Arms certain it is that many in this City have done it, some of which are Officers and appear in Uniform. This strong current of opposition to ministerial measures in some instances bordering on licentiousness calls for the most prudent and temperate deliberations of the Congress. To bear and forebear is a precept of Morality calculated exactly for these times and as we must draw the Sword I hope Necessity, not resentment will influence our measures. It is highly necessary that North Carolina should be puting her self in a State of defence, a Company of Militia ought to be formed in each County and Trained frequently. You prevailed on Hooper and my self to be elected delegates to attend the Congress, you have been instrumental in puting the halter about our Necks, if we should be obliged to promise too much for our Province we shall want your abilities and influence to carry us through. In the interim you ought, I think, to Exert yourself in geting the Province put in a state of defence, encourage the People to Associate in Companies for that purpose and to make themselves acquainted with Military discipline, this you may do without appearing active in it yourself. Hooper calls to me from the next room and says he is writing a long Letter to you, he is much better qualified to give you information than I am therefore I beg leave to refer you to him for a further account of politicks.  When you have read our Letters & the Newspapers I believe you will think it unnecessary to give any Orders for Goods, no person here thinks of it at present, if any alteration should happen I will give you the earliest account I possibly can of it. I have sent you all the Articles you mention in your letter of the 2d except [Stares Porter?] none of which can now be had. My best Compliments to your Family.

315,dg001327,1775,William Hooper to Samuel Johnston,"""William Hooper to Samuel Johnston   Dear Johnston Philadelphia May 23 1775 The close attention which I am compelled to pay to the business of the congress scarce gives me an opportunity to pay my duty to my friends. As we meet at 9 oClock in the morning and set till 4 in the Afternoon you will readily conceive that the little leisure we have is not sufficient for the common functions of life & exercise to keep us in health. While I am writing I encroach upon congress hours, & if I could furnish you with any thing entertaining it might be some apology for the transgression, but the strict secrecy which is enjoined upon the members leaves us at large to communicate nothing worthy attention, that happens within the Walls of the State House. Let it suffice that the most perfect harmony subsists among the Members, the Character of the New Yorkers is no longer suspicious, they take a forward and an active share in the Opposition, all ranks of people amongst them are embarked in the common cause and are sacredly resolved to preserve the Cargoe or perish with the ship. The few Tories amongst them are silent, the cry of liberty is irresistible. The Clergy who are never happy but when dabbling in fac tion have met a just reward for their misguided Zeal & have been compelled, (6 of them) to seek protection on board a Kings Ship. Rivington follows their fortunes, & his printing Shop which forged Calumny and sedition for the whole Continent is shut up. New York must now become the seat of War, the Taking of Ticonderoga will MAY 23, 1775  convert the attention of Government to that Quarter so the N Yorkers will not long be suffered to be indifferent Spectators of its operations. Believe me, I do not think they wish to be. Their City is fitted with armed Men whom they have raised & dis- ciplined, to be called into action when Hostilities begun on the part of Lord North & Troops shall render it necessary. Govt has sent them the Asia Man of War, We suppose to protect their Trade-rather to give Spirit to the tories, but that day is past, they are sunk never to rise again. This City has taken a deep share in the Infection which is so generally diffused thro' the Continent. Men Women & Children feel the patriotick glow, & think every man in a state of Reprobation beyond the power of heavenly mercy to forgive, who is not willing to meet death rather than concede a tittle of the congress creed. Quakerism has received a shock from which it will never recover. An attempt to restrain the other Sects in their spirited conduct has only shew'n the weakness of their efforts & the insignificancy of their numbers when in competition with those who think & act differently from them. Their Testimony to their eternal dishonor, accompanied with the proceedings of the New York Assembly gave encouragement to Administra [tion] to adopt the present compulsory measures, which at this Hour we all lament. For certain it is till those got to hand the plan prepared by Administration was conciliatory. If it should be thought expedient to raise troops in each Colony, Money of course must be supplied, from whence must it come in our Province. Would the Provincial Convention think it prudent, to emit for that purpose, or are not the Circumstances such as to leave no alternative to their Choice. Whether this; or what will be recommended is still in suspence, this however is certain that it will be necessary that a Convention should be held immediately upon the return of the delegates. I would therefore advice Mr Harvey to warn the several Counties immediately to elect representatives to set in Convention, & I would propose that each County should send 10 at least. This is consistent with the New York policy who thereby have given strength to the cause, by interesting so many in the protection of it. Every man let his property be ever so small, has still his right to preserve & claims a share in the publick Consultations which must eventually affect him. Such a step with us would be prudent. The Spirit wants resuscitation in N Carolina I think. Perhaps you may think so too many. Hewes sends you the Newspapers. Pray make my Compliments acceptable to every branch of your Worthy family. Remember me af- fectionately to Mr Iredell, Jones & Charlton whom I beg leave to refer to this hasty scrawl for every thing which is not retailed in the news papers. Only let me add to the Members of the Committees--that a  Resolve has passed the Congress and ordered to be published. That no vessell shall be suffered to load for Newfoundland, St John's, Nova Scotia to supply the British fishery there or any where along the Coast of America. This is much to be noticed, it is a just retaliation for restraining the American fishery. Hewes orders me to congress, that he may have an Opp[ortuni]ty to dispatch his Vessell, and as Caswell is indisposed I must obey & thereby save your patience a further trial.

316,dg001328,1775,George Read to Gertrude Read,"""George Read to Gertrude Read   My Dear G[itty] Philadelphia, [May 23, 1775] That you may not charge me with inattention, I take pen in hand, at a late hour, to chat with you, before I retire to my nest, as Mr. Van Luvenigh, whom I met on the Common this evening, returns to your town to-morrow, and promised to call upon me. I really begin to tire of my confinement. I attended at nine o'clock in the forenoon [to-day], and did not stir till after five; this is common; could we separate at three, I could bear it tolerably well. On Monday I dined with a select company of two or three persons at Mr. Dickinson's, where you were inquired after. He was, and indeed still is, much affected with the loss of his youngest child--the surviving one is a fine, hearty girl. I had an invitation to dine at Mr. James Allen's the same day, but subsequent to the other. An invitation is sent me this evening by Andrew Allen to dine on Saturday; but we distress these people by our late hours, though there is but little entertaining at this Congress compared to the last. The delegates are not such novelties now. There is a paragraph in the New York paper, brought by this day's post, that the regiment of horse, expected from England, had refused to embark, and also that the troops from Ireland were stopped on occasion of some disturbance there,--very lucky for America, if this be true; as it was our great dependence to save fighting here that the people at home would rouse and exert themselves to prevent a Civil war here; however, no great dependence can be put on this intelli- gence. A private letter from New York mentions that one regiment was detained, but the rest were coming, which, or whether either is true we cannot learn with any certainty yet. James Read had the ague yesterday; the rest of the family and all your friends here are well. MAY 24, 1775  I bid you good-night, and am yours, most affectionately, George Read [P.S.] Kiss our little ones for me. MS not found; reprinted from William T. Read, Life and Correspondence of George Read, a Signer of the Declaration of Independence . . . (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co., 1870), pp. 108-9.""

That to Defend The Entrance of The Harbour against a Naval Force would be Extremely Difficult if not Impracticable. That Batteries might be Erected between Those Towns which with Booms Chains &c might possibly Secure Portsmouth from Such attack. That to Defend the Pass & Secure The Retreat of the Inhabitants (of New Castle) will require at Least Fifteen hundred Men. But as they have a well Regulated Militia in That Neighbourhood which may Suddenly be Called Together for that purpose They are of opinion That there will be no necessity of Enlisting Men at the Continental Expence Especially as The Militia will Readily agree to Serve in Turns for the Defence of Those places.

About 1000 Men have been mentioned by some of the Congress to be sent forward from Connecticutt of which they are to Judge how many as it is left with them.(2) They have ordered the Provincial Congress act New York to see that Battoes & Boats are prepared on the lakes & provisions to be forwarded with all dispatch. At the same time they expect that all Surpluss Cannon Stores &c act Ticonderoga & Crown Point not Necessary for use & defence there, or thereabouts, to be sent down to some place of Security as soon as possible.

And he also confesses, in effect at least, that his Men made a very precipitate retreat from Concord, notwithstanding the reinforcement under Lord Piercy; the last of which may serve to convince Lord Sandwich (and others of the same sentiment) that the Americans will fight for their Liberties and property however pusilanimous, in his Lordship's Eye, they may appear in other respects. \""From the best Accounts I have been able to collect of that affair; indeed from every one, I believe the fact, stripped of all colouring, to be plainly this, that if the retreat had not been as precipitate as it was (and God knows it could not well have been more so) the Ministerial Troops must have surrendered, or been totally cut off, For they had not arrived in Charlestown (under cover of their Ships) half an hour, before a powerful body of Men from Marblehead and Salem were at their heels, and must, if they had happened to have been up one hour sooner, inevitably intercepted their retreat to Charlestown. Unhappy it is though to reflect, that a Brother's Sword has been sheathed in a Brother's breast, and that, the once happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched with Blood, or Inhabited by Slaves.

347,dg001359,1775,Fragment of a Speech in Congress,"""Fragment of a Speech in Congress   [May ? 1775] (1) The great God, Sir, who is the searcher of all things, will witness for me, that I have spoken to you, from the bottom and purity of my heart. We have heard that this is an arduous consideration. And surely, Sir, we have considered it earnestly. I may think of every gentleman here, as I know of myself, that, for seven years past, this question has filled the day with anxious thought, and the night with care. The God to whom we appeal, must judge us. If the grievances, of which we complain, did not come upon us unprovoked and unexpected--when our hearts were filled wth respectful affection for our parent state, and with loyalty to our King--let slavery, the worst of human ills, be our portion. Nothing less than seven years of insulted complaints and reiterated wrongs, could have shaken such rooted sentiments. Unhappily for us, submission and slavery are the same; and we have only the melancholy alternative left--of ruin or resistance. The last petition* of this Congress to the king, contained all that our unhappy situation could suggest. It represented our grievances; *In 1774, presented last Christmas. [Almon's footnote.] MAY 31, 1775  implored redress, and professed our readiness to contribute for the general want, to the utmost of our abilities, when constitutionally required. The apparently gracious reception it met with, promised us a due consideration of it; and that consideration relief. But, alas! Sir, it seems at that moment the very reverse was intended. For it now appears, that in a very few days after this specious answer to our agents, a circular letter was privately written by the same Secretary of State, to the Governors of the Colonies, before parliament had been consulted, pronouncing the Congress illegal, our grievances pretended, and vainly commanding them to prevent our meeting again. Perhaps, Sir, the ministers of a great nation, never before committed an act of such narrow policy and treacherous duplicity. They found parliament, however, prepared to support every one of their measures. I forbear, Sir, entering into a detail of those acts, which, from their atrociousness, must be felt and remembered for ever. They are calculated to carry fire and sword, famine and desolation, through these flourishing Colonies. They cry, \""Havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\"" The extremes of rage and revenge, against the worst of enemies, could not dictate measures more desperate and destructive. There are some people who tremble at the approach of war. They fear, that it must put an inevitable stop to the further progress of these Colonies; and ruin irretrievably those benefits, which the industry of centuries has called forth, from this once savage land. I may commend the anxiety of these men, without praising their judgment. War, like other evils, is often wholesome. The waters that stagnate, corrupt. The storm that works the ocean into rage, renders it salutary. Heaven has given us nothing unmixed. The rose is not without the thorn. War calls forth the great virtues and efforts, which would sleep in the gentle bosom of peace. \""Paulum sepultae distat inertia celaia virtus.\"" It opens resources which would be concealed under the inactivity of tranquil times. It rouses and enlightens. It produces a people of animation, energy, adventure, and greatness. Let us consult history: Did not the Grecian republic prosper amid continual warfare? Their prosperity, their power, their splendor, grew from the all-animating spirit of war. Did not the cottages of shepherds, rise into imperial Rome, the mistress of the world, the nurse of heroes, the delight of gods! through the invigorating operation of unceasing wars! \""Per damna, per caedes, ab ipso duxit opes animumque ferro.\"" How often has Flanders been the theatre of contending powers, conflicting hosts, and blood! Yet what country is more flourishing and fertile? Trace back the history of our parent state. Whether you view her arraying Angles against Danes; Danes against Saxons; Saxons against Normans; the Barons against the usurping  Princes, or the civil wars of the red and white roses, or that between the people and the tyrant Stuart--you see her in a state of almost continual warfare. In almost every reign, to the commencement of that of Henry the VIIth, her peaceful bosom (in her poet's phrase) was gored with iron war. It was in the peaceful reigns of Henry VII. Henry VIII. and Charles II. that she suffered the severest extremities of tyranny and oppression. But amid her civil contentions, she flourished and grew strong. Trained in them, she sent her hardy legions forth, which planted the standard of England upon the battlements of Paris; extending her commerce and dominion. \""Those noble English, who could entertain With half their forces, the full power of France, And let another half stand laughing by, All out of work, and cold for action.\"" The beautiful fabric of her constitutional liberty was reared and cemented in blood. From this fullness of her strength those scions issued, which taking deep root in this delightful land, have reared their heads, and spread abroad their branches like the cedars of Lebanon. Why fear we then, to pursue, through apparent evil--real good? The war, upon which we are to enter, is just and necessary. \""Justum est bellum, ubi necessarium; et pia arma, quibus nulla, nisi in armis, relinquitur spes.\"" It is to protect these regions, brought to such beauty through the infinite toil and hazard of our fathers and ourselves, from becoming the prey of that more desolating cruel spoiler, than war, pestilence, or famine--absolute rule and endless extortion. Our sufferings have been great--our endurance long. Every effort of patience, complaint, and supplication, has been exhausted. They seem only to have hardened the hearts of the ministers who oppress us, and double our distresses. Let us therefore consult only how we shall defend our liberties with dignity and success. Our parent state will then think us worthy of her, when she sees that with her liberty we inherit her rigid resolution of maintaining it against all invaders. Let us give her reason to pride herself in the relationship. And Thou, great liberty! inspire our souls. Make our lives happy in thy pure embrace, Or our deaths glorious in thy just defence! MS not found; reprinted from The Remembrancer, or Impartial Repository of Public Events, 17 vols. (London: J. Almon, 1775 84), 2:35-37, where it appeared under the heading: \""Fragment of a Speech made in the General Congress of America, by one of the Delegates in 1775.\"" 1 Although this document was reprinted in several documentary works during the 19th century and apparently accepted as authentic, Burnett chose not to publish it and suggested that it may not have been actually delivered. In speculat- JUNE 1, 1775  ing upon the identity of the delegate who might have made such a speech, he offered no new suggestions and simply quoted Charles Francis Adams' conclusions, which seem as pertinent now as then. \""By whom this was furnished,\"" Adams wrote, \""or whence obtained, does not appear. Mr. Austin, in his Life of Gerry, inserts it in a note to page 188, vol. i., with the intimation of his belief that it was made by John Adams. If genuine, the ownership probably lies between him, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, and Edward Rutledge, as there were no other eloquent men on that side of the question in this Congress. The difficulties are, that it has too much rhetoric for Mr. Adams, too much learning for Patrick Henry, and too much vigor for R. H. Lee, whilst its political tone is too high for Rutledge. With these comments, the reader will be left to form his own opinion from the perusal.\"" Adams, Works (Adams), 3:13-14. Although both Burnett and Adams entertained doubts about the document's authenticity, undoubtedly because of its rhetorical qualities, it is quite possible that it represents the substance of a speech delivered in Congress by a delegate who subsequently rewrote it in a more florid style and sent it to Almon for publication. No additional evidence bearing on its authorship has come to light. Charles Francis Adams discussed the document in the context of John Adams' autobiographical account of Congress' response to the receipt on June 2 of the Massachusetts Provincial Convention's letter of May 16, 1775. Its content suggests that it was written before Congress began to make substantial preparations for war, and it may well have been a product of the debates in the committee of the whole during the last week of May.""

You know my Sentiments of them, in general, & no man living, I am bold to say, knows them better, but though Caution has ever been, and is still predominant, yet when matters come to a push, No Assembly or Government has behaved better, & indeed not only the Name of a Yankee but of a Connecticut Man in particular, is become very respectable this Way, and Governor Trumbull is highly applauded by the Congress, for the Letters he has wrote Us, and the measures he has pursued as Governor; indeed Now the Constitution of Connecticut appears in its full Lustre, and the whole Continent are sensible of its superiority, to any other, and must, I beleive, after all adopt one similar in each Colony.

Their Cartouch Boxes are large, with the Word Liberty & the Number of their Battallion wrote on the outside in large White Letters. Thus equipp'd the[y] make a most elegant appearance, as their Cartouch Boxes are hung with a broad White wash Leather Strapp or Belt & their Bayonette on the other side with one of the same, which Two Crossing on the shoulders Diamond fashion gives an agreeable appearance Viewed in the rear. The Light Infantry are in Green, faced with Buff, Vests &c as the others except the Hatt which is a hunters Capp, or Jockey. These are without exception the Genteelest Companies I ever saw. They have besides a Body of irregulars, or rifle Men, whose dress it is hard to describe.

The Colony of Connecticut having their Men ready has been of Service, & I trust We shall get great share of their expence refunded by the Continent. I have wrote so much on Politics, that I have neither Time nor room to add more than Love to all of both Families, and a kind remembrance of the Neighbors &c. &c. Am sorry to hear of Mr. Merriams Situation, his Loss will be long felt by that people. Mr. Peircy is returned from London & is preaching away here for the first Time last Evening. I went to Mrs. Roberdeaux, in The Afternoon to drink Coffee with the Celebrated Beauty Miss Keys of whom I spoke to You formerly. She is really handsome, but Mrs. Roberdeaux is a zealot in Religion, which I am farr from at Home, or abroad. She must needs go to hear Mr. Peircy at the further end of the City. I told her I had my Pocket Book in my pocket and must be excused, and in plain English did not approve of Evening Lectures of any kind. She marked Me down as an heretic, & what is almost infinitely worse, a Man of no sensibility, or Taste, that could at any rate decline walking near Two Mile, & sitting a whole Evening to hear a Man preach, to have The inexpressible pleasure of being in Company with so much Beauty, but I shipp'd Col. Dyer on the Voyage & gave them the slipp in the best manner I could. On my return, I fell in Company with Two young Ladies, neither of them handsome, yet so free, merry, & diverting, that I must honestly say I had rather spend one hour in their Compy than Four in that where so much formality must be attended to even were I to gaze at an Angel. The Ladies I last spoke of are Daughters of a very good Freind of mine in the City, and are very much like Our Sally, only they sing well, which she does not, or will not. What a Mess have I wrote, I promised You a Long Letter & here You have it a perfect Farrago of Politics, Military, &c &c--& here let it End by my wishing You every Felicity which human Nature is capable of enjoying, & by assuring You I am Your most Affectionate Husband S D ""

I wrote you some time since by one Mr Brown who was at the taking the fort at Ticonderoga & from this place (as he said) was bound direct to Cambridge. I then had JUNE 3, 1775  only to Inform you of Our progress to this place, & at this time what we are att Liberty to Communicate from the Congress you will from time to time See in the public papers. There is no doubt but the Congress will approve and Support the Measures Which have been taken by the New England Colonies & I think we have got New York now Compleatly taken in. The advice given to New York with respect to the Troops that might be attempted to be landed there was in Consequence of their strong Solicitation to preserve their City from ruin.(1) It was said to be Impossible to prevent their landing & that an Immediate Attack would Induce the Men of Warr to lay the City in ruins. There is Care taken to have Sufficient Batteries in the most Convenient places up along Hudsons river to prevent any King's Ships or Cutters going up there. New York are raising 3 or 4000 Men. There are preparations making in every quarter but Unhappily No or but Very little powder except in the New England Colonies. We have just now receivd letters from Albany that Guy Johnson has lately been much Alarmd, is fortifying, & Collected a Number of his Irish Roman Catholicks in that County to protect him, and has Alarmd all the Indians in that quarter pretending that he has heard the New England people are coming to take him & his family & make him their prisoner. But the Majistrates of Schenectida & of Albany have had a talk with the Indians, Assured them of the falsity of that report by which the Indians are quieted & give the Strongest Assurance they will take no part in the dispute Between great Britain & her Colonies Unless their Superintended Johnson is Molested. If he is they must protect him. I hope he will soon be quieted. The Express is now only waiting for me therefore cannot one quarter finish my letter. We Understand Genll Burgoyne &c are arived. If so be on your guard for I think you may depend upon a Violent push from him. He will rather Sacrifice all the English Troop than suffer the disgrace of being Cooped up by you Yankees therefore keep a good look out. I hope if he make Any Attempt you will draw & decoye him into the Country by a retreating fire & then you may have him from every quarter. I must break of [f] in this spot. Youll therefore wait for more in my Next. The Conduct of Connecticutt is highly Approved here. Our Govrs letters are much Esteemd. God bless you all Succeed & prosper you. I hope the Army will run no great risques at first for but little benefit.

Most humbly sheweth That your Majestys American Subjects bound to your Majesty by the strongest Ties of Allegeance & affection and attached to their Parent Country by every Bond that can unite Societies, deplore with the deepest Concern the continuance of that System of colonial Administration which for twelve Years past has filled the minds of the loyal Inhabitants of North America with apprehensions of the most alarming Nature. That reposing the utmost Confidence in the paternal Care of their Prince and the Justice of the British Nation they were urged by the perilous Situation of their Liberties to sollicit his Majesty's Attention by their late Petition to their real & unmerited Greivances, and to request his royal Interposition in their Behalf. That tho disappointed in their Expectations of Relief they still re member their Duty to their Sovereign, & imputing the Rigour of their Treatment to insidious Counsels & wicked Misrepresentation, they again beg Leave to entreat for Justice & to request only that Portion of Liberty to which God and the Constitution have given them Rights. That Nothing but the Overruling Laws of self Preservation could ever have induced them to pursue any Measures which might be deemed offensive to their King or disrespectful to the British Nation, and that they ardently desire an opportunity of manifesting their Fidelity to the one and evincing their affection for the other. JUNE 3, 1775  That neither repeated oppression nor all the Miseries which attend the sword or are Threatned by Famine have yet weaned them from their Parent Country, and that they cannot yet cease to seek by every dutiful & peaceble Means in their Power to obtain a Restoration of that Harmony which formerly gave union Wealth & Power to the Empire. That they most earnestly beseech his Majesty to commission some good & great Men to inquire into the Grievances of his faithful Subjects, & be pleased to devise some Means of accommodating those unhappy Dissentions which unless amicably terminated must endanger the safety of the whole Empire and that shd. his majesty not be disposed to hear the Complaints of his American Subjects from their Representatives in Congress we most humbly beseech his Majesty to direct Com [missioner] s from their different Assemblies to convene for the Purpose. That altho the People of North America are determined to be free they wish not to be independent and beg Leave again to assure his Majesty that they mean not to question the Right of the British Parliament to regulate the Commercial Concerns of the Empire in the Manner they have before declared as their Enemies have unkindly insinuated and to remove all Doubts upon this Head are ready to confirm these Declarations by Acts of their Legislatures in the different Colonies. That (to facilitate the Restoration of Union & Harmony) they most humbly submit it to his Majestys Wisdom [whether] it wd not tend to facilitate the Restoration of Union & Harmony that the further Effusion of Blood should be prevented & every irritating Measure suspended and should his Majesty be graciously pleased by his royal Interposition to relieve his faithful Subjects from the Uneasiness & Anxiety they feel from the several acts of the british Parliament by which they think themselves so greatly agreived, they will with the utmost Gratitude & Chearfulness return to & resume that former Intercourse with their parent State which Nothing but the most pressing necessities could ever induce them to interrupt. They also take the Liberty of suggesting that when Concord & mutual Confidence shall thus be reestablished between his Majesty's British & American Subjects, their several Claims may be examined with Temper, adjusted with Precision and the present unnatural Contest end in a Compact that may place the Union of the Empire on a firm & permanent Basis.

362,dg001374,1775,New York Provincial Congress,"""New York Provincial Congress   Gent. Philadelphia, 3rd June, 1775. We have received your several letters, and communicated such of your papers to the Congress as were intended for their inspection. Your plan for raising money we are much pleased with, though we have some doubt of its being adopted; however, as the reasons on which it is founded, appear to us to be conclucive, we shall use our endeavours to carry it through. Till the success is known, you will, we dare say, see a propriety in keeping the whole secret. We observe with pleasure the attention of our Colony to Indian affairs, as they are really of the highest importance. Should you conceive the interposition of the Congress necessary, you will let us know the mode in which you think it will be most effectual. You inquire whether the direction relative to the militia of NewYork was intended to extend farther than that city and county. In answer to this, we must inform you that it was the design of the Congress that the whole Province should be well armed and disciplined.(1) We wish to hear that you have received some supply of powder, as we fear that none is to be procured here; the people conceiving they have not a sufficient stock for their own defence. We believe, however, that Connecticut will take care to supply their troops at Ticonderoga with that article, as the command of that post is for the present vested in their officers, owing to your repeated declaration of your inability to furnish the arms and ammunition necessary for its defence. We think it an object of great consequence, to know in whom you would wish to vest the command of the Continental Army in our JUNE 3, 1775  Province, which is to be maintained at the general charge, and hope you will not be at a loss to fix on men among yourselves, who may be intrusted with that important charge. As general officers will in all probability be shortly appointed by this Congress, your express should return immediately, with a warm recommendation of those persons in our Province, who you think may safely be trusted with the first and second commands, as major and brigadier-generals.(2) If possible, let us have an answer to this by Tuesday morning, drawn up in such a manner, that if necessary, it may be offered to the Congress, with the reasons on which such choice is founded. We know of nothing farther that may require your attention, unless it be to recommend a profound secrecy with respect to any advice we may offer, particularly on the subject of this letter, though we conceive that your own prudence will render any such recommendation unnecessary. If you wish for any other direction, pray be speedy and explicit in your application. We remain, with great respect, Your most ob. hum. servts. Jas. Duane Francs. Lewis Robt. R. Livingston, Junr. Wm.

They have much before them, scarce a day passes without the Arival of an express from some quarter, and altho' Necessity strongly urges that they should be speedy in their determinations, yet they proceed very slowly. I wish to God you was here that I might advise with you on some matters of great importance. I could say a thousand things to you in my Chamber that I cannot by any means put on paper. I am exceedingly uneasy (so are my Colleagues) not that I think we are doing any thing but what Necessity will Justify, but I fear we shall be obliged to promise for our Colony JUNE 5, 1775  much more than it will perform and perhaps more than it is able to bear. When a large extensive Country Loses its Trade, when its Ports are all Shutt up and all exportation ceases, will there be Virtue enough found in that Country to bear heavy Taxes with patience. Suppose a Country, no matter where, should be under such circumstances, and Necessity should oblige the inhabitants to raise a large Army for their defence, how is it to be paid? Suppose the exigences of that country should demand one million Sterlg. per Annum, how is it to be raised? how made? how sunk? I will not trouble you farther with imaginary Countries, but beg leave to call your attention to your Own, where I think it will be absolutely Necessary to have a Provincial Convention immediately. I think Mr. Harvey may appoint some day in August for the Meeting, an express should be sent to every County with Letters to some of the most popular Men that are friendly to our cause, and great care should be taken to have as full a representation as possible. Some matters will be laid before them that will require the utmost exertions of every friend to American Liberty amongst you. I cannot pretend to say when the Congress will break up, perhaps I may be able to guess at it a month hence. It has been often proposed by some of our Members out of Doors to Adjourn to Hartford or New haven in Connecticut in Order that we might be near the seat of Action, but some of the Southern Gentlemen have not yet given their Consent, nor do I think they ever will. Hooper and myself are willing. I shall be pleased with the Change, it would afford me an opportunity of Visiting the Camp of the American Army near Boston which I want much to see.

Unfortunately the Rain (which I hope you have had plenty of) prevented Our viewing critically as I could wish this Charming Country, which is hardly exceeded, by my beloved Standard, Connecticut River. Wilmington is situate on a Small River Called Christiern, running to the South of it through a rich, beautiful, & extensive meadow. This little River is Navigable up about Two Miles above the Town, to a Bridge called the Christiana, and empties into the D[elaware] about Three Miles below, or to the East of the Town, thro' one immense body of [fine] Meadows, in which there is scarce a Single Tree, to intercept the view of every Vessel sailing up and down the Delaware, become very wide at this place. The Town is compact has as many houses as Hartford, descends Towards the River Christiern, & the Meadows East in much the Same manner, is well built with Brick, has Two Presbyterian, one Quaker, & one Swedish Church in it, and the Quantities of Flour manufactured there would render it a large place were it not Too much in the shade of Philadelphia, to which they shipp all that Article, at least Forty Miles by Water, to be reshipp'd by the Merchants there. To give You an Idea of the greatness of this Business, a Gentleman at Wilmington told Me, that one Coaster carried Annually Thirty Thousand Barrels to Philadelphia. How many such they have I know not, but their Mills are thick as a little Town, and large as Meeting houses, larger indeed, than Most. We returned on Yesterday, thro' the rain which has prevented their review for the present. This instant, I have a Letter from Brother Barn[aba]s at Albany & from Col. Porter of the 1st Instant, by which I hope matters will go right at Last. The Congress are Now out on Committees, by which I hoped for Leisure but am forced on one of them, from which I have slipp'd a Minute, to write this Morning, having [sat] up with them, allmost the whole of last [nig]ht on the Business. Hope soon to be able [to] give the public an agreeable Acct of Our proceedings, and alleviate, the Fears & distresses of Our parsimonious Senators, by exhibiting to Them, Specimens of Continental Firmness, Union, & spirit, on the present Occassion.

They will we presume be releived as soon as our own Men are raised and equipped. This Invasure will settle all disputes between Collo. Arnold and Ethan Allen, who will both be supersed [ed] by the Colonel of the Connecticut Regiment, now probably on its way to the Lakes. We are extremely sorry that at so Critical a Juncture there should be any occasion of Uneasiness between the Colonies. We have mentioned to the Delegates of the Massachusets your Complaints that some Persons of that Province promise Extraordinary Wages to Induce Men in our Government to inlist in their Service. They cannot be persuaded there is any just foundation for such a charge, at least they are Confident that no Person has Authority to offer any encouragement beyond what is allowed to the Troops raised amongst themselves which is 40/ their Money a Month, and a Coat. We shall consider whether it may be proper to make a formal application to the JUNE 6, 1775  Congress on this Subject. In the mean time we do not chuse to detain your Express as the Resolution indosed is of Great Importance for Your direction. The Attention your Committee has paid to the Common Cause and particularly to Indian Affairs meets with approbation, and we know of no object more worthy of your Care than that of keeping the Six Nations in good Humour and preventing their Interfering in this Dispute. When any thing further offers, which we may be at Liberty to Communicate, we shall not fail of giving you the earliest Intelligence.

Several Persons have been before the Congress who have lately been in the Province of Canada, particularly Mr Brown and Mr Price, who have informed us that the French are not unfriendly to us. And by all that we can learn of the Indians, they intend to be neutral. But whether We should march into Canada with an Army Sufficient to break the Power of Governor Carlton, to overawe the Indians, and to protect the French has been a great Question. It Seems to be the general Conclusion that it is best to go, if We can be assured that the Canadians will be pleased with it, and join.(1) The Nations of Indians inhabiting the Frontiers of the Colonies, are numerous and warlike. They seem disposed to Newtrality. None have as yet taken up the Hatchet against us; and We have not obtained any certain Evidence that Either Carlton or Johnson have directly attempted to persuade them to take up the Hatchet. Some Suspicious Circumstances there are. The Indians are known to conduct their Wars, so entirely without Faith and Humanity, that it would bring eternal Infamy on the Ministry thoughout all Europe, if they should excite these Savages to War. The French disgraced themselves last War, by employing them. To let loose these blood Hounds to scalp Men, and to butcher Women & Children is horrid.

May the good Providence of God preserve her and you and all we love under his gracious Protection. (1) Our publick affairs are at length arrived at the most dangerous Extremity. The ministry with inflexible Obstinacy persevere in that inhuman System of Despotism which was contrived to rob us of our Liberties; and because we cannot submit to so humiliating a Condition they have drawn the sword against our suffering Friends as Traitors and Rebels, and the Authority of Parliament is called in to starve the Southern as well as the Eastern Colonies into base Submission. To stand forth at such a Juncture in the Situation in which I am placed is indeed an arduous and difficult Task, requiring an uncommon Exertion both of Wisdom and Fortitude. In the best View we must expect numberless Inconveniencies from this Conflict--We must be exposed to Danger and be loaded with heavy Expences: but if we can thereby secure our Liberties on a Just and solid foundation, the End is worthy of the Means, and we ought not to repine. We contend in a good Cause, and if we continue firm & united among ourselves, If by a wise and temporate Conduct we manifest to the World a desire of Reconciliation and reunion with the parent State, on Terms consistent with our Safety and the Interest and Happiness of the whole Empire, We may hope with the Blessings of Heaven that our JUNE 7, 1775  virtuous Struggles will be rewarded with Success. Many of the measures we are pursuing must from their nature unfold themselves to publick View: but I am not at present at Liberty to communicate them. The Massachusett's is reduced to such an unhappy Crisis that it is more than probable that a general Engagement between the Country and the ministerial Troops is at no great distance--Much will depend on this Event--Despair may supply the place of Discipline and disappoint ministerial Vengeance. We cannot however where so much is at Stake contemplate this approaching Scene without the most painful Apprehensions. The Operations within our own Colony will not at least this Summer be so important. We have little to fear from regular Troops. If we can guard ourselves against Incursions from Quebec and keep the Six Nations quiet we shall have little further to apprehend. From what we learn the English in Canada are our warm Friends, & the common people among the French averse to engage in the Quarrel. I hope nothing will be left unattempted which may serve to confirm this disposition. The Six Nations have such numerous Connections in your County, and it will be so much for the Honour Interest and Safety of the Superentendant & his Family to keep out of the Quarrel, that I am easy in this Respect. However every Expedient ought to be pursued with the utmost diligence to engage their neutrality; for if it was in our power I shoud abhor the Thought of employing them in our Service. Nothing coud so effectually Shut the door of Accomodation as the inhuman policy of making, on either side, those treacherous Savages the Tools of Revenge: and I woud not for any prospect of Advantage have this Guilt laid to our charge. I am much pleased that young Mr Livingston is raising a Company in the Manour. I wish he may extend his Views further, or that some Gent. of property and influence may be found to unite with him in the only plan, which, independent of the grand Contest, will render landed property Secure. We must think in Time of the means of assuming the Reins of Government when those Connections shall subside. Licenciousness is the natural Effect of a civil discord and it can only be guarded against by placing the Command of the Troops in the hands of Men of property and Rank who, by that means, will preserve the same. Authority over the Minds of the people which they enjoyed in the Hour of Tranquillity. I observe w hat you say concerning the State of your Manufactures. Your Case is not singular. We must expect great Inconveniencies and distress in this Contention. Provisions however will be in some demand to support the Armies: and Iron will not decay. If we survive the present Storm, and Liberty should be secured for our Country, it will become the favourite Residence of the Industrious from all parts of the World, and a rich Increase of our Estates will  compensate our Losses. Abstracted from this Consideration we are doing our Duty to which we must be contented to sacrifice every other Object. I can yet form no Judgement how long the Congress will sit. There are Subjects before us of great Magnitude and Difficulty which require time to discuss and Arrange; and much as I long to be with my Friends at the Manour I must be patient. This family is well. It is extremely uncertain whether you will see any of them this Summer tho' they ardently wish for that pleasure. Hood the Collector is run off to England, & the whole Charge of the Customs rests upon Mr Patterson. He has applied for Leave of Absence; but whether he will obtain it; or make use of it if he succeeds, is equally uncertain, as he pays great Attention to his Trust; & personally inspects every Transaction of the office. He seems concerned that you have not in a long time favoured him with a Letter. I am much obliged to him and my sister for the truly polite and affectionate attention they are pleased to pay me. Both of them Join me in our most dutiful and Affectionate Regards to yourself Mamma & the Family. Be pleased to present mine to my dearest Polly & our little ones. I have missed no opportunity of writing to her. I hope she keeps up her Spirits and uses moderate Exercise; and that my daughter attends to her Improvement: and my son not too troublesome.

As he was waiting I wrote in so much hurry that I know not what was Contained in that letter. You will therefore take it for better or for worse. Last evening we had two ships arrived at this place from London in which we have Intelligence I think to about the 25th of April. Every thing seemd tolerabley quiet in England. Lds. North & Datsmouth had full expectation that their late proposal for the Colonys to JUNE 8, 1775  tax themselves in the Manner they pleased, but in Measure as the Parliament pleased, & to be at their disposal (if it was even to Arm the people of Briton to cutt our throats) would bring over some of the Colonies and at least divide & thro us into Confusion; though at times they seemd much Concerned for the event. We have the K[ing']s Answer to the Address or Petition of the City of London which I dare say will kick up a dust in that great City. The K g replied, he was Astonished that Any of his Subjects in Briton should Countenance his rebellious Subjects in America that he firmly relied on his parliament Approved their Measures & should Carry them into execution &c.(1) Majr. Skene the Elder came passenger in one of the Ships with a Commission as it is said to be Govr. of Ticonderoga Crown Point &c with Orders as he says on his passage to raise Ten thousand Men to Subdue the Rebells &c but how amazingly was he Chagrined when on the ships arival here he was Immediately taken prisoner & all his papers & letters taken into Custody, & then to hear that the New England people had taken his fort & Governt. & themselves had placed a Commander there but on second thought he seems to brave it out tolerably well. I think there is one or two more officers with him, [I] believe only Lieuts. all under Guard in this City. Every one now seem more & more Convinced of the Importance of that pass at Ticonderoga & of the Necessity of keeping & defending it. We had this day a grand review of the Militia of this City. They performd to Admiration, they consisted of above 2000 dressd mostly in Uniforms among which was one Compleat Quaker Company their Uniform light blue lappelled &c with white, who were exceeded by none in dress or exactness of discipline, their officers quakers beside many men of that denomination mixd in the other Companys. The Military spirit runs full as high in this Country as in New England & all seem determined to stand or fall with us. I believe I wrote you before that I think our Army may depend upon a brush from How, Clynton, & Burgoyne; now they are Arived they will I Imagine at all Adventures endeavor to retrieve the Credit of the British Troops; I believe if they knew they should Make a Sacrifice of their Whole Army they would make a push rather than to return home in disgrace. You know Burgoyne in the house of Commons spoke with the Utmost Contempt of the dastardly Undisciplined provincialls. I hope our officers will be on their Guard. I know we want good Arms & good Marksmen. I wish you had 500 or a 1000 riflers from this Country. Perhaps you may have them before long. My sincere regards to Genlls Spencer, Putnam & the officers of my Acquaintance, Coll Parsons in particular if he is with you. I own I fear some great and daring enterprise which may prove of great loss & but of little profit of even if attended with so much Success as can be expected. If the Contrary, disheartning to  our Troops at least. But may Prudence direct & Heaven Succeed & prosper every enterprise & am Sincerely Yours Elipht Dyer N.B.

We have nearly 2000 Troops now under Arms in this City, & very well disciplined. I suppose the Province will raise 20,000 effective Men determined to support the noble Cause of Liberty. We are glad to find the City of London steps forth valiantly in ours & the Nations Cause, their Petitions & Remonstrances meet with the same fate as those from the Colonies, treated as if of no Consequence. I hope Time will manifest to the World that a steady Perseverance in the Cause of Freedom will triumph over all the deep lay'd Schemes of Tyranny, & that Britain & America will again be united on the solid Foundation of Commerce & the Constitution. Thou will hear before this reaches thee the Situation of General Gage, he is hem'd in by the Provincials on every Side, & cannot penetrate 500 Yards into the Country, were he supported by all the Troops now in England. You have declared the New England People Rebels, & the other Provinces Aiders & Abettors, this is putting the Halter about our Necks, & we may as well die by the Sword as be hang'd like Rebels, this has made the People desperate. Yesterday arrived here Capt. McCulloch, in whose Vessel came Passenger a certain Major Skeene, Governour of Ticonderoga, Crown Point & the Lakes, it has happened so that the said Governor has no Government to go to, the New England Men having some time since taken possession of those important Places, in order to prevent the Canadians from attacking them in the Rear.

Yet I keep about and attend Congress very constantly.(1) I wish I could write freely to you my Dear, but I can not. The Scene before me, is complicated enough.

395,dg001407,1775,John Adams to Moses Gill,"""John Adams to Moses Gill   Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 10 June, 1775. It would be a relief to my mind, if I could write freely to you (1) concerning the sentiments, principles, facts, and arguments which are laid before us in Congress; but injunctions and engagements of honor render this impossible. What I learn out of doors among citizens, gentlemen, and persons of all denominations, is not so sacred. I find that the general sense abroad is, to prepare for a vigorous defensive war, but at the same time to keep open the door of reconciliation; to hold the sword in one hand and the olive branch in the other; to proceed with warlike measures and conciliatory measures pari passu. I am myself as fond of reconciliation, if we could reasonably entertain hopes of it upon a constitutional basis, as any man. But I think, if we consider the education of the sovereign, and that the Lords, the Commons, the electors, the army, the navy, the officers of excise, customs, &c., &c., have been now for many years gradually trained and disciplined by corruption to the system of the court, we shall be convinced that the cancer is too deeply rooted and too far spread to be cured by any thing short of cutting it out entire. We have ever found by experience, that petitions, negotiations, every thing which holds out to the people hopes of a reconciliation without bloodshed, is greedily grasped at and relied on; and they cannot be persuaded to think that it is so necessary to prepare for war as it really is. Hence our present scarcity of powder, &c. However, this continent is a vast, unwieldy machine. We cannot force events. We must suffer people to take their own way in many cases, when we think it leads wrong, hoping, however, and believing that our liberty and felicity will be preserved in the end, though not in the speediest and surest manner. In my opinion, powder and artillery are the most efficacious, sure, and infallible conciliatory measures we can adopt. Pray write me by every opportunity, and beseech my friends to write. Every letter I receive does great good. The gentleman to whom most letters from our province are addressed, has not leisure to make the best use of them.(2) There are three powder mills in this province, two in New York, but no nitre. Cannot the Massachusetts begin to prepare both? Pray write me minutely the state of the people of Boston and our army. Pray let me know if Mrs. Gill and Mr. Boylston are out of prison. I have never heard, and have suffered much anxiety on their account. My best respects to them, if they are to be seen by you. MS not found; reprinted from Adams, Works (Adams), 9:356-57. 1 Moses Gill (1734-1800), husband of Rebecca Boylston Gill and first cousin of JUNE 10, 1775  John Adams' mother, was chairman of the committee of supplies of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress.

It is of vast Importance that the officers of our Army should be impressed with the absolute Necessity of Cleanliness, to preserve the Health of their Men. Cleanness is one of the three Cardinal Virtues of a Soldier, as Activity and Sobriety are the other two. They should be encouraged to go into Water frequently, to keep their Linnen washed and their Beds clean, and should be continually exercised in the manual and Maneuvres. General Lee has an opinion of Burgoine, Clinton and How.(1) Burgoine he says is very active and enterprizing--fond of Surprizes and Night Attacks and Alarms. He entreats me, to inculcate a most unremitted Vigilance--to guard against Surprizes, especially in the Night. We have a most miraculous Militia in this City, brought into Existence, out of Nothing since the Battle of Lexington. Measures are taken here and at New York to procure Powder-But We must be Sparing of that Article. The Supineness of the Colonies hitherto concerning it, amazes me. Genl Lee and Major Gates are very fond of a Project of procuring Pikes and Pike men I hope We shall send you some Rifle Men--they shoot with great Exactness, at amazing Distances. They are casting Pateraras and making Amuzettes in this City, and preparing for War, with an alacrity, which does them Honor. ""

The Battle of Lexington will be famed in the History of this Country. JUNE 10, 1775  Your Accounts of it have doubtless by this time reachd England. Our insulting Enemies there must be convincd that Americans are not such dastardly Cowards as a Colo Grant & others have represented them to be,(1) and our Friends have receivd a sure pledge that we will not desert them by deserting our Selves, & leave them to the Contempt of those most Contemptible Wretches the Kings Ministers. Whether the People of England will hereby be brought to reflect on their own Danger, or whether their pride will be touchd at this unexpected & Signal Defeat of British Troops is to me uncertain. If their Resentment should run high against us, our Friends will have a political Game to play, to turn the whole Force of that Resentment upon the Authors of these Disturbances, viz Hutchinson and the Ministry. It is however the Duty of America to be still upon its Guard, for there is no Dependence to be had on the People of England, and I am convincd most abundantly that it is the Determination of the K & his Ministers to establish arbitrary Government in the Colonies by Acts of Parliamt. & to inforce those Acts by the Sword. Could the publick Sentiment be otherwise it would be a Delusion leading directly to Destruction. The Spirit of Patriotism prevails among the Members of this Congress, but from the Necessity of things Business must go on slower than one could wish. It is difficult to possess upwards of Sixty Gentlemen, at once with the Same Feelings upon Questions of Importance that are continually arising. All mean the Defence and Support of American Liberty, and Matters are finally well decided; I have endeavord to act with that kind of Prudence, which I dare say, when I shall explain my Conduct to you, you will not condemn. Mr Fessenden a Courier from your Congress arrivd here yesterday. I could not help flattering my Self that your pressing Demand was political, but I was much pleasd to see every Gentleman present anxiously sollicitous to relieve the Necessities & yeild a full supply to the \""American Army before Boston.\"" Our worthy President has Communicated to yours a Resolution for this purpose.(2) Every Step is taking here for the procuring of Gun powder from abroad and setting up the Manufacture of it in America and I believe they will be successfull. Mr. Mifflin assures me that large Quantities are expected in a few Weeks in this place and 200 Barrels every hour. If our Army behave with Spirit this Summer (as I am confident they will) and their Efforts are succeeded, I trust in God, we shall be superior to all future Difficulty. Be cautious of the enterprising Spirit of Burgoin & Howe. D[r] Church left us this Morning. I disclosed to him as much as I could consistent with the Injunctions I am under.

A motion was made in Congress that advice should be given to the present provincial Congress to chuse Councellors, but there being many objections to it, it was withdrawn. The Person that made the motion observd that the choice of Representatives would occasion great Delay--& that there could not at present be an Equal Representation as Boston would not be permitted by the General to chuse Representatives Upon this Occasion. He was answered that the Delay would not be great, that it was best to adhere as near to the Charter as possible & not to vary from it but in Case of Absolute Necessity--that as to the Town of Boston either the present Provincial Congress, or the New Assembly could easily make some provision for their being Represented either by directing the late Inhabitants to meet at Cambridge or some other Town & chuse their Representatives or by divising some new Mode of Collecting the Voice of the People upon this Occasion.(2) As to giving a Credit to our Provincial Notes & the Regulation of the Army at or near Boston it will be determined upon very soon, I hope in a few days you will have the determinations of Congress upon these heads. It will therefore in my opinion be best to suspend any farther orginization of the army till you hear further.

They will not be lessened by the resolutions of the Congress of yesterday recommending it to you to procure and forward five Thousand barrells of Flour for the use of the Army at Boston. We communicated the paragraph of your letter in which you complain that unless the Congress shall make some speedy order with relation to the levying of money it will be impossible for you to comply with their farther Requests. They however seem perswaded that their Vote of Credit, which accompanies the order for the Supply will remove every obstruction, and relying on your Zeal for the Common Cause they hope you will be able to throw in this provision which we are apprehensive will soon become highly necessary. We may venture to hint to you that the emission of paper money will be discus'd on Monday and we expect in the course of next Week to be able to present you with a determination of this importent business, which will free us from much anxiety. We shall not fail to attend to what you suggest concerning the Indians. This is an object to our Colonie of the highest moment and we hope in due time it will be considered by the Congress. We think the Indians will not be disposed to engage in this unhappy quarrell unless deceived and deluded by missrepresentations and this, with Vigilence and care on our part, can be prevented. As one step towards it, which we much applaud, are the assurances you have given the Superintendent of his safety. JUNE 10, 1775  From the temper and customes of the Indians, they would illy brook the extinguishing of their council Fire; and had it been damped by any violence to Col. Johnstons person or property, they must have been and very probably excited to extremities. It is much to be lamented that we are still destitute of Amunition. The Government of Conecticut have been more provident or more fortunate, and will be able to supply the Forces at Tyckonderoga with pouder. We commend your caution in addressing two letters to us upon the Subject of General Officers to command our Troops.(2) What we wrote to you was in the Character of your own immediate Delegates, and with a view to discover the sense of our Colonie, that we might when this matter came to be debated in Congress, be fortified with your opinion and arguments, which having obtained we shall to the utmost of our power enforce your recommendations. Your remarks on the Resolution of the Continental Congress relative to the taking Post at Kingsbridge appear to us to be conclusive, we shall however lay them before our Body, as soon as the other important matters under consideration are determined.

I rely upon it, that measures are taken in your parts of the JUNE 10, 1775  Continent to Supply this defect. The design of the Express will be zeallously attended to I think. I have seen one of the Powder Mills here where they make excellent Powder but have work'd up all the Nitre; one of our Members is Concerned in a Powder Mill at N. York & has a man at Work making Nitre. I have taken pains to enquire into the method. Dr. Franklin has seen Salt Petre Works at Hannover & Paris; & it strikes me to be as unnecessary After a certain time to send abroad for Gun Powder as for provisions. People will make use of common understanding & Industry; but for the present we must import from abroad. Major Foster told me at Hartford he suspected he had Some Land that would yeild Nitre, pray converse with him about it. Dr. Franklin's account is much the same as is mentioned in one of the first of American Magazines. The Sweepings of the Streets & Rubbish of old Buildings are made into Mortar & built into Walls exposed to the Air & once in about two months scraped, & lixiviated & evaporated.

We have to Assure your Honor that the Conduct of our Assembly the Letter and seasonable Advice received from your Honor from time to Time since the Setting of the Congress here have given the body particular satisfaction. They find every step that has been taken is exactly coincides with their Opinion & is in fact done to their minds even before they have an Opportunity to Advise you therein, they are now fully Sencible of the Importance of the Pass at Ticonderoga & every Day turns up something New which Confirms them in that Opinion. The First Advice they are convinced that was hasty & Premature tho as matters then appeared they Acted right. The grounds of that first resolve,(1) may be explained, on some future Day. We just mentioned to you in our last of the Arrival of Major, (alias) Govr Skene who has a Commission for Govr of Ticonderoga, Crown Point &c but he is happily Dissappointed in taking possession of them at present. He is at this time under guard in this City, tho concluded to give him some inlargement on his Parole of Honor. His papers ware soon taken into custady & have been thoroughly examined by a Comtee from the Congress but Nothing very material has been Discovered, As he owns he Distroyed many just before his coming up to the City. There has been a Number of Private letters which Accompanied and followed Maj Skene into this City from London giving JUNE 11, 1775  the most surprising Account of the Confidence Administration have placed in this Gent. It seems he has been of their Cabinet council & that Lds. N[or]th & Dartmouth have much Depended on his Intelligence of this Country & the Dispositions of the people here, & their plan of opperation has been much dictated by him & it seems he is betrusted with all their secrets, & much depended upon to carry their Designs into Execution. He was it seems to make overtures with the Congress & has Authority to draw upon the Treasury in England for what he finds Necessary not only to bribe & bring over some Members of the Congress but to Divide & confound the whole if possable. It is said and not without probable evidence that he had brought over Important Commissions for some Members of the Congress & of those who have been esteemd of Among the first Patriots, but through good Providence all his Schemes are at once Confounded. We are more surprised here that the Ministry have made so great a Confidant of him as he appears Neither to have Art or Abilitys for their purpose, to what low dirty & mean Shifts are this Disparing Ministry put to, to Accomplish their Wicked designs & plots against America. The firmness Union and steady perseverence in the great American Cause believe we may say still prevails in this Congress, but we have so many Expresses & Matters Incidental that almost Daily Comes before US that it makes our Progress slow & causes many Delays in the more great & Important Matters. A Continental Army & Continental resources Including Continental Currancy & their proportions among the United Colonies with a proper & firm Confederacy you are sensible are great & important Objects but we see Nothing Discourageing in either. We have this Day received Advice from the Army Near Boston of their great fears of a Deficiency in the Article of Ammunition. Every Step is taking by the Congress to lay a foundation for a proper Supply by sending & Collecting from every Colony what small parcells of Salt Petre can be Obtaind from every private family or store & to be sent to New York or Philadelphia where their are Powder Mills & Workmen Sufficient if they can be supplied with Materials. They have sent their request to all the Colonies Eastward to supply the Army for the present with what they can spare, Connecticutt among the rest. Also to have an Account forwarded as soon as may be what Powder in Stock Colony Town the several Colonies are possessed of. Believe as so late & thorough enquiry has been made in Connecticutt that you will be able to send us the Account with so much precission as is Necessary without being at the expence of sending through the Colony. We doubt not that a just and True account will be kept of the very expence & Advancement of our Colony in the Genl Cause as we expect it will be a Continental expence. Almost every Colony esteem themselves in some Danger in the Present Dispute from either external or Internal JUNE 12, 1775  force but they mostly foregoe demands of a standing force relying for the present on their Militia which are providing & preparing in every Province with care & Zeal. Therefore doubt some of an Allowence for our Troops that are kept within the Colony Unless they should be wanted and called forth into sum special service. I rather wish that we had not raised so many tho the Genl Service as it then appeard [I] beleive sufficiently Warrented that Number, but we are not enabled to give any Advice on that head therefore must leave the disbanding any part to the Discretion of the Colony who must Judge for themselves therein & we shall not fail on our part to Obtain Justice for the Colony to the utmost of our Power.

I am obliged to you for yours of the 6 & 7th & 10th Instant. We JUNE 13, 1775  had the Kings Answer to the Address of the City of London by a vessel in here last week by which I recvd Mr Glovers Speech having before had the Evidence which very fully justifies Mr. Glovers State as to the dependance of the Islands on the associating Colonies.(1) I assure you I feel troubled at the prospect of Wretchedness into which we are likely to plunge the West Indies and the Additional Missery we are like to heap on Ireland but I very much fear any Relaxation of our System would be imputed by our Enemies to irresistable Interest and that they would not place any Thing of it to the account of Humanity. If they ever conceive that we are shifting our Means of Defence they will cross us and conclude we shall give way in Confusion for if they know any Thing they cannot be ignorant that the people are not more violent in their Demands when Demands are making than in giving up when it is the fashion to give up. I am therefore afraid at this Time to stir any point of the association. I am in Hopes no Body will perish though the West Indies will be much straightened till we get our Trade open again either by a Reconciliation with out Mother Country or by her being engaged in a War with some foreign power. It appears plain to me that neither our Imports or Exports will continue long if the Ministry are resolved to finish the Dispute by Knocks. We surely must invite all the foreign Trade we possibly can but if luckily for us Spain should bring her Quarrel to maturity as I cannot doubt she will have policy enough not to fall on the associated Colonies at the same Time we may I think carry on our Trade in our own Bottoms just where we please for Great Britain by taking our Vessels may force the Colonies even to privateer on their Trade. We had surely better kiss and be friends but I have no Idea of fighting long without attempting to Trade. I am sorry that I have it not in my power to ascertain you whether in Consequence of the late Acts of Parliament we shall shorten the Time for Exporta[tion]. I do not think we shall. I am myself against it and I know from private Conversations many others are so. We can in my Opinion effect nothing very desirable by shortening the Time; we should by that Measure undoubtedly much increase the Distress of Ireland & the West Indies and what is not enough attended to throw the Affairs of our Merchants into the utmost perplexity as well as strip our friends of so much wealth as is the Value of the produce now in their Hands. I tell you with a great deal of Candor all I know of this Business. I have learned from a Gent out of Doors talk of shutting up the ports the same Day that the Act is to take place as a proper Measure but I hope enough to prevent it will think it very unwise. I wish you could get some ingenious Gent to go about Salt petre and teaching others to make it. We certainly may have an internal Supply if we will exert ourselves. The Congress will I dare say do ev-  ery Thing in it's power to promote this very useful Work but I believe most Gent of the Congress have as much to learn as myself.(2) I shall be very agreeably surprized whenever your Country leading Gent. shall act on a large Scale in politicks. I wish you would fret yourself as little as possible. Nothing that you and all your Town can do will expand their Hearts. I have not yet had an Oppty of executing your Commission with regard to Colo.

The Provincials talk much of storming that town and it is expected by many. The Congress will sit long. Adjusting the expenses of each colony for the common cause and settling proper funds for the army are subjects fruitful of debate and of the utmost consequence.

420,dg001432,1775,Edmund Pendleton to Joseph Chew,"""Edmund Pendleton to Joseph Chew   Philadelphia June 15 1775 I have your Favor of the 25th of May and received pleasure in hearing that you and your family were well a blessing which will enable a man to sustain all Calamities Public or private of which we have all of us enough at present to call forth every exertion of Fortitude. The Crisis of our Fate in the present and unhappy Contest seems approaching nearer than may be imagined by us and perhaps this Summer may determine whether we shall be slaves or a Rotten wicked Administration be sacrificed to Our Freedom in such times there will be as great Variety of Sentiments as Constitutions among those who have the same end in view. The Sanguine are for rash Measures without consideration the Flegmatic to avoid that extreme are afraid to move at all while a third Class take the middle way and endeavor by tempering the first sort and bringing the latter into action to draw all together to a Steddy tho Active Point of defense; but till this is done it is natural to suppose the extremes will be blaming each other and perhaps in terms not the most decent and each at times will include the third class in that which is opposite to themselves this I have frequently experienced; and must blame since mutual Charity should lead Us not to censure but to endeavor to convince the Judgment of each other; you are much mistaken my friend in the sentiments of your countrymen about paying for the Tea; scarce a Man there (Scotch Merchants excepted) thinks it ought to be done not on account of the trifling sum but that it would be giving up the Cause; and so early as May 1774 did our Convention Resolve that if by dire Necessity Boston should be compelled to pay for the Tea we would never purchase or consume an Article of East India goods till the Company refunded the money. To consider the question abstractedly as only this That a Company of Merchants sent their property and offered it for sale at a Market where they had a legal right to send it and it was destroyed no one could speak of its being wrong and that they had ought to pay for it: but when you take the case in its true light consider the tea as sent in consequence of a Combination between the Ministry & Company to fix the Precedent in favor of taxing Us; (the only design of their retaining that trivial duty) That if Landed the Tools of Government would have had sufficient Influence over the Virtue of individuals to have affected the sale of it and that all their endeavors to send it away were defeated Necessity of choosing the lesser evil justified them in its destruction JUNE 15, 1775  as the only means of avoiding the Poison: suppose it doubtful or even Wrong the severity in the designed Punishment would scarcely incline Us now to retract and pay for the Tea. Upon a bare accusation thousands confessedly innocent are condemned for the supposed Fault of about 40 and this without hearing and without Testimony; Nor are these sufferings to have an end when the Tea is paid for or they have endured them for a limited term but so long as the Minister Pleases after he shall be satisfied the Trade of Great Britain may be carried on without Interruption that is in plain English until we shall agree to receive and pay for without murmuring all such goods as Parliament shall tax and send to Us: after this can we doubt of the Original Plan and design in sending the Tea? Surely not and then reason must reject the Idea of Paying for it. I am truly sorry for the uneasiness Colonel Johnston (1) has been subject to and hope the Committees of Albany and Schenectady have ere this removed that and Satisfied the Indians. We have reason to Watch the motions of all Government Officers and especially in your parts when well we know it is projected by our Enemies to pour Mischief upon us from the Canadians and Indians as far as they can effect it; it was proper therefore to seize and guard the door of Canada as they had done; I hope Colonel Johnston had none other foundation than this for his apprehension of an Attack For tho it might have been in contemplation to apply to him to preserve the Indians in Neutrality I dare say no hostility to him was thought of unless it should appear he had instructions to enlist the Indians against Us and intended to carry them into Execution when his own good sense will suggest the propriety of resistance and Reprisals; However as I hear he has assured those Committees of his having no such instructions or Intention for which the nature of his Office and his great stake in the community seem a sufficient security; As the Indian chiefs have declared that they don t consider themselves as concerned and shall not intermeddle in the dispute and as the Committees have assured Colonel Johnston they know nor had heard of any intention to molest him I hope this matter is settled to general satisfaction; Whatever is done in this Affair I consider Virginia as under particular Obligations to Colonel Johnston for his Interposition with the Indians and keeping them from entering into the War against Us last year and probably the Indians themselves owe him thanks for the same. I mentioned at setting out that our Affairs were growing Critical--3 Generals are arrived and 9 Regiments come or coming whether all to Boston or to New York is yet to Us here matter of Speculation--the Disgrace the Troops have met with in three skirmishes must spirit up the Officers to some great Effort which we may daily expect: however I am not apprehensive of very bad consequences I think we have sufficient troops of brave men fighting for their all and flushed with Victory to  repel them and at once perhaps to put an end to the War; for I do not think the people of Britain will suffer their Ministry to lavish their blood and treasure in another experiment of the sort especially when they are feeling the want of Our trade that great resource of their Wealth. All our friends as far as I hear are well in Virginia where we have had a small taste of the troubles of the times. Lord Dunmore very imprudently had 15 half Barrels of Powder removed in the night from the Magazine on board a Man of War whether Crown or Country property is uncertain. This alarmed the Country and I suppose 1 000 men were in arms to go to Williamsburg on the Occasion but sent an express there to know the true state of things. The Corporation requested they would not come down as they had force enough in the neighborhood to effect any thing necessary to be done but they believed him sincere in his professions that he only meant to secure it from the slaves and would return it--the greater part was satisfied; however 150 marched on to make Reprisals but the Receiver General met them and having paid them a high value for the Powder they returned and that matter appeared to be Over. Our Assembly have since met and seemed to be going on smoothly in business but we now hear the Governor has fled with his family on board a Man of War and refused to return saying his Assassination was resolved on tho the Assembly sent him a Message that they would protect him and be pledged for his safety. We have no certain account of the beginning of this Affair but it probably was this-there are many stands of Arms in the Magazine from which the locks have been taken and the people uneasy lest the Guns would also be taken away. Curiosity led a Burgess and two other men to go and open the door. Upon their doing it three guns went off being so fixed as to do so on Opening the Door and so well placed as to wound every one of the three--this made a noise the Governor was applied to and he threw it upon his servants who to his face avowed it to be done by his Orders; if this was the Case he might well fear what he must have been conscious he deserved Assassination--it seems he privately sent to the Man of War for Marines to protect him (as he had done before) the Burgesses told him if they came there should not a man of them return alive and then he fled to them since which we have not heard from them. I imagine I have by this time tired you and will only Add what we are at liberty to Publish that Colonel Washington is appointed General and Commander in chief of all the American Force and that a Committee of the whole Congress have voted to raise 15 000 men and to emit a Continental Currency to Amount of 2 Millions of Dollars to pay and provide for them.

I then wrote You a long Letter & have since wrote to You again. I should have wrote to You by Wightman but was afraid the Men of War would intercept my Letter.

Let This be my Apology to you, but do not mention it in public, as they may think I am making an Apology for Wages and expences extra. Genl. Washington, will be with you soon, elected to that high Office by the Unanimous Voice of all America. I have been with him for a great part of the last Forty eight Hours, in Congress & Committee and the more I am acquainted with, the more I esteem him. He promises Me to call, & if it happen favorably, to spend one Night with You. I wish to cultivate this Gentlemans acquaintance & regard, not from any sinister Views, but from the great Esteem I have of his Virtues, which do not shine in the View of the World by reason of his great Modesty but when discovered by the discerning Eye, shine proportionably brighter. I know You will receive him as my Freind --what is more, infinitely more, his Countrys Freind--who sacrificing private Fortune independant Ease, and every domestic pleasure, sets off at his Countrys call, To exert himself in her defence without so much as returning to bid adieu to a Fond partner & Family. Let Our youth look up to This Man as a pattern to form themselves by, who Unites the bravery of the Soldier, with the most consummate Modesty & Virtue. I will say no more. You will hear of other regulations soon, I hope to Satisfaction. I know You will shew this Letter to Freinds, remember my former Caution, and let No Extracts escape You.

The subject is delicate, & on it am silent but do believe that an Adjournment if any take place will undoubtedly be for Hartford. Mr. Lynch of South Carolina desired Me this Day to engage him Lodgings, for himself, Lady & Daughter, near Hartford, Conditionally. I told him I would procure him an house in Wethersfeild which would be more agreeable to him, if We went that Way. The Members talk more, & more, every Day, of a removal to Connecticut. Should it take place, will give Timely Notice for due preparation in Hartford and Wethersfeild. Probable it is indeed to Me. & I think it  Necessary, & shall in due Time move it That a part of the Congress remove to Hartford as a Committee of the whole to direct & superintend the movements. Should a Number of the Rifle Men described in my last pass You in their Way for Boston do not be Affrighted. I see that the Wethersfeild Company under Capt. Chester appeared with honor on a late Occasion, this has made me an Inch Taller, Though I am prouder as I may say of Connecticut than I dare express, not a Colony on the Continent Standing in higher estimation among the Colonies. Politics engross every thing, private Business is at an end in Comparison.

We are now at Liberty further to Acquaint your honor that the Congress have appointed Colo Washington of Virginia to be General of the Continental Army. He is a Gentn highly Esteemed for his Military & other Accomplishments to that Important Command, We Esteem him well Adapted to please A New England Army and much better JUNE 16, 1775  Suited to the Temper & Genius of our People than any other Gent not brought up in that Part of the Country. We have no doubt but that he will render himself very Agreable & Acceptable to all.

The Continent is really in earnest in defending the Country.

Kent, Swift, Tudor, Dr. Cooper, Dr. Winthrop, and others wrote me often, last Fall--not a Line from them this Time. I have found this Congress like the last.

Suspicions were entertained of Designs of Independency--an American Republic--Presbyterian Principles --and twenty other Things. Our Sentiments were heard in Congress, with great Caution--and seemed to make but little Impression: but the longer We sat, the more clearly they saw the Necessity of pursuing vigorous Measures. It has been so now. Every Day We sit, the more We are convinced that the Designs against Us, are hostile and sanguinary, and that nothing but Fortitude, Vigour, and Perseverance can save Us. But America is a great, unwieldy Body. Its Progress must be slow. It is like a large Fleet sailing under Convoy. The fleetest Sailors must wait for the dullest and slowest.

You have by this conveyance two packets from the President of Congress; on the subject to which they relate I need make no Remarks. As it was found that you had made no Progress in raising men, the Congress have thought fit that the posts directed to be taken in our Government should immediately be occupied by the Troops of Connecticut which are ready for service and unemployed. We enclose you by order of the Congress a certified Copy of their Resolution on that Head.(2) Your great Complaint of the want of Money will I hope be soon removed. For your present satisfaction we have obtained Leave of the Congress to inform you that the general Committee of the whole Body have reported a resolution to emit in continental paper Currency a Sum not exceeding the Value of two millions of Spanish Dollars, for the Redemption of which all the Colonies are to be pledged. Upon Revolving the Object of this Resolution you will find to agree in the main point; the Stability of the Fund, with your own Judicious System, we hope soon to furnish you with the particulars of this important transaction. We are likewise at liberty to acquaint you that JUNE 17, 1775  the Congress have agreed to raise at the Continental expense a body of 15,000 men, 10,000 for the defence of the Massachusetts, and the remainder to be employed in New York for keeping open the communication between the Northern and Southern Colonies; and that Col. George Washington is appointed Captain-General and Commander-in-Chief of all the forces raised and to be raised in the common cause. You are under no further obligation of secrecy on those points than to prevent their being inserted with any newspaper, from which it is apprehended some prejudices might arise. The Letters for Governour Trumbull and General Wooster relate to the removal of the Connecticut Troops into our Government, and are to be forwarded with your Dispatches on that subject; but they are only from their Delegates, and not authoritative, the Congress having referred it to you to make the application to that Government.

You will hear that Coll Washington is Appointed Genll or Commander in Chief over the Continental Army by I dont know but the Universal Voice of the Congress. I believe he will be Very Agreable to our officers & Soldiery. He is a Gent. highly Esteemed by those acquainted with him, tho I dont believe as to his Military, & for real service he knows more than some of ours, but so it removes all jealousies, more firmly Cements the Southern to the Northern, and takes away the fear of the former lest an Enterprising eastern New England Genll proving Successfull, might with his Victorious Army give law to the Southern & Western Gentry. This made it absolutely Necessary in point of prudence, but he is Clever, & if any thing too modest. He seems discret & Virtuous, JUNE 17, 1775  no harum Starum ranting Swearing fellow but Sober, steady, & Calm. His modesty will Induce him I dare say to take & order every step with the best advice possible to be obtained in the Army. His allowance for Wages expences & every thing is we think very high, not less than £ 150 lawll per month,(1) but it was urged that the largeness of his family, Aide Camps, Secretary Servts &c, beside a Constant table for more or less of his officers, daily expresses, dispatches &c Must be very expensive.(2) There is an allowance of 63 doll[ar]s per month for his Secretary who is to be Considered as one of his (the Genlls) family, every way provided for by the Genll so as to have no expence for the Secretary. I have so without your knowledge or Consent been laying in for that birth for you. I first mentioned it to Mr Dean. He appeared ready & Chearfull to give all his assistance.(3) Mr Jno Adams & some others of Massachusetts I think they will favor it. Genll. Washington has been spoke to on the occasion, as I thot it would be a Clever genteel Birth, the Wages tollerable considering no expence for living. I believe you will much esteem him & believe he will be pleased with you. I dare say you may live Very happy with him. It is not Certain as yet it can be accomplished but if I knew it would be agreable I should leave no stone unturned to Accomplish it.

434,dg001446,1775,John Adams to Elbridge Gerry,"""John Adams to Elbridge Gerry   Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 18 June, 1775. I have at last obtained liberty, by a vote of Congress, to acquaint my friends with a few of the things that have been done. The Congress have voted, or rather a committee of the whole house have unanimously agreed, that the sum of two million dollars be issued in bills of credit, for the redemption of which, in a certain number of years, twelve colonies have unanimously pledged themselves.(1) The Congress has likewise resolved that fifteen thousand men shall be supported at the expense of the continent; ten thousand at Massachusetts, and five thousand at New York;(2) and that ten companies of riflemen be sent immediately, six from Pennsylvania, two from Maryland, and two from Virginia, consisting of sixty-eight privates in each company, to join our army at Boston. These are said to be all exquisite marksmen, and by means of the excellence of their firelocks, as well as their skill in the use of them, to send sure destruction to great distances. General Washington is chosen commander-in-chief, General Ward the first major-general, and General Lee the second, (the last has not yet accepted,) and Major Gates adjutant-general. Lee and Gates are experienced officers.(3) We have proceeded no further as yet. I have never, in all my lifetime, suffered more anxiety than in the conduct of this business. The choice of officers, and their pay, have given me great distress. Lee and Gates are officers of such great experience and confessed abilities, that I thought their advice, in a council of officers, might be of great advantage to us; but the natural prejudices, and virtuous attachment of our countrymen to their own officers, made me apprehensive of difficulties. But considering the earnest desire of General Washington to have the assistance of these officers, the extreme attachment of many of our best friends in the southern colonies to them, the reputation they would give to our arms in Europe, and especially with the ministerial generals and army in Boston, as well as the real American merit of them both, I could not withhold my vote from either. JUNE 18, 1775  The pay which has been voted to all the officers, which the Continental Congress intends to choose, is so large, that I fear our people will think it extravagant, and be uneasy.(4) Mr. Adams, Mr. Paine, and myself, used our utmost endeavors to reduce it, but in vain. Those ideas of equality, which are so agreeable to us natives of New England, are very disagreeable to many gentlemen in the other colonies. They had a great opinion of the high importance of a continental general, and were determined to place him in an elevated point of light. They think the Massachusetts establishment too high for the privates, and too low for the officers, and they would have their own way. I hope the utmost politeness and respect will be shown to these officers on their arrival. The whole army, I think, should be drawn up upon the occasion, and all the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war displayed;--no powder burned, however. There is something charming to me in the conduct of Washington. A gentleman of one of the first fortunes upon the continent, leaving his delicious retirement, his family and friends, sacrificing his ease, and hazarding all in the cause of his country! His views are noble and disinterested. He declared, when he accepted the mighty trust, that he would lay before us an exact account of his expenses, and not accept a shilling for pay. The express waits. MS not found; reprinted from Adams, Works (Adams), 9:357-59. 1 This measure was not adopted by vote of Congress until June 22. JCC, 2:103. 2 These resolves do not appear in the journals and were probably agreed to while Congress sat in the committee of the whole.

Riley who was present at it for a Volume would not describe it at large, with the queer figures of Mortality which any public Occasion here exhibits. You have often beheld a Gerrman Countenance and the lower order or Western Irish one, these made up so much the greater part of the Spectators, that a Lady of but tolerable Biauty JUNE 18, 1775  shone like a Starr in the midst of Universal Gloom surrounding. Genl. Washington sets out on Thursday this Week. I have a Strong Temptation to accompany him, quite to the Camp for I am more in danger of Death here (if it is an Evil to be dreaded) than in an ordinary battle. Yesterday I was at Com[mitte]e in State House at Six oClock,(1) took one Dish of Coffee, at Freind Marshalls. The Congress opened at Ten, & I never left the House untill Five in the After Noon. Eleven Hours at a Sitting is too much for My Constitution. It would be hard enough to attend the Congress Hours, but Comm[ittee]s take up all my spare Time. The Heat is extreme at present. This Morning (Sunday) I ordered up my Horses, & Col. Schuyler & I rode out as farr as the Falls at Schuylkill Five Miles & breakfasted. This proved a Cordial to Me, but Politics still attended for Our Ride was to Consult a plan We are forming for another bold Stroke like the Ticonderoga affair, & no sooner had We arrived than calling for Pens, Inks & paper We fell to planning & scribling, and cut out so much work that on Our return it has taken Us all Day to compleat it which We have just Now done, & sent off our Dispatches 2 oClock P.M. This Gentleman is the Soul of Albany County and tho' he may have foibles, he is sincere, wellbred, & resolute, and I think a Valuable acquaintance. Shew this Lettr to no Mortal. If Our plan is adopted & succeeds (for No Mortal as yet but he & myself are privy to it) you will hear of it--if it fail I will tell you of it hereafter.(2) Since the Affair at Ticonderoga, which is become my Nick Name at Times, people here, Members of the Congress, & others, have unhappily & erroniously, thought Me a Schemer. This has brought on Me rather more than my Share of Business out Doors at least in the Committee way. I find however that he that has the least to do in public affairs Stands the fairest Chance for happiness. If General Washington set out on Thursday, he will be in New York early on Saturday where affairs will doubtless detain him untill Monday, or Tuesday, & in that Case he will be with you on the Friday following. He is no lover of parade, so do not put yourself into distress if it happen Conveniently he will spend one Night with You; if not, just call and go on. Should he spend a Night his retinue will doubtless the Cheif of them go on to Hartford. As to an Adjournment it is still a Matter of doubt. I hear Mr. Henshaw is in Town, may write again by him. Tell Mr. Hosmer I received his favor of the 6th last Evening & will write to him by Henshaw. May add to this, if Not, farewell untill the Next Oppy. not one of which have I let Slip since my leaving home. I am my Dear Yours S D P.S. Love to all. Tell J Webb there is no Tinn in The City.

Don't forget Brother Buck, nor any of the Family. Saturday [i.e. Monday] Morning 5 oClock--after a few Hours restless tossing on my bed I am knocked up by Col. Schuyler to go on Business again, & having left my Letter unclosed, take up my pen, just to Tell You, that Mr. Hosmer and some others owe Me a Letter and that Our people [at the] Camp, are not careful to write Us the particulars of their Situation.

It has been determined in Congress, that the whole army raised for the defence of the American Cause shall be put under my care, and that it is necessary for me to proceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the Command of it. You may believe me my dear Patsy, when I assure you in the most solemn manner, that, so far from seeking this appointment, I have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it, not only from my unwillingness to part with you and the Family, but from a consciousness of its being a trust too great for my capacity and that I should enjoy more real happiness and felicity in one month with you, at home, that I have the most distant prospect of reaping abroad, if my stay were to be seven times seven years. But as it has been a kind of destiny, that has thrown me upon this service, I shall hope that my undertaking of it is designed to answer some good purpose. You might, and I suppose did perceive, from the Ten JUNE 18, 1775  or of my letters, that I was apprehensive I could not avoid this appointment, as I did not even pretend to intimate when I should return--that was the case--it was utterly out of my power to refuse this appointment without exposing my Character to such censures as would have reflected dishonor upon myself, and given pain to my friends. This, I am sure, could not, and ought not to be pleasing to you, and must have lessened me considerably in my own esteem. I shall rely therefore, confidently, on That Providence which has heretofore preserved, and been bountiful to me, not doubting but that I shall return safe to you in the fall. I shall feel no pain from the Toil or the danger of the Campaign. My unhappiness will flow, from the uneasiness I know you will feel from being left alone. I therefore beg of you to summon your whole fortitude and Resolution, and pass your time as agreeably as possible--nothing will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this, and to hear it from your own Pen. If it should be your desire to remove into Alexandria (as you once mentioned Upon an occasion of this sort) I am quite pleased that you should put it in practice, and Lund Washington may be directed by you, to build a Kitchen and other Houses there proper for your reception--if on the other hand you should rather Incline to spend good part of your time among your Friends below, I wish you to do so. In short, my earnest, and ardent desire is that you would pursue any Plan that is most likely to produce content, and a tolerable degree of tranquillity as it must add greatly to my uneasy feelings to hear that you are dissatisfied, and complaining at what I really could not avoid. As Life is always uncertain, and common prudence dictates to every Man the necessity of settling his temporal concerns while it is in his power--and while the mind is calm and undisturbed, I have, since I came to this place (for I had not time to do it before I left home) got Colonel Pendleton to Draft a Will for me by the directions which I gave him, which Will I now inclose. The Provision made for you, in case of my death, will, I hope, be agreeable; I have included the Money for which I sold my own land (to Doct'r. Mercer) in the Sum given you, as also all other Debts. What I owe myself is very trifling--Cary's Debt excepted, and that would not have been much if the Bank stock had been applied without such difficulties as he made in the Transference. I shall add nothing more at present as I have several Letters to write, but to desire you will remember me to Milly and all Friends, and to assure you that I am, with the most unfeigned regard, my dear Patsy, Yr Affect.

442,dg001454,1775,North Carolina Committees,"""North Carolina Committees   Philadelphia, June 19, 1775. To the COMMITTEES of the several Towns and Counties of the Province of NORTH-CAROLINA, appointed for the purpose of carrying into execution the Resolves of the Continental Congress; Gentlemen, When the liberties of a people are invaded, and men in authority JUNE 19, 1775  are labouring to raise a structure of arbitrary power upon the ruins of a free constitution, when the first minister of Britain exerts every influence that private address or public violence can give him, to shake the barriers of personal security and private property, it is natural for us, inhabitants of America deeply interested in the event of his designs, to be anxious for our approaching fate and to look up to the sources which God and the constitution furnish, to ward off or alleviate the impending calamity. Thus circumstanced, the inhabitants of the united American Colonies by their representatives, met in Congress at Philadelphia in September last, devised a plan of commercial opposition as a peaceful] expedient to bring about a reconciliation with the Parent State, upon terms constitutional and honourable to us both; a most humble and dutiful petition to the throne accompanied it, the first of these has not had sufficient time to work the effect proposed by it, the latter however flattered with a gracious reception upon the first introduction to the throne, was afterwards buried in a mass of useless papers upon the table of the House of Commons, and shared the common fate of American remonstrances and petitions, to be rejected and forgot. To the woeful catalogue of oppressions recited in the proceedings of the late Congress, are now superadded bills passed in Parliament for prohibiting the fishery of the New-England Colonies and restraining the trade of other Colonies to Great Britain, Ireland and the British West-Indies. The minister still continues to pour troops into the town of Boston, some have lately arrived and many more are hourly expected, thus reducing that once flourishing city to a garrison, dealing out from thence his instruments of tyranny and oppression to overawe and enslave the other Colonies: his designs have hitherto proved unsuccessful, heaven seems to have assumed the protection of the injured, insulted Colonists, and signally to have appeared in their favour when in the last battle at Lexington, six hundred raw, undisciplined provincials defeated eighteen hundred regular troops, and pursued them into their camp. No engagements are sufficiently sacred to secure the performance of them, when the fears or expectations of the General make it convenient for him to dispense with them; after the most solemn compacts to the contrary, the inhabitants of the town of Boston are doomed to suffer the most abject distress from the want of the common necessaries of life, confined within the walls of the city, and not permitted to seek a refuge amongst their neighbours in the country. These are the miseries which they suffer for their brave defence of the common cause of British America; they were destined as a first victim to ministerial tyranny; but Fellow Subjects, think not that his schemes are to end here; no, if success should strengthen his hands, the inhabitants of the Southern Colonies would soon feel the weight  of his vengeance. The Provinces of New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, and Connecticut, in imitation of their Massachusetts brethren, have enlisted bodies of troops, preparing for the last extremity, and determined to live free or not at all. New-York has, to the disgrace of those who would represent her as inimical to the liberties of America, boldly stood forth determined to brave every extremity, rather than submit to the edicts of the minister, or desert the protection of their constitutional rights and privileges. New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Provinces to the Southward have taken an honorable share in the line of defence, armed and equipped to avert the impending calamity, dreading a civil war as the most awful scourge of heaven, and to plunge their swords in the breasts of their fellow subjects, as the greatest of all human calamities, and the most painful exertions of human fortitude: but determined at all events, to suffer the excess of human misery rather than be brought to the feet of an insulting minister. North-Carolina alone remains an inactive spectator of this general defensive armament, supine and careless, she seems to forget even the duty she owes to her own local circumstances and situation; have you not, Fellow Citizens, a dangerous enemy in your own bosom and after the measures which the minister has condescended to in order to carry into execution his darling schemes, do you think he would hesitate to raise the hand of the servant against the master. Doctor Johnston, a pensioned tool of the ministry in a pamphlet entitled, Taxation no Tyranny, speaks the intentions of administration in a language too plain to leave any thing to doubt: \""The slaves should be set free, an act which the lovers of liberty must surely commend, if they are furnished with arms for defence and utensils for husbandry, and settled in some simple form of government within the country, they may be more honest and grateful than their masters,\"" are the words of this prostituted court-favorite. Have we not been informed that the Canadians are to be embodied, and the Indians bribed to ravage the frontiers of the Eastern Colonies? Has not General Carlton already given a specimen of his power by forming a Canadian Regiment of men inimical to our liberty and religion? Can you think that your province is the singular object of ministerial favour, and that in the common crush it will stand secure? Be assured it will not. The bait the minister has thrown out to you is a delusive one, it leads to distruction. Have you not by various public acts declared your resolution not be bound to ministerial shackles, but that you will live in a free constitution, or perish in the ruins of it? Do you imagine that after this you are his favourites? You are not. Do you ask why then you are exempted from the penalties of the bill restraining trade? The reason is obvious--Britain cannot keep up its naval force without you, you supply the very sinews  of her strength, restrain your naval stores, and all the powers of Europe can scarcely supply her; restrain them, and you strengthen the hands of America in the glorious contention for her liberty; through you the minister wishes to disunite the whole colonial link; we know your virtue too well to dread his success; you have the example of New-York to animate you, she spurns the proffered boon and views the exemption of that province from the restraining Bill as the smiles of a minister who looks graciously in her face while he stabs her to the heart. It becomes the duty of us, in whom you have deposited the most sacred trust, to warn you of your danger, and of the most effectual means to ward it off. It is the right of every English subject to be prepared with weapons for his defence; we conjure you by the ties of religion, virtue and love of your country, to follow the example of your sister colonies, and to form yourselves into a Militia; the election of the officers, and arangement of the men, must depend upon yourselves; study the art of military with the utmost attention; view it as the science upon which your future security depends. Carefully preserve the small quantity of gunpowder which you have amongst you; it will be the last resource when every other means of safety fails you; Great-Britain has cut you off from further supplies; we enjoin you, as you tender the safety of yourselves and fellow colonists, as you would wish to live and die free, that you would reserve what ammunition you have as a sacred deposit; he, in part, betrays his country who sports it away, perhaps in every charge he fires he gives with it the means of preserving the life of a fellow being. We cannot conclude without urging again to you the necessity of arming and instructing yourselves, to be in readiness to defend yourselves against any violence that may be exerted against your persons and properties. In one word, fellow subjects, the crisis of America is not at a great distance. If she falls, Britain must go hand in hand with her to destruction; every thing depends upon your present exertion, and prudent perseverence; be in a state of readiness to repell every stroke that through you must wound and endanger her; strengthen the hands of civil government; by resisting every act of lawless power; stem tyranny in its commencement; oppose every effort of an arbitrary minister, and by checking his licentiousness, preserve the liberty of the constitution, and the honour of your Sovereign; look to the reigning monarch of Britain as your rightful and lawful Sovereign; dare every danger and difficulty in support of his person, crown and dignity, and consider every man as a traitor to his King, who, infringing the rights of his American subjects, attempts to invade those glorious revolution principles which placed him on the throne, and must preserve him there.

I have been called upon by the unanimous Voice of the Colonies to the Command of the Continental Army. It is an honour I by no means aspired to--It is an honour I wished to avoid, as well from an unwillingness to quit the peaceful enjoyment of my Family as from a thorough conviction of my own Incapacity & want of experience in the conduct of so momentous a concern but the partiallity of the Congress added to some political Motives, left me without a choice. May God grant therefore that my acceptance of it may be attended with some good to the common cause & without Injury (from want of knowledge) to my own reputation. I can answer but for three things, a firm belief of the justice of our Cause--close attention in the prosecution of it--and the strictest Integrety. If these can not supply the places of Ability & Experience the cause will suffer, & more than probably my character along with it, as reputation derives its principal support from success--but it will be rememberd I hope that no desire, or insinuation of mine, placed me in this situation. I shall not be deprivd therefore of a comfort in the worst event if I retain a consciousness of having acted to the best of my judgment. I am at liberty to tell you that the Congress in Committee (which will, I dare say, be agreed to when Reported) have consented to a Continental Currency, and have ordered two Million of Dollars to be struck for payment of the Troops, and other expences arising from our defence--as also that 15,000 Men are voted as a Continental Army, which will I dare say be augmented as more Troops are Imbarkd & Imbarking for America than was expected at The time of passing that vote. As to other Articles of Intelligence I must refer you to the Gazettes as the Printers pick up every thing that is stirring in that way. The other officers in the higher departments are not yet JUNE 19, 1775  fixed--therefore I cannot give you their names. I set out tomorrow for Boston where I shall always be glad to hear from you.(1) My best wishes attend Mrs. Bassett--Mrs. Dandridge & all our Relations and friends.

I hope a good Account will be given of Gage, Haldiman, Burgoine, Clinton and How, before Winter. Such a Wretch as How, with a Statue in Honour of his family in Westminster Abby, erected by the Massachusetts to come over with a Design to cutt the Throats of the Mass-People, is too much. I most sincerely and cooly, and devoutly wish that a lucky Ball, or Bayonet may make a Signal Example of him, for a Warning to Such, unprincipled, unsentimental Miscreants for the future.(2) I think We shall have an ample Variety of able experienced officers in our Army. Such as may form Soldiers and officers, enough to keep up a Succession for the Defence of America for Ages. Our Camp will be an illustrious School of military Virtue and will be resorted to and frequented, by gentlemen in great Numbers, from the other Colonies as such.

You will have Lee, as third in Command, Ward being the second, Schuyler of New York the fourth, and Putnam the fifth.

Dismal Bugbears were raised, there were Prejudices enough among the weak and fears enough among the timid as well as other obstacles from the Cunning: but the great Necessity for officers of skill and Experience prevailed. I have never formed any Friendship or particular Connection with Lee, but upon the most mature Deliberation I judged him the best qualified for the Service, and the most likely to cement the Colonies, and therefore gave him my Vote, and am willing to abide the Consequences. I am much obliged to you for yours of June 11. Pray write me a State of the Army, their Numbers, and a List of the officers and the Condition of the poor People of Boston. My Heart bleeds for them. We have a great shew this Morning here. Our great Generals Washington and Lee review the three Battalions of this City. I believe there never was two thousand Soldiers created out of nothing so suddenly, as in this City. You would be surprised to behold them, all in Uniforms, and very expert both in the Manual and Maneuvres. They go through the Wheelings and Firings in sub-divisions, grand Divisions, and Platoons, with great Exactness. Our accounts from all Parts of the Continent are very pleasing. The Spirit of the People is such as you would wish. I hope to be nearer to you at least, very soon. How does your Government go on? If We have more bad News from England the other Colonies will follow your Example. My Love to all Friends. Yours John Adams ""

General Lee has accepted of his Appointment and will I suppose tomorrow set off with General Washington for Cambridge. The Congress seems determined to support their Army before Boston.

I heartily Wish, & have some reasons to hope this Congress after a few Days will move some where Nearer the Scenes of Action. We are Continually perplexed with New York. They must be saved if possable for the good of the whole. A few days ago we had very good Intelligence that about three Thousand of the Ministerial Troops were to come to New York. :We then thot it best to desire your Honor to send forward the Connecticutt forces near their border to New York, their Congress then desired it. This Day we have Intelligence that all the transports some of which were in sight of New York others at a small Distance were orderd directly to Boston, which Induces us to suppose a Capital Stroke will soon be given there, & that by this addition, with those expected at Boston to reenforce Genl Gage, Will make his Army somewhat formidable, & therefore our whole force ought to be collected near that Place, whereupon the request of this Congress (will Accompany this) to you for Colo Parsons Regiment Near New London, & indeed that all the Connecticutt forces Eastward, may be hastned to Boston with all possable expedition.(1) The Provincial Congress at New York upon Information from some Gent of the Navy there, that the transports coming into their Harbour were all ordered to Boston, Immediately as we understand sent Genl Wooster Not to come forward with his Troops, but this Congress Notwithstanding persist in their resolutions, that Genl Wooster with our Western forces go forward to New York as soon as possable as the Transports might just withdraw out of sight & finding no Provincial at York, return on a Sudden & git footing there; but that is not the only reason. Your Immagination I dare say will suggest others. We Informed you in our last that Colo Washington was Appointed General over the Army of the United Colonies Genl Ward the 2nd in Command Genl Lee the 3d. The two at this place will sit out in two or three Days to join their Army Near Boston. The Congress mean to proceed in the Appointment of General Officers, two More Major Genls. are Yet to be appointed and a Number Brigadier Genls, one Major General Will doubtless [be] of Connecticutt.(2) Thus far I may go but no further at Present. You will Sr now find that we have provided a Continental distination for the forces we have raised, which will bring them into Continental pay which was some Additional Motive with us, in Addition to the greater, Which the publick good and safety requireing it, there may be many things we cannot now explain but when we have the pleasure of waiting on your Honor in person may give a more perticular satisfaction as to many Parts of our Conduct.

I wrote you but a few days agoe that Coll Washington of Virginia was appointed General & Commander in Cheif of the Army of the United Colonies. I Imagine he will be Very agreable to the Genius & Climate of New England. Genll Ward is appointed first Maj. Genll. --Genll Lee the 2nd Maj. Genll or 3d in Command. Bridgdr Genll Putnam is also appointed Majr Genll. the Next in Command to Genll Lee.(1) His fame as a Warrior had been so far extended thro the Continent that it would be in Vain to Urge any of our Genll officers in Competition with him & he Carried by Universal Voice. Coll Schuyler of Albany is also appointed Majr Genll in York department to Sweeten, Add to, & keep up the spirit in that Province. One Majr Gates who has been long an Approved officer in the Regular Service & has a large & Valuable Interest & his whole in America & has an Established Carracter for his strong Attachment to this Country, he is appointed Agitant Genll. The Brigadier Genlls will soon be appointed of which we expect Genll Spencer to be one. Hope he will not make a point of Putnams preference.(2) In my last I wrote you I had made Application to Genll Washington in your behalf to be his Secretary. Mr Dean & Mr Sherman also joined with me. I also procured all the Gentn. of the Massachusett Bay to Confirm our recommendation all which believe will Succeed for your Appointment unless the Massachusett Gent. behind the Curtain have made Interest for some Other person which I ought not to Suspect.(3) I Imagined the birth would be agreable to you otherwise would not have Sollicited for you. The Wages I think are about £20 per month & being of the Genlls family you Cannot be at any expence for living at the best rate. I hope you will wait on him soon after his Arrival & let him know you was recommended to him by the JUNE 20, 1775  Massachusetts & Connecticutt Delegates or in any manner you see fit. If it is not agreable & you can avail your self of a more agreable birth nothing we have said lays you under any obligations but if you like your present Situation better or it should be more profitable or beneficial you will Conduct Accordingly. We expect you will soon have a Trial with Genll Gages reinforced Army. We understand all the Transports bound to New York are Ordered to Boston. When they Arrive with those expected for Boston (which has probably happened before this) & they are recruited I dare say they will make their most Violent Effort to disperse the Provincial Army. Coll Par son['s] Regiment is ordered to join you. About 12 hundred with Genll Wooster are ordered to York for more reasons than one. I hope & somewhat believe this Congress will soon Move Towards Connecticutt. If Necessary have wrote a small Introduction, wether it may be proper to Introduce your self by it or not must leave with you to determine. If you make use of it you will fold & direct it as proper.

I lament that Circumstances occurred at a former congress which rendered it inconvenient to me to pay you a visit in Boston. Difficulties insurmountable prevent it this [sic] I heard from Mrs Inman the other day that you had been indisposed. I sincerely regret it & wish that by any means in my power I could contribute to lessen the distress of your present Situation. I had been obliged to Mrs Inman if she had pointed out some means in which the endeavours of your Children could be made useful to you. I can answer for them and for myself that there is nothing within the compass of our poor abilities which you may not command. I should think it prudent for you to retire to some country farm at a distance from Boston where you might be in some degree retired from the bustle of the present day ill adapted to the delicacey of your frame & advanced state of life. It is impossible for me to give any consistent advice at this distance, unacquainted as I am with your present situation & the possibility of changing it for a better. I must wait till I hear from you or my Brother John & shall immediately give my aid to carry into Execution any plan which you may think most prudent for your & his Security and convenience.

I am long, and have been in the same state of uneasiness which you express. I will tell you some part of our doings which I am at liberty to communicate and which though you may have probably heard of it may be a satisfaction to have from me. By a grand Committee of the whole Congress two Resolutions have been formed, 1st, that 15,000 men be raised for the Defence and preservation of American Liberty. 10,000 whereof to be stationed near Boston and 5,000 in the City province of New York. 2nd, that two millions of Paper Dollars be struck for their support, to be sunk in the four last years of Seven by each province according to their respective Quotas which are not yet finally adjusted, and on Friday or Saturday last Coll. Washington was appointed General and Commander-in-chief, and will probably set off in four or five days for the Army. This is as far as I can go, and it may lead you to conjecture what is become of Lee and Major Gates. R.G., L. and J.H., have found excuses to go home.(1) They talked of returning, but we do not expect it. I have long flattered myself with JUNE 20, 1775  the hope of pacific measures that might avail something, but that hope has almost vanished. Some without Doors talk of sending some Body home. In my judgment 'tis the only step that affords the least glimmering of peace. It is thought Gen. Gage when the troops all arrived, will be 11 or 12,000 strong. The Provincials now have about 18,000. It is supposed they will not attack but it is generally thought that Gage will. Indeed from all circumstances I think it probable, and dreadful slaughter there will be. I wish I could have entertained you more agreeably, but I fear this is the subject on which we must speak and write for some time to come. May Heaven protect us. Pray don't fail mentioning the receipt of my letters. You do not in your last. Give my love to Peggy, and be assured that I remain, Most affectionately yours, Mat. Tilghman.

I have not been in Company with him yet, he looks like a very sensible spirited fine Fellow & by the Pamphlet which he wrote last Summer he certainly is one.(1) I have had the Pleasure of a Letter from you every Week save this since I have been here. I beg of you not to omit writing by every Post. I should be glad to know what was done at the last Assembly, and the Situation of the Colony in every Respect. What became of my Letter to you I cannot imagine, I have wrote you three before this & have recd. no Acknowledgment of any one of them; We wrote twice to the Depy. Govr. and have recd. no Answers: I have wrote to him again & for want of Time to write to you fully refer you to that Letter for all the news from the Congress. Mr. Hopkins was ill but a few Days & is bravely now, but Mrs. Hopkins was unwell on Tuesday, & yesterday kept her Chamber all Day & he was obliged to stay at home with her. I have not seen either of them this morning. Dr. Young had inoculated all his Family when I came into the City that I have seen but very little of him. He is gitting into Business fast. The general Estimate, Imports &c. which I wrote(2) for will be necessary now as it is agreed to make a Proportion according to the number of People,(3) but the act for raising our Men, Copies of Letters from the provincial Congress requesting us to raise them & the Accts. of the Comee. of War I still want. JUNE 22, 1775  A Resolution was passed this Week desiring that Conn [ecticu] t would send what Forces they have (not already employed) to Boston as soon as possible & Rhode Island & Newhampshire to send all they have raised also there.(4) By the best Accts. something of Consequence must soon be done there. Should We receive a Check all your Firmness will be necessary to keep up the Spirits of the Colony & I doubt not but you will exert every Nerve to do it. In no Case whatever can Submission be thought of, for Slavery is worse than all the Calamities of War & Death in any Shape whatever; what innumerable Losses and Distresses the Dutch suffered for years.

Conduct.(1) You will By this express receive a Letter from the President informing you of the appointment of General Washington & other General Officers, and by Unanimous Order of the Congress expressing the high sense they retain of your important Services to the United Colonies, at this critical period. In the arrangement of General Officers, the Character of General Putnam commanded every Vote for his Major General Ship, An Honor peculiar to the Commander in Chief & himself. We hope that his Appointment will give no Umbrage to General Wooster, or General Spencer as they are honorably provided for. We wish the prospect of a Supply of one Article was more favorable but from the large quantities in the West Indies hope for the best. The Article of Salt Petre is now under Consideration, and shall in a few Days be able to write at large on the Subject. The Account brought us by Mr Avery of the Action of the 17th has given us the greatest possable anxciety, as it leaves us in suspence & Uncertainty as to the event of so important an Action, and our receiving no further Advices has increased it greatly. By a Letter from Albany received Yesterday we are informed of the Defection of the Caughnawaga Indians effected by the presents JUNE 26, 1775  of Governor Carlton who is meditating hostilities. Are not some of their Children with Docr Wheelock? (2) If so may not some Advantage be taken of that Circumstance?

We should be happy would our Business admit of greater Dispatch. The Distance from Our Families & Friends, & from the great Scene of Action gives us uneasiness, and with respect to adjourning Nearer which has been repeatedly mentioned though a majority of Voices might [be] obtained, yet We conceive it to be too delicate a Subject for Us to urge on many and various Reasons. It is probable the Congress after finishing the more important Business before them will have a recess appointing a Committee of War or Safety to sit in the meanwhile. This Committee will undoubtedly be directed to remove as near the Scene of Action as Hartford.

477,dg001489,1775,Thomas Jefferson to Francis Eppes,"""Thomas Jefferson to Francis Eppes   Dear Sir Philadelphia June 26. 1775. You will before this have heard that the war is now heartily entered into, without a prospect of accomodation but thro' the effectual interposition of arms. General Gage has received considerable reinforcements, tho' not to the [wh]ole amount of what was expected. There has lately been an action at the outlet of the town of Boston. The particulars we have not yet been able to get with certainty. The JUNE 26, 1775  event however was considerably in our favor as to the numbers killed. Our account said we had between 40 and 70 killed and 140. wounded. The enemy had certainly 500. wounded and the same account supposes that number killed; but judging from the proportion of wounded and slain on our part, they should not have perhaps above [200 killed. This] happened on Saturd[ay, and] on Monday when the express came away the provincials had began to make another attack. Washington set out from here on Friday last as Generalissimo of all the Provincial troops in North-America. Ward and Lee are appointed major Generals, and Gates Adjutant. We are exceedingly anxious till we hear of their arrival at Boston, as it is evident to every one that the provincial encampment is the most injudicious that can possibly be conceived. For the sole purpose of covering two small towns near Boston they have encamped so near the line of the ministerial army that the centries may converse. Gage too being well fortified is in little danger of an attack from them, while their situation is such that he may attack them when he pleases, and if he is unsuccesful they cannot pursue him a foot scarcely, on account of the ships and floating batteries bearing on the neck of Boston. If no evil arises from this till General Washington arrives we may expect to hear of his withdrawing the provincial troops to a greater distance. The Congress have directed 20,000 men to be ra [ised] and hope by a vigorous campaign to dispose our enemies to treaty. Governor Carleton has been spiriting up the Canadian Indians to fall on our back settlements but this we hope will be prevented. Governor Skeene appointed [to] take charge of the fortresses on [the] lakes was intercepted here, and as we had already taken poses[sion] of those fortifications and provided a governor there was no occasion for him to proceed. He is now therefore our prisoner. My best affections attend Mrs. Eppes and family, and am Dr. Sir Your friend & servt, Th: Jefferson ""

The last Fall, I had a great many Friends who kept me continually well informed of every Event as it occurred. But, this Time, I have lost all my Friends, excepting Coll Warren of Plymouth and Coll Palmer of Braintree, and my Wife. JUNE 27, 1775  Our dear Warren has fallen, with Laurills on his Brows, as fresh and blooming, as ever graced an Hero. I have Suffered infinitely this Time, from ill Health, and blind Eyes at a Time when, a vast Variety of great objects were crouding upon my Mind, and when my dear Country was suffering all the Calamities of Famine, Pestilence, Fire, and Sword at once. At this Congress We do as well as we can. I must leave it to some future opportunity, which I have a charming Confidence will certainly come, to inform you fully of the History of our Debates and Resolutions. Last Saturday night at Eleven O Clock, an express arrived from the worthy Govr. Trumbull, informing of the Battle of Charleston. An hundred Gentlemen flocked to our Lodgings to hear the News. At one O Clock Mr H[ancock] Mr A[dams] and myself went out to inquire after the Committee of this City, in order to beg some Powder. We found Some of them, and these with great Politeness, and Sympathy for their brave Brethern in the Mass. agreed, to go that night and send forward about Ninety Quarter Casks, and before Morning it was in Motion. Between two and three O Clock I got to bed. We are contriving every Way we can think of to get you Powder. We have a Number of Plans for making Salt Petre and Gentlemen here are very confident, that We shall be able to furnish Salt Petre and Powder of our own Manufacture, and that very soon. A Method of making it, will be published very soon by one of our Committees.(1) Before this reaches you, Gen. Washington, Lee. &c will arrive among you. I wish to god, you had been appointed a General officer, in the Room of some others. Adams and Adams strove to get it done. But, Notions, narrow Notions prevented it--not dislike to you, but fear of disobliging Pomroy, and his Friends. Your Govt. was the best We could obtain for you. We have passed some Resolutions concerning North Carolina, which will do a great deal of good. We have allowed them to raise 1000 Men, and to take Care of Trayters, if necessary. This must be kept Secret.(2) We are sending you, Ten Companies of Rifle Men. These, if the Gentlemen of the Southern Colonies are not very partial and much mistaken, are very fine fellows. They are the most accurate Marksmen in the World: they kill with great Exactness at 200 Yards Distance: they have Sworn certain Death to the ministerial officers. May they perform their oath. You will soon find that the Continental Congress are in deep enough. The Commissions to the officers of the Army; the Vote for your Government; the Votes about North Carolina; and a Multitude of other Votes which you will soon hear of will convince you. I have inclosed you an Hint about Salt Petre. Germans and others  here have an opinion that every stable, Dove house, Cellar, Vault &c is a Mine of Salt Petre. The inclosed Proclamation coincides with this opinion. The Mould under Stables &c may be boiled soon into salt Petre, it is said. Numbers are about it here. ""

That British America is not represented in the British Parliament, JUNE 27, 1775  and consequently its consent not involved in the Acts of that Assembly, is too true to admit of doubt, too certain to be contested. But to obviate this argument Administration say, many in England are not represented and yet they are bound by Acts of the British Parliament concluding that because the representation of England is imperfect therefore the people of America must not be represented at all and by fallacious kind of logic, reasoning from the existence to the infinite extention of evil. In prosecution of this new scheme of taxation a system of Statutes and regulations has taken place by which the trial by Jury is abolished; the oppressive powers of excise extended to all cases of revenue; the sanctuary of private houses exposed to violation at the pleasure of every Officer and Servant of the customs; the dispensation of justice corrupted by making Judges totally dependant on the Crown; life and liberty rendered precarious by supposed Offenders being liable to be transported over the Ocean to be tried for treason or felony, whereby the condemnation of the most innocent may follow from distance, want of evidence, money and friends; the profligate encouraged to shed the blood of the people by a mode of trial offering in demnity to the murderer; the Capital of one Colony condemned without being heard to most unequal punishment, involving with unexampled rigor the innocent and the guilty in the same undistinguished ruin; that great palladium of English liberty the Habeas Corpus Act suppressed; Charterd rights taken away without forfeiture proved and a new form of government established to prevent legal efforts against the despotism of wicked Rulers; the antient limits of Canada extended over immense regions bordering on the frontiers of all the Colonies and Arbitrary government created there, as well by immediate exertions as by future efforts to banish liberty with all its attendant virtues from this great Continent; and finally a fleet and army sent to execute these oppresive edicts. In this state of unparalled abuse the people of America, by their Representatives in Congress Septemr 1774 presented a petition to his Majesty so full of duty, loyalty, and affection; so full of humble desires \""of peace liberty and safety\"" as malice itself could not except against. The world will judge, what more could be done on this side the Atlantic to soften the rigor of authority and appease the rage of despotic Ministers, unless we had tamely surrendered our lives, liberty, and property into the hands of Administration, thereby rendering ourselves unworthy of the British Ancestry and undeserving the rights of men, by betraying the dignity of human nature. The duty of a British Minister should lead him to protect the just rights of the Subject in every part of the Empire, but the present Administration at variance with freedom in every Clime equal foes to British and American rights, under the fatal guidance of a Favorite at enmity with the glorious constitu-  tion of England, that work of Ages and admiration of surrounding nations instead of redressing grievances of such magnitude and so justly complained against, proceed to bitter declarations of rebellion, determination to subdue by force and increasing Armies in North America have at length drawn the Sword of violence to ravage this Country, burn houses, and destroy his Majesties faithful American subjects. When Ministry charge millions of people with cowardice faction and rebellion, it necessarily leads to reflect how extensive must be the abuse, and how different the present from former ad ministrations, which has worked so wonderful a change in a whole nation, acknowledged frequently by the parent State, to be a brave, loyal, and useful people. Equally unjust is the charge of refusing to support civil government and the administration of justice, and denying contribution to the necessary expence of protection and defence. We have already declared \""that such provision has been and will be made for defraying the two first articles, as has been and shall be judged, by the Legislatures of the several colonies just and suitable to their respective circumstances.\"" And the journals of Parliament shew that in time of war our Aids have been admitted to transcend our abilities. In times of peace justice and magnanimity will be content with the immense profits derived from our confined commerce, establishing so grievious a monopoly of our imports, and of our great staple commodities of exportation, as to impoverish us in proportion as it enriches Great Britain. A Monopoly that annually fixes so large a ballance against these Colonies, as to preclude, without great oppression the payment of fixt revenue, added to the necessary support of our respective civil establishments, and other large contingent expences. Whenever it shall be thought proper to indulge us with a Trade a [s] extensive as you our fellow subjects possess, we shall then, provided with the means of procuring wealth, freely contribute at all tim[es] our full proportion to the expences of the Empire. The injurious and unaccommodating intentions of our Ministerial enemies are fully manifested by a plan of conciliation (as it is called) so inconsistent with its avowed design, as to be incapable of deceiving the most unthinking; for when the Americans, upon constitutional ground, claim a right of being concerned in the disposal of their own property; Administration after various and violent attempts to destroy this claim, propose to conciliate, by [retaining?] a power of controuling both the sum and its application; leaving the injured American the wretched choice of payment, or of punishment in case of refusal. Unprejudiced Men will determine whether this plan is intended to conciliate, or by insulting the understanding to convert dissatisfaction into despair. It appears by the conduct of Administration upon our humble petition for peace presented unto his Majesty and the demands they make; that the design which hath for sometime  been carried on to alter the frame and constitution of these Colonies, is now come to ripeness; and the Contrivers of it conceive themselves arrived to that condition of strength, that they shall be able to put it into present execution. For what else can be signified by an unprovoked declaration of rebellion by the Commander of the British forces, after having converted the large and flourishing Town of Boston into a Military Garrison, marching into the Country, slautering the inhabitants, burning their houses, and ravaging all before him? Necessity hath therefore brought on this Congress and possessed it with the power of acting with more vigor and resolution than former Congresses had done, nor do the principles of Self preservation longer permit us to neglect providing a proper defence to prevent the pernicious practices of wicked men and evil Counsellors, alike enemies to the religion, laws, rights, and liberties of England and America. How necessary this was to be done, is sufficiently manifest from the designs and attempts of the despotic Governor of Canada to march an army of Canadians and Savages into these Colonies. Great cause therefore hath all good men to bless God, who put it into the heads and hearts of our Countrymen to possess themselves of the fortresses of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and to make themselves Masters of those Lakes that cover the frontiers of many Colonies, and secure them from such cruel and wicked designs. For were these bad Ministers to succeed in their evil intentions and put North America in slavery, it is not difficult to foresee with what ease they might afterwards master the liberties of Great Britain. In this state of extreme danger to the British Empire, we have once more implored our common Sovereign to save the whole from the meditated ruin of his Ministers, and by redressing the unmerited grievances of his faithful American Subjects, restore peace to his afflicted people. We call God to witness, that it is the earnest wish of our hearts to be firmly united with you on the broad basis of civil and religious liberty equally extended to all the subjects of this great empire. And we earnestly entreat your powerful aid may be interposed to calm the distractions, and quiet the apprehensions, by removing the grievances of British America. We shall then with joy behold the return of those halcyon days, when peace, happiness, and flourishing Commerce, established the glory, strength, and safety of the British empire. ""

I cannot but be greatly rejoyced at the tryed Valor of our Countrymen, who by all Accounts behavd with an Intrepidity becoming those who fought for their Liberties against the mercenary Soldiers of a Tyrant. It is painful to me to reflect upon the Terror I must suppose you were under on hearing the Noise of War so near you. Favor me, my dear, with an Account of your Apprehensions at that time, under your own hand. I pray God to cover the heads of our Countrymen in every day of Battle, and ever to protect you from Injury in these distracted Times. The Death of our truly amiable and worthy Friend Dr Warren is greatly afflicting. The Language of Friendship is, how shall we resign him! But it is our Duty to submit to the Dispensations of Heaven, \""Whose Ways are ever gracious, ever just.\"" He fell in the glorious Struggle for the publick Liberty. Mr Pitts and Dr. Church inform me that my dear Son has at length escapd from the Prison of Boston.

484,dg001496,1775,Samuel Adams to James Warren,"""Samuel Adams to James Warren   My dear Sir Philadelphia June 28 1775 I have received your Letter of the 21 Instant and am beyond Measure rejoycd at the tryed Bravery of the American Troops in Charles town. I hope speedily to receive a particular & exact Account of the killed and wounded on both sides. If the List on the side of the ministerial Army comes near to 1000, as seems to be the general opinion it may cool the Courage of the three Generals lately arrivd; of the Courage of Gage I have been taught to entertain no opinion. I find by the Letters from our Friends that a Suspicion prevails of the Courage Activity or military Knowledge of some of our Generals. But my dear Sir take Care lest Suspicions be carried to a dangerous Length. Our Army have behaved valiantly. There may have been an Error, but that Error may have proceeded not from a Want of Spirit but a Want of Judgment. We have appointed the Generals you ask for. Preserve that Union upon which every thing we wish for depends. The Experience of Washington & Lee may make good all Deficiencies. Why should any of our Friends hesitate about the propriety of giving a Command to Genl Lee? He was not born an American, but he has heartily espousd the Cause of America and abhors the oppressive Measures of the British Government against America. Prince Eugine, if I mistake not was a Frenchman but he was a Scourge to France, and Marshall Saxe would have been equally, perhaps more so, if Great Britain had not foolishly slighted his offerd Service. Admitting his Integrity, of which I cannot doubt, I think the sound Policy of appointing General Lee is evident. Other English officers may from hence be assurd that if they will afford a sufficient Pledge of their Merit they may have the opportunity of distinguishing their Valor in the Cause of Liberty in America. So desirous was the Congress, that this Country should avail it self of the Abilities of Lee, that they have voted to indemnify him for the Loss of property he may incurr by engaging in this Service to the amount of £11000 Sterling, being the Estimate of his Estate in England, as soon as it shall be made to appear that such Loss or any part of it hath happened.(1) This I think interrests him strongly, and I mention it, by no means that it should be made publick, for I think that would be imprudent, but to induce our Circle of Friends with the greater Chearfulness to reconcile his Appointment to any, if such there be, who have any Scruples about it. I sincerely lament the Loss of our truly amiable & worthy Friend Dr Warren. There has scarcely if ever been a Cause so evidently just as that in which he fell so gloriously. Pray write to me by every opportunity. I have not time to enlarge JUNE 28, 1775  or even to correct what I have written.

Sir Philadelphia 28 June 1775 Yesterday the Congress ordered Major Skeen (who has some time been Confined here within certain limits) to be sent to Hartford and confined to the limits of that Town on his parole of honor, not to depart nor hold correspondence with our Enemies, or Meddle in political Affairs. Also a resolve was passed to request your Honor on behalf of the Colony to Supply General Schuyler with such sums of Money, and Quantities of Ammunition as he may apply for, and can be furnished by the Colony.(1) It is supposed that he wont have occasion for more than £20,000 in Bills of Credit of our Colony, if so much, to be repaid by the Continent. We were not able to Inform what some of Money was in our Treasury but thought it probable he might be furnished with what is necessary. I am most of all concerned about a Supply of Gun Powder our Colony have taken Such an Active part, that I should not think it strange if Some Attack should be made upon it, and it wont be safe to be destitute of Am- JUNE 28, 1775  munition. I am affraid that our stores are two much exhausted already. Care has been taken by our Enemies to prevent our being supplyed [by] the Dutch or Danes, in the West Indies. It is probable General Schuyler may indertake some important enterprise which I wish to have the Colony afford him all possable Assistance. I wish to be informed of the arrival of any Supplies of Powder in any of the New England Governments. I dont know whither your Honr has been informed who are appointed General Officers in the Continental Army. All Officers below the rank of a Brigadier are left to the appointment of the Several Colonies but their Commissions to be signed by the President of this Congress. The Congress have appointed four Major Generals viz, Artemus Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler and Israel Putnam; and Eight Brigadiers viz Colo Pomroy Colo Montgomery of New York, General Wooster, Colo Heath, Colo Spencer, Colo Thomas of Massachusetts, Major Sullivan of New Hampshire, Mr Green Rhode Island. They were Elected by Ballot in the order above. We informed who were appointed in Connecticut and in what Order, and the Rank they had before Sustained in the Army, but General Putnam had rendred himself famous by his Intrepidity and especially in the late Action at Noddle's Island so that the Election was unanimous. An Ajutant General is appointed from Virginia. I forget his Name. The Chief General is allowed 3 Aid De Camps and each Major General 2. Their pay is 33 Dollars per Month, the Persons to be appointed by the Generals respectively. I have not seen all the Letters wrote by Colo Dyer & Mr Dean to your Honour.

The controversy between Great Britain and the Colonies has been carried to greater extremity than I expected but I have now no expectation that the Ministry will relax their Measures unless they are convinced that they cannot carry them into Execution. The Salvation of the Colonies under Divine Providence depends upon their united and Vigorous application to Arms, that is the only conciliatory Plan that appears to me likely to prove Successful, or at least without which no other will have any effect.

To an infant Country, it is loss indeed, to be deprived of wise, virtuous, and brave Citizens. I hope however, still to hear, that our Enemies have lost Characters very useful to them. We received the account of this engagement late on Saturday evening last, and a few of us immediately applied to, and prevailed with the Committee of this City, to dispatch 90 odd quarter Casks of powder to the Camp, which I hope will arrive safe and in good time. We are this day informed in Congress that the six Nations and Canada Indians are firmly disposed to observe a strick neutrality, and I think we shall endeavor to cultivate their friendship. The Congress has been engaged these two days about the mutiny and military regulations, and at last we shall adopt those of Massachusetts with very few alterations.(1) You will see that we have again taken up the business of entering Canada, and have left the propriety of it to Gener. Schuyler. If it can be done, in a manner agreeable to the Canadians, it will certainly shut the door against dangerous tampering with the Indians on all our Western frontiers.

It is no wonder they did so, with superior numbers, ships of war, floating batteries, and field artil- lery. Their loss has certainly been very great, and now they dare not go from under protection of their ships cannon. Our army now before Boston amounts to about 15,000 effective men, commanded by generals Washington, Ward, Lee, Putnam, Gates of Berkeley, with several brigadiers. In New York, we have now about 4000; and they are to be increased to 5000, under the immediate command of general Schuyler. The Canadians absolutely refuse to join Carleton, and the Indians assure US they will observe a strict neutrality. Thus, we seem to be well secured in the north against ministerial madness. A faithful observance of the association with us will surely rouse the sleeping lion ere long, and bring exemplary punishment on the most abandoned ministry that ever abused mankind and disgraced human nature. Sir William Meredith has cheated the Liverpool-men, and they are sending out goods as usual; but all their ships, yet arrived, have been sent back. It will be necessary, however, to keep a good look-out, to prevent their slipping in through other doors less attentively watched than this place, and Charlestown in South-Carolina. We are here confined to a constant and painful attendance on business, from 9 in the morning, to 4, 5, and sometimes 6, in the afternoon; and, what is more, have not the most distant prospect of rising yet.

493,dg001505,1775,Benjamin Franklin s Vindication,"""Benjamin Franklin's Vindication   [June-July ? 1775] (1) Forasmuch as the enemies of America in the Parliament of Great Britain, to render us odious to the nation, and give an ill impression of us in the minds of other European powers, have represented us as unjust and ungrateful in the highest degree; asserting, on every occa- JUNE 30, 1775  sion, that the colonies were settled at the expense of Britain; that they were, at the expense of the same, protected in their infancy; that they now ungratefully and unjustly refuse to contribute to their own protection, and the common defence of the nation; that they aim at independence; that they intend an abolition of the Navigation Acts; and that they are fradulent in their commercial dealings, and purpose to cheat their creditors in Britain, by avoiding the payment of their just debts; And, as by frequent repetition these groundless assertions and malicious calumnies may, if not contradicted and refuted, obtain further credit, and be injurious throughout Europe to the reputation and interest of the confederate colonies, it seems proper and necessary to examine them in our own just vindication. With regard to the first, that the colonies were settled at the expense of Britain, it is a known fact, that none of the twelve united colonies were settled, or even discovered, at the expense of England. Henry the Seventh, indeed, granted Commission to Seastrand Sabot, a Venetian, and his sons, to sail into the western seas for the discovery of new countries; but it was to be \""suits eom propels sumptuous et expenses,\"" at their Own costs and charges.* They discovered, but soon slighted and neglected these northern territories; which were, after more than a hundred years' dereliction, purchased of the natives, and settled at the charge and by the labor of private men and bodies of men, our ancestors, who came over hither for that purpose. But our adversaries have never been able to produce any record, that ever the Parliament or government of England was at the smallest expense on these accounts; on the contrary, there exists on the journals of Parliament a solemn declaration in 1642, (only twenty-two years after the first settlement of the Massachusetts, when, if such expense had ever been incurred, some of the members must have known and remembered it,) \""That these colonies had been planted and established without any expense to the state.\""® New York is the only colony in the founding of which England can pretend to have been at any expense; and that was only the charge of a small armament to take it from the Dutch, who planted it. But to retain this colony at the peace, another at that time full as valuable, planted by private countrymen of ours, was given up by the crown to the Dutch in exchange, viz. Surinam, now a wealthy sugar colony in * See the Commission in the Appendix to PORTALS Administration of the Colonies. Edition 1775. \"" Veneers, March 10th, 1642. Whereas, the plantations in New England have, by the blessing of the Almighty, had good and prosperous success, without any public charge to this state, and are now likely to prove very happy for the propagation of the Gospel in those parts, and very beneficial and commodious to this kingdom and nation; the Commons now assembled in Parliament, &c. &c. &c.\""  Guiana, and which, but for that cession, might still have remained in our possession. Of late, indeed, Britain has been at some expense in planting two colonies, Georgia and Nova Scotia; but those are not in our confederacy; and the expense she has been at in their name has chiefly been in grants of sums unnecessarily large, by way of salaries to officers sent from England, and in jobs to friends, whereby dependants might be provided for; those excessive grants not being requisite to the welfare and good government of the colonies, which good government (as experience in many instances of other colonies has taught us) may be much more frugally, and full as effectually, provided for and supported. With regard to the second assertion, that these colonies were pro tested in their infant state by England, it is a notorious fact, that, in none of the many wars with the Indian natives, sustained by our infant settlements for a century after our first arrival, were ever any troops or forces of any kind sent from England to assist us; nor were any forts built at her expense, to secure our seaports from foreign invaders; nor any ships of war sent to protect our trade, till many years after our first settlement, when our commerce became an object of revenue, or of advantage to British merchants; and then it was thought necessary to have a frigate in some of our ports, during peace, to give weight to the authority of custom-house officers, who were to restrain that commerce for the benefit of England. Our own arms, with our poverty, and the care of a kind Providence, were all this time our only protection; while we were neglected by the English government; which either thought us not worth its care, or, having no good will to some of us, on account of our different sentiments in religion and politics, was indifferent what became of us. On the other hand, the colonies have not been wanting to do what they could in every war for annoying the enemies of Britain. They formerly assisted her in the conquest of Nova Scotia. In the war before last they took Louisburg and put it into her hands. She made her peace with that strong fortress, by restoring it to France, greatly to their detriment. In the last war, it is true, Britain sent a fleet and army, who acted with an equal army of ours, in the reduction of Canada; and perhaps thereby did more for us, than we in the preceding wars had done for her. Let it be remembered, however, that she rejected the plan we formed in the Congress at Albany, in 1754, for our own defence, by a union of the colonies; a union she was jealous of, and therefore chose to send her own forces; otherwise her aid to protect us was not wanted. And from our first settlement to that time, her military operations in our favor were small, compared with the advantages she drew from her exclusive commerce with us. We are, however, willing to give full weight to this obligation; and, as we are daily growing stronger, and our assistance to her becomes of more  importance, we should with pleasure embrace the first opportunity of showing our gratitude by returning the favor in kind. But, when Britain values herself as affording us protection, we desire it may be considered, that we have followed her in all her wars, and joined with her at our own expense against all she thought fit to quarrel with. This she has required of us; and would never permit us to keep peace with any power she declared her enemy; though by separate treaties we might well have done it. Under such circumstances, when at her instance we made nations our enemies, whom we might otherwise have retained our friends, we submit it to the common sense of mankind, whether her protection of us in these wars was not our just due, and to be claimed of right, instead of being received as a favor? And whether, when all the parts of an empire exert themselves to the utmost in their common defence, and in annoying the common enemy, it is not as well the parts that protect the whole, as the whole that protects the parts? The protection then has been proportionably mutual. And, whenever the time shall come, that our abilities may as far exceed hers, as hers have exceeded ours, we hope we shall be reasonable enough to rest satisfied with her proportionable exertions, and not think we do too much for a part of the empire, when that part does as much as it can for the whole. The charge against us, that we refuse to contribute to our own protection, appears from the above to be groundless; but we farther declare it to be absolutely false; for it is well known, that we ever held it as our duty to grant aids to the crown, upon requisition, towards carrying on its wars; which duty we have cheerfully complied with, to the utmost of our abilities; insomuch that frequent and grateful acknowledgements thereof, by King and Parliament, appear on the records.* But, as Britain has enjoyed a most gainful monopoly of our commerce; the same, with our maintaining the dignity of the King's representative in each colony, and all our own separate establishments of government, civil and military; has ever hitherto been deemed an equivalent for such aids as might otherwise be expected from us in time of peace. And we hereby declare, that on a reconciliation with Britain, we shall not only continue to grant aids in time of war, as aforesaid; but, whenever she shall think fit to abolish her monopoly, and give us the same privileges of trade as Scotland received at the union, and allow us a free commerce with all the rest of the world; we shall willingly agree (and we doubt not it will be ratified *Supposed to allude to certain passages in the journals of the House of Commons on the 4th of April 1748; 28th of January, 1756; 3d of February, 1756; 16th and 19th of May, 1757; 1st of June 1758; 26th and 30th of April, 1759; 26th and 31st of March, and 28th of April, ;760; 9th and 20th of January, 1761; 22d and 26th of January, 1762; and 14th and 17th of March, 1763. B[enjamin] V[aughan].  by our constituents) to give and pay into the sinking fund [one hundred thousand pounds] sterling per annum for the term of one hundred years; which duly, faithfully, and inviolably applied to that purpose, is demonstrably more than sufficient to extinguish all her present national debt; since it will in that time amount, at legal British interest, to more than [two hundred and thirty millions of pounds.] ® But if Britain does not think fit to accept this proposition, we, in order to remove her groundless jealousies, that we aim at independence, and an abolition of the Navigation Act, (which hath in truth never been our intention,) and to avoid all future disputes about the right of making that and other acts of regulating our commerce, do hereby declare ourselves ready and willing to enter into a covenant with Britain, that she shall fully possess, enjoy, and exercise that right, for an hundred years to come; the same being bond fide used for the common benefit; and, in case of such agreement, that every Assembly be advised by us to confirm it solemnly by laws of their own, which, once made, cannot be repealed without the assent of the crown. The last charge, that we are dishonest traders, and aim at defrauding our creditors in Britain, is sufficiently and authentically refuted by the solemn declarations of the British merchants to Parliament, (both at the time of the Stamp Act and in the last session,) who bore ample testimony to the general good faith and fair dealing of the Americans, and declared their confidence in our integrity; for which we refer to their petitions on the journals of the House of Commons. And we presume we may safely call on the body of the British tradesmen, who have had experience of both, to say, whether they have not received much more punctual payment from us, than they generally have from the members of their own two Houses of Parliament. On the whole of the above it appears, that the charge of ingratitude towards the mother country, brought with so much confidence against the colonies, is totally without foundation; and that there is much more reason for retorting that charge on Britain, who, not only never contributes any aid, nor affords, by an exclusive commerce, any advantages to Saxony, her mother country; but no longer since than in the last war, without the least provocation, subsidized the King of Prussia while he ravaged that mother country, and carried fire and sword into its capital, the fine city of Dresden! An example we hope no provocation will induce us to imitate. ® See DR. PRICE'S Apeal on the National Debt. B[enjamin] V[aughan].  MS not found; reprinted from Benjamin Franklin, The Works of Benjamin Franklin . . ., ed. Jared Sparks, 10 vols. (Boston: Hilliard, Gray, and Co., 1836 40), 5:83-90. 1 Although this document was identified as the work of Benjamin Franklin when it was first published by Benjamin Vaughan in the Public Advertiser, July 18, 1777, its purpose and origin remain obscure. Vaughan asserted that it was drawn up in a Committee of Congress, June 25th, 1775, but does not appear on their Minutes; a severe act of Parliament, which arrived about that time, having determined them not to give the sum proposed.\"" And Jared Sparks, who reprinted it in 1838, noting that on June 25 \""Dr. Franklin was on a Committee for reporting to Congress a declaration to be published by General Washington, on his arrival in camp at Cambridge,\"" concluded that \""the discussion of that subject in the Committee may have suggested these remarks.\"" Ibid., 5:83. However, neither surmise is convincing, since on the one hand June 25 fell on a Sunday, and on the other, the substance of the \""vindication\"" bears little relation to the work of the committee appointed to prepare a statement to be read to the army upon Washington's assumption of command at Boston. Edmund C. Burnett suggested that since \""the question of colonial support of the mother country\"" was \""the principal point of discussion in the Vindication it may have been written in connection with the preparation of the answer to Lord North's conciliatory motion.\"" But since Congress learned officially on July 20 that Georgia had finally elected delegates who would soon take their seats, it seems unlikely that Franklin would have continued to refer to \""the twelve united colonies\"" in composing a document for a committee that was not appointed until July 22. And Burnett's final suggestion that \""possibly Franklin composed and circulated the 'Vindication' merely for the entertainment or enlightenment of his friends\"" is likewise flawed, because it rests upon a passage from an undated letter of Peter Collinson to Franklin once calendared under the date 1775 but obviously written several years earlier, as Collinson died in 1768. Burnett, Letters, 1:185n; and I. Minis Hays, ed., Calendar of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin in the Library of the American Philosophical Society, 5 vols. (Philadelphia: Printed for the American Philosophical Society, 1908), 4:402. Although the specific occasion for its composition remains unknown, there is no reason to doubt that it is the work of Franklin and represents the common concern that the American cause would be injured by unanswered allegations that Americans ignored their reciprocal obligations within the empire, were dishonest traders, and evaded the legitimate costs of their defense. Surely it was written before July 20, 1775, and may well have been stimulated by fears that Lord North's conciliatory proposals of February 20--which had been submitted to some colonial assemblies early in May and were formally laid before Congress on May 26--would find a favorable reception in the colonies. But it seems as much directed to a British as to an American audience and may well have been composed in consequence of the discussions that led Congress on June 3 to appoint committees to draft a petition to the king, an address to the people of Great Britain, an address to the people of Ireland, and a letter to the inhabitants of Jamaica. See JCC, 2:61-63, 79-80. For Franklin's early view of North's proposals, see his letter of February 25, 1775, to Joseph Galloway. Franklin, Writings (Smyth), 6:313-14. For evidence that Congress continued to be concerned about the impact of ministerial charges directed against American leaders, see JCC, 3:353, 392, 409-12, 455, 513.""

Docr. Franklin is with Us but he is not a Speaker tho' We have I think his hearty Approbation of & assent To every Measure. But, my Dear, Times like these call up Genius, which slept before, and stimulate it in action to a degree, that eclipses what might before have been fixed as a Standard. The Warr will not last Seven Years if I have any Judgment in Matters, and as to powder I hope the Measures we are taking will procure a supply, but I do not approve of wasting it on Batteries, Shipps &c, however much, I approve of & applaud the Bravery of Our Men. I hope Genl. Washington answered the Character I gave of him, I only wish he had a better regulated & provided Army to Command, but hope for the best, if We can worry them thro' this Campaign, resources will be procured or relief obtained. I have the fullest assurance that These Colonies will rise triumphant, & shine to the latest posterity, tho' trying Scenes are before Us which Our Wise Father is in Mercy exercising Us with at this Day. Towns wrapt in Flames, Garments roll'd in Blood, The Feilds of the husbandman loaded with Military preparation, & parade, & parents, Wives, Children, in anxious & soul torturing expectation for or weeping over the Fate of their dear Connections these are Scenes distressing, but they are Necessary for the good of the Whole, and it is for Us to encounter them with Chearfulness, & Alacrity.

It seems indeed as if Lord Dunmore was taking true pains to incur the censure of the whole reasonable world, conceiving, I suppose, that it is the most likely way to please his masters in the administration. The enclosed printed hand-bill will give you an account of a very bloody engagement between a detachment of the continental army and the ministerial forces from Boston.(1) Our enemies are compelled to remain under cover of their ship's cannon. Should they come out we have 15,000 men under command of Generals Washington, Ward, Lee, Putnam and others, ready to give a good account of them. The ministerial plan against New York we shall oppose with 5,000 men, under the immediate command of Gen. Schuyler. The Canadians (20 noblesse excepted) have peremptorily refused to join Gov. Carleton, and when he has warmly solicited the Indians to take up the hatchet against US they tell him it is buried too deep, they cannot find it. To us they promise a strict neutrality. Things being thus secured where our enemies proposed to make the deepest impression, it remains with us in the middle and southern colonies to take care that the association be faithfully observed, attend to military discipline, to the making of salt-petre for future supplies. These things, with the necessary application to manufactures, will prevent the powers of darkness from prevailing against us.... We just hear that thirteen transports are arrived at New York with about 2,000 soldiers and on their being ordered round to Boston, they meet and swear they will not go there to fight against their friends. Gen. Howe, who commanded the ministerial troops in the late battle, we have our accounts, is since dead of his wounds. He was, by much, the best officer they had. He came on this business much against his judgment, and died fighting against the country, that in honor of his brother's virtue, erected a splendid monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey. The Congress, I fear, will sit a great part of the summer. Business crowds, fast upon us, and the public here seems unwilling we should get up before it is known how the battle of Lexington was received in England. Yours obediently, Richard Henry Lee.

I am glad to hear that the Number of killed & wounded on the side of the Enemy amounts to so many more than 1000. I dare say you would not grudge them every last Hill near you upon the same Terms. A Gentleman of New York the Son of Mr. Phillip Livingston one of the Delegates from that place writes him that the Pilot who brot in the Nautil[us] Ship of War lately from Boston reports that he heard the officers on board frequently lament the Death of General Howe. If this be true I rejoyce in it, for that Man deservd to die for his Ingratitude. Indeed my Friend, your Cause here suffers by our not receiving more frequent and particular Accounts from you. The Delegates from the other three Colonies have better Intelligence of what is doing near Boston than your own. We know Nothing of the Disposition of the Army, not even who commanded in the late important Engagement. I know your hands are full of Business, but may not a Committee be appointed to collect and send to us material Intelligence. There is a regular Post but we hardly think it worth while to send a Servant to the office for Letters. I have a thousand things to say to you which I cannot write. Did I not flatter my self that we were doing essential Service to the common Cause, I would not tarry here a Moment. Some Matters are agreed to and many more talkd of which I know you will be pleasd with--but let me tell you that were you here your Patience wd be tried. It is not in the Power of Man to create Events. Our Business is to foresee as far as we are able prepare for and improve them. It is my opinion that great ones will be produced in a short time.

Since his Departure, we hear that Several Companies of expert Rifle men have marched from Virginia and Mariland; Six Companies from this Colony will march this week, to Join the Army before Boston. I have also the pleasure to inform you that the powder Mills are going on fast, haveing been Supplied- with several Tons of salt petre, the Manufactureing of which Article is like to meet with great Success, here, as also in Virginia and without doubt, in two or three months, will be able to furnish large quantities. We hear from South Carolina, that a Considerable quantity of powder was Arrived there, some of which will be immediately forwarded to Boston; this may be depended on. There has been within a few days, a Considerable quantity sent from this place to our Armies before Boston and Ticonderoga. Every method has been taken, and will Continue to be taken, for the importation of large supplies of that Necessary Article of powder, some of which hope will arrive soon. It is not likely that I shall be able to get Powder to send to our Province, as the whole will be in the hands of the Committee, to be sent from time to time to our army; therefore if any should be wanting for the Common Cause, no doubt it may be had from the [army] thence. I would here beg leave to Suggest, that we should not by any means, at Present, make use of Cannon, if it's Possable to avoid it, untill we are more fully suppli'd. The Assembly of this Province have voted to raise four thousand five hundred minute men; every measure seems to be takeing to defend our Just rights to the last extremity.

These Chimerical opinions have been propagated by the Rulers of that Colony, & have gained too ready a belief with men, who are not accustomed to speculate politically, or to look forward to what must be the necessary consequence if Great Britain should be able to enforce her Slavish tenets. The Men who have been most the dupes to the designs of Admin istration are the Inhabitants of the back parts of that Colony, a laborious hardy set of people who become formidable from that as well as their numbers, & should Govt have influence enough to draw them into action, might endanger [the] liberties of North Carolina & go far to defeat the plan of Opposition devised by the Continental Congress. Such a struggle would be productive of bloodshed & therefore loudly calls for the kind offices of the ministers of peace to prevent its baneful Consequences. The Pastoral Letter from the Synod of New York(2) speaks a lan- JULY 3, 1775  guage that will find a ready access to their hearts, and if accompanied with a letter stating more at large the nature of the continental opposition urging them to take an active share in behalf of America, & to submit themselves to these Regulations which the present unhinged state of the usual forms of Govt have rendered necessary substitutes for provincial Assemblie's, will effectually produce those happy purposes which it is the intention of this Application to obtain.

509,dg001521,1775,Thomas Jefferson to Francis Eppes,"""Thomas Jefferson to Francis Eppes   Dear Sir Philadelphia, July 4th, 1775. Since my last, nothing new has happened. Our accounts of the bat- JULY 4, 1775  tle of Charleston have become clear, and greatly to our satisfaction. Contrary to what usually happens, the first accounts were below truth; it is now certain that the regulars have had between 1200 and 1400 killed and wounded in that engagement, and that of these 500 are killed. Major Pitcairn is among the slain, at which everybody rejoices, as he was the commanding officer at Lexington, was the first who fired his own piece there and gave the command to fire. On our part were killed between 60 and 70, and about 150 wounded. Among those killed was a Dr. Warren, a man who seems to have been immensely valued in the North. The New Englanders are fitting out light vessels of war, by which it is hoped we shall not only clear the seas and bays here of everything below the size of a ship of war, but that they will visit the coasts of Europe and distress the British trade in every part of the world. The adventurous genius and intrepidity of those people is amazing. They are now intent on burning Boston as a hive which gives cover to regulars; and none are more bent on it than the very people who come out of it and whose whole prosperity lies there. This however, if done at all, it is thought better to defer till the cold season is coming on, as it would then lay them under irremediable distress. Powder seems now to be our only difficulty, and towards getting plenty of that nothing is wanting but saltpetre. If we can weather out this campaign, I hope that we shall be able to have a plenty made for another. Nothing is requisite but to set about it, as every colony has materials, but more especially Virginia and Maryland. My compliments most affectionately to Mrs. Eppes.

Wronghead (1) will probably solicit Troops to be sent Us, but other circumstances may overrule his Application by the time it reaches London; Independant of that I do not believe you will have any: It is I fancy, their plan was to have struck a bold stroak at Boston and as they vainly supposed freightened them out of all resistance, and then to have dispersed part of their Generals with Troops to other parts to diffuse terror through the Continent, but the scene JULY 4, 1775  is changed, they find all their force little enough to defend themselves at Boston and have accordingly ordered several transports which have arrived at New York, to proceed directly with their Cargoes to Boston, and I doubt not the like orders are lodged at other places. My last account of the Enemie's loss seems so far confirmed--that all now fix it between 12 and 1400 and we have little doubt, but that General How[e] is now among the slain. Ours remains under 200. I was afraid after so much time had elapsed to send your things to the head of the Elk, imagining Mr Johnston's Vessel had sailed. They are now in Mr. Griffin's Warehouse, whose storekeeper sets out this week for Rappahannock and will land them either at Hobb's Hole [Tappahannock] or at Port Royal, from either you will easily get them. Gentlemen here generally agree there will be no danger 'til the 20th of July, in passing by Water.

They are warm, zealous friends of America, and hearty well wishers to her councils and arms, and have contributed much to promote both in this province. We have an infernal scoundrel here, a certain Col. S ,(1) who comes over full of plans and machinations of mischief. He has had the most unreserved and unlimited confidence of Lord Dartmouth, during the whole of the past winter, and it seems for some time before; and together with a contemptible puppy of a parson, V--(2) has been contriving to debauch, seduce, and corrupt New-York. The ministry have given him a commission in the woods as surveyor, and another to be governor of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. He is permitted to roam about, upon his parole of honour not to transgress certain limits, but is doing mischief. The colonies are not yet ripe to assume the whole government, legislative and executive. They dread the introduction of anarchy, as they call it. In this province, indeed in this city, there are three persons, a Mr. W , who is very rich and very timid;(3) the provost of the college, who is supposed to be distracted between a strong passion for lawn sleeves and a stronger passion for popularity, which is very necessary to support the reputation of his Episcopal college;(4) and an I P , who is at the head of the Quaker interest:(5) these three make an interest here which is lukewarm; but are all obliged to lie low for the present. I am greatly obliged to you for your letters, which contain the most exact accounts we have been able yet to obtain. We are to the last degree anxious to learn even the most minute particulars of every engagement. I want an exact list of all the officers in our army, if it can possibly be obtained. I wish I could know exactly what powder you have. We are trying JULY 5, 1775  our possibles to get it; but one would not have conceived it possible that the colonies should have been so supine as they have been. A large building is setting up here to make saltpetre, and we are about trying what can be done in the tobacco works in Virginia. This day has been spent in debating a manifesto setting forth the causes of our taking arms. There is some spunk in it. It is ordered to be printed, but will not be done soon enough to be enclosed in this letter. MS not found reprinted from The New York Review, and Atheneum Magazine 2 (1826): 220-21. Although dated June 5, this letter contains several passages which clearly indicate that it was written in early July. 1 On July 5, 1775, Congress recommended that Philip Skene be imprisoned in Hartford, Conn. JCC, 2:126. 2 For a further description of Vardill, see John Jay to John Vardill, September 24, 1774. 3 Thomas Willing (1731-1821), Philadelphia merchant and partner of Robert Morris, was a member of the Continental Congress, 1775-76. DAB. For a similar view, see John Adams to Abigail Adams, July 23, 1775. 4 William Smith (1727-1803), Anglican minister, teacher and provost of the College, Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia, assiduously but unsuccessfully sought the post of American bishop.

514,dg001526,1775,Thomas Jefferson to George Gilmer,"""Thomas Jefferson to George Gilmer   [July 5, 1775] The battle of Charlestown I expect you have heard, but perhaps not so as you may depend on. The provincials sustained two attacks in their trenches, and twice repulsed the ministerial forces, with immense slaughter. The third attack, however, being made with fixed bayonets, the provincials gave ground, retired a little way, and rallied ready for their enemy; but they, having been pretty roughly handled, did not choose to pursue. We lost between 60 and 70 killed, and about 150 wounded. The enemy had 1400 killed and wounded, of whom were about 500 killed. Major Pitcairn was among the slain; an event at which every one rejoices, as he was the commanding-officer at Lexington, first fired his own piece, and gave command to fire. On our side doctor Warren fell, a man immensely valued to the north. The New Englanders are fitting out privateers, with which they expect to be able to scour the seas and bays of every thing below ships of war; and may probably go to the European coasts, to distress the British trade there. The enterprising genius and intrepidity of these people are amazing. They are now intent on burning Boston, in order to oust the regulars; and none are more eager for it than those who have escaped out, and who have left their whole property in it: So that, their rage has got the better of every interested principle. Nobody now entertains a doubt but that we are able to cope with the whole force of Great Britain, if we are but willing to exert ourselves. It will indeed be expensive, extremely expensive; but people must lay aside views of building up fortunes during these troubles, and set apart a good proportion of their income to secure the rest. As our enemies have found we can reason like men, so now let us show them we can fight like men also. The government of Pennsylvania have raised £35,000 to put their country in a posture of defence. There appear to be as many soldiers here as men. Powder is the great want, and towards having plenty of that nothing is wanting but saltpetre. The Congress have directed 20,000 men to be raised immediately, the greater part of which is already raised. Two millions of dollars also are voted. This is all I am at liberty to tell of their proceedings. As to the time of their rising, it is totally beyond conjecture, expresses after expresses daily coming from the northward; and the machinations of the people in office, on other parts of the continent, keep us JULY 5, 1775  from making any progress in the main business. At the same time, such an impatience for home seems to possess us all, that nothing keeps the Congress together but the visible certainty that, till our military proceedings are got into a good train, their separation would endanger the common cause greatly. If things cannot be got into such a state soon as they may be left, we must petition to be exchanged, for fresh hands, that we may return to our families. P.S. After folding up my letter, we received an account, from an undoubted hand, that the mortality among the wounded regulars has been so great, that the killed on the spot, and those who have died of their wounds, make up 1000. The reason of this is, that they have been long confined to salt provisions, having not so much as a vegetable, a drop of milk, or even any fresh meat.

I have mourned, week after week, the loss of all my old Corre- JULY 6, 1775  spondents, in a Course of Time when they were of more Consequence to me and to my Errand, than ever. What is become of Tudor? Where is Tudor? Is he gone to England? Is he sick? Is he afraid to write? Is he gone into the Army, and become so intent on War with his Enemies, as to forget his Friends? These were Questions very often in our Mouths. But the Past shall be forgiven upon Condition, that you keep an exact Journal of occurrencies from day to day for the future and transmit it to me by every oppertunity. We have Spent this whole Day in debating Paragraph by Paragraph, a Manifesto as some call it, or a Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of our taking up Arms.(1) It will be printed Tomorrow, and shall be transmitted as Soon as possible. It has Some Mercury in it, and is pretty frank, plain, and clear. If Lord North dont compliment every Mothers Son of us, with a Bill of Attainder, in Exchange for it, I shall think it owing to Fear. Surely, upon the Same Principle that he has ordered or suffered Gage, to proclaim Adams and Hancock unpardonable, he must order all of Us to be declared so--for all have now gone further than they ever did. The military Spirit in this City, would agreably Surprise you. It breaks out into a great Variety of Forms--Rifle Men, Indians, Light Infantry, light Horse, Highlanders, with their Plaid and Bag Pipes, and German Hussars. This Morning a Person came to the Door of the State House where the Congress Sitts, in all his Pontificalibus. I went out to see him. His Errand was to shew us the Dress, and Armour of a German Hussar. A Stout Man, with an high large Cap on his Head, with a Streamer flowing from it down to his Waistband: a deaths Head painted on the Front of it. A large Hussar Cloak, ornamented with gold Cord, Lace, and Fringe. A Scarlet Waist coat underneath, with gold Button holes and yellow Mettal Buttons, double breasted--a light Musquet, Slung over his shoulder, and a Turkish Sabre or Scymetar by his side, longer, better fortified and more conveniently shaped than our Highland broad Sword. His Horse, well bridled, Saddled-Pistals in gold Holsters. An active Fellow, Slinging his Musket and Sabre about and mounting with great agility--taken all together the most formidable military Figure, I ever Saw. It Seems he has a great Inclination to See, Burgoines, light Horse. He tells us, he can inlist immediately 50 or 60, German Veterans who have long Served in Germany, and are as desirous of going in the Character of Hussars, or Troopers, as he is.(2) This would Set before our New England People, a fine Example for their Imitation: But what is of more Moment, it would engage the Affections of the Germans, of whom there are many in N. York,  Pensylvania, Maryland and other Colonies, more intensely in the Cause of America. What will be done, I know not. Let me intreat you, as you love your Country, and your Friend write me by every oppertunity. My Compliments to your Father and Mother and all Friends. John Adams ""

Your Letters were very usefull to me last Fall. Your Character became thus known, as much esteemed. The few Letters I have recd from you this Time, have increased the Desire of more, and Some other Gentlemen who happened to know you, particularly Governor Hopkins and Ward of Rhode Island have confirmed every good opinion which had been formed. I must intreat you to omit no opportunity of Writing and to be as particular as pos- sible. Want of frequent Communication and particular Intelligence led us into the unfortunate Arrangement of General officers, which is likely to do so much Hurt. We never recd the most distant Intimation of any Design to new model your Army; and indeed Some of Us, were obliged to give up our own Judgments meerly from Respect to what We took to be the Arrangement of our provincial Congress. I have made it my Business ever Since I heard of this Error, to wait upon Gentn. of the Congress at their Lodgings, and else where to let them into the secret and contrive a Way to get out of the Diffficulty, which I hope we shall effect.(1) I rejoice to hear of the great military Virtues and Abilities of General Thomas. Alas poor Warrenl Dulce et decorum est pro Patria mori. Yet I regret his Appointment to such a Command. For God Sake my Friend let us be upon Guard, against too much Admiration of our greatest Friends. President of the Congress, Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Major General and Chief Surgeon of the Army, was too much for Mortal, and This accumulation of Admiration upon one Gentleman, which among the Hebrews was called Idolatry, has JULY 6, 1775  deprivd us forever of the Services of one of our best and ablest Men. We have not a sufficient Number of such Men left to be prodigal of their Lives in future. Every Brain is at Work to get Powder and salt Petre. I hope We shall Succeed: but We must be very Oeconomical of that Article. We must not use large Cannon, if We can possibly avoid it. This Letter will go by two fighting Quakers. Mr Stephen Collins [and John] Kaighn. The first is the most hospitable benevolent [man] alive. He is a Native of Lynn--a Brother of Ezra Collins of Boston, &--is rich, and usefull here. The last has been the Instrument of raising a Quaker Company in this City, who behave well, and look beautifully in their Uniforms. My Love, Duty, Respect &c where due. Adieu John Adams [P.S.] Secret and confidential, as the Saying is.(2) The Congress is not yet So much alarmed as it ought to be. There are Still hopes, that Ministry and Parliament will immediately receed as Soon as they hear of the Battle of Lexington, the Spirit of New York & Phyladelphia, the Permanency of the Union of the Colonies &c: I think they are much deceived and that We shall have nothing but Deceit and Hostility, Fire, Famine, Pestilence and Sword, from Administration and Parliament. Yet the Colonies like all Bodies of Men must and will have their Way and their Humour, and even their Whims. These opinions of Some Colonies which are founded I think in their Wishes and Passions, their Hopes and Fears, rather than in Reason and Evidence will give a whimsical Cast to the Proceedings of this Congress. You will see a Strange Oscilation between Love and Hatred, between War and Peace. Preparations for War, and Negociations for Peace. We must have a Petition to the King and a delicate Proposal of Negociation &c. This Negociation I dread like Death. But it must be proposed. We cant avoid it. Discord and total Disunion would be the certain Effect of a resolute Refusal to petition and negociate.(3) My Hopes are that Ministry will be afraid of Negociation as well as We, and therefore refuse it. If they agree to it, We shall have occasion for all our Wit, Vigilance and Virtue to avoid being deceived, wheedled, threatened or bribed out of our Freedom. If we Strenously insist upon our Liberties, as I hope and am pretty sure We shall, however, a Negotiation, if agreed to, will terminate in Nothing. It will effect nothing. We may possibly gain Time and Powder and Arms. You will see an Address to the People of G. Britain, another to those of Ireland, and another to Jamaica. You will also see a Spirited Manifesto. We ought immediately to dissolve all Ministerial Tyrannies, and Custom houses, set up Governments of our own, like that of Connecticutt in all the Colonies,  and confederate together like an indissoluble Band, for mutual defence and open our Ports to all Nations immediately. This is the system that your Friend has aimed at promoting from first to last; But the Colonies are not yet ripe for it. A Bill of Attainder, &c may soon ripen them. ""

But, I have several Particulars to mention to you, which are omitted in that Letter. Ten Companies of expert Riflemen have been ordered already, from the 3 Colonies of P [ennsylvania], M [aryland], & V [irginia] . Some of them have marched, under excellent officers. We are told by Gentlemen here that these Riflemen are Men of Property and Family, some of them of independent Fortunes, who go from the purest Motives of Patriotism and Benevolence into this service. I hope they will have Justice done them and Respect shewn them by our People of every Rank and order. I hope also that our People will learn from them the Use of that excellent Weapon a Rifled barrell'd Gun. A few Minutes past, a curious Phenomenon appeared at the Door of our Congress. A German Hussar, a veteran in the Wars of Germany, in his Uniform, and on Horse back, a forlorn Cap upon his Head, with a Streamer waiving from it half down to his Waistband, with a Deaths Head painted in Front a beautiful Hussar Cloak orna- JULY 6, 1775  mented with Lace and Fringe and Cord of Gold, a Scarlet Waistcoat under it, with shining yellow metal Buttons--a Light Gun strung over his shoulder--and a Turkish Sabre, much Superiour to an high Land broad Sword, very large and excellently fortifyed by his side-Holsters and Pistols upon his Horse--In short the most warlike and formidable Figure, I ever saw. He says he has fifty Such Men ready to inlist under him immediately who have been all used to the service as Hussars in Germany, and desirious to ride to Boston immediately in order to see Burgoignes light Horse. This would have a fine Effect upon the Germans through the Continent, of whom there are Multitudes. What will be done is yet uncertain.(1) I should not myself be fond of raising many Soldiers out of N England. But the other Colonies are more fond of sending Men than I expected. They have their Reasons, Some plausible, Some whimsical. They have a Secret Fear, a Jealousy, that New England will soon be full of Veteran Soldiers, and at length conceive Designs unfavourable to the other Colonies. This may be justly thought whimsical. But others Say, that by engaging their own Gentlemen and Peasants and Germans &c they shall rivet their People to the public Cause. This has more weight in it. But that it may have this Effect it is necessary that all who shall be sent, be respectfully treated. ""

The Congress will not proceed further in appointing Officers, or ordering the exact Number of Men untill they have the State of the Army laid before them which will be done immediately on the Generals Arrival. A Continental Battallion is to Consist of 1 Colonel, 1 Lieut Colonel, 1 Major, 8 Captains, 16 Lieutenants, 8 Ensigns, I Adjutant, 1 Quarter Mastir, 1 Chaplain, I Surgeon, 1 Mate, 32 Sergeants, 32 Corporals, 16 Drummers, & 554 Privates. In Consequence of this the Colony will be intituled to a Larger Number of Officers which We conceive the Assembly should nominate immediately, as General Washington has with him blank Commissions to fill up according to the several Nomination[s], of the Assemblies or Congresses, on the Continent. As to our raising more men, We can give no Advice, untill We hear from the Genl, who has orders, not to Dismiss any of the Troops now raised untill further Orders. The President writes to you, on Gover Skeens Acct. who with Mr Lundy are sent at the expence of the Continent to reside in Connecticut for the present under your Honors limitations & directions. Mr Skeen is desirous of residing at Wethersfield or Middletown in which we have told him, Your honor will indulge him as also in permitting the Servants, he has with him, of going to Labor, on his Estate, if needed. It is unnecessary at present, to give the particular motives for sending them Northward. Mr Skeen will be nearer his Estate and Family & his Parole equally binding. We hope the Continental emission will soon be out, when you will be refunded the Monies advanced Genl Schuyler. There are two Powder Mills near this City which when in Stock, can make about Fifteen hundred per Week & the Congress are making the most effectual preparation for supplying the Continent with every necessary Article for Defence. The sample of Salt Petre was very good and will inquire as to Sulphur. Experiments are making to strike out a plan for procuring any requisit Quantity of Salt Petre and Powder with the progress of which We hope soon to acquaint you, and with the arrival of a large Supply Daily expected. A Quantity has been sent from this City, by Land, for the Camp and for Ticonderoga, at which place, Gen Schuyler will Command. Indian Affairs have engrossed much of our Attention, and general Regulations will soon take place, with respect to them. After compleating some of the general Matters now before Us, it is probable there will be an Adjournment to New Haven or Hartford. The Army will soon be recruited by near One thousand Rifle Men.  Wheather they will want more, or Not you will be the best Judges but we fear that the Congress will not think of taking more into pay from Connecticut than Six Thousand. We should think that a Draught of Minute Men, to be under immediately on Marching would be a good Regulation, and what will undoubtedly be agreeable to the Congress. Those provinces are now at a great expence with their Militia, and this in perticular their Assembly have come into resolutions (which we will procure, and send you in Our Next) for putting this Province, into the best possable state of Defence. There is nothing from London than the 24th of May. With the greatest truth, and regard, Subscribe for my Self and Colleages, Your honors most Obedient and Very humble Servant Silas Deane ""

523,dg001535,1775,Henry Middleton to Arthur Middleton,"""Henry Middleton to Arthur Middleton   My dear Son, Philadelphia July 6th. 1775. I have just time to acquaint you (1) that I have sent under the care of JULY 6, 1775  Mr. Daniel Tucker, who tells me he shall embark in about an hour in a Schooner bound to George Town, two packages containing the Number of pieces of woollens mentioned in the enclosed paper, which I have bought for cloathing your Uncles Negroes. The Stuffs are not so good as I could wish them to be; and as they are much narrower than Negro cloth, will come rather high; but they will make a very good shift, and I thought it was better to purchase them, than let the Negroes suffer of want of cloathing. Mr. Tucker will forward them to Charles Town to Cap Blake, and I beg You will desire him to send them to Mr. Dupont as soon as he can meet with an Opportunity, after they come to hand. We do not know that any thing material has happened in the Massachusett since the 17th ultimo. The Regulars suffered almost incredibly in the Engagement which happened on that day, for I believe it is pretty certain that they lost in the field of battle not less than thirty officers, and upwards of six hundred privates; and that they had upwards of fifty Officers and not less than six hundred privates wounded. General How it is said was amongst the latter and that he is since dead; but this report seems to want confirmation. General Gage has received a considerable reinforcement since the Engagement, but as the regulars have had so severe a drubbing, we are afraid they will not be prevailed upon to face the provincials again soon. I purpose to set out on Saturday for New York, in order to see my friend Mr. Fenwicke, who Mr. Huger tells me is in a confirmed dropsy and is given over by the physicians, who attend him. I am really under much concern for poor Mrs. Fenwicke and greatly pity her Situation. I understand that he knows nothing yet of his Son Ned's being married to Miss Stuart; and as he has left him only an annuity in Case such a match should take place, I intend to break it to him and try whether I cannot persuade him to make an alteration in his Will in Ned's favour; and I hope he will not carry his resentment to the grave with him. Mr. Tucker waits and therefore I must conclude my Letter; I need not tell you that I have wrote it in a hurry. Remember me affectionately to my Daughter and the Children, and to your Brother and Sisters & to Mr. Drayton & Mr. Pinckney. I am, Your truly affecn. Father Henry Middleton P.S. I have enclosed you the Captain's receipt for the packages. ""

We have unanimously agreed to be silent on that article in the plan of accommodation which asserts, \""That no earthly legislature or tribunal ought or can of Right interfere or interpose in any wise howsoever in the religious and ecclesiastical Concerns of the Colonies.\"" As the Inhabitants of the Continent are happily united in a political Creed, we are of opinion that it would be highly imprudent to run the Risque of dividing them by the Introduction of Disputes foreign to the present Controversey; especially as the Discussion of them can be attended with no one single advantage. They are Points about which Mankind will forever differ and therefore should always, and at least in Times like these be kept out of Sight. We are the more confirmed in these Sentiments by this Circumstance. That JULY 6, 1775  both this & the former Congress have cautiously avoided the least Hint on Subjects of this Kind, all the Members concurring in a Desire of burrying all Disputes on ecclesiastical Points which have for Ages had no other Tendency than that of banishing Peace & Charity from the World.

Dyer that he was well. I have not heard from him Since the Battle at Charles town. When You write again Should be glad You would inform whether he was in that Battle and what Place he Sustains in the Army. I did not know that he was there till You mentioned it. The Congress are very diligent in making every needful provision in their power for the Support of the American Cause at the Same time do not Neglect any probable means for a reconciliation with Great Britain, tho' I have no expectation that administration will be reconciled unless the Colonies submit to their Arbitrary System, or convince them that it is not in their power to carry it into execution. The latter, I hope will soon be done. You have had a bloody Battle, but I think in every encounter through the merciful Interposition of Divine Providence the advantage has been much in our favour. The people here Seem as Spirited in the Cause as in New England. Many of the Quakers as well as others have armed themselves and are Training every Day. Majr. Mifflin of this City who was a very Useful member of this Congress has before now Joyned Your Army as Aid de Camp to General Washington, whom I would recommend to your Notice as an upright, firm, Spirited and Active Friend in the Cause of Liberty. The Congress has agreed on articles for regulating the Army not much differing from those Established by the New England Colonies except the addition of a few, and a more particular limitation of the discretionary powers given to Courts Martial.(1) Ships are frequently arriving here from London but bring no important News. I want to know what measures the ministry JULY 6, 1775  will take after hearing of the Battle at Concord & Lexington; if they dont relax, but order reinforcements, I hope every Colony will take Government fully into their own hands until matters are Settled. I have nothing to acquaint you with of the doings of the Congress but what you will hear of before this comes to hand. I Should be glad if you would write to me when you have leisure. We want as circumstantial an account as may be of occurrences there. When we hear of numbers wounded we want to know whether dangerously, or Slightly &c. Your accounts have been the most particular that I have seen. I Should be glad if you would mention my sons State of health when you write to me or Colo. Dyer.

He is a Man of Fortune & Character & most warmly attached to his Country. I therefore recommend him most heartily to You and the other Gentlemen in Providence. \""Several Gentlemen in this City have Letters from London, of about the Middle of May; they generally agree that all Petitions, Remonstrances, &c. will be to no Purpose. The Congress however have determined to petition the King once more, under the Idea, that if it should be rejected, those moderate People who now keep back will, when they find no Hopes but in the Success of a War, most heartily unite with Us in prosecuting it eff[ectu]ally. Another Address to the People of England is also determined upon. It is proposed to send this by Mr. Richd. Penn, the late Govr. of this Province, who sails the latter End of this Week. This Gentn. is a sincere Friend to his Country, a Man of good Sense & Firmness, and determined to speak with the same Freedom at home which he uses here.\""(1) You will see in the Papers a Resolution that the fishery & restraining Acts are unconstitutional &c.(2) Many were for stoping Trade 20th. July entirely but it was said that as the Merchts. had made Contracts & ordered their affairs so as to carry on Trade to 10th Sepr. it would be a greater Damage to this Country to stop Trade immediately than to G. Britain. Upon this Principle the Resolution was so formed that those who chuse to continue in Trade to the 10th JULY 7, 1775  Sepr. may do it. The Loss sustained by our Troops at Charleston is not so great as We at first apprehended. I was afraid when I wrote They had received an entire Defeat and thank God it is not so: I find however by the Depy. Govr. Letter that the Colony is again called upon for Men. I had the Letter read in Congress. One of the same Import from Govr. Trumbull was read also But the Petition to the King & Address to the People postponed the Consideration of them but I doubt not but the Conduct of the Colony will be approved. We flatter Ourselves here that the Presence of our new Generals will establish good Order in and give Vigor to the whole Army. \""Some measures have been taken for getting a Supply of Powder, & others are in Contemplation, & the Powder Mills are going in Virginia, this Province & New York.

530,dg001542,1775,John Adams to Abigail Adams,"""John Adams to Abigail Adams   My Dear Philadelphia July 7. 1775 I have received your very agreable Favours of June 22d and 25th. They contain more particulars than any Letters I had before received from any Body. It is not at all surprizing to me that the wanton, cruel, and infamous Conflagration of Charlestown, the Place of your Fathers Nativity, should afflict him. Let him know that I sincerely condole with him, on that melancholly Event. It is a Method of conducting War long since become disreputable among civilized Nations: But every Year brings us fresh Evidence, that We have nothing to hope for JULY 7, 1775  from our loving Mother Country, but Cruelties more abominable than those which are practiced by the Savage Indians. The account you give me of the Numbers slain on the side of our Enemies, is affecting to Humanity, altho it is a glorious Proof of the Bravery of our Worthy Countrymen. Considering all the Disadvantages under which they fought, they really exhibited Prodigies of Valour. Your Description of the Distresses of the worthy Inhabitants of Boston, and the other Sea Port Towns, is enough to melt an Heart of stone. Our Consolation must be this, my dear, that Cities may be rebuilt, and a People reduced to Poverty, may acquire fresh Property: But a Constitution of Government once changed from Freedom, can never be restored. Liberty once lost is lost forever. When the People once surrender their share in the Legislature, and their Right of defending the Limitations upon the Government, and of resisting every Encroachment upon them, they can never regain it. The Loss of Mr. Mathers Library, which was a Collection, of Books and Manuscripts made by himself, his Father, his Grandfather, and Great grandfather, and was really very curious and valuable, is irreparable. The Family picture you draw is charming indeed. My dear Nabby, Johnny, Charly and Tommy, I long to see you, and to share with your Mamma the Pleasures of your Conversation. I feel myself much obliged to Mr. Bowdoin, Mr. Wibirt, and the two Families you mention, for their Civilities to you. My Compliments to them. Does Mr. Wibirt preach against Oppression, and the other Cardinal Vices of the Times? Tell him the Clergy here, of every Denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten every sabbath. They pray for Boston and the Massachusetts-they thank God most explicitly and fervently for our remarkable Successes--they pray for the American Army. They seem to feel as if they were among you. You ask if every Member feels for Us? Every Member says he does--and most of them really do. But most of them feel more for themselves. In every Society of Men, in every Clubb, I ever yet saw, you find some who are timid, their Fears hurry them away upon every Alarm--some who are selfish and avaricious, on whose callous Hearts nothing but Interest and Money can make Impression. There are some Persons in New York and Philadelphia, to whom a ship is dearer than a City, and a few Barrells of flower, than a thousand Lives--other Mens Lives I mean. You ask, can they reallize what We suffer? I answer No. They cant, they dont--and to excuse them as well as I can, I must confess I should not be able to do it, myself, if I was not more acquainted with it by Experience than they are.  I am grieved for Dr. Tufts's ill Health: but rejoiced exceedingly at his virtuous Exertions in the Cause of his Country. I am happy to hear that my Brothers were at Grape Island and behaved well. My Love to them, and Duty to my Mother. It gives me more Pleasure than I can express to learn that you sustain with so much Fortitude, the Shocks and Terrors of the Times. You are really brave, my dear, you are an Heroine. And you have Reason to be. For the worst that can happen, can do you no Harm. A soul, as pure, as benevolent, as virtuous and pious as yours has nothing to fear, but every Thing to hope and expect from the last of human Evils. Am glad you have secured an Assylum, tho I hope you will not have occasion for it. Love to Brother Cranch and sister and the Children. There is an amiable, ingenious Hussy, named Betcy Smith, for whom I have a very great Regard. Be pleased to make my Love acceptable to her, and let her know, that her elegant Pen cannot be more usefully employed than in Writing Letters to her Brother at Phyladelphia, tho it may more agreably in writing Billet doux to young Gentlemen. The other Day, after I had received a Letter of yours, with one or two others, Mr. William Barrell desired to read them. I put them into his Hand, and the next Morning had them returned in a large Bundle packed up with two great Heaps of Pins, with a very polite Card requesting Portias Acceptance of them. I shall bring them with me [when] I return: But when that will be is uncertain. I hope not more than a Month hence. I have really had a very disagreable Time of it. My Health and especialy my Eyes have been so very bad, that I have not been so fit for Business as I ought, and if I had been in perfect Health, I should have had in the present Condition of my Country and my Friends, no Taste for Pleasure. But Dr. Young has made a kind of Cure of my Health and Dr. Church of my Eyes. Have received two kind Letters from your Unkle Smith--do thank him for them--I shall forever love him for them. I love every Body that writes to me. I am forever yours. ""

533,dg001545,1775,Benjamin Franklin to Jonathan Shipley,"""Benjamin Franklin to Jonathan Shipley   Philada July 7. 1775 I received with great Pleasure my dear Friends very kind Letter of April 19, as it informed me of his Welfare, and that of the amiable Family in Jermyn Street. I am much obliged by the Information of what passed in Parliament after my departure; in return I will endeavor to give you a short Sketch of the State of Affairs here. I found at my arrival all America from one End of the 12 united Provinces to the other, busily employed in learning the Use of Arms. The Attack upon the Country People near Boston by the Army had rous'd every Body, & exasperated the whole Continent. The Tradesmen of this City were in the Field twice a day, at 5 in the Morning, and Six in the Afternoon, disciplining with the utmost Diligence, all being Volunteers. We have now three Battalions, a Troop of Light Horse, and a company of Artillery, who have made surprizing Progress. The same Spirit appears every where and the Unanimity is amazing. JULY 7, 1775  The day after my Arrival, I was unanimously chosen by our Assembly then sitting, an additional Delegate to the Congress, which met the next Week. The numerous Visits of old Friends, and the publick Business has since devoured all my time: for we meet at nine in the Morning, and often sit 'till four. I am also upon a Committee of Safety appointed by the Assembly, which meets at Six, and sits 'till near nine. The Members attend closely without being bribed to it by either Salary Place or Pension, or the hopes of any; which I mention for your Refection on the difference, between a new virtuous People, who have publick Spirit, and an old corrupt one, who have not so much as an Idea that such a thing exists in Nature. There has not been a dissenting Voice among us in any Resolution for Defence, and our Army which is already formed, will soon consist of above 20,000 Men. You will have heard before this reaches you of the Defeat the Ministerial Troops met with in their first Sortie; the several small Advantages we have since had of them, and the more considerable Affair of the 17th when after two severe Repulses, they carry'd the unfinished Trenches of the Post we had just taken on a Hill near Charlestown. They suffered greatly however, and I believe are convinc'd by this time, that they have Men to deal with, tho' unexperienced, and not yet well arm'd. In their way to this Action without the least Necessity they barbarously plundered & burnt a fine, undefended Town, opposite to Boston, called Charlestown, consisting of about 400 Houses, many of them elegantly built; some sick, aged and decrepit poor Persons, who could not be carried off in time perish'd in the Flames. In all our Wars, from our first settlement in America, to the present time, we never received so much damage from the Indian Savages as in this one day from these. Perhaps Ministers may think this a Means of disposing us to Reconciliation. I feel and see every where the Reverse.(1) Most of the little Property I have, consists of Houses in the Seaport Towns, which I suppose may all, soon be destroyed in the same way and yet I think I am not half so reconcileable now, as I was a Month ago. The Congress will send one more Petition to the King which I suppose will be treated as the former was, and therefore will probably be the last; for tho' this may afford Britain one chance more of recovering our Affections and retaining the Connection, I think she has neither Temper nor Wisdom enough to seize the Golden Opportunity. When I look forward to the Consequences, I see an End to all Commerce between us; on our Sea Coasts She may hold some fortified Places as the Spaniards do on the Coast of Africa, but can penetrate as little into the Country. A very numerous Fleet extending 1500 Miles at an immense Expense may prevent other Nations trading with us: but as we have or may have within ourselves every thing  necessary to the Comfort of Life, & generally import only Luxuries and Superfiuities, her preventing our doing that, will in some respects contribute to our Prosperity. By the present Stoppage of our Trade we save between four and five Millions per Annum which will do something towards the Expence of the War. What she will get by it, I must leave to be computed by her own political Arithmeticians. These are some of my present Ideas which I throw out to you on the Freedom of Friendship. Perhaps I am too sanguine in my opinion of our Abilities for the Defence of our Country after we shall have given up our Seaports to Destruction; but a little time will shew. General Gage we understand enter'd into a Treaty with the Inhabitants of Boston, whom he had confin'd by his Works, in which Treaty it was agreed that if they delivered their Arms to the Select Men, their own Magistrates, they were to be permitted to go out with their Effects. As soon as they had so delivered their Arms, he seiz'd them and then cavil'd about the meaning of the word Effects which he said was only wearing Apparel and Household Furniture, and not Merchandize or Shop Goods which he therefore detains: And the continual Injuries and Insults they met with from the Soldiery, made them glad to get out by relinquishing all that kind of Property. How much those People have suffered, and are now suffering rather than submit to what they think unconstitutional Acts of Parliament is really amazing. Two or three Letters I send you enclosed may give you some, tho' a faint Idea of it. Gage's Perfidy has now made him universally detested. When I consider that all this Mischief is done my Country, by Englishmen and Protestant Christians, of a Nation among whom I have so many personal Friends, I am ashamed to feel any Consolation in a prospect of Revenge; I chuse to draw it rather from a Confidence that we shall sooner or later obtain Reparation. I have proposed therefore to our People that they keep just Accounts, and never resume the Commerce or the Union, 'till Satisfaction is made. If it is refused for 20 Years, I think we shall then be able to take it with Interest. Your excellent Advice was that if we must have a War, let it be carried on as between Nations who had once been Friends & wish to be so again. In this ministerial War against us, all Europe is conjur'd not to sell us Arms or Amunition, that we may be found defenceless, & more easily murdered. The humane Sir W. Draper, who had been hospitably entertain'd in every one of our Colonies, proposes, in his Papers call'd the Traveller,(2)to excite the Domestic Slaves, you have sold us, to cut their Master's Throats. Dr. Johnson a Court Pensioner, in his Taxation no Tyranny adopts and recommends that Measure, together with another of hiring the Indian Savages to assassinate our Planters in the Back Settlements. They are the poorest & most innocent of all People; and the Indian manner is to murder and scalp  Men Women & Children. This Book I heard applauded by Lord Sandwich in Parliament, and all the ministerial People recommend it. Lord Dunmore & Governor Martin have already, we are told, taken some steps towards carrying one part of the Project into Execution by exciting an Insurrection among the Blacks. And Governor Carleton, we have certain Accounts, has been very industrious in engaging the Indians to begin their horrid Work. This is making War like Nations who never had been Friends, and never wish to be such while the World stands. You see I am warm: and if a Temper naturally cool & phlegmatic can, in old age, which often cools the warmest, be thus heated, you will judge by that of the general Temper here, which is now little short of Madness. We have however as yet ask'd no foreign Power to assist us, nor made any offer of our Commerce to other Nations for their Friendship. What another year's Persecution may drive us to, is yet uncertain. I drop this disagreeable subject, and will take up one that I know must afford you and the good Family, as my Friends, some Pleasure. It is the State of my own Family, which I found in good Health; my Children affectionately dutifull & attentive to every thing that can be agreeable to me; with three very promising Grandsons, in whom I take great Delight. So that were it not for our publick Troubles, and the being absent from so many that I love in England, my present Felicity would be as perfect, as in this World one could well expect it. I enjoy however, what there is of it while it lasts, mindfull at the same time that its Continuance is like other earthly Goods, uncertain. Adieu my dear Friend, and believe me ever, with sincere & great Esteem Yours most Affectionately B Franklin [P.S.] My respectfull Complts. to Mrs. Shipley.

I this day received your favor dated at Rome, in which you say that you had received no letter from me. Be assured that I wrote two or three, and enclosed you the proceedings of our Congress, and sent them to Mr. Stead, with directions to forward them to you wherever you are. It gives me much pleasure to hear that those proceedings are approved by the world. We have, indeed, the same accounts from several quarters. America, we hear, is looked up to as the last resource of liberty and the common rights of mankind. Brave and generous, we fight for mankind, and they say, \""to it, brave boys,\"" but afford us not one necessary of war--not a musket or bayonet, not a grain of powder. England has cut off our usual supply. Holland and France JULY 8, 1775  follow the noble example. They say the Americans are cowards, poltroons, dare not fight; yet these doughty heroes take care to deprive us of the means of defence. If we are so fearful, why disarm us? But they know the contrary. In the first of General Gage's attempts against the people, his regulars were put to flight by half their number of militia, without officers or commanders.... This account comes through men of character on the spot, and may be depended on; it is confirmed by most undoubted letters, and you may say so. There are now marching to the camp, a thousand riflemen. They are, at 'listing, rejected, unless they can hit a playing-card, without a rest, at one hundred and twenty yards distance. Almost every fencible man, in all the colonies, is trained, and ready to supply any loss. The regulars have, in any case, never appeared equal to our troops, man for man. What, then, have we to fear? Loss of money, alone; and may the wretch perish, who puts that in competition. Will Lord Effingham come to us? he would be almost adored.(1) Dear sir, can the friends of old England find no way to stop this fatal war going on--to the certain destruction of that once great state? All America pants for reconciliation; they dread, what may be easily prevented by government, a total separation. Should war go on another year, a government must be formed here--it is unavoidable; and when once that is done, it will be, I fear, impossible to restore the connection. When America acts unitedly, she will feel herself too strong to submit to such restrictions as she now does. In short, the time will be past. The people of New-York are now fixed on the side of liberty. Georgia is near coming in. Mrs. Lynch unites with me, in compliments to Mrs Izard. We hope to see you, before we leave this part of America. Your affectionate friend, Thomas Lynch.

My last was by Govr Skene, who set off yesterday, for Wethersfeild who carried Letters from Me. His JULY 8, 1775  Companion Lundey is a specious, stupid, profligate Fellow. Caution You and my Freinds against taking any particular Notice of him, his Finances are as I understand as Low as his Character. J Webb &c, ought to take Care of him in the Credit way. You ask, when I return? This is a hard Question, if We do not adjourn I see no prospect of returning before October, if We agree to adjourn, You may expect Me in Three Weeks or thereabouts. I sent You one of Doct Smith's Sermons, had the pleasure last Evening of hearing my Favorite Duchè' on the same Subject preached to Col. Dickinson's (the Farmer) Regiment, and a Vast Concourse of People. It will be published so need not say anything more, than that you will never by reading have the same Idea of it as those who heard it. Your Lettr. of the 3d is now come to hand, and I find Your Opinion of the Generals and Mr. Mifflin, agree with mine, the latter is greatly miss'd in this City, as he was the Soul, of every thing either Civil or Military here, not that the Military fails, but it does not increase as it would under his animating, & indefatigable endeavors. Pray why is Barzillai, gone to the Camp? Does Barn[ab]as intend his Briga [ntine] for Sea. I advised him to make dispatch & shall write him again by this post. The Congress are in good health Notwithstanding their Confinement to Business without the least intermission. If We tarry untill Fall, Nothing but Your want of Health will I trust prevent Your seeing this City and returning with Me. I am my Dear Yours S D [P.S.] I think it a pity, that Middletown was disappointed. I gave the General Lettrs. to Mr. Hosmer, but I wish his Excellency had wholly missed Hartford since they exerted themselves so faintly to wait on him. I hope by Jos. Webbs going to Camp with the General will enable him to procure a berth for Saml. Webb which I recommend him to, an honorable, tho a dangerous one, but I think that must Now be his Course of Life for the future. ""

538,dg001550,1775,Joseph Hewes to James Iredell,"""Joseph Hewes to James Iredell   Dear Sir Philadelphia 8th. July 1775 I have sent by Captain Hatch's Sloop Ten pair of Shoes for yourself and Six pair for Mrs. Iredell and Mrs. Dawson. I did intend to have sent double the number for the Ladies but could not prevail with the workman to get them ready in time. The demand for Womens Shoes is so great that the makers cannot compleat half their Orders, when a Tradesman has made a thousand Promises and broke them all he has one Answer ready for every charge, Sir I have been under Arms in the Field. I have sent to the Committee of Correspondence at Edenton a Copy of a Letter from General Gage to Governor Martin also a Copy of a Letter from Gov. Martin to Henry White Esqr. in New York. The first was sent to the Congress from the Provincial Convention of New York, the latter from the Committee of this City. By them you may see what part our Governor intends to take in the present unhappy dispute.(1) The Congress some days ago took into consideration the state of the Trade of America. All the arguments that could be made for and against Shuting up the Ports on the 20th of July were duly attended to, and after mature deliberation they determined to let the matter rest on the association agreement entered into last Congress so that the Ports will remain open till the 10th of September next unless Shut sooner by the People themselves in their separate Committees.(2) A Resolution was entered into against the two last restraining Acts of Parliament which you will see in the News Papers.(3) The humble Petition and Remonstrance from the New York Assembly has been treated by the King and Parliament with the same Contempt & neglect as they treated that, from the Congress last Winter. It is said the ministry desired that Agent to inform the Petitioners that they might apply to the Army & Navy at Boston for an answer. This circumstance has induced many of the Tories in that Colony to renounce their principles. It is certain that administration have endeavourd to prevail on the JULY 8, 1775  Canadians and Indians to fall upon our Frontiers, and that they have in contemplation a Scheme to set our Slaves free and arm them against us. By the Fishing & restraining acts they meant to destroy our Trade and Starve US. They have made mean concessions to all the Powers of Europe to prevent our getting a supply of Arms & Ammunition. They have sent a formidable Fleet and Army to Seize our Vessels and cut our throats. They then charge us with Rebellion because we will not believe that they have a right to make Laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever. Strange, that we should be deemed Rebels for an article of faith--after all this they add insult to injury and tell us we are all poltroons and Cowards. Close attention to business, bad health, and a weakness in my Eyes all contribute to prevent me from writing so much as I otherwise should do, I write in pain and can scarcely see to read what I have written. I have sent to Mr. Smith a number of News papers, some Magazines, Sermons, Articles of War for the Continentall Army and a Declaration of War from the Representatives of the united Colonies of North America, they are all intended for the amusement of my friends. My warmest good wishes and best Compliments attend you and the Ladies of my Acquaintance. Desire them to pray for Dear Sir your mo. obedt. hume Servt. Joseph Hewes ""

539,dg001551,1775,Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston,"""Joseph Hewes to Samuel Johnston   Sir [July 8, 1775] Since my last by Mr. Underbill I am favored with yours of the 11th of June. The death of our old friend Colo. Harvey has given me real uneasiness. He will be much missed, I wish to God he could have been spared and that the G __r (1) and Judge H d had been called in his Stead. I wrote a long Letter to R Smith on the 20th of June and forwarded it by a Vessel to Currituck. The injunctions of Secrecy being then JULY 8, 1775  in part taken of[f], I gave him some account of our proceedings in Congress. We have agreed to emit paper Bills of Credit to the amount of two millions of Dollars, for the redemption of which every Colony is bound Jointly & severally, the Quota of each Province to be setled in proportion to the number of Souls it contains, and to be sunk in Seven years in the manner most agreeable to their respective assemblies or Conventions, to raise an Army of Fifteen thousand men (those already raised in the Eastern Colonies to make part of it) Ten thousand to be employed near Boston & five thousand in New York, on Hudsons River, the Lakes, &c. So stood the first Resolution. We have since resolved to employ an additional number so that the whole will exceed Twenty thousand men. We have appointed as you will see by the News papers a General & Commander in Chief, a number of Majors General & Brigadiers General. All the other officers are to be appointed by the Provincial Conventions. We have Resolved to petition the King, to address the People of England, also the people of Ireland, to write a Letter to the City of London, and to the Inhabitants of Jamaica, we have published a manifesto or declaration of War.(2) Caswell set off about Ten days ago to meet the assembly which you say is expected on the 12th of this month. He carried most of the Resolves with him and will give you a particular account of our proceedings. Before he left us we wrote a Circular Letter to the Committees of our Province. Since his departure the Congress received a Copy of a letter from General Gage to Govr Martin forwarded by the Provincial Convention of New York, also a copy of Gov. Martins Letter to Henry White Esqr. of New York delivered to us by the Committee of this City.(3) These Letters have alarmed Hooper & my self. We have sent Copies of them to the Committees of Edenton & Wilmington. We have prevailed on the Presbyterian Ministers here to write to the Ministers and congregations of their Sect in North Carolina, and have also made application to the Dutch Lutherans & Calvinists to do the same. These people are all Staunch in our cause and have promised to set their Brethren in North Carolina right. If the Governor attempts to do any thing he ought to be seized, and sent out of the Colony, so should the Judge. The powers of Government must soon be superseded and taken into the hands of the People. Administration has endeavored to let loose the Indians on our Frontiers, to raise the Negroes against us, to destroy our Trade, Block up our Harbours, make mean concessions to all the European Powers to prevail with them not to furnish us with Arms and Ammunition, and have sent a formidable Army to cut our throats, and then abuse us with the names of Rebells & Cowards. I have sent R Smith a few Copies of a Sermon preached by Smith the Provost of the College,(4) it is much liked here. I have also sent him several Magazines, News papers our Declaration of War, and  Rules & articles of War &c &c. To these I must refer you for News & amusement. Hooper thinks the Congress will break up the latter end of next week, I think otherwise, perhaps not before the last of August, but this is only guess work. I hope by your influence and example you will drive every principle of Toryism out of all parts of your province. I consider myself now over head & Ears in what the ministry call Rebellion. I feel no compunction for the part I have taken nor for the number of our Enemies lately [. . .] in battle at Bunkers Hill. I wish to be in the Camp before Boston tho' fear I shall not be able to get there 'till next Campaign. General Howe says the Americans fought more like Devils than Men, he never knew nor heard of such carnage in so short a time. He confesses that if their reinforcement had come up fifteen minutes sooner the British Troops would have been all cut off. It is reported here that General Burgoyne is among the Dead, but we have no certainty of it. I hope your family & Connections are all well. My best Compliments to them. Hooper Joyns in this with Dear Sir Your most obed hum Sev Joseph Hewes ""

The committee of this city, a few days ago, transmitted to you an original letter from Gov. Martin to Henry White, Esq. from the contents of which it is very obvious that Gov. Martin has formed designs highly inimical to the friends of America.(1) From authentic information we learn that he is to receive a supply of gunpowder from Gen. Gage, via New-York, and that he has sent from North-Carolina a cutter well armed to receive it. She is a small boat, rigged like a schooner, mounts a few swivels, and is commanded by a Mr. Bridges, the lieutenant of the Tamar man of war; the vessel we believe was formerly purchased in New-York by a Capt. Vollet. We beg your particular care, in case she should arrive in your port, to take the steps you may think prudent to secure her and her cargo.(2) She is probably to receive the gunpowder from the Asia, or some other man of war lying in your harbour.

542,dg001554,1775,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   My Dear Sunday July 9th [1775] Yesterday I wrote, or rather blotted the inclosed, at Table, in the Congress which send you without apology. Mr. Wykoff invited Me in the Morning to take a ride with him after Congress, on horseback, into the Jersies. The Congress held untill after 5 oClock, returning to my Lodging found him, with horses ready, ate an hasty Dinner & mounted. Five Miles of Our Road lay thro' the Rich & Beautiful Meadows, of this Town, when we crossed the Delaware, to the City of Gloucester. Ten Degrees inferior To Rockyhill, (but all are Cities here, that have Corporate privileges) thence Six Miles to Woodbury when Night overtook Us, or met Us, for all was a Wood beyond. Here a Company of One Hundred had been closing the Labor of the Week with Military exercise, in their Rifle Dress, & were now washing away the remembrance of their Fatigue at the Tavern. Woodbury affords but one Tavern, even where, every man may have a License for asking & Forty Shilling per Annum. My Freind meeting the Man he had Business with there We agreed to ride Four Miles further & Lodge with him. He conducted Us thro' a Wood not unlike Suffeild plain untill We arrived at his Mansion on the brink of a Creek, & good Meadow. He most hospitably called up his wife who making no Apology fill'd her pan with Bacon & Eggs, put a Skillet of Chocolate on the Fire & prepared for Supper, while he made a Bowl of Toddy. Our Supper was of the above preparation with Cucumbers, Butter, & Cheese. I drank a Bowl of Chocolate while my delicate Citizen ply'd the Bacon & Eggs close, which I avoided, knowing by Experience the Effects on my head. We lodged together & in the morning (Sunday) had Coffee, Cucumbers, & Gammon, & Egg Rum all which Complaisance as well as hunger urged Us to partake of. After Breakfast We walked out to View his Farm. He milks upwards of Twenty Cows, has a fine English horse called Liberty, (to which Wild air is not equall) which cost him more than Two Hundred pounds,--Though the whole Furniture of his House would be a bad Bargain at Thirty pounds. We set out at about Nine oClock & returned. The Country here, were it not, for Now, & then, a Creek which has a little Meadow on its bank, would be no great way Superior to Suffeild Plains. It bears good Rye, but cannot support Wheat. I am thus particular to give you some Idea of the Country adjacent on every side, in doing of JULY 9, 1775  which I must not forget, my Ride to German Town Five Miles from hence famous for Stocking Manufacture. I cannot describe pompous Villa's, or Elegant Gardens where there are None Unless I meant a romance, & as I mean only to divert You with honest Chat, I describe the Country as it is. Between this City & German Town there is not one Elegant Seat, and the greatest improvement on Nature is that on their Groves, owing by no means to Luxury, but to penury & Want. The Growth is Red Oak interspersed with Black Walnut &c. The poor are allowed to cut up the Brush & trim the lower limbs. This leaves the Groves in the most Beautiful View You can imagine. All is clean on the Ground, removing every Shrubb & Bush, leaves the Wind free play to sweep the Floor, and the Soil by no means Luxuriant, shooting up the Trees rather sparingly, so much Grass starts as to give a pale Green Carpet, while the Trees are trimmed up Ten to Fifteen Feet on their Trunk & give the Eye a prospect farr into the Grove, and the Footman, or Horseman free access. This is the State of the Groves Near this City, by a Stranger supposed to be Natural entirely, which (this trimming & cleaning of the poor excepted) is really the Case. I am the more particular on this as the London or Gentlemans Magazine mentions this appearance of their Groves as the simple Effect of Nature, in which Opinion I joined, untill Ocular Demonstration convinced Me of the Contrary. German Town consists of one Street built intirely of rough Stone. Two Miles nearly in length & the houses, correspond to the appearance of the Inhabitants, rough Children of Nature, & German Nature too. I cannot add on this Subject. A handsome Lady might be shewn here, as a Monster, and had the Women, (or what they call such,) any spirit they would hunt her down as a Phenomenon in Nature, portending Evil to Society. Satire apart, in Sober Truth I can give You no description but what must beggar the real appearance of the Country Women near this City. Yet my Landlady in the Jersies by her hospitality, & simplicity, (for she was young & a Quaker) made Me almost think her handsome, tho' I found, her Husband putting on Regimentals, & exercising, greived her Conscience not a little. New England with all its Foibles, must be the Glory, & defence of America, & the cry here is, Connecticut forever, so high has the Universally applauded Conduct, of Our Governor, and the brave intrepidity of Old Genl Putnam & his Troops raised Our Colony in the Estimation of the whole Continent.(1) [P.S.] I am sorry I did not know of Col. Reads [Joseph Reed] going on, or I should have mentioned him to you most particularly, as he is a Gentleman of a most amiable Character, in private & public Life & from whom I have received every mark of Civility, but I supposed him only going on to New York.

It was with great difficulty we got the 6000 into Continental pay.

We have had no special Direction from the Congress to write you on this Subject we therefore only advise what we apprehend prudent for the Colony. According to the Arrangement of the Congress, viz allowing 68 privates to a Company we might with propriety make more Companies out of those allready raised which will require an Addition of Officers.

549,dg001561,1775,President of the Virginia Convention,"""President of the Virginia Convention   Sir Philadelphia July 11. 1775. The continued sitting of Congress prevents us from attending our colony Convention: but, directed by a sense of duty, we transmit to the Convention such determinations of the Congress as they have directed to be made public. The papers speak for themselves, and require no comment from us. A petition to the king is already sent away, earnestly entreating the royal interposition to prevent the further progress of civil contention by redressing American grievances; but we are prevented from transmitting a copy of it, because a public communication, before it has been presented, may be improper. The Convention, we hope, will pardon us for venturing our sentiments on the following subjects, which we submit to their superior wisdom. The continuance and the extent of this conflict we consider as among the secrets of providence; but we also reflect on the propriety of being prepared for the worst events, and, so far as human foresight can provide, to be guarded against probable evils at least. Military skill we are certainly not so well provided with as military violence opposed to us may render necessary. Will not this deficiency be supplied by sending at the publick expence a few gentlemen of genius and spirit to the military school before Boston to learn that necessary art, which in these days of rapine can only be relied upon for public safety. The present crisis is so full of danger and incertainty that opinions here are various. Some think a continued sitting of Congress necessary, whilst others are of opinion that an adjournment to the Fall will answer as well. We conclude that our powers go not to the latter, but that a Fall Congress will be indispensible, with adjourning powers given to your delegates that they may be prepared to meet contingencies. The Convention will therefore see the propriety of proceeding to a new choice of delegates and being explicit about the time to which they chuse to limit the continuance of their delegation. It is expected JULY 12, 1775  that at the next Congress the delegates from the respective colonies come provided with an exact account of the number of people of all ages and sexes, including slaves. The Convention will provide for this. It is with singular pleasure that we can congratulate you on the success with which providence has been pleased to favor our righteous cause by giving success to the operations in defence of American liberty.

The King's Speech upon that Occasion is come over, there is nothing particular in it. The news of the Lexington battle had not got home then but it is reported came 2 days after to wit the 28th-this is a verbal account. Your Nephew James Ross is to command a company of Riffle Men. One company only had been ordered to be raised in the county of Lancaster. However Jemmy undertook to raise a 2d. and they have been accepted of by the Congress.(1) I have heard nothing from Col. Thompson yet we expect him daily. The Congress have received no Letter from General Washington since his arrival at the Camp. The Accot. of their Reception &c. there mentioned in Bradford's Paper of yesterday is said to be wrote by Griffin Genl. Lee's Aid de Camp. The list of the Slain &c. on both sides as mentioned in the same paper came from Joseph Reed the Lawyer of this place. He went from hence with the General and now acts as his Secretary. Your friends are all well. I [. . .] wish to share the cool Breezes of New Castle with you. I grow impatient but this only increases my uneasiness. Kiss our little ones and believe me yours most Affectionately Geo. Read ""

556,dg001568,1775,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   My Dear [July 15? 1775] I have only Time to acknowledge the Receipt of yours of the 11th, and to assure you I am so farr from thinking hard, of your not writing oftener, that I have to return You my warmest Thanks, for so many, of your agreeable Letters, and in particular for that in which You inform Me that you are better in health, than the last Summer. The Weather has for the last Week been extreme, tho a little moderated by Showers yet the Air is excessive bad, which added to Our Close Confinement to Business is almost too much, for from the 10th of May We have not had Sunday's excepted one Days respite, from Nine in the Morning to four pm, & then at Times by Committees on to Ten or Eleven at Night--judge what an easy Time We have. You know, (tho I pay no Compliment to your Taste by reminding You) that I am the most indifferent in Female, or Ladys' Company, of any Man in the World, yet I try now and then to Chat away an hour in a Mixed Company, meerly to chase off the Spleen, for as to my description of the Ladies here at which You hint, refer you to my description of the review, my Ride to German Town &c--or if that will not answer take the following Anecdote. A Brother Delegate, remarkably fond of fine Ladies, at a late Fair, when the whole Country was collected asked Me if I saw one pretty Girl. I replied in the Negative, he was then very free (as he is well acquainted in N. England, tho' not an Inhabitant of it in praises of Your Ladyshipps there) and taking a Guinea out of his pocket says Deane here is a Vast Crowd of Girls. I will follow You and the first that You shall say has a pretty face, I will give the Guinea too. We stroll'd thro the whole Fair, and though I sincerely wished to make him loose his Guinea yet could not in Conscience say that I found one handsome Face. From this judge of the general Complexion of Females here. I am informed that the late Arrangement of Officers, is highly dis pleasing to Worster, and Spencer and that high Words have pass'd on JULY 15, 1775  the Occasion--that Worster talks high of his Thirty Years Services, and that Spencer left his Forces, to shift for themselves, though expecting hourly to be attacked, to return home, and pray an Alteration. I see the Bottom of the whole, and am well aware that the Storm is raised, or at least blown up, by others, and am at no Loss to foresee the direction of it, but am determined to do my duty, and will on no Occasion sacrifice, the good of my Country, to the whim of any old Man, or old Woman rather, or their sticklers. When Worster was appointed I wash'd my hands of the Consequences by declaring him, in my Opinion, totally unequall to the Service. This I did openly in the Face of the Assembly, and if I tho't him unfit for a Major General of Connecticut Forces only, could any one think, I would oppose the Voice of the Continent, & act contrary to my own Sentiments, by labouring to prefer him to Putnam, on whom, by every Acct. the whole Army has depended, ever since the Lexington Battle? I wish all such Men would leave Our Army at once. As to Spencer, I once had a good Opinion of him, but his leaving the Forces in the Manner I hear he has, shocks it very greatly, and if true I wish him to resign at once and let Another take his place. Pray listen to these reports, and inform Me, how farr I am charged with being Active in this Arrangement. I have various reasons to expect their Freinds will Father it all on the old ScapeGoat, as Sherman is known to be in favor of Worster, & Dyer and Spencer are Brother Councellors.(1) If the Warr lasts I hope Matters will come into a more regular, & decisive Course than They (2) ""

July 15th. 1775 Mr. Spotswood leaves this tomorrow morning & intends to continue his journey to Richmond, which affords me an Opportunity of paying my Respects, tho' there is nothing worth relating since my last to Colo. Taylor that I now recollect. Should there be any thing, Mr. Spotswood will deliver it you. We are quite at a loss for the reason of not hearing from our General who has been at the Camp a fortnight, & various conjectures are formed on the Occasion; I know he is clear of meriting blame & therefore think an Action happened about the time his express should have come away & he waits to send us the event & particulars of it, but this is mere Opinion & a whisper on the contrary runs about Town that Gage has sent proposals to our Genl. JULY 15, 1775  for a Suspension of Hostilities, for how long or on what terms has not reached me, nor do I give credit to the Story. If I get that or any other thing Interesting, you shall have it by Post Tuesday next. I shall hope to be at home by the time you return from Richmd. & wish it may be convenient to you & Colo. Taylor to give me the Pleasure of Yr. Company that we may exchange Bugets. It is said a Man of War is in this River & some mention It to be the Fowey; perhaps our friend Dunmore is coming to pay us a Visit, he will not meet a very polite Reception. Your things with some of my own are to embark tomorrow & be sent to New Castle. The Vessell does not go to Port Royal as I expected, but to Norfolk & then to New Castle; I found if I was to have them freighted from Norfolk to Rappa. besides the uncertaintie of getting it done, would have been attended with more than double freight & much exceeded the expence of sendg. for them by Land to New Castle, wch. I will have done as soon as I hear of their Arrival. I have been sadly plagued to get them along. A land Carriage would have cost at least £20. When I might have sent them, they were not ready, & since they have been so, no opportunity 'til now; None here seem to think there is any danger of their being seised in the Passage. If the Colours escape 'til they reach yr. worthy Company, I know they must buy them dear, who attempt to meddle with them afterwards. My Complts. to Colo.

[William] Thompson's inclosed. I have been proud, and have often expressed my Pride in JULY 16, 1775  the Spirit and Vigour of Cumberland County to the great American Cause: Guess then what my Uneasiness and Disappointment were, when I was informed that Matters were carried on in a Manner disagreeable to our sanguine Hopes and Wishes. One happy Circumstance attended your Letter: The Bearer's Horse got lame, and I did not receive it till the Day before Yesterday. This fortunate Delay prevented the Chagrin which I should otherwise have felt for two or three Days. About an Hour after I had read your Letter, and while I was ruminating upon it in a manner that you will easily conceive, I was pleasingly surprised by Mr Jesse Lukins with an Account that the Cumberland Companies were compleated, and either ready to march, or on their March towards Reading. I expect Col. Thompson here to Day. Since Capt. Little has declined going, I am determined to use every possible Endeavour to procure Mr [Robert] Magaw to be appointed Lieut. Colonel.(1) His Zeal and Activity merit to be distinguished. I hope I shall succeed. We have not lately received any material News from the Northward. There is in one of the Papers a particular Account of the killed and wounded among the Regulars at Bunker's Hill. Their Number amounts in the whole to 1492. I presume Mr Blaine will furnish you with all the late Papers. As I write at Mr Turner's, it is not in my Power to do it as usual. I inclose the only one I have. The edifying Speeches of the Commons to the King, and of the King to his Parliament will give you great Satisfaction. Our Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of taking up Arms you l-ave in the News-paper; as also our Address to the People of Britain. I send you a Copy of our Rules and Articles for the Government of the Army. Indian Affairs have been under the Consideration of the Congress. As I am at Liberty to communicate any Part of this Business which I think ought to be publicly known, I take this Opportunity of informing you that we are anxious to take every Step which will have a Tendency to preserve Peace with the Indians. For this Purpose we have divided them into three different Departments; and appointed Commissioners to hold Treaties and make Presents in each Department. Dr Franklin Mr Henry of Virginia and I are Commissioners for the middle Department. We have not yet determined upon the Time or Place of holding a Treaty. But Speeches are prepared, and the Belts are getting ready. I should be glad you would take the first Opportunity you can find of conveying this Intelligence to Westmoreland County. It will give Satisfaction to the Inhabitants there to learn that the proper Measures are pursuing for preserving their Tranquillity. Perhaps you will write to Capt St Clair. Make my Compliments to him, and tell him that, tho' I have not now Time I will seize the first Leisure Moment to send a long Letter to him. I observe what you say concerning an Indian Treaty; and shall be  glad to have any farther Thoughts you may judge proper to hint concerning that Matter. I cannot tell what to say about Croghan. I think it dangerous to employ him; and dangerous to let him alone. Give little Polly a Kiss for me.

Putnam Acted on principles as much superior To Those which actuate the dissatisfied as Heav'n is superior to Earth. Putnam's Merit Rung thro this Continent, his Fame still increases and every day justifies the Unani-- JULY 20, 1775  mous applause of this Continent. Let it be remembered he had every Vote of the Congress, and his health has been the second or third at almost all Our Tables in This City, but it seems he does not Wear a large Wigg nor screw his Countenance into a form that belies the sentiments of his generous Soul. He is no adept either at political or religious canting & cozening, he is no shake hand body, he therefore is totally unfit for every thing, but only fighting. That Department I never heard that these intriguing Gentry wanted to interfere with him in. I have scarce any patience, O Heav'nl blast, I implore Thee every such low, narrow, selfish, envious maneuvre in the bud, nor let one such succeed far enough to stain the fair page of American patriotic politics! General Washington writes, that Spencer left his post without so much as waiting on him, or sending him a Single Word of his Intentions. You can be at no Loss to infer what Opinion is formed of him from this Conduct indoors & out, suffice it to say the Voice here is that he acted a part, inconsistent, with the Character, either of a Soldier, a Patriot, or even of a Common Gentleman to desert his post in an hour of Danger, to sacrifice his Country, which he certainly did as farr as was in his power, and to turn his back sullenly on his General, a General too of such exalted worth, and Character, will I can assure you, unless he take the most Speedy & effectual Measures to atone, draw down upon him the Resentment of the whole Continent. I am daily, & hourly making as fair Weather as possible of this transaction, and a painful task it is. It is one I am unused to, and therefore labor hard to gloss over what I condemn from the bottom of my Soul. But my principles are, (the Eye of my God knows them, and the most envious Eye of Man, nor the bitterest Tongue of Slander, can not find any thing in my political Conduct to contradict them) they are to sacrifice all lesser considerations to the service of the whole and in this Tempestuous season, to Throw chearfully overboard, private Fortune, private emoluments & all partial, or interested Views, even my Life, if the Ship with the Jewel Liberty on board may be saved. This being my Line of Conduct, I have a Calmness of Mind I thank God resulting from such resolutions which more than ballances, every external Trouble, of which I have not a few, and of which the late Conduct of a part of Our Officers in Support of Spencer is not the least. Inclosed I send a Letter for Parsons which please to read, then Copy, seal, and forward. I will say no more on the very disagreeable Subject than, that the Copy and this Letter may hereafter shew my Sentiments at the Time. I am glad Our Assembly did not interpose in favor of Spencer. They have hereby acted up to the high Character they sustain with the Congress and the only consistent part He, Spencer, can now act is to throw Up his Commission, & give place to Men who do not think  it degrading to serve their Country tho they have not the highest Feather in their Cap. Let them look at Major Mifflin who is a Member of the Continental Congress, a respectable one too, yet he condiscends to act as Aid de Camp, & of Course ranks no higher than Saml. Webb, whose appointment I rejoice at, & own I procured it for him, but not because he was my Freind but because he merits it, and will if it please God to preserve him, make an Officer of the first rank and Character, when some blusterers of the present hour are forgotten, or I am much mistaken. At the Time I recommended Capt. Chester I did not think he would accept, but I knew he deserved it. On that motive I acted. His Conduct has justified my voice in his favor, and will I doubt not justify what I have said, & wrote to the Generals in his favor, and expect soon to hear of his promotion which I shall with pleasure. I recommended without Sollicitation my Freind Jos. Trumbull, & have been happy enough to find him successful in an honorable, & important though a very laborious station. My Interest in Our assembly has been something, in the Congress, it is as large as my Vanity could wish, but God forbid I ever use it, but to promote the meritorious, & my rule of Judging of those, must be by actual specimens of their Conduct, not by Squireship or Cousinship. The Revd Mr. Duchè, in the forenoon & Dr. Allison this Afternoon entertained the Congress at Church & Meeting. Such a Fast was never before observed in this City. Sunday was never so strictly kept.

It was natural to expect the General would prefer Col. Read [Joseph Reed] to any one, who, besides his Acquaintance, with the Genl. is one of the most amiable Characters, in this City. But the General did you full Justice, in his Letter to the Congress--and greatly to my Satisfaction. I am greived at the part Genl. Spencer has acted, as it has greatly hurt him here. You know how hard it is to efface, such kind of impressions, but We make the best We can of it. I have wrote freely to my Freind Col. Parsons on the Subject, which I hope he will take as I meant it, in good part.(2) I find he is charged, by many in Connecticut, with having had Too great a Share in the uneasiness which I am ready to attribute, to the insinuations of his Enemies, who are you know, jealous of his enterprizing Genius. The Rifle Men are filing off fast. Permit Me to recommend to your Civilities Capt. Ross of this Province, a Young Gentleman who is Son to Col. George Ross one of the Congress for this Colony.

The Gent. from that province recommended General Pomroy who was accordingly fixed upon but before his Commission arrivd at the Camp he had retird from the Army. Under these Circumstances the JULY 21, 1775  Congress thought it Just to fill up the Commission designd for Mr. Pomroy with the Name of General Thomas as first Brigadier;(2) you Consequently hold the Rank to which you was elected.

The MS is endorsed by Charles Thomson: \""Sketch of Articles of Confederation. July '75. This sketch in handwritg of Doct Franklin. Read before Congress July 21, 1775.\"" Thomson also JULY 21, 1775  wrote an endorsement on another copy of the proposed articles, which is located in PCC, item 9, and reads as follows: \""July 21, 1775. Agreeably to Order the Congress resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole to take into Consideration the State of America, when doct. B. Franklin submitted to their Consideration the following Sketch of Articles of Confederation.\"" A discussion of the various surviving copies of Franklin's proposed articles, among which is a copy annotated by Thomas Jefferson, can be found in Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 1:177-82. In addition to the copies discussed by Boyd, there is a copy in the hand of Josiah Bartlett in the Peter Force Papers, DLC, and an incomplete copy in the Samuel Ward Papers, RHi, of which articles one through three are in the hand of Charles Thomson and four through eleven are in the hand of Samuel Ward. Variations between these copies and the other surviving ones are slight. However, the copy in James Duane's Papers, NHi, contains the following marginal comments, in an unidentified hand, pertaining to articles 7 and 9 of Franklin's document. \""The delegates from each colony [cf.

This council [cf. Article 9] should consist of one from each colony.\"" It is interesting that the journals of Congress contain no mention of the submission of Franklin's proposed resolutions this date, perhaps simply because Franklin submitted them in the committee of the whole, and they were not laid before the Congress.

Your fatigue & various kinds of trouble, I dare Say are great, but they are not more than I Expected, knowing the people you have to deal with by the Sample we have here. The Congress have Taken the Two Regiments now Raising in Connecticutt into Service which with Riflemen & Recruits to your Regimts. will I hope make up the Number voted by your Council of War. I wish with all my Heart your JULY 21, 1775  Troops were better & your Stores more Complete. Every thing that we can do here to put you in the best posture possible I think you may depend will be done. I trust you will have a Supply soon of Ammunition, without any Accident you may Depend on it. The want of Engineers I fear is not to be Supplied in America. Some folks here seem'd much displeas'd at your Report on this head, they Affirm there are two very good ones with you, a Coll Gridley I think is one. I took the Liberty to say they must be mistaken, they were certainly either not in the Camp, or could not have the Skill they were pleas'd to Say they had. This in my soft way put a Stop to any thing more on this Subject, indeed, my Friend, I do not know what to think of some of these Men, they seem exceeding hearty in the Cause, but still wish to keep every thing among themselves. Our President is quite of a different Cast, Noble, Disinterested & Generous to a very great Degree. The Congress have given you the Appointment of Three Brigade Majors. Mr Trumbull has the office you propos'd for him. The appointment of Commissary of Artillery, of Musters, & Quarter Master General are also left to your Disposal. Nothing is yet done as to the Hospitall, but I will bring it on very soon. Your Brothers in the Delegation have Recommended it to our Convention to Send some Virginians to the Camp at the Expence of our Colony to learn the Military Art, & I hope you will see them soon.(1) We have given the Commission of First Brigadier to Mr Thomas as Putnam's Commission was deliver'd it would perhaps have offended the old Gentn. to have superceeded him; the other I hope will still Act, the Congress have from your Accott. a high Opinion of him, & I dare Say will grant any thing in their power that he may here after Require. Your Hint of the Removal of the Congress to some place nearer to you will come on to morrow, I think it will not Answer your Expectations if we should Remove, You shall have the Result in the Close of this.(2) The Military Chest I hope will be Supplied soon, they begin to Strike the Bills this day, so that I hope some may be forwarded to you next week. What has Occasion'd a Delay of this Article I know not. Without, an Imitation of the Congress in its Slowness has become fashionable. I have had no farther Accott. from our Country about the Governor, except that he is still at York Town with three Men of War. He, Montague & [Foye] went the other Day by Water to his Farm, and were within three or four Minutes of being all Taken by Capt Meredith from Hanover, who are with about 150 Men from other Counties guarding Williamsbg. from any Attempt he may make with his boiled Crabs. Meredith says, his Intentions were to Carry his Lordship to Williamsburg to put him into the Palace & promise him protection, to convince him & the World that no Injury was intended him. However as he missed his Stroke, I dare Say he will be Charg'd with intending to murder him. We think the Season too far Advanc'd  to Send you any more Men from the Southward, but it seems to be the general Opinion to Send some Thousands early in the Spring, Should this be the case, if I have the honour of being here, you may Depend on my Care of Mr Johnston. We have an imperfect Accott. of an Attack on New York by some of the over lake Indians. I hope it is not true (indeed between you & I) I give very little Credit to any thing from that Quarter, and I wish I could Say I had no Reason to be Suspicious of those People. We yesterday Received dispatches from Georgia. They have come into the Union, & appointed Dele gates to the Congress. They have even done more. They with South Carolinians Armed a Vessell, & have Taken a Ship with 140 Barr [el] s of King's Powder which they have Divided betwixt them.(3) As I was in the pleasing Task of writing to you, a little Noise occasion'd me to turn my head round, & who should appear but pretty little Katy the Washer Woman's Daughter over the way, clean, trim & Rosey as the Morning. I snatch'd the Golden glorious Opportunity, and but for that Cursed Antidote to Love, Sukey, I had fitted her for my General against his Return, We were obliged to part, but not till we had contrived to Meet again. If she keeps the Appointment I shall Relish a Weeks longer Stay. I give you now & then some of these Adventures to amuse and unbend your Mind from the Cares of War. (4) ""

We had great fears when we heard the Assembly had Voted to raise fourteen hundred More men for the JULY 22, 1775  Army that they would not have been Receivd by this Congress, & that the whole Expence would have fallen on our exhausted Colony. But on receiving an express from General Washington and his Return of the Army with his Intimations that a reinforcement was necessary togeather with the high Esteem entertained of the Connecticut forces here, we have procured them to be admitted into the Continental Army & you Will be desired by the President of the Congress to have them forwarded to join the Army with all expidition. The Congress have Unanimously appointed Capt. Joseph Trumbull Com missary General of our Army. We had recommended him to Genl Washington for his Secretary but Colo Reed a Gentleman of high reputation in this City a Lawyer of the first eminence set out with the Genl from this Place and was induced by the General to proceed with him to the Army & tarry with him through the summer, upon which he appointed him his secretary, and on his Arrival he found the Connecticut Troops so much better supplied than the other & by the good Opinion he entertained of your son he recommended him to the Congress for that appointment which was very readily agreed to. The publick Fast was observed here by all Societys of Christians with great Decency & Solemnity even much beyond what the Sabboths are generally observed here. We hope it may have a happy effect thro the Continent & that Almighty God may hear the united Supplications of his People.

They have lately taken at South Carolina about fourteen Thousand Wt Powder which was going into Georgia for the use of the Ministry. We are yet Uncertain when we shall adjourn or where the General Urges our Moving nearer Boston which I dare say will have great Weight, but the Gentlemen from some of the Sothern Colonies seem Very averse to [it].(1) We hope to be on our way to New England in about a fortnight.

Dr. Franklin has been very constant in his Attendance on Congress from the Beginning. His Conduct has been composed and grave and in the Opinion of many Gentlemen very reserved. He has not as- JULY 23, 1775  sumed any Thing, nor affected to take the lead; but has seemed to choose that the Congress should pursue their own Principles and sentiments and adopt their own Plans: Yet he has not been backward: has been very usefull, on many occasions, and discovered a Disposition entirely American. He does not hesitate at our boldest Measures, but rather seems to think us, too irresolute, and backward. He thinks us at present in an odd State, neither in Peace nor War, neither dependent nor independent. But he thinks that We shall soon assume a Character more decisive. He thinks, that We have the Power of preserving ourselves, and that even if We should be driven to the disagreable Necessity of assuming a total Independency, and set up a separate state, We could maintain it. The People of England, have thought that the Opposition in America, was wholly owing to Dr. Franklin: and I suppose their scribblers will attribute the Temper, and Proceedings of this Congress to him: but there cannot be a greater Mistake. He has had but little share farther than to co operate and assist. He is however a great and good Man. I wish his Colleagues from this City were All like him, particularly one,(2) whose Abilities and Virtues, formerly trumpeted so much in America, have been found wanting. There is a young Gentleman from Pensylvania whose Name is Wilson, whose Fortitude, Rectitude, and Abilities too, greatly outshine his Masters. Mr. Biddle, the Speaker, has been taken off, by Sickness. Mr. Mifflin is gone to the Camp, Mr. Morton is ill too, so that this Province has suffered by the Timidity of two overgrown Fortunes. The Dread of Confiscation, or Caprice, I know not what has influenced them too much: Yet they were for taking Arms and pretended to be very valiant. This Letter must be secret my dear--at least communicated with great Discretion. Yours, John Adams ""

They will perhaps be introduced, into places, as Aid du Camps--Brigade Majors, Secretaries, and Deputies in one Department, or another. I earnestly intreat you to make the most minute Enquiry, after every one of these, and let me know his Character, for I am determined, I will know that Army, and the Character of all its officers. I swear, I will be a faithfull Spy upon it for its good. I beg you would let me know, what is become of Coll Gridley and Mr Burbanks, and whether they have lost their Character as Engineers and Gunners--and let me know, what Engineers there are in the Army, or whether there are none. I want to know if there are any Engineers in the Province and who they are. I have heard the Generals were much disappointed, in not finding Engineers, and Artillery as they expected.

586,dg001598,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dr Sir Philadelphia July 23d. 1775 I have many Things to write you, which thro Haste and Confusion, I fear I Shall forget. Upon the Receipt of General Washingtons Letter, the Motion which I made Some Days before, for appointing General Thomas first Brigadier, was renewed and carried,(1) So that the Return of the Express will carry his Commission. I hope that this will give all the Satisfaction which is now to be given. You ask me upon what Principle We proceeded in our first Arrangement. I answer you the Principle of an implicit Complyance with the order in which the General Officers were chosen in our Provincial Congress last Fall. Not one of us would have voted for the Generals in the order in which they were placed, if We had not thought that you had Settled the Rank of every one of them last Fall in Provincial Congress, and that We were not at Liberty to make any alteration. I would not have been so shackled however, if my Colleagues had been of my Mind. But, in the Case of the Connecticutt officers, We took a Liberty to alter the Ranks established by the Colony, and by that Means made much Uneasiness: so that We were sure to do Mischief whether We confirmed or deviated from Colony Arrangements. I rejoice that Thomas had more Wisdom than Spencer or Wooster, and that he did not leave the Camp nor talk imprudently; if he had We should have lost him from the Continental service: for I assure you, Spencer by going off, and Wooster by unguarded Speeches have given high offence here. It will cost us Pains to prevent their being discarded from the service of the Continent with Indignation. Gentlemen here had no private Friendships Connections, or Interests, which prompted them to vote for the Arrangement they made, but were influenced only by a Regard to the Service; and they are determined that their Commissions shall not be dispized. I have read of Times, either in History or Romance, when Great Generals would chearfully serve their Country, as Captains or Lieutenants of Single Companies, if the Voice of their Country happened not to destine them to an higher Rank: but such exalted Ideas of JULY 23, 1775  public Virtue seem to be lost out of the World. Enough of this. I have laboured with my Colleagues to agree upon proper Persons to recommend for a Quarter Master General, a Commissary of Musters and a Commissary of Artillery, but in vain. The Consequence has been that the appointment of these important, and lucrative Officers is left to the General, against every proper Rule and Principle, as these offices are Checks upon his. This is a great Misfortune to our Colony, however, I hope that you and others will think of proper Persons and recommend them to the General.(2) There is, my Friend, in our Colony a great Number of Persons, well qualified for Places in the Army, who have lost their all, by the outrages of Tyranny, whom I wish to hear provided for. Many of them will occur to you. I beg leave to mention a few. Henry Knox, William Bant, young Hitchbourne,(3) the Lawyer, William Tudor, and Perez Morton. These are young Gentlemen of Education and Accomplishments, in civil Life, as well as good Soldiers; and if at this Time initiated into the service of their Country might become in Time and with Experience, able officers. If they could be made Captains or Brigade Majors, or put into some little Places at present I am very sure, their Country would loose nothing by it, in Reputation or otherwise. A certain Delicacy which is necessary to a good Character, may have prevented their making any applications, but I know they are desirous of serving. I must enjoin Secrecy upon you, in as strong Terms as Mr Hutchinson used to his confidential Correspondents; and then confess to you, that I never was Since my Birth, so compleatly miserable as I have been since the Tenth of April. Bad Health, blind Eyes, want of Intelligence from our Colony, and above all the unfortunate and fatal Division, in our own Seat in Congress, which has lost us Reputation, as well as many great Advantages which We might otherwise have obtained for our Colony, have made me often envy the active Hero in the Field, who, if he does his own Duty, is sure of applause, tho he falls in the Execution of it. It is a vast and complicated System of Business which We have gone through, and We were all of us, unexperienced in it. Many Things may be wrong, but no small Proportion of these are to be attributed to the Want of Concert, and Union among the Mass. Delegates. We have passed a Resolution, that each Colony make such Provision as it thinks proper and can afford, for defending their Trade in Harbours, Rivers, and on the sea Coast, against Cutters and Tenders.(4) We have had in Contemplation a Resolution to invite all Nations to bring their Commodities to Market here, and like Fools have lost it for the present.(5) This is a great Idea. What shall We do? Shall We invite all Nations to come with their Luxuries, as well as  Conveniences and Necessaries? or shall We think of confining our Trade with them to our own Bottoms, which alone can lay a Foundation for great Wealth and naval Power. Pray think of it. I rejoice that the Generals and Coll Reed and Major Mifflin are so well received. My most respectfull Compliments to them all. I thank you and Mrs. Warren a thousand Times for her kind and elegant Letter. Intreat a Continuance of her Favours in this Way, to your old Friend. ""

They have propagated that Opinion among the Penns people on the West branch & below Wyoming & that part of the forces raised in Connecticut are for that purpose, that our assembly in this time of distress are making strides into that Country extending their Claim &c, & Indeed they goe farther & trye to possess the minds of Southern Gentn of the Congress that we are a hardy daring enterprising people & if we prove Successful against the Ministerial Army here we shall after that make our way by force into any the Southern Colonies we JULY 23, 1775  please. Mr Dickinson the Pensylvania farmer as he is Called in his Writings is lately most bitter against us & Indeavours to make every ill Impression upon the Congress against us but I may say he is not very highly Esteemd in Congress. He has taken a part very different from what I believe was expected from the Country in general or from his Constituents. But Sr I mean to let you know & be apprised that a little Matter, a little driving or Imprudence now in that Country may blow all up into a flame or the least threat or offer of force or Violence. Therefore Sr hope you will take every precaution & guard our people against every appearance of that kind. Let all the setlers under the propriet[or]s & their land holders know they will not be put off by force but may be quieted in their actual possessions & Improvements as their own on the most reasonable terms, free from quit rents or Services to any. Flatter them to let our people set down among them on the Vacant lands, I mean the Common people and let them know as far as you can make them understand, how much better it will be for them to come in under our Colony & that they will be secured by Our Government. If you are about to settle a Township let those who are settled under Penn within the Limits know that they shall have a part with you where they are setled down & Actually Improved to Some more or less if even a hundred acres to some & that they shall be one with you. The Proprietors of every Township have a right to do this, to flatter in the bulk of the People will be the wisest method at present and We can deal with the great land holders by & by when we have the main of the people [on] our side. For some of the great purchasers there Under Penn would be glad also to purchase in the Connecticutt Claim. I believe it would be best to take in some of the greatest Influence in that way but it will not do abruptly to goe with a Number to the West branch for they have lately been made very Jealous. You must goe first & only with one or two. Let the people know that your designs are not of force, gain their Consent & get gradual possession. Do not be fond to exercise jurisdiction (as I understand you are appointed Juste Pacis there) where they do not own the Connecticutt Claim. I mean it will not do at this time to force your Authority among our own people & who are setled under Connecticutt. I hope the best order may be observed, that you may conduce much to by some proper harangue in some of your publick Meetings &c & the Necessity of keeping up Authority. I want to have you fully gaine the affections of & Confidence in the people in that part, every thing in my power to Serve you there or with us will not be wanting.

The Debate about the Remove was taken up yesterday and Determin'd in the Negative.(1) I propos'd a Committee but could not Carry it. I think the last Method would have answer'd your purpose best, but the Gentlemen could not think of parting with the least particle of their power. Pendleton left us yesterday, all Maryland are gone off this Day, and we intend to follow them [next] Sunday if nothing material happens betwixt this & then. Our Going I Expect will break Up the Congress, indeed I think it high time there was an End of it. We have been too long together. Edmund Randolph is here, & has the greatest Desire to be with you, he has beg'd of me to Say something in his favour, & that if you can you will keep one of the places now in your Gift for him. He is not able to Support himself, or he would not Ask this of you. You know him as well as I do. He is one of the cleaverest young men in America, & if Mr. Reed should leave you, his place of Secretary cannot be better Supplied. JULY 24, 1775  He will set off for New York in a few days, and I Beg it as a favour of you to write a line to be left at the Post office till Call'd for. This deserving young Man was in high Repute in Virginia, & fears his Fathers Conduct may lessen him in the Opinion of his Countrymen. He has taken this Method without the Advice of his Friends to Raise him into favour, as he is Determin'd on the thing. I am sure our good old Speaker will be much oblig'd by any favour you shew him. Applications of this sort, I fear, will be too frequent. I shall avoid them as much as possible, but I could not Refuse it on this Occasion, well knowing that a most valuable young Man, & one that I love, without some Step of this sort, may from the misconduct of his Parent be lost to his Country which now stands much in need of men of his Abilities. We have Report that Bob [McKenzie] was kill'd at Bunker's Hill, is it true? I had a great Friendship for him formerly, but can't help saying I shall be Glad to hear the News confirm'd.(2) ""

A certain great Fortune and piddling Genius whose Fame has been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly Cast to our whole Doings.(1) We are between Hawk and Buzzard. We ought to have had in our Hands a Month ago, the whole Legislative, Executive and Judicial of the whole Continent, and have compleatly moddelled a Constitution, to have raised a Naval Power and opened all our Ports wide, to have arrested every Friend to Government on the Continent and held them as Hostages for the poor Victims in Boston--And then opened the Door as wide as possible for Peace and Reconcilliation: After this they might have petitioned and negotiated and addressed, etc. if they would. Is all this extravagant? Is it wild? Is it not the soundest Policy? One Piece of News--Seven Thousand Weight of Powder arrived here last Night. We shall send along some as soon as we can--but you must be patient and frugal. We are lost in the extensiveness of our Field of Business. We have a Continental Treasury to establish, a Paymaster to choose, and a Committee of Correspondence, or Safety, or Accounts, or something, I know not what that has confounded us all Day. Shall I hail you Speaker of the House, or Counsellor or what-What Kind of an Election had you? What Sort of Magistrates do you intend to make? Will your new Legislative and Executive feel bold, or irresolute? Will your Judicial hang and whip, and fine and imprison, without Scruples?(2) I want to see our distressed Country once more--yet I dread the Sight of Devastation. You observe in your Letter the Oddity of a great Man.(3) He is a queer Creature. But you must love his Dogs if you love him, and forgive a Thousand Whims for the Sake of the Soldier and the Scholar.

A Quantity is expected in at Connecticut, where will be the greatest probability of a Supply. You mention Your Fears of the Indians. We have had such reports here but from many Circumstances, hope they will prove groundless. As to petitioning the Congress for a Number of Men to be Stationed near you,(1) can by no means advise it as the Congress are so deeply engaged already in the Warr at Boston and Genl. Schuyler has to the Northward an Army sufficient to check the Indians, and protect the Frontiers. Should Johnson attempt to penetrate Southward into the Settlements, Schuyler will be in his Rear, so that I think You are safe on that Quarter though I cannot urge You Too strongly to put Your people in the JULY 24, 1775  best posture of defence possible, and to apply to Connecticut for Powder. You can have no prospect of any from this place. I hope Peace will be preserved between You, & those claiming under Penn, should Violences of any kind be committed the Consequences will be terrible beyond description, as Our Enemies will be sure to take advantage of the Times, and prejudice the Colonies against Our Claim, and it is probable as things are ripening that the Colonies will be Our Judges at last. I am wishing You, & the Settlers all possible happiness & success. Your most Humle. Servt. Silas Deane P.S. You may rely upon it, that any rash Measures, at this Time, will ruin Our Cause forever--by no means attempt to disseize peaceable possessors. You will draw the resentment of the Congress if You do. Cannot You obtain a friendly Association for the present between both parties for mutual defence, a petition to the Congress (in Case of Danger), from the whole, of the Inhabitants, will undoubtedly be attended to but if a party should petition, it will occasion the greatest Susspicion possible.

In answer to the several Matters therein contained I am to inform you that the Congress appointed a committee to enquire what quantity of light Sail Cloth, Sheeting and Oznabrigs could be obtained in this town for the purpose of making Tents, and in this business the Committee are now closely employed.(1) It is agreed that tow cloth will be most proper for hunting shirts, & of this the Congress are informed a sufficient quantity may be obtained in Rhode island and Connecticut. It is expected you will give orders for purchasing there the quantity necessary. Agreeable to your recommendation they have appointed Joseph Trumbull Esqr. Commissary-general of stores and provisions for the army of the United Colonies. The appointment of a Quarter Master General, Commissary of Musters, and a Commissary of Artillery is left to you, the Congress not being sufficiently acquainted with persons properly qualified for these offices. They have ordered a company of Matrosses to be raised in this city and sent forward. General Thomas, they have appointed First Brigadier General in the room of Mr Pomroy who did not act under the commission sent him and have ordered General Thomas's commission to bear date the same day Genl Pomroy's did. They have empowered you, if you think fit, to appoint three Brigade Majors of such persons as you chuse to honor with that command and to commission them accordingly. They have appointed a committee to consider and report on the establishing an Hospital and appointing a director. As soon as they have brought in their report and the Congress have come to any resolution on that subject you will be made acquainted with it. Letters are sent with a recommendation to the colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Connecticut to compleat the deficiencies in the regiments belonging to their respective colonies, which you shall retain in the Continental Army. Inclos'd are the Letters to N Hampshire & Rhode Island, wch. please to order forwarded by express immediately. And it is earnestly recommended to Rhode Island to send forward to you three hundred and sixty men lately voted by their General Assembly, and to Connecticut to send forward fourteen hundred men JULY 24, 1775  lately voted by the General Assembly of that colony. Upon intelligence that Mr. Johnson is endeavouring to instigate the Indians to acts of hostility the Congress have impowered General Schuyler to dispose of and employ all the troops in the New York department in such manner as he may think best for the protection and defence of these colonies, the tribes of Indians in friendship and amity with us and most effectually to promote the general interest, still pursuing, if in his power, the former orders of this Congress and subject to the future orders of the Commander in chief.(2) As the Congress are not fully acquainted with the number of the enemy you have to oppose and the extent of your operations, they reposing confidence in your prudence have resolved, that \""such a body of troops be kept in the Massachusetts-Bay as you shall think necessary provided they do not exceed twenty two thousand.\""(3) In a letter from Lord Dartmouth to Govr Martin dated Whitehall May 3d. 1775 after recommending him to embody such of the men in four counties (which Govr Martin had represented as favourable to the views of administration) as are able to bear arms is the following Paragraph. \""I confess to you, Sir, that this appears to me to be a matter of such importance that I cannot too earnestly recommend it to your attention, and that no time may be lost, in case of absolute Necessity I have received his Majesty's commands to write to Genl.

Attention to the public business, and an immediate answer to your letter not being necessary, will, I hope, be my excuse for not sooner acknowledging the receipt of your favor of June the 5th.(1) The case you mention has not yet come under consideration of the Congress. It is a hard one no doubt, but how to give relief, without again introducing that Commodity to public use, is a question of much difficulty. New York is not a singular instance of such suffering, they are plentifully scattered thro all the existing Colonies. Should Congress determine to admit the sale & the use of what tea is on hand, may not bad men take the advantage of the impossibility of distinguishing this from newly imported Tea & exerting their wits conceal the importation, & thus render abortive our Association against this article, the hateful cause of the present disagreeable situation of N. America. I fear this case is among the number of those unavoidable evils introduced into Society, by the want of public virtue. I am acquainted with very many instances of large quantities of stopt Tea in Virginia, but I am happy to find that the Sufferers bear their misfortune with much patience in consideration of the public good resulting therefrom. It is more than a year now since the use of Tea has been totally banished from Virginia. Do you not think Sir, that Gen. Gage will turn his eyes to N. York for Winter Quarters for part of his Army, and may it not be wise to be prepared for resisting a plan calculated to afford shelter in cold weather to Men who will certainly enter upon our destruction when the Season changes?

Influenced solely by this motive, our joint and our earnest request to you is, that all animosities, which have heretofore subsisted among you as inhabitants of distinct colonies may now give place to generous and concurring efforts for the preservation of every thing that can make our common country dear to us. We are fully persuaded that you, as well as we, wish to see your differences terminate in this happy issue. For this desireable purpose, we recommend it to you, that all bodies of armed men kept up under either province be dismissed; that all those, who, on either side, are in confinement or under bail for taking a part in the contest be discharged; and that until the dispute be decided every person be permitted to retain his possessions unmolested. By observing these directions the public tranquility will be secured without injury to the titles on either side. The period we flatter ourselves, will soon arrive when this unfortunate dispute, which has produced much mischief, and, as far as we can learn, no good, will be peaceably and constitutionally determined.

608,dg001620,1775,Roger Sherman to William Williams,"""Roger Sherman to William Williams   Dear Sir Philadelphia July 28th.1775 I this Day received Your favour of the 22d Instant. We Should have wrote to You oftener but had not much Intelligence of importance to communicate but what was by order of Congress Transmitted to the his Honr. the Govr. which we Supposed you would be acquainted with, besides we have had but little leisure being obliged to attend Congress from 8 or 9 in the morning to 4 or 5 in afternoon. We have lately received Six Tuns of Powder which is Sent to the army near Boston, also 5000 lb Sent to General Schuyler this Day. A Ship arrived here from Bristol Yesterday which Sailed the 4th of June & brings intelligence that the account of the Battle of Lexington Sent by the province with the affidavits had arrived in London, that it occasioned the Stocks to fall one & half per cent, that Lord North was greatly Astonished &c but there had not been time to know what effect it would have on the people. JULY 28, 1775  The Congress have recommended the making Salt Petre & gun Powder and offer half a Dollar per pound for all the Salt Petre that Shall be made in any of the United Colonies within fifteen months from this Day. I am Sorry for the Uneasiness occasioned by the appointment of General officers;(1) General Wooster is dissatisfied as well as General Spencer. I feared that would be the Case. We had just heard of the Engagement at Noddles Island before we proceeded to the appointment of General officers, which engagement being conducted by General Putnam occasioned him to be highly esteemed for his Bravery by the Congress. The officers were chosen by Ballot-but previous to giving in the votes I informed the Congress of the Choice and Arrangement made by our Gen. Assembly and that I supposed if the Same order Should be preserved by the Congress it would best Satisfy the officers & the Colony. Colo. Dyer was not then in the Room but came in immediately afterward and made the same representation without knowing what I had said, but the votes turned as you have heard. There was likewise an uneasiness in the Massachusetts Bay on a like occasion which General Washington being made acquainted with before he delivered the Commissions represented it to the Congress and it was rectified, but he had delivered General Putnam his Commission before he heard of the uneasiness, so that I dont know how the difficulty can be remedied at present. I hope Generals Wooster & Spencer will consider the Grand Cause we are Engaged in of So much Importance as not to let it suffer any disadvantage on account of this disagreable circumstance which was not occasioned by any disregard in the Congress toward those Gentlemen but for want of a more mature consideration of the ill consequences that might attend Such a transposition. The Congress has Set much longer than I at first expected it would, but I believe. not longer than was needful. I hope it will adjourn the beginning of next week & have a recess of a few weeks. It is very tedious Sitting here this hot Season: I have herewith Enclosed a Declaration and an address to the people of England. The whole proceedings will be published within a few Days--which will make a considerable volume. The reason why I dont Sign more of the Letters is not because our Lodgings are very far distant but because expresses are often Sent off in haste, and Colo Dyer and Mr Dean being together have the Custody of the Papers. I sometimes Sign with them, sometimes they Sign my name, others they Sign only with their own names it not being very material and in Congress hours it is needful Some Should attend while others are writing. I have not been absent at any time while the Congress has been sitting. Mr. Jonathan Trumbull Junr. was this Day appointed Paymaster for the New York Department. The pay is 50 Dollars per month.

609,dg001621,1775,John Adams to Josiah Quincy,"""John Adams to Josiah Quincy   Philadelphia, 29 July, 1775. I had yesterday the honor of your letter of July 11th, and I feel myself much obliged by your kind attention to me and my family, but much more by your care for the public safety, and the judicious and important observations you have made. Your letters, Sir, so far from being \""a burthen,\"" I consider as an honor to me, besides the pleasure and instruction they afford me. Believe me, Sir, nothing is of more importance to me, in my present most arduous and laborious employment, than a constant correspondence with gentlemen of ex- perience, whose characters are known. The minutest fact, the most trivial event, that is connected with the great American cause, becomes important in the present critical situation of affairs, when a revolution seems to be in the designs of providence, as important as any that ever happened in the affairs of mankind. We jointly lament the loss of a Quincy and a Warren, two characters as great, in proportion to their age, as any that I have ever known in America. Our country mourns the loss of both, and sincerely sympathizes with the feelings of the mother of the one, and the father of the other. They were both my intimate friends, with whom I lived and conversed with pleasure and advantage. I was animated by them in the painful, dangerous course of opposition to the oppressions brought upon our country, and the loss of them has wounded me too deeply to be easily healed. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. The ways of heaven are dark and intricate, but you may remember the words which, many years ago, you and I fondly admired, and which, upon many occasions, I have found advantage in recollecting. \""Why should I grieve, when grieving I must bear, And take with guilt, what guiltless I might share?\"" I have a great opinion of your knowledge and judgment, from long experience, concerning the channels and islands in Boston harbor; but I confess your opinion, that the harbor might be blocked up, and seamen and soldiers made prisoners at discretion, was too bold and enterprising for me, who am not very apt to startle at a daring proposal; but I believe I may safely promise you powder enough, in a little time, for any purpose whatever. We are assured, in the strongest manner, of salt-petre and powder in sufficient plenty, another year, of our own make.(1) That both are made in this city, you may report JULY 29, 1775  with confidence, for I have seen both, and I have seen a set of very large powder works, and another of saltpetre. I hope, Sir, we shall never see a total stagnation of commerce for any length of time. Necessity will force open our ports; trade, if I mistake not, will be more free than usual. Your friend, Dr. Franklin to whom I read your letter, and who desires his kind compliments to you, has been employed in directing the construction of row-galleys for this city. The committee of safety for this province have ordered twenty of them to be built; some of them are finished. I have seen one of them; it has twelve oars on each side. They rowed up the river the first time, four miles in an hour, against a tide which ran down four miles an hour. The Congress have recommended to the colonies to make provision for the defence of their navigation in their harbors, rivers, and on their sea-coasts. Of a floating battery I have no idea --am glad you are contriving one. You tell me, Sir, that General Lee complained that \""he did not find things as the Massachusetts delegates had represented them.\"" What General Lee could mean by this, Sir, I know not. What particular he found different from the representation, I do not know; nor do I know which delegate from the Massachusetts he received a mistaken representation from. I think he should have been particular, that he might not have run the risk of doing an injury. If General Lee should do injustice to two of the Massachusetts delegates, he would commit ingratitude at the same time; for to two of them he certainly owes his promotion in the American army, how great a hazard soever they ran in agreeing to it. I know him very thoroughly, I think, and that he will do great service in our army at the beginning of things, by forming it to order, skill, and discipline. But we shall soon have officers enough. MS not found; reprinted from Adams, Works (Adams), 9:360-62. 1 On July 28 Congress recommended to the colonies several measures designed to encourage the production and collection of saltpetre, sulphur, and gunpowder.

As we have good Reason to believe that an Application to the Congress to recommend a Loan of the Jersey Arms would not succeed, we have agreed not to make it. No Colony has as yet given the Congress any trouble on that Head, and we are unwilling that New York should be the first. We advise however that accurate Accounts of Disbursements for arms be kept, so that should any Charges of that Kind be made against the Continent our Colony may be prepared to support their Claim. Besides it is easy to foresee that New Jersey under the present Circumstances of public Affairs, would very reluctantly part with their Arms, & be displeased with any Recommendation for that Purpose. Permit us to recommend to your most serious attention the Necessity of laying your Hands on all the Powder that is, or may be im- JULY 29, 1775  ported into the Colony. We think none should be permitted to go out of the Province, but by the Express Direction of the Congress or your Committee, and that Magazines of that article should be formed in different Parts of the Province & not that the whole be risqued in one Place. We hope our Province will depend for Defence on their own Exertions, and with out Delay put the Militia on the Footing recommended by the Congress. The Delegates of New Jersey are charged with the Transportation of two Tons & a half of Powder to Dobbs Ferry, where the Congress desire you to have a Boat ready to recieve & forward it to Genl. Schuyler.(2) As to a Treaty or Conference with the five Nations the Congress has already provided for it, and consequently it would be improper to lay the Papers you sent us on that Subject before the Congress.(3) We are Gentlemen with the greatest Respect your most obedt. & hble Servt.

If he calls at our House you will please to receive him complaisantly and thank him for your Present of Pins. I have been treated by him with great Civility, both at this and the former Congress. This Day, I have heard my Parish Priest, Mr. Duffill from 2. Chron. 15. 1. 2. This Gentleman never fails to adapt his Discourse to the Times. He pressed upon his Audience the Necessity of Piety and Virtue, in the present Times of Adversity, and held up to their View the Army before Boston as an Example. He understood, he said, that the Voice of the Swearer was scarcly heard, that the Sabbath was well observed and all Immoralities discountenanced. No doubt there were vicious Individuals, but the general Character was good. I hope this good Mans Information is true, and that this will become more and more the true Character of that Camp. You may well suppose that this Language was exceedingly pleasing to me. We have nothing new, but the Arrival of some Powder. Three little Vessels have certainly arrived, making about Ten Tons in the whole, and four or five Tons have arrived from S. Carolina. A Supply, I think now We shall certainly obtain. Congress have taken Measures for this End, which I hope to have the Pleasure of explaining to you in Person, within a few Days, as Congress has determined to adjourn to sometime in September.(1) I could not vote for this my JULY 30, 1775  self because I thought it might be necessary to keep together, but I could not blame those who did, for really We have been all so assiduous in Business, in this exhausting debilitating Climate, that our Lives are more exposed than they would be in Camp.(2) Love to the Children.

I have long ago learnd to deny my self many of the sweetest Gratifications in Life for the Sake of my Country.

622,dg001636,1775,Richard Henry Lee to George Washington,"""Richard Henry Lee to George Washington   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 1st August 1775 After the fatigue of many days, and of this in particular, I should not sit down at eleven oClock at night to write to a Gentleman of whose goodness of heart I have less doubt than I have of yours. But well knowing that you will pardon what flows from good intentions, I venture to say that my hopes are you will find from what the Congress has already done, and from what I hope they will do AUGUST 1, 1775  tomorrow,(1) that it has been a capital object with us to make your arduous business as easy to you as the nature of things will admit. The business immediately before us being finished, the approaching sickly season here, and the great importance of our presence in the Virga. Convention, have determined a recess of a Month, it standing now, that the Congress shall meet here again on the 5th of September. The capital object of powder we have attended to as far as we could by sending you the other day six Tons, and tomorrow we shall propose sending six or eight Tons more, which, with the supplies you may get from Connecticut, and such further ones from here, as future expected importations may furnish, will I hope enable you to do all that this powerful article can in good hands accomplish. We understand here that Batteries may be constructed at the entrance of the Bay of Boston so as to prevent the egress & regress of any Ships whatever. If this be fact, would it not Sir be a signal stroke to secure the Fleet & Army in and before Boston so as to compel a surrender at discretion. While I write this, I assure you my heart is elated with the contemplation of so great an event. A decisive thing that would at once end the War, and vindicate the injured liberties of America. But your judgment and that of your brave Associates, will best determine the practicability of this business. I think we have taken the most effectual measures to secure the friendship of the Indians all along our extensive frontiers, and by what we learn of the Spirit of our Convention now sitting at Richmond, a Spirit prevails there very sufficient to secure us on that quarter. The particulars of their conduct I refer you to Mr. Frazer for, who comes fresh from thence, & who goes to the Camp a Soldier of fortune.(2) You know him better than I do, and I am sure you will provide for him as he deserves. We are here as much in the dark about news from England as you are, the London Ships having been detained long beyond the time they were expected. The indistinct accounts we have, tell us of great confusion all over England, and a prodigious fall of the Stocks. I heartily wish it may be true, but if it is not so now, I have no doubt of its shortly being the case. I will not detain you longer from more important affairs, than to beg the favor of you, when your leisure permits, to oblige me with a line by Post, to let us know how you go on. There is nothing I wish so much as your success, happiness, and safe return to your family and Country, because I am with perfect sincerity dear Sir Your Affectionate friend and countryman.

I would chuse you should receive yours in the most respectful Manner; every Lover of his Country who considers that it is absolutely essential to the Preservation of America that the Resolutions of the Congress should be considered as sacred and inviolable will by no means take any Measure which may draw into Question the Authority of that Congress; this would be not only injurious to the common Cause but ruinous to the Persons who May do it: The Officers above the Rank of Colo. are well provided for I think, and all below that by a proper Representation to the Congress through their General or any other Way which he may direct I doubt not will be properly regarded . . .

You and I and America in general may almost universally wish in the first place to establish our Liberties; our second wish is a reunion with Britain; so may we preserve the Empire intire and the Constitutional Liberty founded in whiggish principles, handed down to us by our Ancestors. In order to strengthen ourselves to accomplish these great ends we ought in my opinion to conduct ourselves so as to unite America and divide Britain. This as it appears to me may most likely be effected by doing rather more than less in the peaceable Line than would be required if our petition is rejected with contempt which I think most likely. Will not our Friends in England be still more exasperated against the Court, and will not our very moderate Men on this side of the water be compelled to own the necessity of opposing Force by Force? The rejection of the New-York petition was very servicable to America. If our petition should be granted the Troops will be recalled, the obnoxious Acts repealed, and we restored to the footing of 1763. If the petition should not be granted, but so far attended to as to lay the ground work of a negotiation Britain must I think be ruined by the delay. If she subdues us at all it must be by a most violent and sudden exertion of her force, and if we can keep up a strong party in England headed by such characters as Lord Chatham and the others in the present opposition, Bute, Mansfield, and North, and a corrupt majority cannot draw the British force fully into action against us. Our Friends will certainly continue such so long as they see we do not desire to break from a reasonable and beneficial Connection with the Mother Country, but if, unhappily for the whole Empire, they should once be con- AUGUST 18, 1775  vinced by our conduct that we design to break from that Connection I am apprehensive they will thenceforth become our most dangerous enemies. The greatest and first Law of self preservation will justify, nay compel it. The cunning Scotchmen and Lord North fully feel the force of this reasoning; hence their Industry to make it be believed in England that we have a scheme of Independance, a general term they equivocally use to signify to the Friends of Liberty a breaking off all connection; and to Tories that we dispute the Supremacy of Parliament. In the Extent of the Declaratory Act is the power of binding us by its acts, in all causes whatever. The latter we do most certainly dispute, and I trust shall successfully fight against, with the approbation of every honest Englishman. Lord North's proposition, and consequent resolution of Parliament were insidiously devised to wear the face of peace, and Embarrass us in the Choice of evils--either to accept and be slaves or reject and increase the number and power of our Enemies. I flatter myself that our petition will present to him only a choice of means injurious to his villanous schemes.\"" Concludes with description of the proceedings of a recent meeting of the Maryland Provincial Convention.(1) ""

Nothing (your presence excepted) can be more agreeable than a Line from You, if Dated Montreal the better. I am Dr Sir Yours S. Deane ""

641,dg001655,1775,A Delegate in Congress to a Correspondent in London,"""A Delegate in Congress to a Correspondent in London   [August 24, 1775] You will see by the publick Papers some of the Proceedings of our Congress; the rest will soon be published. Three million of Dollars are now striking by their Orders, for defending the Rights of America. The very Quakers in this and other Provinces are in Arms, and appear in the Field every Day in their Regimentals, and make as good a Figure as the best; you may be sure we are in earnest, when they handle a Musquet. All trade to England, and every other Part of the World, will most certainly be stopped on the 10th of next Month, and if the Ministry do not very soon see the Justice and Equity of placing the Colonies in the same Situation they were in before the Year 1763, in which both Sides experience Satisfaction and mutual Benefit, then you may expect to hear in the Course of next Winter that the Congress have opened all our Ports to every foreign Power that will come with their Manufactures, and trade with US for our Produce. Whether that will not be one Means of dissolving our Connection entirely with Great Britain, I shall leave to wiser Heads to determine; I am far, very far, from wishing such an Event; but, nevertheless, I am very apprehensive, from the present Temper of our People, that a few more violent Steps will lay a Foundation for it. MS not found; reprinted from the Daily Advertiser (London), October 19, 1775.

I am inclined, however, to believe that these Fears far exceed any Occasion that has been given for them.\"" On the other hand, some of the Wyandots and Mingoes have not \""such friendly Dispositions as are to be wished for,\"" and the Shawnees appear to be disregarding an invitation to meet with the Virginians. \""These Considerations determined me to dispatch Messengers to the Indians with Belts and Strings of Wampum, and with written Invitations to attend the Treaty appointed by the Congress.(1) The Nations to whom I have instructed the Messengers to go are the Delawares, the Shawnese, the Mingoes living on Scioto, the Wyendotes (or Hurons), the Tawas, and the six Nations residing on French Creek and the Alleghany River.... The 10th of Septr. is the Day named. . . . Eight Belts were, about ten Days ago, carried down this River to the Shawnese Tribe by three of the six Nations, and two Shawnese.

643,dg001657,1775,Thomas Jefferson to John Randolph,"""Thomas Jefferson to John Randolph   Monticello. Aug. 25. 1775. Regrets that Randolph is leaving his native land.(1) Continues: \""Looking with fondness towards a reconciliation with Great Britain, I cannot help hoping you may be able to contribute towards expediting this good work. I think it must be evident to yourself that the ministry have been deceived by their officers on this side the water, who (for what purposes I cannot tell) have constantly represented the American opposition as that of a small faction, in which the body of the people took little part. This you can inform them of your own knolege to be untrue. They have taken it into their heads too that we are cowards and shall surrender at discretion to an armed force. The past and future operations of the war must confirm or undeceive them on that head. I wish they were thoroughly and minutely acquainted with every circumstance relative to America as it exists in truth. I am persuaded this would go far towards disposing them to reconciliation. Even those in parliament who are called friends to America seem to know nothing of our real determinations. I observe they pronounced in the last parliament that the Congress of 1774 did not mean to insist rigorously on the terms they held out, but kept something in reserve to give up; and in fact that they would give up everything but the article of taxation. Now the truth is far from this, as I can affirm, and put my honor to the as sertion; and their continuance in this error may perhaps have very ill consequences. The Congress stated the lowest terms they thought possible to be accepted in order to convince the world they were not unreasonable. They gave up the monopoloy and regulation of trade, and all the acts of parliament prior to 1764, leaving to British generosity to render these at some future time as easy to America as the interest of Britain would admit. But this was before blood was spilt. I cannot affirm, but have reason to think, these terms would not now be accepted. I wish no false sense of honor, no ignorance of our real intentions, no vain hope that partial concessions of right will be accepted may induce the ministry to trifle with accomodation till it shall be put even out of our own power ever to accomodate. If indeed Great Britain, disjoined from her colonies, be a match for the most potent nations of Europe with the colonies thrown into their scale, they may go on securely. But if they are not assured of this, it would be certainly unwise, by trying the event of another campaign, to risque our accepting a foreign aid which perhaps may not be obtainable but on a condition of everlasting avulsion from Great Britain. This would be thought a hard condition to those who still wish for reunion with their parent country. I am sincerely one of those, and would rather be in dependance on Great Britain, properly limited, than on any nation upon earth, or than on no nation. But I am one of AUGUST 25, 1775  those too who rather than submit to the right of legislating for us assumed by the British parliament, and which late experience has shewn they will so cruelly exercise, would lend my hand to sink the whole island in the ocean. \""If undeceiving the minister as to matters of fact may change his dispositions, it will perhaps be in your power by assisting to do this, to render service to the whole empire, at the most critical time certainly that it has ever seen. Whether Britain shall continue the head of the greatest empire on earth, or shall return to her original station in the political scale of Europe depends perhaps on the resolutions of the succeeding winter. God send they may be wise and salutary for us all!\"" Encourages him to write often, as \""communication among individuals may be mutually beneficial to the contending parties.\"" ""

I have wrote you two Letters, since my return from Philadelphia & should not trouble you again at this time were it not for my Situation respecting Mr. Skeene. I have not seen him since my return but am repeatedly inform'd of his receiving such Treatment, as is quite inconsistent with the Assurances I gave him at Philadelphia, of which I would think less had I not been Authoriz'd by the Congress, to make them.(1) To a person of any sensibility, nothing can be more painfull than to be constantly liable to the reflections of having his faith which he pledg'd & word of honor violated before his face. I have as contemtible an Opinion of Mr. Skeene as of any man in one point of light--his political principals, but as a prisoner he is intitled to the performance of the Conditions on which he was made such. I return'd but this instant from the Camp, & find that but last week a party beset his lodgings, insulted him, & searched all his papers &c. Your honor I trust will give some Order I hope to the Committee respectg him. If for particular reasons you think it best to Continue him where he now is, I wish to be favor'd with them, that I may reconcile the Matter to the congress, whose desires have been misunderstood, & so not complied with (2)--but give me leave to hint it as my Opinion, that he is in the very worst Situation for the Public. A country Village is inquisitive, & Communicative every where. He is AUGUST 27, 1775  on a large Road and one which the people, passing to & from both Armies use. He has therefore all the intelligence of every thing he can wish to know, & 'twill the advantage of sending it to the Enemy that he would have in a Town. One thought farther, he is a very communicative man, & in the Secrets of Administration, were he near some Judicious person many important discoveries might be made, of this I am Confident from the Opportunities I had with him at Philadelphia. I will Trouble your honor no farther on this disagreeable Subject, as I am Confident you will give such Orders as will do me Justice, as well as the Public in whose behalf, and by whose express Orders I gave the Assurances I did.

Mr [William] Goddard, Riding Surveyor to the (',en. Post Office is gone to the Southward, for Settling the new Post-Offices all along to Georgia. Mr [Richard] Bache, the Comptroller, is to set out next Week Northward on the same Business, who will take with him Directions from me to establish all the Officers in your Government that you recommend and the new Offices and Stages that appear likely to support themselves. I am glad to hear that the Gunsmith's Business goes on so well with you. We make great Progress on it here; but the Price is high. If we would acquire that Manufacture in Perfection, it must be by assuring the Workmen of a large Demand, for a Number of Years, and at a Price certain. Then they will be encourag'd to bring up Apprentices for different Parts of the Work, and also to make Tools and Machines for facilitating & expediting it, such as Fuages for Lock Plates & Cocks Mills for grinding and boring the Barrels, &c. Those bred to Parts of the Work only, will dispatch more and do it better. And then I am confident Arms may be made as good and as cheap in America as in any Part of the World. I intend therefore to propose to our Assembly to give that Encouragement here, by engaging to take 2000 Muskets per Annum for Ten Years, at a good Price, which I AUGUST 27, 1775  doubt not will in that time establish the Manufacture among us; and an Arsenal with 20,000 good Firelocks in it, will be no bad thing for the Colony. As the Numbers of People are continually increasing, we can never be long overstock'd with the Article of Arms. And I wish the Congress may think fit to recommend the same Project to the other Colonies. I congratulate you on the plentiful Year with you as well as with us. It makes one smile to see in the English Papers, the Ignorance of some of their Political Writers, who fancy we cannot continue the Non Importation Agreement; because if we do it must starve us. I lament with you the Want of a naval Force. I hope the next Winter will be employ'd in forming one. When we are no longer fascinated with the Idea of a Speedy Reconciliation, we shall exert ourselves to some purpose. 'Till then Things will be done by Halves. Those you mention who seem frightened at finding themselves where they are, will by degrees recover Spirits when they find by Experience how inefficient merely mercenary the regular Troops are, when oppos'd to Freeholders & Freemen, fighting for their Liberties & Properties. A Country of such People was never yet conquer'd, (unless through their own Divisions) by any absolute Monarch and his Mercenaries. But such States have often conquer'd Monarchies, and led mighty Princes captive in Triumph. I shall be curious to hear more Particulars of your new mechanical Genius.

I write but seldom to you, because at this time the most innocent Correspondence with me may be suspected, and attended with Inconvenience to yourself. Our united Wishes for a Reconciliation of the two Countries, are not I fear soon to be accomplished; for I hear your Ministry are determin'd to persevere in their mad Measures, and here I find the firmest Determination to resist at all Hazards. The Event may be doubtful, but it is clear to me that if the Contest is only to be ended by our Submission, it will not be a short one. We have given up our Commerce; our last Ships, 34 Sail, left this Port the 9th Instant. And in our Minds we give up our Sea Coast (tho' Part may be a little disputed) to the barbarous Ravages of your Ships of War; but the internal Country we shall defend. It is a good one and fruitful. It is with our Liberties, worth defending, and it will  SEPTEMBER 13, 1775  itself by its Fertility enable us to defend it. Agriculture is the great Source of Wealth & Plenty. By cutting off our Trade you have thrown us to the Earth, whence like Antaeus we shall rise yearly with fresh Strength and Vigour. This will be delivered to you by Mr Jonathan Williams, a Nephew of mine, whom I left in my Lodgings. Any thing you think fit to send me, may be safely trusted to his Care and Discretion. He is a valuable young Man, having, with great Industry & excellent Talents for Business, a very honest and good Heart. If he should stay in London, I beg leave to recommend him to a little of your Notice. I am here immers'd in so much Business that I have scarce time to eat or sleep. The Winter I promise myself will bring with it some Relaxation. This Bustle is unsuitable to Age.

With sincere and great Esteem & Respect, I am ever, my dear Friend, Your affectionate & most obedt huml Servant B Franklin [P.S.] The Perfidy of General Gage in breaking his Capitulation with Boston & detaining their Effects. The Firing of Broadsides from Men of War into defenceless Towns & Villages filled with Women and Children. The Burning of Charlestown wantonly without the least Reason or Provocation. The encouraging our Blacks to rise and murder their Masters. But above all, The Exciting the Savages to fall upon our innocent Outsettlers, Farmers, (who have no Concern in, and from their Situation can scarce have any Knowledge of this Dispute) especially when it is considered that the Indian Manner of making War, is by surprizing Families in the Night, and killing all, without Distinction of Age or Sex!(1) What would be thought of it, if the Congress should hire an Italian Bravo to break into the House of one of your Ministers, and murder him in his Bed? All his Friends would open in full Cry against us as Assassins, Murderers & Villains, and the Walls of your Parliament House would resound with their Execrations! Of these two damnable Crimes which is the greatest? These Proceedings of Officers of the Crown, who it is presumed either act by instruction, or know they shall please by such Conduct, give People here a horrid Idea of the Spirit of your Government.

He speaks, as it is reported, Several Languages, English, Dutch, French, Latin &c. -is reported to be a learned Man. He is a Man of a warm and zealous Spirit. It is said that he possesses considerable Property. Houstoun is a young Gentleman, by Profession a Lawyer, educated under a Gentleman of Eminence in South Carolina. He seems to be sensible and spirited, but rather inexperienced. Bullock is cloathed in American Manufacture. Thomas Nelson Esquire, George Wythe Esqr., and Francis Lightfoot Lee Esq. appeared as Delegates from Virginia. Nelson is a fat Man, like the late Coll. Lee of Marblehead. He is a Speaker, and alert and lively, for his Weight. Wythe is a Lawyer, it is said of the first Eminence. Lee is a Brother of Dr. Arthur, the late Sheriff of London,(2) and our old Friend Richard Henry, sensible, and patriotic, as the rest of the Family. Deane says, that two Persons, of the Name of De Witt of Dutch Extraction, one in Norwich the other in Windham, have made Salt Petre with Success-and propose to make a great deal. That there is a Mine of Lead at Middletown, which will afford a great Quantity. That Works are preparing to smelt and refine it, which will go in a fortnigllt. There is a Mine at Northampton, which Mr. W. Bowdoin spent much Money in working, with much Effect, tho little Profit. Langdon and Bartlett came in this Evening, from Portsmouth.(3) 400 Men are building a Fort on Pierce's Island to defend the Town vs. Ships of War. Upon recollecting the Debates of this Day in Congress, there appears to me a remarkable Want of Judgment in some of our Members. Chace is violent and boisterous, asking his Pardon. He is tedious upon frivolous Points. So is E. Rutledge. Much precious Time is indiscreetly expended. Points of little Consequence are started, and debated [with] warmth. Rutledge is a very uncouth, and ungracefull Speaker. He shruggs his Shoulders, distorts his Body, nods and wriggles with his Head, and looks about with his Eyes, from side to side, and Speaks thro his~Nose, as the Yankees Sing. His Brother John  SEPTEMBER 15, 1775  dodges his Head too, rather disagreably, and both of them Spout out their Language in a rough and rapid Torrent, but without much Force or Effect. Dyer is long winded and roundabout-obscure and cloudy. Very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy Man, means and judges well. Sherman's Air is the Reverse of Grace. There cannot be a more striking Contrast to beautifull Action, than the Motions of his Hands. Generally, he stands upright with his Hands before him. The fingers of his left Hand clenched into a Fist, and the Wrist of it, grasped with his right. But he has a clear Head and sound Judgment. But when he moves a Hand, in any thing like Action, Hogarths Genuis could not have invented a Motion more opposite to grace. It is Stiffness, and Aukwardness itself. Rigid as Starched Linen or Buckram. Aukward as a junior Batchelor, or a Sophomore. Mr. Dickinsons Air, Gate, and Action are not much more elegant. ""

We met, and passed near enough to touch Elbows. He passed without moving his Hat, or Head or Hand. I bowed and pulled off my Hat. He passed hautily by. The Cause of his Offence, is the Letter no doubt which Gage has printed in Drapers Paper.(1) I shall for the future pass him, in the same manner. But I was determined to make my Bow, that I might know his Temper. We are not to be upon speaking Terms, nor bowing Terms, for the time to come. This Evening had Conversation with Mr. Bullock of Georgia. I asked him, whether Georgia had a Charter? What was the Extent of the Province? What was their Constitution? How Justice was administered? Who was Chancellor, who Ordinary? and who Judges? He says they have County Courts for the Tryal of civil Causes under £8-and a C[hief] Justice, appointed from Home and 3 other Judges appointed by the Governor, for the decision of all other Causes civil and criminal, at Savanna. That the Governor alone is both Chancellor and Ordinary. Parson Gordon of Roxbury, spent the Evening here.(2) I fear his indiscreet Prate will do harm in this City. He is an eternal Talker, and somewhat vain, and not accurate nor judicious. Very zealous in the Cause, and a well meaning Man, but incautious, and not sufficiently tender of the Character of our Province, upon which at this Time much depends. Fond of being thought a Man of Influence, at Head Quarters, and with our Council and House, and with the general Officers of the Army, and also with Gentlemen in this City, and other Colonies.

I arrived here in good Health, after an agreable Journey, last Wednesday; There had not been Members enough to make a House, several Colonies being absent, so that I was just in Time. The next day, an adequate No. appeared, and Congress has sat ever since. Georgia is now fully represented, and united to the other Twelve. Their Delegates are Dr. Zubly, a Clergyman of the independant Perswasion who has a Parish in that Colony and a good deal of Property. He is a Native of Switzerland, is a Man of Learning and Ingenuity. It is said he is Master of several Languages, Greek, Latin, French, Dutch and English. In the latter it is said, he writes tolerably. He is a Man of Zeal and Spirit, as We have already seen upon several occasions. However, as he is the first Gentleman of the Cloth who has appeared in Congress, I can not but wish he may be the last. Mixing the sacred Character, with that of the Statesman, as it is quite unnecessary at this Time of day, in these Colonies, is not attended with any good Effects. The Clergy are universally too little acquainted with the World, and the Modes of Business, to engage in civil affairs with any Advantage. Besides those of them, who are really Men of Learning, have conversed with Books so much more than Men, as to be too much loaded with Vanity, to be good Politicians. Mr. Bullock is another of the Georgian Delegates, a sensible Man, a Planter I suppose. Mr. Houstoun is the third, a young Lawyer of Modesty as well as sense and Spirit which you will say is uncommon  SEPTEMBER 17, 1775  Mr. Jones and Dr. Hall are not yet arrived. Mr. Henry is made a General in Virginia, and therefore could not come. Mr. Pendleton and Coll. Bland excused them selves on Account of Age and ill Health. Messrs. Nelson, Wythe, and Lee, are chosen and are here in the Stead of the other three. Wythe and Lee are inoculated. You shall hear more about them.

676,dg00231,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dr Sir Philadelphia Septr. 17.1775 I have nothing in particular to write. Our most gracious K--- given a fresh Proof of his Clemency, in his answer to the City. But no more of Politicks, at present. If this Scratch of a Pen should fall into the Hands of the wiseacre Gage, as long as I confine myself, to Matrimony, and Horsemanship, there will be no Danger. Be it known to you then that two of the most unlikely Things, within the whole Congress of Possibility, have really, and actually happened. The first is the Suden Marriage of our President, whose agreable Lady honours us with her Presence and contributes much to our good Humour, as well as to the Happiness of the President. So much for that. The next Thing is more wonderfull Still. You know the aversion, which your Secretary (1) has ever entertained to riding, on Horseback. He never would be perswaded to mount a Horse. The last time we were here, I often laboured to perswade him, for the Sake of his Health, but in vain. Soon after We Sat out, on the last Journey, I reflected that Some Degree of Skill and Dexterity in Horsemanship, was necessary to the Character of a Statesman. It would take more Time and Paper than I have to Spare, to shew the Utility of Horsemanship to a Politician; So I shall take this for granted. But I pointed out the particulars to him, and likewise shewed him that Sociability would be greatly promoted, by his mounting one of my Horses. On Saturday the second day of September 1775, in the Town of Grafton He was prevailed on to put my Servant with his, into Harrisons Chaise and to mount upon my Horse, a very genteel, and easy little Creature. We were all disappointed and Surprised. Instead of the Taylor riding to Brentford We beheld, an easy, genteel Figure,  SEPTEMBER 17, 1775  upon the Horse, and a good deal of Spirit and facility, in the Management of the Horse, insomuch that We soon found our Servants were making Some disagreable Comparisons, and Since our arrival here I am told that Fessenden (impudent Scoundrel!) reports that the Secretary rides fifty per Cent better than your Correspondent. In this manner, We rode to Woodstock, where we put up for the Sabbath. It was Soon observed that the Secretary, could not Sit So erect in his Chair as he had Sat upon his Horse, but Seemed to be neither sensible of the Disease or the Remedy. I Soon perceived and apprised him of both. On Sunday Evening, at Mr Dexters, where we drank Coffee & Spent an agreable Evening I perswaded him to purchase two yards of flannell which we carried to our Landlady, who with the assistance of a Tayler Woman in the House, made up a Pair of Drawers, which the next Morning were put on, and not only defended the Secretary from any further Injury, but entirely healed the little Breach which had been begun. Still an Imperfection remained. Our Secretary had not yet learned to mount and dismount. Two Servants were necessary to attend upon these Occasions, one to hold the Bridle and Stirrup, the other to boost the Secretary. This was rather a ridiculous Circumstance Still. At last, I undertook to instruct him the necessary Art of mounting. I had my Education to this Art, under Bates, the celebrated Equerry, and therefore might be Supposed to be a Master of it. I taught him to grasp the Bridle, with his Right Hand over the Pummell of his Saddle, to place his left Foot firm in the Stirrup; to twist his left Hand into the Horses Main, about half Way between his Ears and his Shoulders, and then a vigorous Exertion of his Strength would carry him very gracefully into the Seat, without the least Danger of falling over on [the] other Side. The Experiment was tryed and Succeeded to Admiration. Thus equipped and instructed, our Horseman rode all the Way from Woodstock to Philadelphia, Sometimes upon one of my Horses, Sometimes on the other-and acquired fresh Strength, Courage, Activity and Spirit every day. His Health is much improved by it, and I value myself, very much upon the Merit of having probably added Several Years, to a Life So important to his Country, by the little Pains I took to perswade him to mount and teach him to ride. Sully and Cecil were both Horsemen, and you know I would not have our Americans inferiour to them in the Smallest Accomplishment. Pray Mrs Warren to write to me. I would to her, if I had half so much Time. ""

With Pleasure I observe that you have lately received some Powder & expect some Lead & Arms from our Colony. I hope the Measures taken by Congress and by the Colonies will furnish you with such Quantities as will allow the freest Scope to your military Plans & Operations. That Part of your Letter relative to removing the Stock from the Islands & Sea Coasts I laid before our Genl. Assembly. I shewed the necessity of immediately doing it in the most forcible Terms & such Measures were immediately adopted as have I imagine secured all our Cattle from the Enemy by this Time. The innumerable Difficulties which you must have encountered in the Command of an Army under different Establishments in Want of Arms Ammunition, regular Supplies of Provisions, a military Chest,  SEPTEMBER 17, 1775  experienced officers a due Organization & a hundred other Things I have some tho' not an adequate Conception of but from the Accts. which I have the Pleasure to receive from my Friends in Camp I doubt not but your wise & steady Attention to the Service will surmount all obstacles & that by the opening of next Campaign you will have the finest Army under Your Commd. which ever was formed in America. I am too sensible of the Multiplicity of Business in which you are engaged to flatter Myself with a regular Correspondence but whenever you shall communicate any thing necessary for the public Good to Me you may rely upon my best & constant Endeavours both in our own Colony & in Congress to promote the Service. I most chearfully entered into a solemn Engagement upon your Appointment to support you with my Life & Fortune and shall most religiously & with the highest Pleasure endeavour to discharge that duty. The Congress began to do Business Last Wednesday but many Members are still absent; Colo. Lee, Colo. Harrison & Mr. Jefferson & the No. Carolina Delegates & some others are not arrived. Mr. Randolph has been confined with a fever two or three Days. Messrs. Wythe & Lee are under Enoculation so that Colo. Nelson alone attends from your Colony. We entered into the Consideration of your Letters yesterday, for Want of a thorough Knowledge of military affairs it was not so well understood how an officers having several Appointments could make any Difference in Rank for instance how a Genl. officers having a Regiment or Company or a Feild officers having a Compy. could alter his Rank. It seemed to be the general Opinion that all officers should receive Pay only for one Commission & that for their highest & that when the Army was reformed no Person should sustain more than one office but some seemed to apprehend that if a Genl. officer appointed by his Colony as Colonel of a particular Regiment or a Field officer as Captain of a Company were refused by the Congress Commissions as such that the Colonies would appoint other Colonels & Captains in their Places that this increase of officers would augment the Difficulties attending the Reduction of the Troops if such a Measure should be adopted. Upon the whole the matter was referred & as soon as your several Letters are considered you will be acquainted with the Sentiments of the Congress. (We have no News here from England later than 18th July. By the Kings Answer to the Petition of the Lord Mayor Aldermen & Commons of the City of London it appears He is determined to pursue and enforce his Measures.(1) God be thanked that however severe the Contest may prove We are now in such a happy Way that the End must be the Establishment of American Liberty.)

This Committee was chosen by the House, but half of them are not Members and therefore not the Choice of the People. All this is just. He mentions many Particular Instances, in which Dickenson has blundered. He thinks him warped by the Quaker Interest and the Church Interest too. Thinks his Reputation past the Meridian, and that Avarice is growing upon him. Says that Henry and Mifflin both complained to him very much about him. But Rush I think, is too much of a Talker to be a deep Thinker. Elegant not great. In the Evening Mr. Bullock and Mr. Houstoun, two Gentlemen from Georgia, came into our Room and smoked and chatted, the whole Evening. Houstoun and Adams disputed the whole Time in good Humour. They are both Dabbs at Disputation I think. H. a Lawyer by Trade is one of Course, and Adams is not a Whit less addicted to it than the Lawyers. The Q. was whether all America was not in a State of War, and whether We ought to confine ourselves to act upon the defensive only. He was for acting offensively next Spring or this fall if the Petition was rejected or neglected. If it was not answered, and favourably answered, he would be for acting vs. Britain and Britains as in open War vs. French and frenchmen. Fit Privateers and take their Ships, any where. These Gentlemen give a melancholly Account of the State of Georgia and S. Carolina. They say that if 1000 regular Troops should land in Georgia and their commander be provided with Arms   and Cloaths enough, and proclaim Freedom to all the Negroes who would join his Camp, 20,000 Negroes would join it from the two Provinces in a fortnight. The Negroes have a wonderfull Art of communicating Intelligence among themselves. It will run severall hundreds of Miles in a Week or Fortnight. They say, their only Security is this, that all the Kings Friends and Tools of Government have large Plantations and Property in Negroes. So that the Slaves of the Tories would be lost as well as those of the Whiggs. I had nearly forgot a Conversation with Dr. Coombe concerning assassination, Henry 4., Sully, Buckingham &c. &c. Coombe has read Sullys Memoirs with great Attention. ""

The Weather is very cool here for this Season, therefore if you determine on coming down the Time fixed above will be a good one though by the Way I see no End to Our Business, & it is as extensive as endless. How ran Elections? Though personally I do not feel myself Interested however agreeable to one of my Sensibility the suffrages of ones Countrymen are, yet one great Object swallows up like Aarons Rod all the Lesser. Liberty, or Death is before Us, & I can conceive of No Alternative, if the former it will take a long Time to obtain, & afterwards settle it, on a permanent Basis. If the Latter (as I trust no American patriot will so desert himself as to prefer a short existence in Slavery to it) why then, it will but Shorten a Life of Care and Anxiety. We expect intelligence from G Brittain every hour. I am impatient for it, not that I think it will alter our Measures, for I am very confident as to the Complexion of it before it arrives but that the least & every Shadow of an excuse, for not pursuing the most vigorous Measures may be removed from the really Timid, & those pretendedly so. You must not expect Long Letters from Me, as I am more taken up, than when here last Summer and among other Things, the Settlement of Our Continental Expences & Charges of the Warr has fell to the Lot of a Comme.

Sept. 24 [i.e. 25] An Uneasiness, among some of the Members concerning a Contract with Willing & Morris, for Powder, by which the House, without any Risque at all will make a clear Profit of 12,000£ at least.(1) Dyer and Deane spoke in public, Lewis to me in private about it. All think it exorbitant. S. Adams desired that the Resolve of Congress, upon which the Contract was founded might be read: he did not recollect it. De Hart. One of the Contractors, Willing, declared to this Congress that he looked upon the Contract to be that the first Cost should be insured to them, not the 14£ a Barrell for the Powder. R. R. Livingston. I never will vote to ratify the Contract in the sense that Morris understands it. Willing. I am as a Member of the House, a Party to that Contract, but was not privy to the Bargain. I never saw the Contract, untill I saw it in Dr. Franklins Hand. I think it ensures only the first Cost.  SEPTEMBER 25, 1775  My Partner thinks it ensures the whole. He says that Mr. Rutledge said at the Time, that Congress should have nothing to do with Sea risque. The Committee of this City offered 19£- I would wish to have nothing to do with the Contract: but to leave it to my Partner, who is a Man of Reason and Generosity, to explain the Contract with the Gentlemen who made it with him. J. Rutledge. Congress was to run no Risque only vs. Men of War and Customhouse officers. I was surprized this Morning to hear that Mr. Morris understood it otherwise. If he wont execute a Bond, such as We shall draw, I shall not be at a loss what to do. Johnson. An hundred Ton of Powder was wanted. Ross. In Case of its Arrival Congress was to pay £14. If Men of War, or Custom house officers, should get it, Congress was to pay first Cost only as I understood it. Zubly. We are highly favoured. 14£ We are to give if We get the Powder: and 14£ if We dont get it. I understand Persons enough will contract to supply Powder at 15£ and run all risques. Willing. Sorry any Gentleman should be severe. Mr. Morris's Character is such that he cannot deserve it. Lynch. If Morris will execute the Bond, well, if not the Committee will report. Deane. It is very well that this matter has been moved and that so much has been said upon it. Dyer. There are not Ten Men in the Colony I come from, who are worth so much Money as will be made clear by this Contract. Ross. What has this Matter to the present debate, whether Connecticutt Men are worth much or no. It proves there are no Men there whose Capital or Credit are equal to such Contracts. That is all. Harrison. The Contract is made and the Money paid. How can We get it back? Johnson. Let us consider the Prudence of this Contract. If it had not been made Morris would have got 19£, and not have set forward a second Adventure. Gadsden. Understands the Contract as Morris does, and yet thinks it a prudent one, because Morris would have got 19£. J. Adams.----&c. &c. &c. Cushing. I move that We take into Consideration a Method of keeping up an Army in the Winter. Gadsden. Seconds the Motion and desires that a Motion made in Writing some clays ago, and postponed may be read as it was. As also Passages of G. Washingtons Letter. S. Adams. The General has promised another Letter in which We shall have his Sentiments. We shall have it tomorrow perhaps. Lynch. If We have, We shall only loose the Writing of a Letter.   J. Adams moved that the Generals Advice should be asked concerning Barracks &c. and that a Committee be appointed to draught a Letter. Lynch seconded the Motion. A Committee was appointed. Lynch, J. Adams, and Coll. Lee the Men.(2) Sherman moved that a Committee be appointed of one Member from each Colony, to receive, and examine all Accounts. S. Adams seconded the Motion. Harrison asked is this the Way of giving Thanks? S. Adams. Was decent to the Committee for Rifle Mens Accounts, meant no Reflections upon them, was sorry that the worthy Gentleman from Virginia, conceived that any was intended. He was sure there was no foundation for it. Paine. Thought that Justice and Honour required that We should carefully examine all Accounts, and see to the Expenditure of all public Monies. That the Minister would find out our Weakness, and would foment divisions among our People. He was sorry that Gentlemen could not hear Methods proposed, to settle and pay Accounts in a manner that would give Satisfaction to the People, without seeming to resent them. Harrison. Now the Gentlemen have explained themselves he had no Objection, but when it was proposed to appoint a new Committee in the Place of the former one, it implied a Reflection. Deane.--------. Willing. These Accounts are for Tents, Arms, Cloathing, &c. as well as Expences of the Riflemen, &c. Nelson moved that 20,000 dollars be voted into the Hands of the other Committee to settle the Accounts. S. Adams. Seconded the Motion, but still hoped that some time or other, a Committee would be appointed of one Member from each Colony, to examine all Accounts because he thought it reasonable.(3) ""

As to Wales & Bingham there was but Very few thot them fitt for the least Command when they Obtained it.

He has rather appeared to be a still quiet fehow & of but little Influence, but hope Capt Thos with the Assistance of his friends will be Able to make his way good. The Money Ordered by Congress was forworded soon after our Arrival and were Surprised to find that Nothing had been done by the delegates of this Province, Who were especially entrusted to Send forward the Money as also a Number of Tents & other Necessaries for the Army but when we came here found Nothing had been done in our recess. For ought I can See at present you must depend principally upon Connecticutt for the Provision Supplys for the Army the bread kind as well as Others. I wish our Soldiery would be Content with Rye & Indian [corn] two or 3 times a week. Believe then our Colony could easily furnish the whole. You must set the farmers in Connecticutt Immediately to thresh out their Wheet &c.

For the present it is as yet quite undetermined What force will be Necessary to be kept up thro the Winter. I know your Trouble & expences is great and your present allowance but small but believe the Congress will be disposed to make you a proper allowance. It will be best for you to keep a good account of your expenses, Clerks, Store keepers &c as it is not expected their pay will come out of your small pittance and it would be well for you to be prepared to make a proper representation to the Congress of the State of your business Contracts Number of persons you are oblidgd to employe & to Transact with, the quantitys you Supply, the Vast sums that goe  SEPTEMBER 25, 1775  thro your hands & the Numbers you have to pay out to, to which it will be Well to have the Generalls (at least) & the other Generall officers recommendation for further Allowance. I should think a small Commission might be best as the Amount would not be so Obvious to every Vulgar eye to make their Invidious reflections upon, but as all is uncertain, you must take good and prudent care to guard your self against loss. Tell my son I wrote to him a few days agoe & put him in mind to write to me for he is Very Slack about letter writing, but hope you will favor me with your observations from time to time, how he makes out &c.

I shall be unhappy till I hear farther from you, tho I hope for the best. I have enjoyed better Health, this session than the last, and have suffered less from certain Fidgets, Pidlings, and Irritabilities which have become so famous. A more serious Spirit prevails than heretofore. We shall soon be in Earnest. I begin to think We are so. Our Injunctions of Secrecy are so much insisted on, that I must be excused from disclosing one Iota of any Thing that comes to my Knowledge as a Member of the Congress. Our Journal of the last session however, I conjecture will be speedily printed and then I will inclose it to you. I want to be informed from Hour to Hour, of any Thing which passes in Boston--whether our Friends come out--what Property they bring?-how they fare in Town? How the Tories subsist &c. &c. &c. Whether the Troops are healthy or sickly? I also want to know every Thing which passes in our Army. The Feats and Exploits of our little Naval Armaments would be very agreable. Tudor is made easy. He must keep a Clerk, or there will be Jealousies. Indeed it is his Duty for it is impossible he can do the Business himself, and if that is not done, Injustice to the public will be done.(1) I have seen the Utility of Geometry, Geography, and the Art of drawing so much of late, that I must intreat you, my dear, to teach the Elements of those Sciences to my little Girl and Boys. It is as pretty an Amusement, as Dancing or Skaiting, or Fencing, after they have once acquired a Taste for them. No doubt you are well qualified for a school Mistress in these Studies, for Stephen Collins tells me the English Gentleman, in Company with him, when he visited Braintree, pronounced you the most accomplished Lady, he had seen since he left England. You see a Quaker can flatter, but dont you be proud. My best Wishes and most fervent Prayers attend our little Family. I have been banished from them, the greatest Part of the last Eighteen Months but I hope to be with them more, in Time to come. I hope to be excused from attending at Philadelphia, after the Expiration of the Year. I hope that Dr. Winthrop, Mr. Sever, Mr. Greenleaf, Coll. Warren, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Gerry, some or all of them will take their Turns, in the States (2)-and suffer me, at least to share with my Family, a little more than I have done, the Pleasures and Pains of this Life, and that I may attend a little more to my private Affairs that I may not be involved in total Ruin, unless my Country should be so and then I should choose to share its Fate.

718,dg00273,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dr Sir Philadelphia Septr. 26. 1775 This Afternoon, and not before I received a Line from the excellent Marcia, which [is] the first and only Letter I have received from the Family to which She belongs Since I left Watertown. Be pleased to thank her for this Favour, and to let her know that She must certainly have misinterpretted Some Passage in my Letter Since I never thought either Politicks or War, or any other Art or Science beyond the Line of her Sex:(1) on the contrary I have ever been convinced that Politicks and War have in every Age, been influenced, and in many, guided and controuled by her Sex. Sometimes it is to be feared by the unworthy Part of it: but at others, it must be confessed by the amiable and the good. But, if I were of opinion that it was best for a general Rule that the fair should be excused from the arduous Cares of War and State; I should certainly think that Marcia and Portia ought to be Exceptions,(2) because I have ever ascribed to those Ladies, a Share and no small one neither, in the Conduct of our American Affairs. I have nothing new to communicate. Every Thing has been done, and is now doing, to procure the Unum Necessarium. I wish I could give you a more agreable account of the Salt Petre Works in this City. I fear they have chosen injudiciously a Place for their Vatts, Vaults and Buildings, a low marshy Place which was lately overflowed by the Storm. Still We have Sanguine Accounts of the Skill and Success of some operators. Coll Dyer produces a Sample of excellent Salt Petre, made by two De Witts, one of Norwich the other of Windham, and he is confident that they can and will make large Quantities. Coll Harrison of Virginia, whose Taste in Maderia, I know, and in Girls I believe, and in Salt Petre I hoe to be much Superiour to his Judgment in Men, is very confident that they are making large Quantities from Tobacco House Earth, in his Colony. We are hourly expecting Intelligence from Canada, as well as Massachusetts, and from London. My dear Sir, Let me intreat you to do every Thing in your Power to get ready the Accounts of all that our Province has done and expended in the Common Cause, for which they expect or hope to be  SEPTEMBER 26, 1775  reimbursed by the United Colonies.(3) It has ever appeared to me a Thing of much Importance, that We should be furnished with these Accounts as soon as possible. From present appearances, our session will not be long, and if We should not be furnished with the Necessary Papers, very soon, We shall not be able to obtain any Reimbursement this Fall; and the next Spring We may be involved in so many Dangers, as well as new Expences as to render our Chance for obtaining Justice, more precarious. You know that your Delegates have been here, almost the whole Time since the Commencement of Hostilities, and therefore can say nothing of their own knowledge concerning your Exertions or Expences, but must depend altogether upon Information from the General Court. This is really a Strong Reason for a Change in the Delegation. We have been absent so long from our native Country as to be a Kind of Aliens and Strangers there. If it is good Policy to reelect one of the old Delegates, because he is personally knowing to what has passed here, it is equally good Policy to elect some new ones, because they are Witnesses of what has passed with you. For my own Part, as my political Existence terminates with the Year, I Sincerely wish to be exempt in the next Election. I long to be a little with you in the General Court, that I may see and hear, and feel with my Countrymen, and I ardently wish to be a little with my Family, and to attend a little to my private Affairs. To be frank and candid to a Friend, I begin to feel for my Family. To leave all the Burthen of my private Cares, at a Time when my affairs are in so much Perplexity, to an excellent Partner, gives me Pain for her. To leave the Education of a young Family, entirely to her, altho I know not where it could be better lodged, gives me much Concern for her and them. I have very little Property, you very well know, which I have not earned myself, by an obstinate Industry, in opposition to the Malice of a very infirm Constitution, in Conjunction with the more pernicious Malice of Ministerial and gubernatorial Enemies. Of the little Acqisitions I have made, five hundred Pounds Sterling is sunk in Boston in a Real Estate, four hundred sterling more is compleatly annihilated in a Library that is now wholly useless to me and mine, and at least four hundred sterling more, is wholly lost to me, in Notes & Bonds not one farthing of the Principal or Interest of which, can I obtain, and the Signers are dying, breaking, flying every day. It is not compleatly two years since my Business has been totally ruined by the public Confusions. I might modestly estimate the Profits of my Business before this Period at three hundred sterling a Year, perhaps more. I think therefore I may fairly estimate myself a sufferer immediately, to the amount of two Thousand Pounds sterling. I have purchased Lands, which these Causes have prevented me from paying for, and the Interest is running on without a Possibility   of my paying it, and I am obliged to hire Labour yearly upon my Farm to no Small amount. In the mean Time, all that has been granted me by the general Court for the sessions of this Congress last Fall and this Spring has not defrayed my necessary Expences, however Strange it may appear. The Conclusion from all this is, that I am rushing rapidly into Perplexities and Distresses in my private affairs from which I can never extricate myself. By retreating from public Life, in some Measure I might preserve myself and Family from a Ruin, which without it will be inevitable. I am Willing to sink with my Country, but it ought not to be insisted on that I Should Sink myself without any Prospect of contributing by that Means to make it Swim. I have taken my Trick at Helm, when it was not easy to get Navigators who would run the Risque of the Storm. At present the Course is plain whatever the Weather may be, and the prospect of that is much better than it was when I was called to assist in steering the ship. ""

Providence intended them for Instruments to promote valuable Purposes, altho the Writer of them, thought so little of them that he never could have recollected one Word in them, if they had been lost. The most that I care about them, is the indecent Exposure of the Name of a Lady, who cannot be put to Pain, without giving me Uneasiness by Sympathy. I boasted, Madam, of my Happiness, in my last to you, because I know you could excuse the appearance of Vanity, and because I knew very well that the Person who So deservedly holds the first  SEPTEMBER 26, 1775  Place in your Heart, could Say by Experience, that an Happiness so perfect was not merely ideal.

I think it has contributed to the stablishment of my Health, for which I am obligd to my Friend Mr John Adams who kindly offered me one of his Horses the day after we set off from Watertown. I write you this Letter, principally to put you in Mind of the promise you made me to give me Intelligence of what is doing in our Assembly and the Camp. Believe me sir it is of great Importance that we should be informd of every Circumstance of our Affairs. The Eyes of Friends and Foes are attentively fixed on our Province, and if Jealousy or Envy can sully its Reputation, you may depend upon it they will not miss the opportunity. It behoves our Friends therefore to be very circumspect, and in all their publick Conduct to convince the World, that they are influenced not by partial or private Motives but altogether with a View of promoting the publick Welfare. Some of our Military Gentlemen have, I fear, disgracd us; It is then important that every Anecdote that concerns a Man of real Merit among them (and Such I know there are) be improvd, as far as decency will admit of it, to their Advantage and the Honor of a Colony which for its Zeal in the great Cause as well as its Sufferings, deserve so much of America. Until I visited head Quarters at Cambridge, I had never heard of the Valor of Prescot on Bunkers Hill, nor the Ingenuity of Knox and Waters in planing the celebrated Works at Roxbury. We were told here that there were none in our Camp who understood this Business of an Engineer, or any thing more than the manual Exercise of the Gun. This we had from great Authority, and for want of more certain Intelligence were obligd at least to be silent. There are many military Geniuses at present unemployd and overlookd, who I hope, when the  SEPTEMBER 26, 1775  Army is new modelld, will be sought after and invited into the Service of their Country. They must be sought after, for modest Merit declines pushing it self into publick View.

As making any Alterations in the present Appointments of the Of- SEPTEMBER 26, 1775  ficers of different Colonies, and the Reduction of those Regiments which cannot be Compleated to their full Establishments may Create great Jealousies and Uneasiness, the Congress are of Opinion that at present no Step should be taken therein, as the New Modelling the whole is so soon Expected, when those inconveniencies may be Remedied without Danger.

Agreeable to the order of Congress I inclose you Copy of a Letter from General Schuyler, with sundry papers Inclos'd.(2) Application having been made to Congress for the Discharge of Coll John Fenton, at present Confin'd at Hartford they pass'd a Resolution that he be allow'd to proceed to New York, and from thence to London upon his giving his Parole not to Take up Arms against the Continent during the present Contest.(3) It is Determin'd by Congress that you Issue a Commission to Mr Gridley as Colonell only, and to Suspend the appointment of a Brigadier General for the present. They Recommend to you to Grant Commissions to Messrs. Box, Scammell & Samuel Brewer as Brigade Majors.(4) The Memorial from Mr. Tudor the Judge Advocate was laid before Congress, and upon Consideration it was Resolved that he be allow'd & paid Fifty Dollars per Month for himself & Clerk from the Time of his Appointment, & I Transmitt him by this Express his Commission and the Resolution of Congress. Some Difficulty having arisen in the Settlement of the Accotts. of the severall Rifle Companies as to Supplies of Money &c particularly with Respect to Coll. Thompson, and the Congress having on the 29th July last Advanc'd to Colonell Thompson Five Thousand Dollars for the Service of his Battalion, I am directed to Desire you will order Coll Thompson to Exhibit to you an Accott. of the Expenditure of the said Five Thousand Dollars, which you will please to Transmitt to me to be laid before Congress, by which the severall Accotts. may easily be Accomodated.

723,dg00278,1775,Richard Henry Lee to George Washington,"""Richard Henry Lee to George Washington   Dear Sir Philadelphia 26th Septr. 1775 Two days ago I arrived here from Virginia, which the late short adjournment just allowed me time to visit and return from. I brought two letters from thence for you which come with this. Having some business with Colo. Mason, I travelled that road and having sent to your Lady to know if she had any commands this way, had the pleasure to learn that all were well at Mount Vernon. As I suppose it will be agreable to you to know what is passing in Virginia, I have inclosed you the proceedings of our last Convention, with two of Purdies Gazettes. I am greatly obliged to you for your favor of August the 29th,(1) and you may be assured I shall pay great attention to it. When I mentioned securing the entrance of the harbour of Boston, it was more in the way of wishing it could be done, than as conceiving it very practicable. However the reasons you assign are most conclusive against the attempt. I assure you, that so far as I can judge from the conversation of Men, instead of their being any who think you have not done enough, the wonder seems to be that you have done so much. I believe there is not a Man of common sense and who is void of prejudice, in the world, but greatly approves the discipline you have introduced into the Camp; since reason and experience join in proving, that without discipline Armies are fit only for the contempt and slaughter of their Enemies. Your labors are no doubt great both of mind and body, but if the praise of the present and future times can be any compensation you will have a plentiful portion of that. Of one thing you may certainly rest assured that the Congress will do every thing in their power to make your most weighty business easy to you. I think you could not possibly have appointed a better Man to his present Office than Mr. Mifflin. He is a singular Man, and you certainly will meet with the applause and support of all good men by promoting and countenancing real Merit and public virtue, in opposition to all private interests, and partial affection. You will see in the proceedings of our Convention, that they have agreed to raise the pay of our Rifle Officers & Men to the Virginia standard. It may perhaps encourage them to be told this. We have no late accounts from England, but from what we have had that can be relied on, it seems almost certain, that our Enemies there must shortly meet with a total over throw. The entire failure of  SEPTEMBER 26, 1775  all their schemes, and the rising spirit of the people strongly expressed by the remonstrance of the Livery of London to the King, clearly denote this. The Ministry had their sole reliance on the impossibility of the Americans finding money to support an army, on the great aid their cause would receive from Canada, and consequent triumph of their forces over the liberties and rights of America. The reverse of all this has happened, and very soon now, our Commercial resistance will begin sorely to distress the people at large. The Ministerial recruiting business in England has entirely failed them, the Ship builders in the royal yards have mutinied, and now they are driven as to their last resort to seek for Soldiers in the Highlands of Scotland. But it seems the greatest Willingness of the people there cannot supply more than one or two Thousand men, A number rather calculated to increase their disgrace, than to give success to their cause. I beg your pardon for engaging your attention so long, and assure you that I am with unfeigned esteem dear Sir Your affectionate friend and Countryman Richard Henry Lee ""

Washington relative to the forming a new Army, and that Paragraph of Govr. Cooke's Letter that only Capt. Ward amongst all the Rhode Island officers had received a continental Commission alarmed the Congress, or rather some Members of it. A Motion was made that a Comee. should be appointed to consult Genl. Washington, the Depy. Govr. of Rhode Island, the Govr. of Connecticut, the Council of the Massachusetts Bay & the President of the Congress of New Hampshire upon the best Method of continuing supporting & regulating a continental Army. Mr. Adams the Con[necticu] t Gentlemen & myself were against it & many others but least We should be supposed to think our Army would not bear Inspection We did not exert ourselves and suffered the Motion to be carried without calling the Colonies when a Major[it]y of them were against it. Letters to the Governors &c go by this Express that they may meet the Comee. 12th next Month at Cambridge. The Gentn. fond of the Motion wished a very different Comee. from that actually appointed. I saw their Aim and proposed to the New England Cols. a Plan for defeating them & succeeded saving that We failed in getting Colo. Dyer appointed with the other Gentn. The Comee. as it now stands is Dr. Franklin Mr. Lynch & Colo. Harrison, the two first You are well acquainted with the last is a Virginian a Friend of Liberty a Man of  SEPTEMBER 30, 1775  Sense & Spirit but not at all Times so wise & judicious as some from that glorious Colony.(2) A Comee. is appointed to draw Instructions for them I imagine they will sett out on Tuesday next. I wish You could accompany Govr. Cooke to Cambridge. Your Advice & Pen I think would do your Country most essential Service. It is agreed that an Army for the Winter must be formed out of that now in Service, the Southern Gentlemen wish to reduce the Wages of the privates and raise those of the Officers. With Regard to the last they are right for in the present Camp officers can't support themselves upon their present Pay, as to the first they are certainly wrong for no Man can live tolerably for less. They could hire they say good Men in the Southern Colonies for ten shillings per Month less but I believe they would not be so good by twenty. A Letter to General Washington would have superceded the necessity of any Comee. but as we have suffered one I would have the best made of it. Upon this Principle I ardently wish You to attend the Depy. Govr. & at the same time that you nobly sacrifice every other Consideration to the Good of America, I would have you take Care of the New England Colonies in general (the great Support of Liberty) & of our own little Colony in particular. Neither of the Gentn. save Dr. Franklin is equal to you in natural or acquired abilities. Some of the southern Gentn. seem to consider this matter as an affair between New England & the other Colonies & upon that Plan balloted for Gentn. only of the other Colonies. (Colo. Dyer & Colo. Harrison had equal Votes at first, upon a second Tryal another Southern Member came in & turned the Vote for Colo. Harrison). I believe he will do well. I wish our Troops to reinlist but wish the Terms may be good. An unhappy Dispute subsists between the Virginians & the Pennsylvanians & another between the latter & Connecticut both which are before the Congress & I hope such Measures will be adopted as may prevent the sad Mischiefs which they threaten us with. Mr. Goddard hath been to the southward and established Post offices & Riders quite to Georgia & Dr. Franklin as he comes to the north will establish proper offices that Way. No News from England since my last. The Gen[tleme]n of Georgia deserve the Character I gave you of them. They are some of the highest Sons of Liberty I have seen & are very sensible & clever. Mr. Wythe & Mr. Lee of Virginia have been under Enoculation ever since my last that I can say no more of them than I did then; saving that unhappy Jealousy of New England which some weak Minds are possessed with great Unanimity prevails in Congress. Our Measures are more Spirited and I believe We are now ready to go every Length to secure our Liberties. John Adams Letter(3) has silenced those who opposed every decisive Measure, but the moderate or as I consider them the Enemies of our Cause have caused Copies of it to be sent  throughout the Province in Hopes by raising the Cry of Independence to throw the Friends of Liberty out of the new Assembly the Choice of which commences next Monday but I believe they will fail & that the House will be more decisive than ever. One Comfort We have that divine Wisdom & Goodness often bring Good out of ill; that the Issue of this severe Contest will be the Establishment of our Liberties I as firmly believe as I do my Existence for I never can think God brought us into the Wilderness to perish or what is worse to become Slaves but to make us a great & free People. If you have any kind of Intelligence from Quebec let Me have that & any thing else in your next. I am concerned for my Son least the severe Fatigues of the Expedition should overcome him. God bless you & yours my dear Bror. I am most affectionately your Sam Ward P.S. The Express being just going I have wrote as fast as I could & scarcely know what. Mr. Hopkins & Lady are very well. Make my most respectful Compliments to the Depy. Govr. & his Family. I thought the rude Sketch now given of the Sentiments of Congress &c would not be unacceptable & might let you into the Principles of the chief People. You'l observe I have wrote principally to You & communicate no Parts but such as are proper. ""

The ministry themselves agree that it must be made up, and will, in all probability take hold of the offer made them by the congress in their petition. Orders are sent, it seems, to Boston, to treat the people with lenity, and to suffer them to remove with their effects. MS not found; reprinted from the Virginia Gazette (Pinkney), October 12, 1775. Printed under the heading: \""Extract of a letter, to a gentleman in this city, from one of the delegates from this colony to the congress.\"" 1 This letter was probably written after the delegates had learned in mid-September of the king's response to the petition of the city of London but before the beginning of October when they became more pessimistic over prospects for a peaceful accommodation with Britain as a result of accounts recently received from correspondents in London.

752,dg002108,1775,John Adams to Abigail Adams,"""John Adams to Abigail Adams   My Dear Philadelphia Octr. 1. 1775 This Morning, I received your two Letters of September 8th. and September 16th. What shall I say? The Intelligence they contain, came upon me by Surprize, as I never had the least Intimation before, that any of my Family was ill, excepting in a Card from Mrs. Warren received a few days ago, in which she informed me that Mrs. Adams had been unwell but was better.(1) You may easily conceive the State of Mind, in which I am at present. Uncertain and apprehensive, at first I suddenly thought of setting off, immediately, for Braintree, and I have not yet determined otherwise. Yet the State of public Affairs is so critical, that I am half afraid to leave my Station, Altho my Presence here is of no great Consequence. I feel-I tremble for You. Poor Tommy! I hope by this Time, however, he has recovered his plump Cheeks and his fine Bloom. By your Account of Patty I fear-but still I will hope she has been supported, and is upon the Recovery. I rejoice to learn that Nabby and her Brothers have hitherto escaped and pray God that his Goodness may be still continued to them. Your Description of the distressed State of the Neighborhood is affecting indeed. It is not uncommon for a Train of Calamities to come together. Fire, Sword, Pestilence, Famine, often keep Company, and visit a Country in a Flock. At this Distance I can do no good to you nor yours. I pray God to support you-I hope our Friends and Neighbours are kind as usual. I feel for them, in the general Calamity. I am so far from thinking you melancholy, that I am charmed with that Admirable Fortitude, and that divine Spirit of Resignation which appears in your Letters. I cannot express the Satisfaction it gives me, nor how much it contributes to support me. You have alarmed me however, by mentioning Anxieties which you do not think it prudent to mention to any one. I am wholly at a Loss to conjecture what they can be. If they arise from the Letters, (2) be assured that you may banish them forever. These Letters have reached Philadelphia, but have produced Effects very different from those which were expected from the Publication of them. These Effects I will explain to you sometime or other. As to the Versification of them, if there is Wit or Humor in it laugh-if ill Nature, sneer -if mere Dullness, why you may even yawn or nod. I have no Anger, at it, nay even scarcely contempt. It is impotent. As to Politicks, We have nothing to expect but the whole Wrath and Force of G. Britain. But your Words are as true as an oracle  OCTOBER 1, 1775  \""God helps them, who help them selves, and if We obtain the divine Aid by our own Virtue, Fortitude and Perseverance, We may be sure of Relief.\"" It may amuse you to hear a Story. A few days ago, in Company with Dr. Zubly, somebody said, there was nobody on our side but the Almighty. The Dr. who is a Native of Switzerland, and speaks but broken English, quickly replied \""Date is enough. Date is enough,\"" and turning to me, says he, it puts me in mind of a fellow who once said, The Catholics have on their side the Pope, and the K. of France and the K. of Spain, and the K. of Sardinia, and the K. of Poland and the Emperor of Germany &c. &c. &c. But as to them poor Devils the Protestants, they have nothing on their side but God Almighty. ""

753,dg002109,1775,John Adams to William Tudor,"""John Adams to William Tudor   Dr Sir Philadelphia Octr. 1. 1775 I have at last the Pleasure to mention to you what I Suppose Mr H [ancock] has informed you of before, vizt that the Pay of the Judge Advocate is raised to fifty dollars per Month for himself and his Clerk, and this is to be allowed from the day he entered upon the service.(1) There was an Expresion in your Representation to the General which alarmed me much, and put me to some Pain lest it should excite a Disgust.(2) It was this \""The Congress as I have been informed were wholly unacquainted with the Duties of a Judge Advocate, especially in the continental Army.\"" If this had been true, yet it was indecent to tell them of it, because they ought to be presumed to know all the Duties of this officer, but most especially in their own Army. The Construction that I put upon it, was that the Congress had never been made Acquainted with the orders of the General to the Judge to attend every general Court Martial, which made the Duty in the American Army, essentially greater than in any other. By this Interpretation, satisfaction seemed to be given and by the favourable Representation of the General, together with the friendly Notice of General Gates to Some Members who had been at the Camp, this Matter was at last well understood, and Justice was done. I am very Sorry to learn, that you have been Sick, but rejoice to OCTOBER 1, 1775  hear you are better. I have this Morning received from my dear Mrs Adams, two Letters which have put all my Philosophy to the Proof. Never Since I had a Family was it in such Distress, altho it has often seen melancholy Scenes. I tremble for fear my Wifes Health should receive an irreparable Injury from the Anxieties, and Fatigues, which I know she will expose herself to, for the relief of her Family in their present Sick Condition. I fear too the Contagion of such an Hospital of an House. Whether to return I know not. We expect every Hour, momentous Intelligence from England, and from Schuyler and from Washington. And altho, my Presence here is not of any great Consequence, yet some of my Constituents may possibly think it of more than it is, and be uneasy, if I should be absent. At least, if I am here, and any thing goes differently from my Wishes, I shall have the Satisfaction to reflect that I have done all I could however little it might be. Yet if I Stay here, I shall not be happy, till I know more from Braintree. Perhaps I may receive another Letter in a day or two. My Respects to your Father and Mother, and all Friends. Pray write me if you are well enough. I am, sir, your Friend. John Adams ""

Drapers Paper is a great Curiosity and you will oblige me by sending it as often as possible. The foreign News you mention, is all a Delusion my Friend.(1) You may depend upon it, every Measure is preparing by the Ministry to destroy us if they can, and that a Sottish Nation is Supporting them. Heaven helps those who help themselves, and I am happy to find a Disposition so rapidly growing in America to exert itself. The Letters, by your Packett from my Family, have given me Serious Concern indeed. I am much at a Loss what Course to take. I have thoughts on returning home-I fear my dear Mrs - Adams's Health will sink under the Burthen of Care that is upon her. I might well enough be Spared from this Place, where my Presence is of no Consequence, and my Family might derive some Advantage from my being there, and I might have an opportunity of attending a Conference between a Comtee. of this Congress and the Council of Mass. where perhaps I might be of more Service than I can here. However  OCTOBER 1, 1775  I am not determined-My Friend, your secretary (2) is very much averse to my going. I dont know what to do. The Comtee, who are going to the Camp, are Dr Franklin Mr Lynch and Coll Harrison, who I hope will be received with Friendship and Politeness-by all our Friends. I assure you, Sir, there is a serious Spirit here-Such a Spirit as I have not known before. The Committee by whom this Letter will go are determined Americans. I fear that two of them, I mean Mr L. & H. may have received some unfavourable Impressions from Misrepresentations, concerning our Province, but these will be easily removed, by what they will see and hear, I hope. I wish that every Civility may be shewn them, which their Fortunes, Characters and Stations demand. Our News from England, is, Troops from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Hanover-Poor old Britania!

755,dg002111,1775,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   My Dear [October 1, 1775] (1) Yours of the 24th Ulto. received yesterday. I thank you for welcoming Me to the Lovely City of Philadelphia, but I hardly know a place, but I should be happier in, save among my distressed sick Neighbors at Wethersfeild. The sight of the Eye affects even the hardest heart, mine is too easily affected, Sc public miseries are surely enough for one thinking feeling mind at a Time. Of these the prospect, the Apprehension is ever before Me, not only on my heart, but as I may say in my hand continually. My sincerest condolance awaits however, all the unfortunate, those in Wethersfeild in particular, whose remembrance of Me, so repeatedly in my absence, will ever render them dear to Me, while I have sense, or recollection left. Mr.May's loss must be a cutting one, as he is fond of his Children, & I think had great reason to be fond of this. But I often say to myself, Blessed are the Dead, if as Hamlet says, in that same Sleep of theirs, there were no Dream. You will think Me Melancholy, and you are not much out of the way. The Soul distressing Uncertainty in which We are, respecting Our Northern Friends, with the weight, and fatigue of Business, is almost Too much. I will shake it off for a more agreeable Subject your proposed Journey. The Col. proposed, for Brown, to bring you as farr as New York, where one of Us would OCTOBER 1, 1775  meet You, on previous Notice. I do not like Browns Coa[ch and] made no bargain but directed him to shew it to Mr. Webb, & you, [for] your Opinion of that plan. The Season is advancing, and I am sure the Business of the Congress will not soon be compleated. By all the accts. from London the inveteracy of the Ministry is increasing, and nothing in their power, will be left unattempted to reduce Us to their humiliating Terms. The reduction of Montreal, & Quebeck would put a very good Face on Our Affairs, & give the Ministry a blow indeed. The most cool & moderate Men among Us, now sing the same song, which I rung in their Ears, last May & June, untill they almost call'd Me mad, and tell me plainly every day, We now wish we had followed Your advice in Season. This is some satisfaction, but the poorest in the World, to have Your Opponents own you were right, when too late to take advantage of it either for them or Ourselves. I will however hope the best. I was urged Week before last, on hearing of Genl. Schuylers illness to go in person to that Army, not so much to command as to advise, & assist. This was in a private Clubb, but I discouraged the proposal, and it went no farther. I have vanity enough to think myself a tolerable good contriver, & manager in such an assembly as this, but am not Vain eno. to think myself fit for a General officer. I have indeed tho't it my duty to stay here, otherwise should have gone Northward [on]a former Occasion. I am inlisted in the general Service & must take my post if possible where I have a Chance of doing most service. I think that the 10th of this Mo. will be late eno. for you to set out, if you can be ready by that Time. This comes by Col. Williams, & Mr. Wales, who have paid Us a Visit,(2) the former cool & stiff as you please, but I trust I have not been deficient in complaisance to him. I suppose Connecticut politicians have been busy, & that the Nomination will be varied, but I hope not very greatly, as I wish for the old steady plan of the Colony in preferance to every private View, either for myself, or Freinds. Am a little surprized that Col. Seymour miss'd his Election for Hartford, but duplicity and haughtiness are two the worst ingredients, in Nature, for a Connecticut Statesman. Adieu to this Subject. I suppose all Freinds are well, my Love to them. When is Sally to be married? I am my Dear your Affectionate Husband S. Deane ""

We should be glad of a True & just Information from you & some other principal Gentn of ours with respect to the Matters Alledged & the true state of the Affair.(1) The times you Know Now are Very Critical therefore require the Utmost prudence & tho many things may be lawfull yet not expedient it is better to make friends by every Concilliatory method than drive or Use force.

I assure you I could mention compliments passed upon them: and if a serious Decision could be had upon them, the public Voice would be found in their Favour.

However, I will hope that your Prospects are more agreable than they were, and that the Children are all better as well as the rest of the Family and the Neighbours. If I should hear more disagreable Advices from you I shall certainly come home, for I cannot leave you, in such Affliction, without endeavouring to lessen it, unless there was an absolute Necessity of my staying here, to do a Duty to the Public, which I think there is not. I must beg to be excused my dear from hint[ing] any Thing for the future of public Persons or Things. Secrecy is so much exacted: But thus much I can say, that I never saw so serious and determined a Spirit. I must also beseech you to be cautious what you write to me and by whom you send.

The Bearer of this is Major Bayard a Gentleman of this City of the Presbyterian Persuasion of the best Character and the clearest affections for his Country. I have received so many Civilities from him, that I could not refuse myself the Pleasure of introducing him to you. Our obligations of Secrecy, are so braced up, that I must deny myself the Pleasure of Writing Particulars.(1) Not because some Letters have been intercepted, for notwithstanding the Versification of them, they have done good, tho they have made some People grin. This I can Say with Confidence, that the Propriety and Necessity of the Plan of Politicks so hastily delineated in them is every day, more and more confessed, even by those Gentlemen who disapproved it at the Time when they were written.

760,dg002116,1775,John Adams to John Winthrop,"""John Adams to John Winthrop   Dr sir Philadelphia Octr. 2.1775 I do myself the Honour of writing you a very few Lines, just for the Sake of introducing to you, the Gentlemen who compose a Committee of this Congress, who are to consult with your Hon. Board,(1) about a Plan for continuing the Army. I conjecture that the Reduction of the Pay of the private Soldiers, and the Introduction of Some Gentlemen from other Colonies, into the Service as officers will be principal objects. The Pay of the Privates is generally, if not universally thought to be too high,(2) especially in Winter: but whether a Reduction of it would not give Such a Disgust as to endanger the Service, I dont know. If the War should continue, and the Pay is not reduced this Fall this Congress will certainly reduce it next Spring, and in a Way that will perhaps be dangerous, at least attended with many Inconveniences. This Way will be by each Colony furnishing its Quota of Men as well as Money. The other Thing that is wished by many is not so reasonable. It is altogether absurd to Suppose, that the Council of Massachusetts should appoint Gentn. from the southern Colonies, when Connecticutt, Rhode Island and N. Hampshire do not. But it is idle to expect it of either. The Council, if they are Men of Honour cannot appoint Gentlemen whom they dont know, to command Regiments or Companies in their service. Nor can they pay a Regard to any Recommendation of Strangers, to the Exclusion of Persons whom they know. Besides it is certain that the Massachusetts has Numbers of Gentlemen, who have no Command in the Army at all, and who would now be glad to get in, who. are better qualified, with knowledge both of Theory and Practice than any who can be had upon the Continent. They have been more in War, and longer in the study of it. Besides can it be Supposed that the private Men will be easy to be commanded by Strangers to the Exclusion of Gentlemen, whom they know being their Neighbours. It is moreover a Reflection, and would be a Disgrace upon that Province to send abroad for Commanders of their own Men, it would suppose that it had not Men fit for officers than which nothing can be further from the Truth. But I must desist. We have heard nothing from the Comtee appointed to write to Us, as yet. Nor from that about Lead and Salt. I pray you Sir that We may have the accounts and Vouchers sent Us, that our poor suffering Province may obtain a Reimbursement. I am, with great Respect &c ""

Octob 3 1775 I take the Liberty of recommending to your Notice Mr Bayard a worthy Inhabitant of this City who with his Friend Mr Henry intends to make a Visit to the American Camp. They are both honest Whigs, and as such I am sure they will be duly regarded by you. This day Dr Franklin setts off for Cambridge, being deputed by the Congress in Conjunction with Mr Lynch of South Carolina and Coll Harrison of Virginia to consult with the General and some Gentlemen of the four New England Colonies concerning the most effectual Methods of continuing supporting and regulating the Continental Army. This Embassy I conjecture will be attended with great and good Consequences. The Intelligence receivd by the July Packett which arrivd at New OCTOBER 3, 1775  York a few days ago, has convincd some, who could not be prevaild upon to believe it before, that it is folly to supplicate a Tyrant, and that under God, our own virtuous Efforts must save us. I hope, that our Troops will before long force their Way into Boston. If such a Design should be in Contemplation, I dare say you will encourage it to the utmost of your Power. Mr Lynch is a Man of Sense and Virtue. Coll Harrisons Character may be drawn from his Confidential Letter publishd not long ago in Madam Drapers Gazette.(1) I hope these Gentlemen will be treated with all the Respect which is due to the publick Character they sustain. I mentiond to my valueable friend Coll Lee (Brother of my trusty Correspondent Dr Lee of London) his going upon this Embassy. Indeed he could not have been well spared from the Congress, and therefore I was the more easily satisfied with his Objection, which was the Want of Health. You would have been exceedingly pleasd with him. In your Letter to Mr J A you promise to write to me. I shall be happy in receiving your Letters by every opportunity. If I am not much mistaken, a short time will afford you a delightful Subject to write upon. Our Army must not long remain inactive. They must improve the golden Season, before the Rebels can be reinforcd, which probably will be this fall. We are expecting every Moment important News from General Schuyler. May God prosper our Designs in that Quarter. I wish you would inform me, how Affairs are carried on in General Assembly. Adieu S A ""

I wish as ardently as you can do for peace, and should rejoice exceedingly in cooperating with you (1) to that end. But every ship from Britain brings some intelligence of new measures that tend more and more to exasperate; and it seems to me, that until you have found by dear experience the reducing us by force impracticable, you will think of nothing fair and reasonable. We have as yet resolved only on defensive measures. If you would recall your forces and stay at home, we should meditate nothing to injure you. A little time so given for cooling on both sides would have excellent effects. But you will goad and provoke us. You despise us too much; and you are insensible of the Italian adage, that there is no little enemy. I am persuaded that the body of the British people are our friends; but they are changeable, and by your lying gazettes may soon be made our enemies. Our respect for them will proportionably diminish, and I see clearly we are on the high road to mutual family hatred and detestation. A separation of course will be inevitable. It is a million of pities so fair a plan as we have hitherto been engaged in, for increasing strength and empire with public felicity, should be destroyed by the mangling hands of a few blundering ministers. It will not be destroyed; God will protect and prosper it, you will only exclude yourselves from any share in it. We hear, that more ships and troops are coming out. We know, that you may do us a great deal of mischief, and are determined to bear it patiently as long as we can. But, if you flatter yourselves with beating us into submission, you know neither the people nor the country. The Congress are still sitting, and will wait the result of their last petition.

Tell our dear good friend, Dr. Price, who sometimes has his doubts and despondencies about our firmness, that America is determined and unanimous; a very few Tories and placemen excepted, who will probably soon export themselves. Britain, at the expense of three millions, has killed one hundred and fifty Yankees this campaign, which is twenty thousand pounds a head; and at Bunker's Hill she gained a mile of ground, half of which she lost again by our taking post on Ploughed Hill. During the same time sixty thousand children have been born in America. From these data his mathematical head will easily calculate the time and expense necessary to kill us all, and conquer our whole territory.

In Answer I can only say that I am too fully engaged in actual Business to write much; and I know your Opinions are not easily changed. You wish me to come over with Proposals of Accommodation. Your Ministers have made that impracticable for me, by prosecuting me with a frivolous Chancery Suit in the Name of Whately, by which, as my Sollicitor writes me, I shall certainly be imprisoned if I appear again in England. Nevertheless, send us over hither fair Proposals of Peace, if you choose it, and no body shall be more ready than myself to promote their Acceptation: For I make it a Rule not to mix personal Resentments with Public Business.

773,dg002129,1775,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   Oct. 3 [i.e. 4,1775].(1) Johnson. I should be for the Resolutions about Imports and Exports, standing, till further order. I should be vs. giving up the Carriage. The Grower, the Farmer gets the same, let who will be the Exporter. But the Community does not. The Shipwright, Ropemaker, Hempgrower, all Shipbuilders, the Profits of the Merchant are all lost, if Foreigners are our sole Carriers, as well as Seamen, &c. I am for the Report standing, the Association standing. J. Rutledge. The Question is whether We shall shut our Ports entirely, or adhere to the Association. The Res[olutions] we come to, ought to be final. Lee. N. Carolina is absent. They are expected every Hour. We had better suspend a final Determination. I fear our determination to stop Trade will not be effectual. Willing. N.C. promised to put themselves in the same situation with other Colonies.(2) N. York have done the same. Our Gold is lok'd up, at present. We ought to be decisive. Interest is near and dear to Men. The Committee of Secrecy (3) find Difficulties. Merchants dare not trade. Deane. Sumptuary Laws, or a Non Imp[ortation] were necessary, if We had not been oppressed. A N[on] Export was attended with Difficulty. My Colony could do as well as others. We should have acquiesced in an immediate Non Export. or a partial one. Many voted for it as an Object in Terrorem. Merchants, Mechanicks, Farmers, all call for an Establishment.  OCTOBER 4, 1775  Whether We are to Trade with all Nations except B[ritain], Ireland and West Indies, or with one or two particular Nations, We cannot get ammunition without allowing some Exports, for The Merchant has neither Money nor Bills, and our Bills will not pass abroad. R. R. Livingston. We should go into a full Discussion of the Subject. Every Gentleman ought to express his Sentiments. The 1st Q. is how far we shall adhere to our Association-What advantages we gain, What Disadvantages we suffer by it. An immediate Stoppage last year would have had a great Effect: But at that time the Country could not bear it. We are now out of Debt, nearly. The high Price of Grain in B. will be an advantage to the Farmer. The Price of Labour is nearly equal in Europe. The Trade will be continued and G.B. will learn to look upon America as insignificant. If We export to B. and dont import, they must pay Us in Money. Of great Importance that We should import. We employ our Ships and Seamen. We have nothing to fear but Disunion among ourselves. What will disunite us, more than the Decay of all Business. The People will feel, and will say that Congress tax them and oppress them worse than Parliament. Ammunition cannot be had unless We open our Ports. I am for doing away our Non Exportation Agreement entirely. I see many Advantages in leaving open the Ports, none in shutting them up. I should think the best way would be to open all our Ports. Let us declare all those Bonds illegal and void. What is to become of our Merchants, Farmers, Seamen, Tradesmen? What an Accession of Strength should We throw into the Hands of our Enemies, if We drive all our Seamen to them. Lee. Is it proper that Non Export. Ag[reemen]t should continue. For the Interest of Americans to open our Ports to foreign Nations, that they should become our Carriers, and protect their own Vessells. Johnson. Never had an Idea that We should shut out Export. Agreement closer than it is at present. If We leave it as it is, We shall get Powder by Way of N. York, the lower Counties and N. Carolina. In Winter our Merchants will venture out to foreign Nations. If Parliament should order our Ships to be seized, We may begin a Force in Part to protect our own Vessells, and invite Foreigners to come here and protect their own Trade. J. Rutledge. We ought to postpone it, rather than not come to a decisive Resolution. Lee. We shall be prevented from exporting if B[ritish] Power can do it. We ought to stop our own Exports, and invite foreign Nations to come and export our Goods for Us. I am for opening our Exportations to foreigners farther than We have.  Willing. The Gents. favorite Plan is to induce foreigners to come here. Shall We act like the Dog in the Manger, not suffer N.Y. and the lower Counties and N. Carolina to export because We cant. We may get Salt and Ammunition by those Ports. Cant be for inviting foreigners to become our Carriers. Carriage is an amazing Revenue. Holland and England have derived their maritime Power from their Carriage. The Circulation of our Paper will stop, and [lose?] its Credit without Trade. 7 Millions of Dollars have been struck by the Continent and by the separate Colonies. Lee. The End of Administration will be answered by the Gentns. Plan. Jealousies and Dissensions will arise and Disunion and Division. We shall become a Rope of Sand. Zubly. The Q. should be whether the Export should be kept or not. Chace. I am for adhering to the Association and think that We ought not to determine these Questions this day. Differ from R. Livingston, [who holds that] our Exports are to be relaxed except as to Tobacco and Lumber. This will produce a Disunion of the Colonies. The Advantage of cultivating Tobacco is very great. The Planters would complain. Their Negro females would be useless without raising tobacco. That Country must grow rich that Exports more than they import. There ought not to be a partial Export to Great Britain. We affect the Revenue and the Remittance, by stopping our Exports. We have given a deadly Blow to B. and Ireland, by our Non Export. Their People must murmur, must starve. The Nation must have become Bankrupt before this day if We had ceased Exports at first. I look upon B., I. and W.I. as our Enemies, and would not trade with them, while at War. We cant support the War and our Taxes, without Trade. Emissions of Paper cannot continue. I dread an Emission for another Campaign. We cant stand it without Trade. I cant agree that N.Y., the lower Counties and N. Carolina, should carry on Trade. Upon giving a Bond, and making Oath, they may export. I am vs. these Colonies trading according to the restraining Act. It will produce Division. A few Weeks will put us all on a footing. N. York &c. are now all in Rebellion as the Ministry call it, as much as Mass. Bay. We must trade with foreign Nations, at the Risque indeed. But We may export our Tobacco to France, Spain or any other foreign Nation. If We treat with foreign Nations, We should send to them as well as they to Us. What Nation or Countries shall We trade with. Shall We go to there Ports and pay duties, and let them come here and pay none. To say you will trade with all the World, deserves Consideration.  I have not absolutely discarded every Glimpse of a Hope of Reconciliation. Our Prospect is gloomy. I cant agree, that We shall not export our own Produce. We must treat with foreign Nations upon Trade. They must protect and support Us with their Fleets. When you once offer your Trade to foreign Nations, away with all Hopes of Reconciliation. E. Rutledge. Differs with all who think the Non Exportation should be broke, or that any Trade at all should be carried on. When a Commodity is out of Port, the Master may carry it where he pleases. My Colony will receive your Determination upon a general Non Export. The People will not be restless. Proposes a general Non Export, untill next Congress. Our People will go into Manufactures, which is a Source of Riches to a Country. We can take our Men from Agriculture, and employ them in Manufactures. Agriculture and Manufactures cannot be lost. Trade is precarious. R. R. Livingston. Not convinced by any Argument. Thinks the exception of Tobacco and Lumber, would not produce Disunion. The Colonies affected can see the Principles, and their Virtue is such that they would not be disunited. The Americans are their own Carriers now, chiefly. A few British Ships will be out of Employ. I am vs. exporting Lumber. I grant that if We trade with other Nations, some of our Vessells will be seized and some taken. Carolina is cultivated by rich Planters-not so in the northern Colonies. The Planters can bear a Loss and see the Reason of it. The northern Colonies cant bear it. Not in our Power to draw People from the Plough to Manufacturers. We cant make Contracts for Powder, without opening our Ports. I am for exporting where B. will allow Us, to Britain itself. If We shut up our Ports, We drive our Sailors to Britain. The Army will be supplied, in all Events. Lee makes a Motion for 2 Resolutions. The Trade of Virginia and Maryland may be stopped by a very small naval Force. N. Carolina is badly off. The Northern Colonies are more fortunate. The Force of G.B. on the Water being exceedingly great, that of America, almost nothing-they may prevent allmost all our Trade, in our own Bottoms. G.B. may exert every Nerve next Year, to send 15, 20, or even 30,000 Men to come here. The Provisions of America are become necessary to several Nations. France is in Distress for them. Tumults and Attempts to destroy the Grain in the Year [Ear]. England has turned Arable into  Grass-France into Vines. Grain cant be got from Poland, nor across the Mediterranean. The Dissentions in Poland continue. Spain is at War with the Algerians, and must have Provisions. It would be much safer for} them to carry our Provisions than for Us. We shall get necessary Manufacturers and Money and Powder. This is only a temporary Expedient, at the present Time, and for a short Duration-to End when the War ends. I agree We must sell our Produce. Foreigners must come in 3 or 4 Months. The Risque We must pay, in the Price of our Produce. The Insurance must be deducted. Insurance would not be high to foreigners on account of the Novelty. It is no new Thing. The B. Cruizers will be the Danger. ""

775,dg002131,1775,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   Octr. 5. [1775] Gadsden. I wish we may confine ourselves to one Point.(1) Let the Point be whether We shall shut up all our Ports, and be all on a footing. The Ministry will answer their End, if We let the Custom houses be open, in N.Y., N.C., the lower Counties and Georgia. They will divide us. One Colony will envy another, and be jealous. Mankind act by their feelings. Rice sold for £3-it wont sell now for 30s. We have rich and poor there as in other Colonies. We know that the excepted Colonies dont want to take Advantage of the others. Zubly. Q. whether the Custom houses be stopped, and the Trade opened to all the World. The object is so great that I would not discuss it, on Horse back, riding Post haste. It requires the debate of a Week. We are lifting up a Rod-if you dont repeal the Acts, We will open our Ports. Nations as well as Individuals are sometimes intoxicated. It is fair to give them Notice. If We give them Warning, they will take Warning. They will send Ships out. Whether they can stop our Trade, is the Question. N. England I leave out of the Question. N.Y. is stopped by one Ship. Philadelphia says her Trade is in the Power of the fleet. V[irginia] and Maryland, is within the Capes of Virginia. N. Carolina is accessible. Only one good Harbour, Cape Fear. In G[eorgia] We have several Harbours, but a small naval Force may oppose or destroy all the naval Force of Georgia. The Navy can stop our Harbours and distress our Trade. Therefore it is impracticable, to open our Ports. The Q. is whether we must have Trade or not. We cant do without Trade. We must have Trade. It is prudent not to put Virtue to too serious a Test. I would use American Virtue, as sparingly as possible lest We wear it out. Are We sure one Cano will come to trade? Has any Merchant received a Letter from Abroad, that they will come. Very doubtfull and precarious whether any French or Spanish Vessell would be cleared out to America. It is a Breach of the Treaty of Peace. The Spaniards may be too lazy to come to America. They may be supplied from Sicily. It is precarious, and dilatory-extreamly dangerous -and pernicious. I am clearly vs. any Proposition to open our Ports to all the World. It is not prudent to threaten. The People of England will take it we design to break off, to separate. We have Friends in Eng. who have taken this up, upon virtuous Principles. Lee. I will follow Mr. Gadsden and simplify the Proposition, and confine it to the Q. whether the Custom houses shall be shut? If they OCTOBER 5, 1775  are open, the excepted Colonies may trade, others not, which will be unequal. The Consequence Jealousy, Division and Ruin. I would have all suffer equally. But We should have some Offices, set up, where Bond should be given that Supplies shall not go to our Enemies. ""

But as the good of our Country, which I know is your first Consideration, is my Motive, I presume you will think it a Sufficient Apology. In the present State of America, which is so novel and unexpected, and indeed unthought of by Numbers of Persons in every Colony, it is natural to expect Misapprehensions, Jealousies and Misrepresentations in Abundance: and it must be our Care to attend them, and if possible explain what is misunderstood and state truly what is misrepresented. It is represented in this City, by Some Persons, and it makes an unfriendly Impression upon Some Minds, that in the Massachusetts Regiments, there are great Numbers of Boys, Old Men, and Negroes, Such as are unsuitable for the service, and therefore that the Continent is paying for a much greater Number of Men, than are fit for Action or any Service. I have endeavoured to the Utmost of my Power to rectify these Mistakes as I take them to be, and I hope with Some success, but still the Impression is not quite removed. I would beg the favour of you therefore sir, to inform me whether there is any Truth at all in this Report, or not. It is natural to suppose there are some young Men and some old ones and some Negroes in the Service, but I should be glad to know if there are more of these in Proportion to the Massachusetts Regiments, than in those of Connecticutt Rhode Island and New Hampshire, or even among the Rifle Men. You may depend, Sir upon my Using the most prudent Caution in the Use of your Letter, and especially of your Name but I could certainly make a good Use of a Letter from you upon the Subject. Great Fault is likewise found in Several Parts of the Continent of the Massachusetts officers, whom I believe, taken on an average, and in Pro OCTOBER 5, 1775  portion to Numbers to be equal at least if not Superiour to any other Colony. I must confess I had another View in giving you this Trouble which was to introduce to your Attention, Dr Franklin Mr Lynch and Coll Harrison, a Committee from this Congress to consult with the General and with the New England Colonies, concerning a Plan for future Armies. Mr Lynch is from S. Carolina, Coll Harrison from Virginia, both Gentn. of great Fortune, and respectable Characters, Men of Abilities and very Staunch Americans.

782,dg002138,1775,John Hancock to George Washington,"""John Hancock to George Washington   Sir, 5 0ctr. [l7]75 By a very intelligent person just arrived from London (1) we have certain intelligence that a large number of Brass cannon from 24 to 4 pounders are preparing at the tower and were to be sent to Boston immediately, that 400 of the train of artilery were to be sent with them; that transports were taken up by Government to carry several regiments from Ireland to New York, that 17 of the transports lay at Deptford when he left England; that he expected they would sail from Ireland by the last of Septr. The following is an extract from a person of credit in London (2) dated 31 July which came by the above gentleman. \""The plan of operation they have at present in ajitation or which I might properly say, actually determined on and transmitted to Boston is as follows. \""With the assistance of Govr. Tryon (who is much relied on for the purpose) to get immediate possession of New York & Albany- to fill both of these cities with very strong garrisons-to declare all Rebels who do not join the Kings forces-to command the Hudsons and East Rivers with a number of small men of war & cutters stationed in different parts of it, so as wholly to cut off all communication by water between New York and the provinces to the Northward of it & between New York & Albany except for the Kings Service and to prevent also all communication between the city of New York & the provinces of New Jersey, Pensylvania and those to the southward of them. By these means Administration & their friends fancy that they shall soon either starve out or retake the garrisons of Ticonderoga & Crown Point & open & maintain a safe intercourse & correspondence between Quebec Albany & New York & thereby afford the fairest opportunity to their Soldiery & the Canadians (In conjunction with the Indians to be procured by G.J.) (3)-to make continual irruptions into New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay & Connecticut and so distract & divide the provincial forces as to render it easy for the British army at Boston to defeat them: but the spirits of the Massachusetts people depopulate their country & compel an absolute  OCTOBER 5, 1775  subjection to Great Britain. Another good effect to be deduced from this extensive plan, as government apprehend, is that as New York will by this method be prevented from supplying the Massachusetts army near Boston with flour &c. as they heretofore have done through the medium of Connecticut, And the New Jersey and Pensylvania people will not be able to transport provisions across the country, & the colony of Connecticut does not raise corn sufficient for the supply of herself and the Massachusetts bay, The inhabitants & troops of this province must inevitably of course be in a short time destroyed by diseases and famine and to this train of facts let me add; that in consequence of General Gage's desire brought by Captn. Chadds one hundred flat bottomed boats are at present building at Deptford in order to be sent immediately to America-but for what particular purpose I have not yet been able to learn. Many American gentlemen have however been lately asked by a Lord high in the American department, what sized vessels can go loaded from hence to Albany-what is the depth of water at the Overslaw (I think that is the name of the shallowest place in the North River)-whether the ship belonging to Albany in the London trade is always obliged to unload part of her cargo before she can get to Albany and what proportion of it. Whether if batteries were erected at the highlands, they would not prevent vessels from going up & down the North River. And where would be the best places on that river to hinder the New Jersey people &c from sending flour &c in the winter through Connecticut to the Massachusetts bay. These are the proper operations to the northward. As to the southward-Commodore Shuldam is preparing with all expedition to go to Virginia at the earnest request of Lord Dunmore with a number of Frigates, Cutters &c which are to be employed in obstructing all communication by water inland between the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, Pensylvania & the northern Colonies and in order to keep the Virginians & Marylanders engaged at home and prevent their affording any assistance to New York or the Massachusetts Bay. Those frigates & cutters are to destroy the towns of Virginia & Maryland and spread devastation over the plantations bordering on the navigible rivers. Shuldam is also to detach some of his fleet to lie before Philada & Charles town S. C. and fire on these cities, if they afford the least assistance to the Massachusetts Bay.\"" There are several other letters which confirm the above and farther intimate the resolutions of Administration to take into pay 20,000 Hessians & Hanoverians. But as this must have the sanction of parliament it is apprehended they will not be sent out this fall. The Gentlemen appointed to wait on you are to set out tomorrow Morning. I am Your most obedt sert John Hancock Prest.  ""

783,dg002139,1775,Williamsburg Committee of Safety,"""Williamsburg Committee of Safety   Gentlemen Philadelphia 5th Octr. 1775 The inclosed extracts from London letters yesterday laid before the Congress will sufficiently explain to you without a comment what extensive and destructive mischief is projected against our Colony with some others.(1) We have deemed it an incumbent duty to give you the earliest intelligence of our danger, that every possible precaution may be used to render the pernicious design abortive. The most effectual method of doing this, your wisdom will best determine, but it would seem a very important concern to leave undone nothing that can render us more secure from the further machinations of our inveterate, unprincipled, and (with respect to the situation & circumstances of Virginia) our well informed enemy Lord Dunmore. His influence with a most abandoned Ministry, his ardent zeal for the ruin of our Country, and his extensive acquaintance with the Colony certainly renders him an Object deserving particular care. We apprehend that Batteries placed on particular heights on James, York, & Rap. Rivers might greatly circumscribe this ruinous rogue, and it may be worthy of enquiry, whether the Cannon at Hampton, York & Williamsburg may not be removed for this purpose. It is said that near the mouth of Currotoman some good Cannon lay [buried?] in the Sand, which may be raised and placed to advantage on that river. We hope, from an insertion in Purdies Gazette, that our Colony powder is arrived, which, if true, will serve to furnish these Batteries, and we suppose Ball may be obtained from the Furnaces. There is no powder here that can possibly be spared, and the  OCTOBER 5, 1775  wicked activity, and power on the Sea of our enemies, renders it so essential and indispensable a duty on our Colony in particular to push the making of Salt Petre with unremitting diligence, that we earnestly entreat you will move the whole Colony most strongly on this point. All N. Am. expects it, and the safety of the whole does absolutely demand it; without this internal and essential security, the liberty & rights of America rest on doubtful ground. Perhaps, if a proper System of Look outs was formed by Colonies along the Bay, & from the mouths of the Rivers upwards, such quick notice of the appearance of warlike Vessels might be given as to enable the Inhabitants to guard against the evil, and in many instances to repel it with proper chastisement. It must certainly tend much to the public security if the Country could be prevailed on to execute the Patrol Law with diligence and attention, yet in such a manner as not to alarm the Slaves by too sudden a change from the late general intermission of this salutary regulation. We hope to be pardoned for these hints, and that they will be attributed to zeal for our Countrys good, and anxiety for its impending evils. We have the honor to be with much esteem & regard Gentlemen: ""

786,dg002142,1775,Samuel Ward to Henry Ward,"""Samuel Ward to Henry Ward   Dear Brother Philadelphia 5th Octr. 1775 I wrote you this Morning by Post. Since that Time I have seen a Number of Letters from Gentlemen of Character in England to Doctor Franklin. The Master of the Ship a sensible Man (Bro[the]r to one of the Delegates of the lower Counties) I have also seen,(1) and the general Tenor of all the Letters and the Captain's Information is that the Ministry is determined at all Events to conquer America. The Dr. being asked whether his Intelligince was from Gentn. who had frequently corresponded with him & whether their Advices generally were found true, he answered that it was generally good: being asked whether he thought they were a sufficient Foundation for America to proceed upon he answered He thought they were & that We ought to take all possible Care of ourselves. He observed that it was not certain; for that upon the Arrival of the Petition the Ministry might think best to relax a little but it was by no means to be trusted to. We ought to be prepared for the worst: I hope every measure will be taken to put the Town of Providence into a further State of Defence & every Part of the Colony which can be made tenable. Poor Newport You know I have long been concerned for I wish they would secure all their most valuable Effects in the Country indeed I wish the Friends of their Country would move out of Town but if not let all their most valuable Effects be secured. A Number of Men of War OCTOBER 5, 1775  are coming over, Troops are to be sent to New York & Virginia to be under the Command of Govrs. Tryon & Dunmore, they propose to take Possession of Albany & keep up a Communication with Canada by the North River & to keep Frigates and Cutters in the East River and all along the Coast. I may write again possibly but must conclude for I am greatly fatigued having been writing ever since Light save while at Breakfast or in Congress. Once more my dear Bror. adieu. Yours most affecy. Sam Ward P.S. This News will have a more happy Effect for they will induce the most spirited Measures. I wish this Letter may be communicated saving Dr. Franklins Name and the Captains being Bror. &c which I would have communicated to no Person whatever. I wish the People of Newport may know my Sentiments but have not Time to write. ""

Dunmore has been many Months committing Hostilities vs. Virginia, and has extended his Piracies to Maryland. I wish he had been seized, by the Colony, Months ago. They would have received the Thanks of all North America. Is it practicable now? Have the Committee any naval Force? This order will be a mere Piece of Paper. Is there a Power in the Committee to raise and pay a naval Force? Is it to be done at the Expence of the Continent. Have they Ships or Men. Lee. I wish Congress would advise Virginia and Maryland to raise a Force by Sea to destroy Ld. Dunmores Power. He is fond of his Bottle and may he taken by Land, but ought to be taken at all Events. Zubly. I am sorry to see the very threatening Condition that Virginia is likely to be in. I look on the Plan We heard of yesterday to be vile, abominable and infernal-but I am afraid it is practicable. Will these Mischiefs be prevented by seizing Dunmore. Seizing the K's Representatives will make a great Impression in England, and probably Things will be carried on afterwards with greater Rage. I came here with 2 Views. One to secure the Rights of America. 2. A Reconciliation with G. Britain. Dyer. They cant be more irritated at home than they are. They are bent upon our Destruction. Therefore that is no Argument vs. seizing  OCTOBER 6, 1775  them. Dunmore can do no [more?] Mischief in Virginia-his Connections in England are such that he may be exchanged to Advantage. Wentworth is gone to Boston. Franklyn is not dangerous. Pen is not. Eden is not. Johnson. Dunmore a very bad Man. A defensive Conduct was determined on, in the Convention of Virginia. I am for leaving it to Virginia. We ought not to lay down a rule in a Passion. I see less and less Prospect of a Reconciliation every day. But I would not render it impossible. If We should render it impossible, our Colony would take it into their own Hands and make Concessions inconsistent with the Rights of America. N.C., V., P., N. York, at least have strong Parties, each of them of that Mind. This would make a Disunion. Five or six Weeks will give Us the final Determination of the People of G. Britain. Not a Governor in the Continent has the real Power, but some have the Shadow of it. A Renunciation of all Connection with G.B. will be understood by a step of this Kind. 13 Colonies connected with G.B. in 16 Months have been brought to an Armed Opposition to the Claims of G.B. The line We have pursued has been the Line We ought to have pursued If what we have done had been proposed two Years ago, 4 Colonies would not have been for it. Suppose we had a dozen Crown Officers in our Possession. Have We determined what to do with them? Shall we hang them. Lee. Those who apply general Reasons to this particular Case will draw improper Conclusions. Those Crown Officers who have advised his Lordship vs. his violent Measures, have been quarrell'd with by him. Virginia is pierced in all Parts with navigable Waters. His Lordship knows all these Waters and the Plantations on them. Shuldam is coming to assist him in destroying these Plantations. We see his Influence with an abandoned Administration, is sufficient to obtain what he pleases. If 6 Weeks may furnish decisive Information, the same Time may produce decisive destruction to Maryland and Virginia. Did We go fast enough when We suffered the Troops at Boston to fortify. Zubly. This is a sudden Motion. The Motion was yesterday to apprehend Govr. Tryon. We have not yet conquered the Army or Navy of G.B. A Navy, consisting of a Cutter, rides triumphant in Virginia. There are Persons in America who wish to break off with G.B. A Proposal has been made to apply to France and Spain-before I agree to it, I will inform my Constituents. I apprehend the Man who should propose it would be torn to pieces like De Wit. Wythe. It was from a Reverence for this Congress that the Convention of Virginia, neglected to arrest Lord Dunmore. It was not intended suddenly, to form a Precedent for Govr. Tryon. If Maryland   have a Desire to have a Share in the Glory of seizing this Nobleman, let them have it. The 1st. objection is the Impracticability of it. I dont say that it is practicable, but the attempt can do no harm. From seizing Cloathing in Delaware, seizing the Transports &c., the Battles of Lexington, Charlestown, &c., every Man in Great Britain will be convinced by Ministry and Parliament that We are aiming at an Independency on G.B. Therefore We need not fear from this Step disaffecting our Friends in England. As to a Defection in the Colonies, I cant answer for Maryland, Pensylvania, &c. but I can for Virginia. Johnson. I am not vs. allowing Liberty to arrest Ld. Dunmore- there is Evidence that the Scheme he is executing was recommended by himself. Maryland does not regard the Connection with G.B. as the first good. Stone. If We signify to Virginia, that it will not be disagreable to us, if they secure Ld. Dunmore, that will be sufficient. Lewis moves an Amendment, that it be recommended to the Council of Virginia, that they take such Measures to secure themselves, from the Practices of Lord Dunmore, either by seizing his Person, or otherwise as they think proper. Hall. A Material Distinction between a peremptory order to the Council of Virginia, to seize his Lordship, and a Recommendation to take such Measures as they shall judge necessary, to defend themselves against his Measures. Motion to export Produce for Powder.(2) Sherman. I think We must have Powder, and We may send out Produce for Powder. But upon some Gentlemen Principles We must have a general Exportation. Paine. From the observations some Gentlemen have made I think this Proposition of more Importance than it appeared at first. In Theory I could carry it further, even to Exportation and Importation to G.B. A large Continent cant Act upon Speculative Principles, but must be govern'd by Rules. Medicines, We must have-some Cloathing, &c. I wish We could enter upon the Question at large, and agree upon some System. Chase. By the Resolution We may send to G.B., Ireland and W. Indies. Lee. Suppose Provisions should he sold in Spain for Money, and Cash sent to England for Powder. Duane. We must have Powder. I would send for Powder to London, or any where. We are undone if We hant Powder. Dean. I hope the Words \""Agreable to the Association\"" will be inserted. But I would import from G.B. Powder.   R. R. Livingston. We are between Hawk and Buzzard. We puzzle ourselves between the commercial and warlike opposition. Rutledge. If Ammunition was to be had from England only, there would be W teigh] t in the Gentlemans Arg [ument] . The Captn. Reed told us Yesterday that he might have bro't 1000 Blls. of Powder. Why? Because he was not searched. But if he had attempted to bring Powder, he would have been search'd. I would let the Ass[ociation] stand as it is, and order the Committee to export our Provisions consistent with it. Lee. When a Vessell comes to England vs. our Association, she must be observed and watched. They would keep the Provisions, but not let us have the Powder. Deane. I have not the most distant Idea of infringing the Association. Duane. The Resolution with the Amendment amounts to nothing. The Committee may import now consistent with the Association. I apprehend that by breaking the Association We may import Powder, without it not. We must have Powder. We must fight our Battles in two or three Months, in every Colony. J. Rutledge. They may export to any other Place and thence send Money to England. New York letter, concerning a Fortification on the high Lands, considered .(3) Dyer. Cant say how far it would have been proper to have gone upon Romains Plan in the Spring, but thinks it too late now. There are Places upon that River, that might be thrown up in a few days, that would do. We must go upon some Plan that will be expeditious. Lee. Romain says a less or more imperfect Plan would only be beginning a Strong hold for an Enemy. Deane. An order went to N. York. They have employed an Engineer. The People and he agree in the Spot and the Plan. Unless We rescind the whole, We should go on. It ought to be done. ""

I am very Sorry to learn from your Letter that you have occasion for any Advice of mine, and have not had an opportunity of take it. I fully intended to have made you a visit,(1) but my stay was so short and I had so many Engagements that it was out of my Power. That a great Revolution, in the affairs of the World, is in the Womb of Providence, Seems to be intimated very Strongly, by many Circumstances: But it is no Pleasure to me to be employed in giving Birth to it. The Fatigue, and Anxiety, which attends it are too great. Happy the Man, who with a plentifull Fortune, an elegant Mind and an amiable Family, retires from the Noises, Dangers and confusions of it. However, by a Train of Circumstances, which I could neither foresee nor prevent, I have been called by Providence to take a larger share in active Life, during the Course of these Struggles, than is agreable either to my Health, my Fortune or my Inclination, and I go through it with more Alacrity and Chearfullness than I could have expected. I often envy the Silent Retreat of some of my Friends. But if We should so far succeed as to secure to Posterity the Blessings of a free Constitution, that alone will forever be considered by me as an ample Compensation for all the Care, Fatigue, and Loss that I may sustain in the Conflict. I am much obliged by your kind Explanation of your opinion that the Harbour might be locked up. I must confess, altho I was born so near it, I never before understood the Course of the Channell, and the Situation of the Harbour so well. I have carefully compared your Descriptions of Squantum, the Moon, Long Island, Gallops Island, Lovells Island, and Georges, the Narrows and Nantaskett Road, with \""A Plan of the Town and Chart of the Harbour of Boston, exhibiting a View of the Islands, Castle, Fort, and Entrances into the Said Harbour, which was published in London, last February.\"" This Plan I know to be inaccurate in some Particulars, and the Chart may be so in others: but by the best Judgment I can make, upon comparing your Facts with the Chart, and considering the Depths of Water marked on this Chart, I think it extreamly probable, with you that nothing but Powder and Cannon are wanting, to effect the important Purposes you mention, that of making Soldiers and Sailors Prisoners at Discretion. Dr Franklyns Row Gallies are in great Forwardness. Seven of them are compleated, manned, armed &c. I went down the River the other Day with all of them.(2) I have as much Confidence in them as you have. But the People here have made what some call Chevaux  OCTOBER 6, 1775  Channell of Delaware River. Three Rows of them, are phased in the River, with large Timbers barbed with Iron. They are frames of Timber Sunk with stone Machines very proper, for our Channell in the Narrows [. .. .] (3) ""

It should be considered out of Respect to the Colony of R. Island who desired it. Determined against the appointment of a Committee.(3) Report of the Committee for fortifying upon Hudsons River considered.(4) J. Rutledge. I think We should add to the Report, that they take the most effectual Measures to obstruct the Navigation of Hudsons River by Booms or otherwise. Gadsden seconds the Motion. Deane doubts the Practicability of obstructing it with Booms, it is so wide. The Committee said 4 or 5 Booms chained together, and ready to be drawn across, would stop the Passage. The Congress of N.Y. is to consult the Assembly of Connecticutt and the Congress of N. Jersey, the best Method of taking Posts and making Signals, and assembling Forces for Defence of the River. Gadsden. Moves that all the Letters, laid before us from England, should be sent to the Convention of N. York. Tryon is a dangerous Man, and the Convention of that Colony should be upon their guard. Lee. I think the Letters should by all means be sent. Rutledge. Dr. F. desired they might not be printed. Moves that Gen. Wooster with his Troops may be ordered down to N. York.(5) Duane. Moves that Woosters Men may be employed in building the Fortifications. Dyer 2ds the Motion allowing the Men what is usual. Sherman. Would have the order conditional, if Schuyler dont want them. Understands that N.Y. has the best Militia upon the Continent. R. Livingston. They will be necessary at the Highlands.132   Dyer thinks they ought to have the usual allowance for Work. S. Adams. Understands that the Works at Cambridge was done without any Allowance, but that G[eneral] W[ashington] has ordered that for future works they be allowed half a Pistareen a day. Langdon would not have the order to Wooster, but to Schuyler for he would not run any risque of the northern Expedition. Rutledge thinks Schuyler cant want them. He waited only for Boats to send 500 Men more. Sherman. Would it not be well to inform Schuyler of our endeavours to take the Transports and desire him to acquaint Coll. Arnold of it. Rutledge. He may cooperate with Arnold in taking the Transports. I hope he is in Possession of Montreal before now. Deane. I wish that whatever Money is collected, may be sent along to Schuyler. E. Rutledge. We have been represented as beggarly fellows, and the first Impressions are the strongest. If We eat their Provisions and dont pay, it will make a bad Impression. Ross. Produces a Resolve of the Assembly of Pensylvania that their Delegates lay the Connecticutt Intrusion before Congress, that something may be done to quiet the Minds.(6) J. Rutledge moves that the Papers be referr'd to the Delegates of the two Colonies. Willing. Thinks them Parties and that they must have an Umpire. Sherman. Thinks they may agree on a temporary Line. Lee. Moves that Parliamentary or ministerial Post may be stopp'd, as a constitutional Post is now established from N.H. to G.(7) Langdon 2d ts] the Motion. Willing. Thinks it is interfering with that Line of Conduct which we have hitherto prescribed to ourselves-it is going back beyond the Year 1763. Lee. When the Ministry are mutilating our Correspondence in England, and our Enemies here are corresponding for our ruin, shall We not stop the ministerial Post. Willing. Looks upon this to be one of the offensive Measures which are improper at this Time-it will be time enough to throw this aside when the Time comes that we shall throw every Thing aside-at present We dont know but there may be a Negociation. Dyer. We have already superceeded the Act of Parliament effectually. Deane is for a Recommendation to the People to write by the constitutional Post, not forbid a Man to ride. S. Adams thinks it a defensive Measure, and advising People not  to write by it, looks too cunning for me. I am for stopping the Correspondence of our Enemies. Langdon. Administration are taking every Method to come at our Intentions, why should not we prevent it. Duane. I shall vote vs. it. It may be true that We are come to the Time when We are to lay aside all. I think there should be a full Representation of the Colonies. N.C. should be here. Deane 2d[s] the Motion for postponing it. Zubly. The Necessity of this Measure does not appear to me. If We have gone beyond the Line of 1763 and of defence without apparent Necessity it was wrong, if with Necessity right. I look upon the Invasion of Canada a very different Thing. I have a Right to defend myself vs. Persons who come vs. me, let em come from whence they will. We in G. have gain[ed] Intelligence by the K's Post that We could not have got any other Way. Some Gentlemen think all Merit lies in violent and unnecessary Measures. S. Adams. The Gentlemans Argument would prove that We should let the Post go into Boston. Moreton. Would not this stop the Packett. Would it not be ordered to Boston. Does the Packett bring any Intelligence to Us that is of Use? Lee. No Intelligence comes to Us, but constant Intelligence to our Enemies. Stone. Thinks it an innocent Motion, but is for postponing it, because he is not at present clear. He thinks that the setting up a new Post has already put down the old one. Paine. My opinion was that the Ministerial Post will die a natural death. It has been under a Languishment a great while. It would be Cowardice to issue a Decree to kill that which is dying. It brought but one Letter last time, and was obliged to retail Newspapers, to bear its Expences. I am very loath to say that this Post shall not pass. Lee. Is there not a Doctor Ld. North who can keep this Creature alive. R. R. Livingstone. I don't think that Tory Letters are sent by the Royal Post. I consider it rather as a Convenience than otherwise. We hear 5 times a Week from N.Y. The Letters upon our Table advise us to adopt every conciliatory Measure, that we may secure the Affections of the People of England. ""

792,dg002148,1775,John Adams to Abigail Adams,"""John Adams to Abigail Adams   My dear Philadelphia Octr. 7th. 1775 Yesterday, by the Post, I received yours of Septr. 25th., and it renewed a Grief and Anxiety, that was before almost removed from my Mind. Two days before I had the Pleasure of a very valuable Letter from Coll. Quincy, in which he kindly informed me that you and Our Family were so much better that you and my dear Nabby had made a Visit at his House: and Mr. Williams, who brought the Letter acquainted me that he had been to Braintree after the Date of it, that you was in good Spirits, that Tommy was so much better as to be playing abroad, and that he hoped Patty was not dangerous: you will easily believe that this Information gave me great Pleasure and fine Spirits: It really relieved me from a heavy Load: But your last Letter has revived my Concern. I will still hope however that your excellent Mother will yet be spared for a Blessing to her Family and an Example to the World.(1) I build my Hopes of her Recovery, upon the Advantage of a Constitution whicll has hitherto sustained so many Attacks and upon a long Course of exact Temperance which I hope has deprived the Distemper of its most dangerous food and Fuel. However, our Lives are not in our own Power. It is our Duty to submit. \""The Ways of Heaven are dark and intricate.\"" Its designs are often inscrutable, But are always wise and just and good. It was long before I had the least Intimation of the Distress of the Family, and I fear, that your not receiving so many Letters from me as usual may have been one Cause of Infelicity to you. Really, my dear, I have been more cautious than I used to be. It is not easy to know whom to trust, in these times, and if a Letter from any Person in the situation I am in, can be laid hold of, there are so many Lies made and told about it, so many false Copies taken and dispersed, and so many false Constructions put, that one ought to be cautious. The Situation of Things, is so alarming, that it is our Duty to pre- OCTOBER 7, 1775  pare our Minds and Hearts for every Event, even the Worst. From my earliest Entrance into Life, I have been engaged in the public Cause of America: and from first to last I have had upon my Mind, a strong Impression, that Things would be wrought up to their present Crisis. I saw from the Beginning that the Controversy was of such a Nature that it never would be settled, and every day convinces me more and more. This has been the source of all the Disquietude of my Life. It has lain down and rose up with me these twelve Years. The Thought that we might be driven to the sad Necessity of breaking our Connection with G.B. exclusive of the Carnage and Destruction which it was easy to see must attend the separation, always gave me a great deal of Grief. And even now, I would chearfully retire from public life forever, renounce all Chance for Profits or Honours from the public, nay I would chearfully contribute my little Property to obtain Peace and Liberty. But all these must go and my Life too before I can surrender the Right of my Country to a free Constitution. I dare not consent to it. I should be the most miserable of Mortals ever after, whatever Honours or Emoluments might surround me. ""

793,dg002149,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dr sir Philadelphia Octr. 7th. 1775 The Debates, and Deliberations in Congress are impenetrable Secrets: but the Conversations in the City, and the Chatt of the Coffee house, are free, and open. Indeed I wish We were at Liberty to write freely and Speak openly upon every Subject, for their is frequently as much Knowledge derived from Conversations and .Correspondence, as from Solemn public Debates. A more intricate and complicated Subject never came into any Mans thoughts, than the Trade of America.(1) The Questions that arise, when one thinks of it, are very numerous. If The Thirteen united Colonies Should immediately Surcease all Trade with every Part of the World, what would be the Consequence? In what manner, and to what degree, and how Soon, would it affect, the other Parts of the World? How would it affect G. B., Ireland, the English West India Islands, the French, the Dutch, the Danish, the Spanish West India Islands? How would it affect the Spanish Empire on the Continent? How would it affect the Brazills and Portuguese Settlements in America? If it is certain that it would distress Multitudes in these Countries, does it therefore follow that it OCTOBER 7, 1775  would induce any foreign Court to offer Us Assistance, and to ask us for our Trade or any Part of it? If it is questionable whether foreign States would venture upon Such Steps, which would perhaps be Violations of Treaties of Peace, and certainly would light up a War in Europe, is it certain that Smugglers, by whom I mean private Adventurers belonging to foreign Nations, would come here, through all the Hazards they must run. Could they be suffered to clear out for America in their own Custom houses? Would they not run the risque of Seizure from their own Custom house officers, or of Capture from their own Men of War? Would they not be liable to be visited by British Men of War, in any Part of the ocean, and if found to have no Clearances be seized? When they arrive on any Part of the Coast of N. America, would they not be seized by Brittish Cutters, Cruizers, Tenders, Frigates without Number: [But] if their good Fortune should escape all these Risques, have We harbours or Rivers, sufficiently fortified, to insure them Security while here? In their Return to their own Country would they not have the Same Gauntlett to run. In Short, if We stop our own ships, have We even a Probability that the ships of foreign Nations, will run the Venture to come here, either with or without the Countenance and Encouragement of their Severall Courts or States public or private open or secret? It is not easy for any Man precisely and certainly to answer tllis question. We must then say all this is uncertain. Suppose then We assume an intrepid Countenance, and Send Ambassadors at once to foreign Courts. What Nation shall We court? Shall We go to the Court of France, or the Court of Spain, to the States General of the United Provinces? to the Court of Lisbon, to the Court of Prussia, or Russia, or Turkey, or Denmark, or where, to any, one, more, or all of these? If We Should is there a Probability, that Our Ambassadors would be received, or so much as heard or seen by any Man or Woman in Power at any of these Courts. He might possibly, if well skill'd in intrigue, his Pocketts well filled with Money and his Person Robust and elegant enough, get introduced to some of the Misses, and Courtezans in keeping of the Statesmen in France, but wd not that be all. An offer of the Sovereignty of this Country to France or Spain would be listened to no doubt by Either of those Courts, but We should Suffer any Thing before We shd offer this. What then can We offer? An Alliance, a Treaty of Commerce? What Security could they have that We should keep it. Would they not reason thus. These People intend to make Use of Us to establish an Independency but the Moment they have done it: Britain will make Peace with them, and leave Us in the Lurch and We have more to dread from an alliance Between Britain and the United Colonies as an independent state, than We have now they are under one corrupted Administra-  tion. Would not Spain reason in the Same manner, and say further, our Dominions in South America will be soon a Prey to these Enterprizing and warlike Americans, the Moment they are an independent State. Would not our Proposals and Agents be treated with Contempt! And if our Proposals were made and rejected, would not this sink the Spirits of our own People, Elevate our Enemies and disgrace Us in Europe. If then, it will not be Safe to Stop our own Ships entirely, and trust to foreign Vessells coming here either with or without Convoy of Men of War, belonging to foreign States, what is to be done? Can our own People bear a total Cessation of Commerce? Will not Such Numbers be thrown out of Employment, and deprived of their Bread, as to make a large discontented Party? Will not the Burthen of supporting these Numbers, be too heavy upon the other Part of the Community? Shall We be able to maintain the War, wholly without Trade? Can We support the Credit of our Currency, without it? If We must have Trade how Shall We obtain it? There is one Plan, which alone, as it has ever appeared to me, will answer the End in some Degree, at first. But this is attended with So many Dangers to all Vessells, certain Loss to many, and So much Uncertainty upon the whole, that it is enough to make any Man, thoughtfull. Indeed it is looked upon So wild, extravagant and romantic, that a Man must have a great deal of Courage, and much Indifference to common Censure, who should dare to propose it. \""God helps those who help themselves,\"" and it has ever appeared to me since this unhappy Dispute began, that We had no Friend upon Earth to depend on but the Resources of our own Country, and the good sense and great Virtues of our People. We shall finally be obligd to depend upon ourselves. Our Country furnished a vast abundance of materials for Commerce. Foreign Nations have great Demands for them. If We should publish an Invitation to any one Nation or more, or to all Nations, to send their ships here, and let our Merchants inform theirs that We have Harbours where the Vessells can lie in Safety, I conjecture that many private foreign Adventurers would find Ways to send Cargoes here thro all the Risques without Convoys. At the Same Time our own Merchants would venture out with their Vessells and Cargoes, especially in Winter, and would run thro many Dangers, and in both these Ways together, I should hope We might be supplied with Necessaries. All this however Supposes that We fortify and defend our own Harbours and Rivers. We may begin to do this. We may build Row Gallies, flatt bottomed Boats, floating Batteries, Whale Boats, Vesseaux de Frize, nay Ships of War, how many, and how large I cant Say. To talk of coping Suddenly with G. B. at Sea would be Quixot-  ism indeed. But the only Question with me is can We defend our Harbours and Rivers? If We can We can trade.(2) ""

796,dg002152,1775,John Hancock to Philip Schuyler,"""John Hancock to Philip Schuyler   Sir Philadelphia Octr. 7th 1775 By Intelligence received from England and laid before the Congress on the 5th Instant,(1) we are well assured that two North Country Briggs were dispatched from England to Quebec on the 11th of August with a very large Quantity of Arms, Ammunition and Cloathing. If you should be happy enough to possess yourself of Montreal, it is the earnest Desire of the Congress, that you take Measures if those Vessels should arrive, to seize them and secure their Cargoes for the Use of the Continent. It is also the Desire of the Congress that you secure for the same purpose all Military Stores belonging to the King. I am also to inform you that we have Intelligence that Administration are obstinately determined to pursue every Measure in their power to subjugate the Colonies, and in Order to execute their purpose, they have determined to send over five more Regiments viz: 17th, 27th, 28th, 46th & 55th to New York. Their plan is that these Troops \""with the assistance of Governor Tryon, who is much relied [on] for the purpose to get immediate possession of New York and Albany-to fill both these Cities with very strong Garrisons-to declare all Rebels, who do not join the King's Forces-to command the Hudson and East Rivers, with a Number of small Men of War and Cutters stationed in different parts of it so as wholly to cut off all Communication by Water between New York & the provinces to the Northward of it, and between New York and Albany except for the King's Service & to prevent also all Communication between the City of New York and the provinces of Jersey Pennsylvania and those to the Southward of them. By these Means Adm--- n and their Friends fancy that they shall soon either starve out or retake the Garrisons of Ticonderoga & Crown Point and open and maintain a safe Intercourse and Correspondence between Quebec Albany and New York & thereby afford the fairest Opportunity to their Soldiery and Canadians in Conjunction with the indians to be procured by G[uy] J[ohnson] to make continual Irruptions into New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut and so distract and divide the provincial Forces as to render it easy for the British Army at Boston to defeat them, break the Spirit of the Massachusetts people, depopulate their Country and compel OCTOBER 7, 1775  an absolute Subjection to Great Britain. Another good Effect to be deduced from this extensive plan as Government apprehend is that as New York will by this Method be prevented from supplying the Massachusetts army near Boston with Flour &c as they have heretofore done through the Medium of Connecticut: and the New Jersey and Pennsylvania people will not be able to transport provisions across the Country: and as the Colony of Connecticut does not raise Corn sufficient for the Supply of herself & the Massachusetts Bay, the Inhabitants and Troops of this province must inevitably of Course by [be] in a short Time destroyed by Diseases & Famine, and to this Train of Facts let me add, That in Consequence of Genl. Gage's desire brought by Capt. Chad one hundred flat Bottomed Boats are at present building at Deptford &c in Order to be sent immediately to America. But for what particular purpose I have not yet been able to learn. Many American Gentlemen have however been lately asked by a Lord high in the American Department, what sized vessels can go loaded from hence to Albany? What is the Depth of Water at the Overslaw. I think that is the Name of the shallowest place in the North River Whether the ship belonging to Albany in the London Trade is always obliged to unload part of her Cargo before she can get to Albany and what proportion of it? Whether if Batteries were erected at the Highlands, they would not prevent Vessels from going up and down the North River? and where it would be the best place on that River to hinder the New Jersey people &c. from sending Flour &c. in the Winter through Connecticut to the Massachusetts Army. These are the proposed Operations to the Northward.\"" I hope the Success of the Enterprize you are engaged [in] and the happy Change in the Disposition of the Canadians & Indians will disappoint and defeat the infernal purposes of administration. Your Letters of the 25th & 28th Ult. have been laid before the Congress.(2) Measures are taking to collect a Quantity of Gold and Silver, which when collected will be sent to you by the safest & speediest Conveyance, when I shall again address you.

799,dg002155,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dear Sir October the 8. 1775 You will not think your Time misspent in Perusing any Plans for the service of your Country, even altho they may prove, upon Examination chimerical. There are two Channells only, through which Vessells of large Burthen, can pass, to and from Boston: one is between the West Head of Long Island and the Moon: It is a mile wide, but incumbered with Rocks and too shallow for a Man of War of more than twenty Guns. The other is between Long Island and Deer Island, a mile and a half from Point to Point, the only Channell, thro which capital Ships can pass, leads through the Narrows, between Gallops Island and Lovells Island where it is not wider, than the length of a fifty Gun Ship. In the Interval between Gallops and George's, is Nantaskett Road where, five Men of War are now Stationed: for what other Encl, do you Suppose, than to guard the Narrows from being obstructed? The Moon communicates with Squantum, at low Water, even without a Canoe. A Fort, therefore, upon Squantum, may be so placed as to secure a Retreat from the Moon to Squantum and from that to the Main: one upon the East Head of the Moon, and another on the West Head of Long Island, secures the Communication, and covers a Retreat from the latter to the former: Another, on the Summit of Long Island, covers the shore on each Side. A strong Battery at the East Head of Long Island, commands the Ship Channell, the Narrows, and Nantaskett Road. Consequently by Sinking Hulks or Vesseaux de Frise, in the Narrows, We might prevent any Vessell of great Force from going out, or coming in. In the Month of February last, \""a Plan of the Town and Chart of the Harbour of Boston,\"" was published in London-I think in a Magazine. I wish you would examine this Project by that Plan, and give me your opinion. I dont trouble Washington with any of these Schemes, because 1 dont wish to trouble him with any Thing to no Purpose. But if I could command a Thousand Tons of Powder, and an hundred Pieces of heavy Cannon I would Scribble to him till he would be weary of me. Mean Time It may not be amiss for me to amuse myself with some of my Friends, in Speculations of this kind, because some good may Some time or other Result from them.  OCTOBER 8, 1775  Can no use be made of Rowe Gallies, with you? Eight or Ten are compleated here. Can they be used in the Vineyard Sound? Would not their heavy Metal demolish a Cruizer now and then? There is a Shipwright escaped from Boston, who [has] been several Years a Prisoner in a Turkish Galley, and has a Model of one. Coll. Quincy knows him. Or I could procure you Directions from this Place, how to construct them. We have just received by an express from Schuyler, very promising Intelligence concerning the operations of the Northern Army. Ethan Allen are in the Heart of the Country joined by 200 Canadians. Montgomery was beginning to bombard St Johns. If We should be successful in that Province, a momentous, political Question arises. What is to be done with it? A Government will be necessary for the Inhabitants of Canada, as for those of the Massachusetts Bay? and what Form of Government, shall it be? Shall the Canadians choose an House of Representatives, a Council and a Governor? It will not do to govern them by Martial Law, and make our General Governor. This will be disrelished by them as much as their new Parliamentary Constitution or their old French Government. Is there Knowledge and Understanding enough among them, to elect an assembly, which will be capable of ruling them and then to be governed by it-who shall constitute their Judges and civil Officers? This appears to me as serious a Problem as any We shall have to solve.(1) When I was at Watertown, a Comtee. of both Houses was appointed to Correspond with Us. We have not recd any Letter from it.

804,dg002160,1775,President of the New Jersey Provincial Congress,"""President of the New Jersey Provincial Congress   Sir [October 9, 1775] The Continental Congress have this Day Agreed to Recommend to the Jersey Congress to Raise two Battallions for one year to Consist of 8 Companys of 68 Men to be sent to New York as soon as raised where it is expected their Assistance may be Wanted this Winter or early in the Spring. In Case the present Unhappy differences should be soon Settled & they discharged sooner the Men to receive one Months pay extra ordinary. The Troops hitherto raised in any of the Colonys have had the Appointment of the Colonells and All the Inferier Offficers and the Men 50 Shillings per Month. It is Voted by the Congress that 5 Dollars per Month should be paid to the Jersey Troops and we have had a Considerable Debate whether the provincial Congresses Should have the Appointment of the field Officers of the Regiment or only the Captains & the Offficers downward. The Reason of Lessening the pay is The Expences of the Continent are so enormous and so beyond the Abilitees to pay that the Congress propose to Lessen All the pay after December. Whether the Last proposition will take place or not is Undetermined that is Whether the Continental Congress or the Several provincial Congresses shall Appoint the Regimental field officers. (From what has Already past in Congress We believe the Majority of the Congress will incline to take the Appointment of the field officers of the Regiments into their Owtl hands. Whether the New England Colonies will submitt to that Inclination We doubt.) We beg the favor of You to lay this before the New Jersey Congress and Request of them to Return an Answer to the Continental Congress Whether on these Terms the Troops Can be had in Jersey and Whether the Congress will putt the Recommendation in practice.(1) As Delegates of New Jersey We think it our Duty to state these Facts for Your Consideration without any Observation of Our Own Not doubting but that You will bestow the proper Consideration on OCTOBER 9, 1775  the subject and Come to that Determination which Your Duty and the Common Interest Dictate. You will receive We Expect a Letter from the president inclosing the Minutes of the Continental Congress relating to this Matter which will More particularly Mention the Terms. We are with great Respect Your Frds and Serts Js Kinsey Wil: Livingston MS not found; reprinted from Burnett, Lcttcrs, 1:223-24. 1 At first the New Jersey Provincial Congress was reluctant to grant Congress the appointment of field officers for the colony's battalions, but in time a compromise was reached whereby the provincial congress submitted nominees which Congress then approved.

We ought to be prepared for the worst, The Town of Providence We hope is secure if not We would advise to such additional works as the Fall will admit & necessity requires The People in Newport We hope have secured their best Effects in Places of Safety. We think indeed that it would be for theirs & their Countrys Interest that they should abandon the Town. We are afraid dike the unhappy People of Boston) that they will stay too long. We doubt not but your best Endeavours will be used to secure as much as possible every Part of the Colony. The ministry depends much upon Canada. Their Plan by the best Intelligence is to take Possession of New York, Hudsons River & Albany keep open a Communication with Canada, cut off all Intercourse between New England & the other Colonies sett the Canadians & Indians upon our Frontiers, and arm all our domestic Enemies against Us.

Upon Motion that it should be recommended to the Convention of Virginia to arrest & secure Lord Dunmore a general Resolution was come into a Copy of which is inclosed.(1) This as to our Colony is a matter of great Delicacy especially in New port.

Whether such a measure would have that happy Effect or precipitate an Attack upon them You who are upon the Spot & well acquainted with the State of the Colony in all Respects can best determine. New Hampshire some time since seized the Money in the public Treasury. She has lately disarmed all the Torries & crown officers. Connecticut disarmed two whole Towns, other Colonies have seized public Money's & Supplied them to provincial Uses. We are clear that such measures when necessary for the public Safety are perfectly justifiable. As to this particular Matter We submit it wholly to your Honor only suggesting whether it will not be best to keep the inclosed matter Secret save from a few trusty Friends until the next assembly, & then communicate it under the strongest Injunctions of Secresy that our Enemies may get no Knowledge of it & that such Measures may be taken as the public Safety shall require. May infinte Wisdom direct & prosper all your Councils. By Letters from Genl. Schuyler of 19th Sepr. We are informed that the American Troops had surrounded St. Johns & cut off the Enemies Communication with Montreal; before this Time We hope they are in Possession of both for as our People are joined by the Canadians they will have nobody to contend with but the few Regulars in that Country; by these happy Acquisitions to which We hope Quebec will be soon added We shall altogether disappoint the most favourite Plan of the Ministry.

As it is a verry great disadvantage to me to be so much from my private Concerns, I hope therefore you will between this and your Coming to Newcastle, put All my business as well as your own upon the best footing you possibly Can, or Else when both are away We Shall doubly Suffer. I am Sorry Circumstances turned out so Contrary [o your Good intentions toward John Bullen. But Your Carrying Sipple so near him as to put it in the power of the others to Shoot him ahead Certainly Broke your Scheme with Respect to him-for tho it was Just and Right that Bullen (according to your party Agrement) Should have the Commission, Yet as those Manuveries of party are, and Ought to be unknown to a Governor, and as it is a Just Rule of Conduct in him to give the Commission to the highest in Vote [s], I Could not Serve Bullen unless I had asked as a favour, which (I dare say you will be of opinion with me) would have been paying too dear for a Commission of no more importance than that of a Coroner. You may perhaps have it in Your power to take better Care of him another time. But we Shall talk More of this another time. On Fryday about Eleven O'CLOCK at night Doctor. Kearsly of this City was Seized by Order of the Committee of Observation,(2) for having wrote Letters to England injurious & distructive to us in the American Contest, and wicked with Respect to this City, and is now Confined in Goal Together with one Brooks who Came here with Governor Skeen, Mr. Carter an apothecary who was in partnership with Speakman, and one Mr. Snowden, all of whom were Aiding the Doctor. in his plan. You must know Kearsly has been a Considerable time Since Marked out as a thorough-paced Tory, for Which, together with his having Insulted the people he was (Since I Came to Town last) Carted through the Streets. But the offence for Which he is now Confined is thus Circumstanced. On Wednesday last A Ship OCTOBER 9, 1775  Sailed out of this port for London, in Which Mr. Carter was going passenger. A few days before she Sailed, Young Dewees, son of the Sheriff went to pay Doctor. Kearsly Some Money and Comeing Suddenly in to his Room found him and Carter together, with a bundle of Papers before them, which they Hussel'd up in Seeming Confusion. This, with Kearsly's Tory Carrictor gave Dewees Suspition, and he Accordingly informed a few of the Committee Who kept the matter Secret, Let the Ship Sail, and the passengers go down to Chester by Land to go on Board. On Thursday Evening Which was the day the passengers Went, A Small party was Sent down to Chester. They Stayed there that night in Cogg [incognito] and see the passengers go on board next Morning. They then imediately pushed on board, Seized and Examined Mr. Carter who in a Little time told them that there were Several Letters from Doctor. Kearsly & Mr. Brooks, And one from Mr. Snowden, That he had the Charge of them, and was Concerned with them in the plan they had Concerted, But that the Letters were then in the Custody of a woman down in the Cabin, And that She had them Concealed in a pocket Sewed to the inside of her Shift-Tail, Where in fact they Soon after found them and Came back to Town (leaving Carter as they had promised Upon his Making a discovery of the Whole Matter on a Oath before Mr. Grayham at Chester) and then Seized the Authors. The Letters were to Lord Dartmouth and other Ministers of State, But under Cover to Misses McCawley. The Substance and design was pressing their Sending to Philadelphia five thousand Regulars, on Which Condition they would Engage five thousand more here to Join them, provided the Royal Standard Should be also Sent in, and Kearsly appointed to bear it, for that Great numbers of those who now wear Cockades & Uniform were hearty in the Ministerial Cause. That the Rest were a pack of Cowards for that he (Kearsly) had made above five thousand of them Run By Snapping a Single Pistol at them &c &c. They had with them for the use of the Ministry one of Joshua Fishers plans of Delaware Bay & River, whereon they had described the place Where the Chevaux Defreise's were fixed. Besides these and Many more Villinous Contrivances, they were takeing home the out-lines for a print to be Struck off in London, Shewing Kearsly's late Exhibition in the Cart, going through the Streets of Philadelphia with the Mob, many of Whom he undertakes particularly to discribe, to wit, Bradford &c. &c. many of whom were actually not there, and how he every now and then by Snapping his Pistol made them Run &c. His abuse of the Congress, Committees &c. (in his letters) is intolerable, Such as Rebels, Villians &c. After the Committee of Safety had Examined them and the Contents of the Letters, they Sent a Pilot Boat down the River to overtake the Ship, to bring up Carter, and to Search the Box of Letters and to bring all of them that they Sup-  posed to be from, or to Suspicious persons. This Boat Returned Sunday afternoon, brought Carter and put him in Goal, and also brought a Number of Letters belonging to and wrote by other persons. The Committee of Safety has been Setting on these affairs all this day. But I have been so Closely Confined to Congress to day, that I don't yet know what they have done-or What others are accused.

The French Officers are allowed to exceed any in Europe, because a Gentleman is hardly entituled to the Smiles of the Ladies without serving a Campaign. In my Province, We want Officers.

Several Ships of War were also orderd to America. What was intended for Quebeck were to sail in a fortnight from the Date of the Letter which was the 8th of August. The Regiments from Ireland were intended to be at Boston in October. The Parliamt was to meet in Octr and so soon, that a Sanction might be given as early as possible to the Measures that have been taken as well as others to be adopted. General Gage had been appointed Governor General of all North America but afterwards it was concluded that Leave should be given him to return home. This was to make Room for Genl Amherst who is to take the Command in the Spring with a promise of 20,000 Men- 2000 Highlanders 3000 Irish Roman Catholicks and the rest, if they cannot be raisd in England, to consist of Hannoverians Hessians & other Germans. The Plan said to have been laid before Ministry last Spring which was to divide the Troops then sent out, a part of them to go to New York is now to be followed. General Gages Necessity then obligd him to alter that plan and to collect all his Troops together at Boston. Govr Carleton had orders to enter upon the New England Frontiers with the Canadians, and Tryon with the Forces at New York was to meet and cooperate with him. This it is said was the Design of his return to his Governmt. The Idea is not yet given up, and to facilitate the plan a Number of flat bottomd boats were to  OCTOBER 10, 1775  be constructed and so contrivd as when they touch the Shore, to throw down a platform that will land at once 6 Armed Men. They may be used to fire field pieces or Swivel Guns. When they are compleated they are to be taken to pieces and sent to Canada to be used on the Lakes. It was reported in England that the Officers just arrivd from Boston said, the Intention was to dispossess the Americans of Dorchester Neck which was all they thought of doing this Campain; supposing that by the Spring they should have Reinforcements sufficient to attempt any thing, especially as they concluded the Americans would be obligd from the Severity of the Winter to break up their Encampment, while the Soldiers would be in good Quarters in Boston. They also said that the officers were much disgusted with the Service, and that it was with the utmost difficulty the Soldiers were compelld to fight.

I wrote to Patty on my arrival here, and there being then nothing new in the politcal way I inclosed her letter under a blank cover to you. Since that we have received from England news of much importance, which coming thro' many channels we beleive may be confidently relied on. Both the ministerial and provincial accounts of the battle of Bunker's hill had got to England. The ministry were determined to push the war with vigor, a measure in which they were fixed by the defeat of the Spaniards by the Moors. 90. brass cannon were embarked from the tower and may be hourly expected either at N. York or Boston. 2000 troops were to sail from Ireland about the OCTOBER 10, 1775  25th. Sep. These we have reason to beleive are destined for N. York. Commodore Shuldam was to sail about the same time with a great number of frigates and small vessels of war to be distributed among the middle colonies. He comes at the express and earnest intercessions of Ld. Dunmore, and the plan is to lay waste all the plantations on our river sides. Of this we gave immediate notice to our committee of safety by an express whom we dispatched hence last Friday, that if any defence could be provided on the rivers by fortifications or small vessels it might be done immediately.(1) In the spring 10,000 men more are to come over. They are to be procured by taking away two thirds of the Garrison at Gibralter (who are to be replaced by some Hessians) by 2000 Highlanders and 5000 Roman Catholics whom they propose to raise in Ireland. Instead of the Roman Catholics however some of our accounts say foreigners are to be sent. Their plan is this. They are to take possession of New York and Albany, keeping up a communication between them by means of their vessels. Between Albany and St. John's they propose also to keep open the communication; and again between St. John's, Quebec, and Boston. By this means they expect Gage, Tryon and Carleton may distress us on every side acting in concert with one another. By means of Hudson's river they expect to cut off all correspondence between the Northern and Southern rivers. Gage was appointed Governor General of all America; but Sir Jeffery Amherst consented afterwards to come over, so that Gage is to be recalled. But it [is] beleived Amherst will not come till the Spring. In the mean time Howe will have the command. The co-operation of the Canadians is taken for granted in all the ministerial schemes. We hope therefore they will all be dislocated by the events in that quarter. For an account of these I must refer you to Patty. My warmest affection to Mrs. Eppes. Adieu. ""

The Congress have considered your Letters of the 19th and 29th of Sepr. last, and directed me to assure you, that they are very sensible of the Difficulties under which you labour, and your unremitted Dilligence to remove such as may in any wise obstruct the public service. They most heartily lament the Loss of your Health, as well on your own, as on Account of the Public, but find some Pleasure in thinking that you are not without Consolation, when you reflect, that the Obligations of your Country are increased in Proportion to the Sacrifices you make to her Interest. Their Concern for the Public is greatly alliviated by the Abilities and Zeal of Genl. Montgomery, in which they cannot but place the highest Confidence. The Congress see the Necessity of attending to the Situation of Canada, but trust that your Care and Prudence will render any Delegation from this Body unnecessary, at least for the present. What they expect from your Endeavours is, that the Canadians be induced to accede to an Union with these Colonies, and that they form from their several Parishes a Provincial Convention and send Delegates to this Congress. And as in the present unsettled State of that Country, a regular Election can hardly be expected, we must acquiesce in the Choice of such Parishes and Districts as are disposed to join us. You may assure them that we shall hold their Rights as dear as our own, and on their Union with us, exert our utmost Endeavours to obtain for them and their Posterity the Blessings of a free Government, and that Security to their Persons and Property which is derived from the British Constitution. And you may further declare that we hold sacred the Rights of Conscience, and shall never molest them in the free Enjoyment of their Religion. If our Arms should be crowned with Success, you will consult with OCTOBER 11, 1775  your principal Officers about the Number of Troops that will be necessary for the Defence of Canada, and for the different Posts of Crown Point and Ticonderoga, and the best Method of procuring Men for those Services. If you should observe in the Canadians an Inclination to take up Arms, you may immediately, at the Expence of the Continent, raise a Regiment and appoint such officers as you conceive will be most agreeable to them, and serviceable to us. The Congress will endeavour to attend to the Cloathing of your Troops, and approve of your Design to purchase Woolens at Montreal, which they sincerely hope it may be in your Power to accomplish. You may depend upon their Compliance with all Contracts made by you for the Supply of the Troops under your Command. The Establishment of a Civil Government in Canada is a Subject of great Consequence, and requires the most deliberate Councils. The Temper, the Disposition and local Circumstances of our Brethen in that Colony must be known, before we can form a proper Judgment on so important a Question. You will endeavour therefore to collect the Sentiments of the most discreet and sensible among the principal Canadians and English on this Head, and communicate their opinion, with your Remarks to the Congress. It is the Determination of this Congress at all Events to keep the Command of Lake Champlain. They would therefore have the most effectual Measures adopted for that Purpose; and if our Enemies should be expelled [from] Montreal, will exert their utmost Endeavours to secure the River St. Lawrence, and prevent by Batteries, Vessels, and every other Obstruction the ministerial Troops from regaining the Possession of that Town. The Congress approve of the Presents made to the Coghnewagas, also of the Disposition of the Prisoners, and have borrowed one Ton of gun Powder from the Committee of Safety of this Colony, and directed it to be sent to the Provincial Convention of New York, with a Request to transmit to you the whole, or such a Part of it, as they can spare. Nails will be supplied you, by the Convention of New York, when they receive your Direction on that Head. They, together with the Committee of Albany, and the Governor of Connecticut will on Application, furnish such Carpenters and Blacksmiths, as you may want over and above what may be procured from among the Troops. As for the Artificers taken from thence, you will pay them the customary Allowance, if you think their Services entitle them to any Reward. The Congress are pleased with the Mode in which you prepare to settle with and pay those, who took and garrisoned Crown Point, and desire that the Accounts may be transmitted to them as soon as possible. Mr. Phelps will be considered as Deputy to Mr. Livingston for the   New York Department, and be paid as such at the Rate of forty Dollars per Month from his Entrance into the Service. The Congress are greatly hurt at the Misconduct of a Part of the Troops, and hope they will take the earliest opportunity to obliterate their Disgrace.(1) It is their earnest Wish, that the strictest Discipline be observed. For, as on the one Hand, they are resolved to reward those, who deserve their Favour, so on the other, a Regard for their Country forbids them to overlook the offenses of such as neglect their Duty, or basely betray their Trust. I cannot conclude without assuring you that the Congress are highly sensible of the Spirit, Activity, and Zeal, of Mr. James Livingston,(2) from which they cannot but promise themselves Advantages, that will be entitled to their earliest Recompence. I have the Honor to be &c. J H Prest. ""

820,dg002177,1775,Samuel Ward to Henry Ward,"""Samuel Ward to Henry Ward   Dear Brother Philadelphia 11th Octr. 1775 I received yours of 3rd. inst. and very readily allow it to ballance our literary Accts. to that time. Dr. Church, Who could have thought or even suspected it, a Man OCTOBER 11, 1775  who seemed to be all Animation in the Cause of his Country, highly caressed, employed in several very honorable & lucrative Departments, & in full Possession of the Confidence of his Country, what a Complication of Madness & Wickedness must a Soul be filled with to be capable of such Perfidy, what Punishment can equal such horrid Crimes.(1) I communicated the Affair to the Massachusetts Delegates. They could hardly conceive it possible. They soon after recd. some Acct. of the Matter themselves. A Letter from Mr. Secry Reed says upon searching his Papers nothing amiss was found in them. His Friends from thence would infer his Innocence, he pretends that the Letters sent through Wallace were wrote to his Bror. in Law Fleming (late Partner with Mein) & contained Accts. favourable to our Cause. Such Letters as these might have been sent in every Week without Interruption, of course there could be no Occasion for that expensive roundabout & suspicious Way of Conveyance which he took. I am obliged to you for the circumstantial Acct. of the Matter as it throws Light on the Subject. How happy it is that He is discovered before he has done us any considerable Mischief. The greatest that I am apprehensive of is that it may induce Suspicions & lessen that Confidence which is necessary to a cordial Union & our mutual Support, this ought carefully to be guarded against as fatal, and at the same Time the utmost Vigilance is necessary least we should be betrayed. Our Letter to Govr. Cooke & my last to you contain most of the News, but since those I have seen one Letter from a faithful & very sensible Friend in England which gives us a most minute Acct. of affairs. The K says He, who out does Lord Mansfield himself in Dissimulation & Lust of Power is at the Head of the violent Measures pursued & planning; Councils are frequently called, various Conclusions formed but all agreeing in this to make an absolute Conquest of America. The K hath himself prevailed on Sir Jeffery Amherst to come over next Spring, has engaged him a Reinforcement of 20000 Men, 2000 of them Highlanders 3000 Roman Catholics the remaining 15000 to be Hanoverians & Hessians, the Plan of Operations much the same as in our Letter to Govr. Cooke. After giving us a very full Acct. of the Intentions of the Enemy, Our Friend in a most masterly Manner points out many very important Measures for our Defence some of which the Congress have already taken, the rest they will soon adopt I believe, some of them are of such a Nature I dont chuse to commit them to paper. The constant training of the Militia is one thing recommended another is that all the valuable Goods should be removed from Rhode Island least the Town should be surprized as Boston was; I hope this Sentiment from One in England who has the best Means of information will add such Weight to my frequent Applications upon that Subject as may secure  OCTOBER 12, 1775  every thing which it is in their Power to remove or defend. The Peo ple of New York have moved & are daily moving their Families & most valuable Effects into the Country. A very Strong Fortification is building on the Highlands about 45 miles above New York which it is said will effectually command the North River. Two Battalions are ordered by Congress to be immediately raised in the Jerseys for the Defence of that Post & the neighbouring Coasts in one Word all Hopes of a speedy Reconciliation are given over and We unanimously determine to push the War with the greatest Vigor. We recd. Govr. Cooke's Letters of the 3d. and if any thing new turns up to Day We shall write by the Post, if not, We shall omit it for I am almost worn out with Attention; I am upon a standing Comee. of Claims which meets every Morning before Congress; and upon the Secret Comee. which meets almost every afternoon. These with a close Attendance upon Congress and writing many Letters make my Duty very hard; And I cannot get time to ride or take other Exercise but I hope the Business will not be so pressing very long. My affectionate Regards to our Friends. May God preserve them all. I am Most affectionately yours. Sam Ward P.S. That Bundle & Letter for Nancy you will please to take care of & forward as directed.

821,dg002178,1775,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   Oct. 12. [1775] Report, on Trade, considered in a Committee of the whole.(1) Lee. It has been moved to bring the debate to one Point, by putting the Q. whether the Custom houses shall be shut up, and the officers discharged from their several Functions. This would put N. York, N.C., lower Counties and Georgia upon the same Footing with the other Colonies.(2) I therefore move you, that the C[ustom] Houses be shut, and the officers discharged. This will remove Jealousies and Divisions. Zubly. The Measure, We are now to consider, extreamly interesting. I shall offer my Thoughts. If We decide properly, I hope We shall establish our Cause-if improperly, We shall overthrow it, altogether. 1st Prop[osition]. Trade is important. 2. We must have a Reconciliation with G.B. or the Means of carrying on the War. An unhappy day when We shall. OCTOBER 12, 1775  A Republican Government is little better than Government of Devils. I have been acquainted with it from 6 Years old. We must regulate our Trade so as that a Reconciliation be obtained or We enable [d] to carry on the War. Cant say, but I do hope for a Reconciliation, and that this Winter may bring it. I may enjoy my Hopes for Reconciliation, others may enjoy theirs that none will take Place. A Vessell will not go, without Sails or Oars. Wisdom is better than Weapons of War. We dont mean to oppose G.B. merely for Diversion. If it is necessary that We make War, and that we have the Means of it, This Continent ought to know what it is about. The Nation dont. We ought to know what they mean to be about. We ought to have Intelligence of the Designs. K. of Prussia and Count Daune march'd and counter march'd untill they could not impose upon Each other any more. Every Thing We want for the War are Powder and Shot. 2d Thing necessary that We have Arms and Ammunition. 3. We must have Money. The Cont[inent']s Credit must be supported. We must keep up a Notion that this Paper is good for Something. It has not yet a general Circulation. The Mississippi Scheme in France and the South Sea Scheme in England were written for our Learning. An hundred Million fell in one day. 20 Men of War may block up the Harbour of N. York, Del[aw]are River, Cheasapeak Bay, the Carolinas and Georgia. Whether We can raise a Navy is an important Question. We may have a Navy-and to carry on the War We must have a Navy. Can We do this without Trade? Can we gain Intelligence without Trade. Can We get Powder without Trade? Every Vessell you send out is thrown away. N. England where the War is may live without Trade. Money circulates there-they may live. Without Trade our People must starve. We cannot live. We cannot feed or cloath our People. My Resolution was that I would do and suffer any Thing rather than not be free. But I resolved not to do impossible Things. If We must trade, We must trade with Somebody, and with Somebody that will trade with us, either with foreigners or G.B. If with foreigners, We must either go to them or they must come to us. We cant go to them if our Harbours are shut up. I look upon the Trade with foreigners as impracticable. St. Lawrence being open is a Supposition. N. England People last War went to C [ape] Francois. Spaniards are too lazy to come to Us. If We cant trade with foreigners we must trade with G. Britain. Is it practicable. Will it quit cost. Will it do more hurt than good. This is breaking our Association. Our People will think We are giving Way and giving all up. They will say one mischivous Man has over  set the whole Navigation. I speak from Principle. It has been said here that the Association was made in terrorem. Gadsden. 2ds. Lees Motion, and affirms that We can carry on Trade from one End of the Continent to the other. Deane. Custom house Officers discharged! Were they ever in our Pay, in our service. Let em stand where they are. Let this Congress establish what Offices they please. Let the others die. I think that all the Colonies ought to be upon a footing. We must have Trade. I think We ought to apply abroad. We must have Powder and Goods. We cant keep our People easy without. Lee. The Gentleman agrees that all ought to be upon a Footing. Let him shew how this can be done without shutting the Customhouses. Jay. This should be the last Business We undertake. It is like cutting the Foot to the shoe, not making a shoe for the Foot. Let Us establish a System first. I think We ought to consider the whole, before We come to any Resolutions. Now Gentlemen have their Doubts whether the N. Exportation was a good Measure. I was last Year, clear vs. it. Because the Enemy have burn'd Charlestown, would Gentlemen have Us burn N. York? Let us lay every Burden as equal on all the Shoulders that We can. If Prov[idence] or Ministry inflict Misfortunes on one, shall We inflict the same on all? I have one Arm sore-why should not the other Arm be made sore too? But Jealousies will arise. Are these reasonable? Is it politick? We are to consult the general Good of all America. Are We to do hurt to remove unreasonable Jealousies. Because Ministry have imposed hardships on one, shall We impose the same on all. It is not from affection to N. York, that I speak. If a Man has lost his Teeth on one side of his Jaws, shall he pull out the Teeth from the other that both sides may be upon a Footing? Is it not realizing the Quarrell of the Belly and the Members? The other Colonies may avail themselves of the Custom houses in the exempted Colonies. Lee. All must bear a proportional share of the Continental Expence. Will the exempted Colonies take upon themselves the whole Expence. V. pays a sixth Part, the lower Counties an 80th-yet lower Counties may trade, V. not. The Gentleman exercised an Abundance of Wit to shew the Unreasonableness of Jealousies. If this ministerial Bait is swallowed by America another will be thrown out. Jay. Why should not N.Y. make Money, and N. Jersey not. One Colony can cloath them. McKean. I have 4 Reasons for putting the favoured Colonies upon a footing with the rest. 1st. is to disappoint the Ministry. Their design was insidious. (2). I would not have it believed by Ministry or other Colonies that those Colonies had less Virtue than others. 3. I have a  Reconciliation in View, it would be in the Power of those Colonies, it might become their Interest to prolong the War. 4. I believe Parliament has done or will do it for us, i.e. put us on the same footing. I would choose that the exempted Colonies should have the Honour of it. Not clear that this is the best Way of putting them upon a Footing. If We should be successfull in Canada, I would be for opening our Trade to some Places in G.B., Jamaica, &c. J. Rutledge. Wonders that a Subject so clear, has taken up so much Time. I was for a general Non Exportation. Is it not surprizing, that there should so soon be a Motion for breaking the Association. We have been reproached for our Breach of Faith in breaking the Non Imp. I have the best Authority to say that if We had abided by a former Non Imp. We should have had redress. We may be obliged hereafter to break the Association, but why should We break it before We feel it. I expected the Delegates from the exempted Colonies would have moved to be put upon the same footing. Dont like shutting the C. Houses and discharging the Officers- but moves that the Res[olution] be, that People in York, N. Car., Georgia and lower Counties dont apply to the Custom house. Zubly. Georgia is settled along Savanna River, 200 miles in Extent, and 100 mile the other Way. I look upon it the Association alltogether will be the Ruin of the Cause. We have 10,000 fighting Indians near us. Carolina has already smuggled Goods from Georgia. Chase. I will undertake to prove that if the Revd. Gentlemans Positions are true and his Advice followed, We shall all be made Slaves. If he speaks the Opinion of Georgia I sincerely lament that they ever appeared in Congress. They cannot, they will not comply! Why did they come here? Sir We are deceived. Sir We are abused! Why do they come here? I want to know why their provincial] Congress came to such Resolutions. Did they come here to ruin America. That Gentlemans Advice will bring Destruction upon all N. America. I am for the Resolution upon the Table. There will be Jealousies, if N.Y. and the other exempted Colonies are not put upon a footing. It is not any great Advantage to the exempted Colonies. What can they export that will not be serviceable to G.B. and the West Indies. The exports of N. Car. are of vast Importance to G.B. If these Colonies are in Rebellion, will not their Effects be confiscated, and seized even upon the Ocean. Arms and Ammunition must be obtained by what is call'd Smuggling. I doubt not We shall have the Supply. Leaving open N. York &c. will prevent our getting Arms and Ammunition. Houstoun. Where the Protection of this Room did not extend, I would not set very tamely. Chase. I think the Gentleman ought to take offence at his Brother Delegate.   Wythe. Agrees with the Gentleman from N. York that We dont proceed regularly. The Safety of America depends essentially on a Union of the People in it. Can We think that Union will be preserved if 4 Colonies are exempted. When N. York Assembly did not approve the Procedings of the Congress it was not only murmured at, but lamented as a Defection from the public Cause. When Attica was invaded by the Lacedemonians, Pericles ordered an Estate to be ravaged and laid waste because he tho't it would be exempted, by the Spartan King. Nothing was ever more unhappily applied, than the fable of the Stomach and the Limbs. Sherman. Another Argument for putting [sentence unfinished]. ""

I wrote you some time ago, and ventured to acquaint you with the appointment of fifty dollars a Month to the Judge Advocate for himself and his Clerk, to commence from his first Appointment. This I hope you recd. I feel more anxious about Letters than formerly as you may well imagine. The Times are so critical and there are so many Peepers, that one cant be too carefull. Indeed the horrid Story you allude to in yours of the surgeon &c is enough to make one jealous of every Body, but it must not have this Effect.(1) In the Reign of Charles the first, such Instances of Treachery and Infidelity, were not uncommon. I would fain hope however that this has turned out more favourably than was feared: yet from several private Letters received here by Gentlemen, I am Staggered. What shall We say? I think it very odd, however, that every Event which happens at the Camp should regularly come to Governers Ward or Hopkins, or to Coll Dyer or Mr Deane, before it comes to me. It is really astonishing. However hush Complaint. The last Accounts from my Family were very disagreable-and yours mentions not a Word of it. I hope for the best but should be rejoiced to hear. Three Battalions I believe will be raised in Pensilvania and the OCTOBER 12, 1775  Jersies for the Defence of New York.(2) News We have none, but such as you see in the Papers. As you are now in the military Line of Life, I presume it will not be disagreable to have your Thoughts turned to military Speculations. I want to know what Books upon Martial Science are to be found in the Army, and whether, among the many young Gentlemen in the service, any of them are studious of the Principles of the Art. It is a shame for Youths of Genius and Education to be in the Army, without exerting themselves to become Masters of the Profession. If it is objected that Books are not to be had, Measures ought to be taken to procure them. To this End I wish to collect a perfect List of the best authors, and should be obliged to you if you would enquire and make up one for me-and at the same Time enquire whether the following are in the Possn. of any Body in the Army. Dalrymples military Essay. Saxes Reveries. History of Prussia. History of Frederic 3d. I.e Blonds military Engineer. History of the late War. Mullers Works Eight Volumns. Maneuvres for a Battalion of Infantry, by Major Young. Military Guide, by Simes. Andersons Art of War. Prussian Field Regulations. King of Prussia's Advice to young officers.

In truth sir I have been under some Apprehensions, that a certain Passage, in a very unfortunate as well as inconsi- OCTOBER 13, 1775  derate Letter, might have made Some disagreable Impressions on your Mind.(1) I was indeed relieved in some Degree by accounts which I had from Gentlemen who knew your sentiments, especially such as were present when you first heard it read. The candid, genteel and generous Manner in which it was heard and animadverted on, gave me great Satisfaction. I had thought of writing you on the Subject, but was hindered by certain Notions of Delicacy perhaps as whimsical, as any Thing alluded to in that Letter. But I rejoice exceedingly, that this incident has induced you to write. I frankly confess to you that a little Whim and Eccentricity, so far from being an objection to any one in my Mind, is rather, a Recommendation, at first Blush, and my Reasons are, because few Persons in the World, within my Experience or little Reading, who have been possessed of Virtues or Abilities, have been entirely without them; and because few Persons have been remarkable for them, without having Something at the same Time, truly valuable in them. I confess farther that a Fondness for Dogs, by no means depreciates any Character in my Estimation, because many of the greatest Men have been remarkable for it; and because I think it Evidence of an honest Mind and an Heart capable of Friendship, Fidelity and Strong Attachments being Characteristicks of that Animal. Your opinions of my Generosity, Valour, Good sense, Patriotism and Zeal for the Rights of Humanity, is extreamly flattering to me: and I beg leave to assure you, in the strongest Manner and I flatter myself that my Language and Conduct in public and private upon all occasions, notwithstanding the wanton Expressions in the intercepted Letter have demonstrated, that this opinion is reciprocal. Your Sincerity, sir, I never doubted, any more than I did my own, when I expressed or implied an opinion of your Attainments as a Schollar and a Soldier: Indeed I might have expressed a much higher opinion of these than I did, with the Same Sincerity. But enough of this. At the Story of the Surgeon General I stand astonished.

Good God! What shall We say of human Nature? What shall We say of American Patriots? Or rather what will the World say? The World however, will not be too severe. Indeed, Sir, We ought to expect, in a Contest like this, however we may detest, such Examples as this. History furnishes Instances more or less, in all Quarells like this. The D[octo]r's Brother Poet, Waller,(2) in the Struggle with a Stuart, was his Antitype We cannot be too cautious of the Persons We entrust, in such Times as these: Yet We  ought not to let our Caution degenerate into groundless Jealousy. There is a Medium between Credulity on one hand and a base suspicious Temper on the other from which We need not be induced to deviate, even in such Times as these, and by such Examples as the Drs. The Nature of the Conspiracy and the Duration and Extent of it Seem as yet in much obscurity. I hope Time, and Care will bring the whole Truth to light that exact and impartial Justice may be done, if that is possible. Before this Reaches you, a Comtee. from Congress will tell you News from hence. I wish, sir that I could write freely to you concerning our Proceedings. But you know the obligations I am under to be upon the Reserve: and the danger there would be as I know not the Carrier of this Letter, if I was at perfect Liberty. But this I must Say, that I See no danger of our \""displaying Timidity.\"" This Congress is more united, and more determined, than ever. And, if the petrified Tyrants would but send us their Ultimatum, which is expected Soon,(3) you would see Us, in Earnest. As to confiscating Estates,(4) that is but a small Part of what will be done when We are engaging seriously. You began upon a Subject, towards the Close of your Letter of infinite Importance; I read with avidity your Thoughts and was much chagrin'd that you gave me so few of them. The Intricacy and Multiplicity of the Questions involved in it, require more extensive Knowledge and a larger Mind than mine to determine them with Precision. There is so much Uncertainty too, that I believe no Man is capable of deciding with Precision; but it must be left to Time, Accident and Experience, to begin and improve the Plan of our Trade. If We should invite \""all the Maritime Powers of the World into our Ports,\"" would any one of them come? At least, untill they should be convinced that We were able, and determined to fight it out with G. B. to the last? Are they yet convinced of this, or will they be very soon? Besides, if they should, Would it be Sound Policy in Us to admit them? Would it not be sounder to confine the Benefit and the Bargain to one or a few? Is it not wiser to send our own Ships to all maritime Powers, and admit private adventurers from foreign Nations, if by any Means We can defend them against Cutters and Cruizers, or teach them to elude them. I have upon this Subject a System of my own but am not bigoted to it, nor to any other. You will oblige me vastly by your Sentiments at large. ""

These were from my afflicted Wife, giving me Such a continued History of her Distresses, as has affected me too much to write you a long Letter. The Misfortune, or what shall I call it of the Surgion General had been represented here in Several Letters in very glaring Colours untill one arrived from the secretary to the general, couched in Terms of more Temper and Candour. By your Account,(1) and indeed by the Letter itself it appears an unaccountable affair. Balaam praying for Leave to curse Israel, is the Emblem. A manifest Reluctance at hurting his Country, yet desirous of making a Merit, with the other Side -what shall We thinkl Is there reason to believe that other Letters have gone the same Way? I was so little acquainted with the World that I never hearcl a Suspicion to the Disadvantage of his Moral Character, untill I was lately with you at the Adjournment. I should scarcely have joined in a certain Recommendation, if I had heard before what I heard then-for Honour and Fidelity violated in Such gross Instances in private Life, are slender securities in public. Be not concerned about your Friends at the Congress-their Recommendations will not be discredited by this Event. Gentlemen here have behaved universally with the Utmost Politeness, upon this occasion. They say they pitty us, for the Suspicions that there is danger may arise among us of one another, and the Hurt to that Confidence in one another which ought to be-but any Man ought to be kick'd for a Brute that shall reproach Us in Thought, Word or Deed on this account. Our Accounts from Schuyler's Army are as agreable as yours from Arnold. We are in hourly Expectation. Rejoice to hear of your Successes by Sea. Let Cargill and Obrien be put into continental service immediately I pray. We begin to feel a little of a Seafaring Inclination here. The Powder at Quebec, will place US all upon the Top of the House. OCTOBER 13, 1775  Your Letters are very usefull to me, and I cannot have too many, or too long. I believe We shall take some of the twenty Gun ships before long. We must excite by Policy that Kind of exalted Courage, which is ever victorious by sea and land-which is irresistable. The Saracens had it -the Knights of Malta-the Assassins-Cromwells Soldiers and Sailors. Nay N. England men have ever had it hitherto-they never yet fail'd in an attempt of any Kind. ""

831,dg002188,1775,Samuel Adams to James Warren,"""Samuel Adams to James Warren   My dear sir, Philadelphia Octob. 13th 1775 It is now more than a Month since we arrivd in this City. I have receivd but one Letter and for that I am much indebted to you. I thought our Assembly had appointed a Committee to transmit Intelligence to us. We hear nothing from them. Have they no Intelligence of Importance to send to us? If so, let them inform us even of that, and we will pay the Postage of their Letter. But surely it is of some Importance that we should know whether C[hurch] is a Traiter or not-that on the one hand we might joyn like disinterrested Patriots in execrating him, or on the other hand, in vindicating the Character of an unfortunate Friend. Our pride is sorely mortified when there are Grounds to suspect that so eminent a Countryman is become a Traiter. The Fool will say in his heart, there is no such thing in the World as publick Spirit-the most virtuous Citizen will be suspected of concealing his dishonest Designs under a Cloak of Zeal for his Country and the brightest Examples will lose their Influence. I am very sollicitous that our Army, if it be practicable, should make a resolute Attack upon the Rebels before a Reinforcement to them shall arrive, which I think may be depended upon very soon. Genl Gage I understand is already gone for England. This verifies a part of the Intelligence which I gave you in my last Letter. Howe will remain in Command till the Spring when Amherst will come out as strong as they can make him. It is said that ------- usd his utmost Power of Dissimulation (and he is as great a Master of it as Mansfield or Hutchinson) to prevail on him to undertake the Command. Among the officers of the British Army, the Slavish Maxim \""The Will of the Prince is Law\"" too much prevails. They will suffer the arbitrary and cruel Commands of their Sovereign to supercede the Dictates of Honor, Morality and Conscience. I fear there are few, if  OCTOBER 13, 1775  more than one Effingham to be found in Britain. I have thought there was more of the true principle of Honor in the British Army, than among any other publick Class. If this be a Truth it is a melancholly one, for it is greatly to be apprehended that there is not Virtue enough in the Nation to save it. We know by long Experience that there is not Virtue enough there to save America. Why then should America expect it from Britain. This fond Hope of a Change from violent to lenient Measures in Britain is the Rock which endangers the Shipwreck of America. This Instant is arrivd an authentick Account of Dr Churchs Affair and a Copy of the Letter he had intended to send into Boston. To me it appears to be a very unintelligible Letter-I have not indeed thoroughly examind it-I have only heard it read. I do not recollect that it in any measure was calculated to expose the Weakness of our Army, which a Traitor would gladly have seizd the opportunity of doing, especially as he might have done it at that time with great Truth. The Union of Individual Colonies & of the Continental Congress, and their firmness and Resolution are picturd in high Colours; he informs of the Arrival of large Quantities of Gun powder at a time when he knew there was the greatest Scarcity, and was solliciting his Friends here to take every Method for providing as he expressed it that \""unum necessarium.\"" Other parts of his Letter wear a different Complection, such as his mentioning the Defeat of our Army at Bunkers Hill as \""lucky,\"" his attempting three times in vain to send in his Letter, the messenger in the third Attempt being taken up (which I do not recollect to have heard before) and the Manner in which this Letter was conceald. But I will quit this disagreable Subject and conclude with assuring you that I am very affectionately, yours S A ""

The Enemy have not a Naval force Now on this Coast equall to the foregoing, if the Asia, Somerset, & Boyne be put out of the Question. These Three Shipps are ordered home and Forty Gunn Shipps and downward are to be employed on the American Station for the future. It is evident if they cruize in a Fleet they will not be formidable to Trade, and if single they will be liable to be attacked by an equall if not Superior force of the Continental fleet. Connecticut has fitted out Two & Rhode Island Two, these joining with the Two from the Massachusetts and those which other Colonies & Individuals will fix for the Sea will go near to form a Naval force equall if not Superior to what the Ministry will think of sending to America the Next season for they dream as little of Our meeting them, on the Sea as of Our invading Canada, and though their Naval power, & resources be ever so great in Brittain, they must inevitably be defeated the Next Campaign in America if We get early to Sea, these Shipps, and with them surprize, & intercept their Transports, or any considerable part of them, this effected, the distance between Us & Europe will put it out of their power to recover the blow, untill the season is over. What will be the Loss to the Continent if these vessels should be so unfortunate as to make no prizes? I answer the Three Mo. Wages and provisions will Amount To nearest one Third of the Gross Sum or sixty Thousand Dollars, and the ware dr Tare will make up Ninety or one half which is a large Computation-but if by means of this Force the Coastwise Trade only is protected to say Nothing of securing the introduction of Ammunition &c under their protection. The Freight of Flour only to the Army will amount To a great part of the Sum, as every Barrel which they consume at present pays at least 12 Dollar Transportation more than if carried by Water. 40,000 Barrels transported will save Sixty Thousand out of the Ninety Thousand Dollars And other Articles will doubtless Amount to as much more. It is a fact that more than 40,000 Bls. of Flour have been consumed the present Season. But the probability of Captures is much, in favor of the adventure.  The Transports unsuspecting danger will sail without Convoy. Every prize of this kind is of double Advantage-it weakens & disappoints the Enemy, strengthens & encourages Our Army. It is good policy now to set on foot a Naval Force under proper Regulations, & the reasons for it are- At least Ten Thousand Seamen are thrown out of employ in the Northern Colonies. These with their Owners, & the various mechanics, dependent on this extensive branch of Business cannot possibly long rest easy, in their present destitute, distress'd Situation, their Shipps rotting & their Families starving. They will not revolt from the Cause but reprisal being justifiable as well by the Laws of Nature as of Nations, they will pursue the only Method in their power for indemnifying themselves, and Reprisals will be made. This will at best be but a kind of Justifiable piracy & subject to No Law or Rule, the Consequences may be very pernicious. The first fortunate Adventurer will set many more on pushing their Fortunes. Is it not more prudent, where the Loss can, at most, be so trifling to Turn this Spirit, this Temper, this Necessity of the Times down its right & proper Channel, and reduce it while in its infancy to Rule & Order before it become thro Want of Regulation, unmanageable? This will be, not only preventing, a Licentious roving, or piracy~ but will be turning Our Enemies Weapons upon him. Should private Adventurers take up the M[atter], every one will soon make his own Laws & in a few Years, No Law will govern, the mischief will grow rapidly & Our Own property will not be safe. Such Adventures are already entered upon, Witness several Captures made by the provincials without order or direction. This calls upon Us to be taken up & regulated at the first setting out. It will afterward be out of Our power. Our Coasts will swarm with roving adventurers, who if they forbear plundering of Us or Our immediate Freinds, may thro Necessity invade the property of the Subjects of those with whom We wish to stand well, & bring Accumulated Mischeif on these Colonies. Can there be a scheme, or plan, by which, the above proposed, Naval Armament may be equipp'd, without burthening these Colonies, or interfering with their other important & Necessary Operations? I think there may, & therefore take leave to propose- I. That a Committee of persons skill'd in Maratime Affairs be Appointed to fitt for Sea with all possible dispatch the foregoing Vessels of Warr-that They have power to Commission proper persons to command the same and to Constitute such rules, Ordinances, & directions as they shall judge best for the well regulating  such Naval force, subject to the revision, & Alteration, of the General Congress, or such board as they may hereafter appoint for that purpose-Also to give the several Commanders from Time to Time such Instructions for their Conduct as they shall judge Necessary Subject to the Controll of the Congress. II. This Committee shall receive from the Continental Treasury the Sum of in Bills emitted solely for that purpose & made redeemable as hereafter provided for, and that sd. Committee receive after the rate of per Cent on the Sums by them disbursed, in executing said Trust for the Congress.(2) III. These Vessels shall cruise, only to protect the Trade of these Colonies from the insults of Ministerial Cutters, & Shipps of Warr, & for intercepting, & seizing such Vessels as shall be employed to Transport Stores, or shall have Stores on board for the Ministerial Forces employed against these Colonies. IV. The Neat [net] proceeds of all prizes after deducting the Shares of the Captors shall be by the Committee Accounted for to the Congress, by them to be applied toward sinking the Bills emitted for that purpose-all Convoy Mony, or [. . .] freight, shall be applied to the same purpose but of these the Officers & Seamen Shall have no Share. Whatever Stores, or Vessels, which on being found Useless for the present & shall be judged proper for Sale, they shall be sold for Gold, or Silver, or those Bills emitted for Naval purposes & the Neat Amount of the Sales shall be applied to discharge & sink the Sum first Granted for these purposes. V. The Vessels of Warr already fitted out by any of these Colonies or Individuals or such as may hereafter be fitted out & shall join any part of the Fleet belonging to the Continent shall during their continuing with such Fleet or any part thereof be under the same Orders & Regulations as sd. Fleet are, & be subject to the Directions of the cheif Commander of the Continental Fleet then present, and all prizes taken, they or any of them present, & assisting shall be divided by the proportion of Gunns & Men in the respective Shipps or Vessels present. VI. That the first Commissioned Captain be stiled Commodore and be considered as, & have the powers of a Commander in Cheif, under the Congress, or sd. Committee over sd. Fleet. I have now run over the outlines of a Naval Establishment. The American Exchequer may have No Money to spare, for such an Adventure. That is not the Question. Is it Necessary, if so, let Us look for Ways, & Means. I would have the Money struck for the use of the Navy, be kept as a distinct affair, & the Bills be sunk, or discharged independant of other Concerns. If there should be any prizes they will help to pay off the Bills. The Sales of the Vessels, after the Cruize, if the Congress should not incline to keep it longer, in pays   will go farr in paying off the Bills. Suppose to make out The One half only, it is very probable, that selling, even at this discount with the Convoy Money, Freight & prizes, that the whole will be discharged. But in case this should fail & the whole at the end of Three Mo. be sunk, will not the forcing Our Enemy to keep their Naval force collected in a Fleet give such a free access to Vessels bringing the Stores We want, be an advantage adequate to this Sum? I think it will & more. The Bills emitted should be paid off in three annual payments, and suppose to render the payment certain without burthening the public it be, by Three annual Lotteries, in which Case, whatever the Fleet may bring in, may be applied to the repairing of it, & increasing, if Necessary. This will take off all popular Objection in point of expences. The Continent may be alarmed, at an additional expence, if a Navy be set on foot at Continental Charge, but a provision for sinking the Bills, by Lottery, will burthen no one, and it can be done with the greatest Certainty, by putting the Lottery, in effect, into Three Classes obliging the fortunate Adventurers in the first to receive a certain Number of Tickets in the Second in payment, in proportion To The Value of the prizes drawn, by which, a Sale will be insured, of so large a part of the next that the drawing will be punctually complied with.

836,dg002193,1775,Portrait of Silas Deane,""" Portrait of Silas Deane  OCTOBER 16, 1775  sonal insult. The most opulent inhabitants of this City have lately become interested, under the Proprietaries in those Lands, they assembled, & fell to raising Money to employ an Armed Force to drive off all Our People without exception. Artful Enemies to the general Cause of America blew up the Flame, in hopes of breaking the general Union. I need not be more particular, to give you an Idea, of the distress which this Affair threw Me into, in a word I publiclys & sincerely condemned their Conduct. The Cheif Justice ordered them to procure Bail for their Appearance, with Sureties Freeholders of The province. This could not be procured, & they were committed. The Congress ordered the Delegates, of the two Colonies, to conferr & labor a Settlement, they did, but hitherto in vain, tho' I think the Storm subsides, and that a Temporary Settlement may be bro't about if rightly managed, which believe Me is a most delicate, as well as arduous task.(5) Sluman & Judd will probably think hard, of my censuring them, so severely as I have, but I have done it in Sincerity, Nor has anything they have said to Me, altered my Opinion. Tho' did I think otherways, I should be in no way of serving them, by attempting To justify them, while the Confidence which the Delegates of this Colony, & other cool persons here have in Me will enable Me I trust to help on the healing of this unhappy breach between the Two Colonies. Thus my Freind, you see the critical Situation into which this mad frolic of these Men has thrown Us, and indeed the very Union of the Colonies. I have wrote many Letters into Connecticut, but have received few Answers. As to Commerce, it is my Opinion that it will be opened soon with all Foreign States but no decision has yet been had, the Congress early appointed a Committee on the Subject of which I was one. We made a Report, which is now under Consideration.(6) You shall early be informed of whatever it may be. You ask Me, when I shall return, which Question I am in no way of answering, but will give you my particular Situation. The Congress have appointed a Board of Claims, of which I am one, & cannot of course be able to return untill the Acsts. of the Expences of this Campaign at least, are Settled. On this Business, We set every Morning. The Congress have also appointed a Secret Committee, for Supplying the Continent with certain Necessary Articles, of this I am one, and wish I could see You, or some other of my Connecticut Mercantile Freinds, here, as it would be in my power, to help them, & in theirs to serve their Country.(7) This hint is all I can give, on this head, & if you will come down, the Sooner, the better. A Naval Force is a favorite object of mine, & I have a prospect now, of carrying that point, having succeeded, in getting Our Connecticut, & the Rhode Island Vessels into Continental pay, (8) which motion I was seconded in beyond my expectations, and was further directed by Congress to lay before them an   Estimate of the Expence of a Naval Armament sufficient to Cope with the Cruisers, on this Coast.(9) This I shall lay before them this Day, and am of your Opinion, That N. London harbor is well situated for the rendevous of an American Navy, & my Freind, is it not worth while for N. London to labor to obtain the advantages of such a Collection of Navigation spending their Money there? I think it prudent, & adviseable, therefore for you or some other to come instantly down here, by which, You may undoubtedly procure, an advantageous employment for your Navigation. As to the Assembly choosing New Delegates, the Congress will not interfere, either in the Mode, or Time, agreeable to any Colony. I think however, it would be best, for the Assembly, to make a New Election, or at least To reelect their Delegates annually. As to myself, I know not how I stand in their estimation, but make this my rule, to serve them chearfully, to the best of my Abilities, when called upon, and with equall Chearfullness to give place to better Men.(10) By what I have said above you will See I have no idle Time. My Compts. to all Freinds in Assembly-particularly to Mr. Hosmer, I wish he was here, & if You make a new choice he must be one. I have wrote to him a long Letter, and Several Short ones without any Answer. How does his Lead Works go on? I am Sir Your most Obedt. & very Huml. Servt. Silas Deane P.S. Where is the Maccaroni, & how have you Succeeded, in procuring a most Necessary Article? Will it not be prudent, to Arm one half the Militia, with pikes of handles of about Ten feet in length, the heads Three square, with sharp stripps of Iron running down about One feet on the handle from the head to prevent The Enemy laying hold with their hands in the Action.

Not whilst there was a single man living to defend the poor captive. O, Sir! did you but know what I feel upon this occasion, you would sympathise with me.

I tell them that the chief of the inhabitants are tories: Then why do you suffer such wretches to stay among you? Ah! why do we suffer them indeed! It would not be permitted in any other colony on the continent, I am convinced. But what are we to do? The bulk of the inhabitants of Norfolk is composed of natives of North Britain; and all the world knows that the late Virginia convention have expressly exempted those men from the service of defending their country, or rather, they have granted them a privilege of doing all the mischief imaginable to the common cause of America. They say it is inhuman, it is cruel, it is barbarous, to make them take arms against their countrymen. Poor, mean tools of despotism! Brutus condemned his sons to death, because they supported tyranny, and Timoleon slew his brother, because he was a tyrant; but if these examples of patriotism are of too old a date for them to follow, let them look at many brave men, both English and Scotchmen, now on the continent, who have most ardently embarked in the common cause of freedom and mankind. They feel no shocks to humanity, but, warmed with the spirit of liberty, are ready to plunge the dagger into a tyrant brother. It is high time for the test act to make its appearance among us. It is highly proper that the worthy natives of Britain should be distinguished from the others, and that every man should have the choice of joining us or not; but it is also reasonable, that those who will not join us should be forthwith sent out of the country; for who can trust a man in his neighbourhood whose principles are avowedly against the liberties of the people. It requires no great gift of prophecy to foretell, that if such men are suffered to live among us, whether natives of North or of South Britain, or of our own country, our plans and operations must forever be betrayed, which, in all probability, will prove the downfall of Virginia. But there is another reason for the rapid progress which lord Dunmore makes in and about Norfolk: Without regular forces to support them, without minute-men, and the militia but badly armed, what are the poor, wretched inhabitants to do? They must either submit to the military government of lord Dunmore, or suffer the miseries of imprisonment, and the loss of property. Five thousand regular forces, with a few horse, would have prevented the disgrace of Norfolk and Princess Anne, and perhaps of the whole lower country. Those men are weak politicians who would sacrifice a wide extended coast to the mean consideration of saving a little public money.

Resolved that in the Opinion of the Congress, it is expedient for preserving the Peace of said Colonies that a Temporary Line of Jurisdiction be fixed between them, and therefore recommend for the present, and until there shall be a legal Settlement of said Controversy, or some other Regulation established, that the Colony of Connecticut confine the Exercise of its Jurisdiction (at the Place in Controversy) to that Part of a Township incorporated by the Assembly of that Colony by the Name of Westmoreland, that lieth East of a Meridan Line beginning at Latitude 41° North, at the Distance of 15 English Miles West from the East Branch of Susquehannah River, and from thence running North to the North Line of the Lands in Controversy. And that the Colony of Pennsylvania forbear to exercise Jurisdiction within those Limits, unless the South Limit of said Town include any of the Inhabitants who settled and hold under the Claim of the Proprietors of Pennsylvania, that then those Inhabitants remain under the Jurisdiction of Pennsylvania, and that all the Inhabitants, on said controverted Lands, be suffered peaceably to occupy the Lands now in their actual Possession. Provided nevertheless, that nothing contained in this temporary Provision shall any way affect or prejudice the legal Title or Claim of either Party to any of the said Lands. And it is further recommended that all Persons who have been arrested only for attempting to enter upon and take Possession of any of the vacant or uncultivated Lands in Controversy, be forthwith released, and that all their Effects be restored to them. And that for the future all concerned carefully avoid whatever may tend to disturb the Peace, or interrupt the Harmony and Friendship that ought at all Times, and more especially the present, to subsist among all true Lovers of their Country.  OCTOBER 17, 1775  MS not found; reprinted from Pa. Archives, 8th ser. 8:7320-21. 1 The inability of the Connecticut and Pennsylvania delegates to come to an agreement on the subject of \""the disputes between the people of the two colonies on the waters of the Susquehannah,\"" led to the appointment on October 17 of a committee to take the controversy into consideration. JCC, 3:297. The committee then apparently heard representations from the Connecticut and Pennsylvania delegates, and in the course of its hearings received the following proposed resolution from the Connecticut delegates. Concerned that congressional adoption of the proposal would confirm Connecticut settlers in possession of a large tract of land in the area, representatives from the counties of Northumberland and Northampton submitted a memorial to the Pennsylvania Assembly on October 25 \""to solicit Assistance . . . against the Connecticut Intruders.\"" This memorial contained the proposed resolution. For the full text of the memorial and the response of the Assembly to the Northumberland and Northampton Counties' plea, see Pa. Archives, 8th ser. 8:7314 23, 7326, 7330-32. Although the committee reported to Congress on November 4, the dispute remained an issue of continuing concern, and the congressional resolve of December 20, calling for an end to hostilities, seemed aimed at delay rather than decisive settlement of the conflict.

Yet there are several Strokes, which cannot be accounted for at least by me without the Supposition of Iniquity. In Short I endeavour to Suspend my Judgment. Dont let us abandon him for a Traitor without certain Evidence. But there is not So much Deliberation in many others, or so much Compassion. The Congress declined entering into any Discussion of the Evidence, or any Determination concerning his Guilt, or the Nature of  OCTOBER 18, 1775  his offence. But in general they had a full Conviction that it was so gross an Imprudence at least, and was So Suspicious, that it became them to dismiss him from their Service, which they did instantly. Yesterday they chose a Successor, Dr Morgan an eminent Surgeon of this City.(1) We, as usual had our Men to propose, Dr Hall Jackson and Dr Forster. But Dr Forsters Sufferings and Services-and Dr Jacksons great Fame, Experience and Merits were pleaded in vain. There is a Fatality attends our Province. It Seems destined to fall into Contempt.

I consider the Stroke must fall heavier upon her, as it was nearer to her. Her Prosperity is near my Heart-I wish her every Blessing which she can possibly wish for herself. Really it is very painfull to be 400 Miles from ones Family and Friends when We know they are in Affliction. It seems as if It would be a Joy to me to fly home, even to share with you your Burdens and Misfortunes. Surely, if I were with you, it would be my Study to allay your Griefs, to mitigate your Pains and to divert your melancholly Thoughts. When I shall come home I know not. We have so much to do, and it is so difficult to do it right, that We must learn Patience. Upon my Word I think, if ever I were to come here again, I must bring you with me. I could live here pleasantly if I had you, with me. Will you come and have the small Pox here? I wish I could remove all the Family, our little Daughter and Sons, and all go through the Distemper here. What if We should? Let me please myself with the Thought however.

The Expence would be very great-true. But the Expence might be born and perhaps the Profits and Benefits to be obtained by it, would be a Compensation. A naval Force might be created, which would do something. It would destroy Single Cutters and Cruisers- it might destroy small Corvets or Fleets of these like Wallaces at R. Island and Ld Dunmores at Virginia-it might oblige our Enemies to sail in Fleets-for two or three Vessells of 36 and twenty Guns, well armed and manned might attack and carry a 64 or a 70 or a 50 Gun Ship. But, there is a great objection to this. All the Trade of Pensylvania, the Lower Counties, a great Part of Maryland and N. Jersey Sails in between the Capes of Delaware Bay-and if a strong Fleet should be posted in that Bay, Superior to our Fleet it might obstruct all the Trade of this River. Further the Trade of Virginia and the rest of Maryland floats into Cheasapeak Bay between the Capes of Henry and Charles where a Fleet might Stop all. Besides Virginia and Maryland have no Navigation of their own nor any Carpenters to build ships. Their whole Trade is carried on in British Bottoms by British, most of it by North British Merchants. These Circumstances distinguish them quite from New England, where the Inlets are innumerable and the Navigation all their own. They agree that a Fleet would protect & secure the Trade of New England but deny that it would that of the Southern Colonies. OCTOBER 19, 1775  Will it not be difficult to perswade them then to be at the Expence of building a Fleet, merely for N. England. We are Speculating now about Things at a Distance. Should We be driven to a War at all Points, a Fleet a public Fleet as well as privateers might make prey enough of the Trade of our Enemies to make it worth while. ""

Thompson's & Blevins I would weigh & mark carefully & let them take good Care of  OCTOBER 19, 1775  it until you can sell it. Some Market may present at Stonington Harbor or your Uncle or Bror. Greene may help you to one. In the mean time see that it is well saved; keep Plenty of the best for ourselves. My last was to Debby. I mention'd the hogs & many other things in it. You must lay in 2500 lb of Pork, either buy hogs & fat or engage good Pork enough to make up with what you fat yourselves; that Quantity, if it be possible to do it without Cash you will, if not you must give it. I would not sell any more Wheat at 5/3. Indeed I dont think you ought to sell any at all unless you have taken in some Quantity, for your Family is large & may be larger, for if any of our worthy distressed Friends should seek shelter with you I would receive them kindly at a reasonable Rate. I want to know what has become of the Freebodys, your Aunt Vernon & other particular Connect [ion] s. It is high Time your Harvest was on the way we used to do dig Potatoes a Day's & husk a load at Night is the best Way but you must do the best you can My dear; after Harvest I would by all Means look for Seaweed & get up as much as possible, if you can secure it over the Beach we may cart across the Ice in the winter or scow it across, may be you can hire Capt. Babcocks Scow until we can build one. You must learn to do without Me for I shall be very little with You. I wish to know how you manage the marsh. The Fence against Dodge ought to be done up & all your young Cattle & spare Horses turned on. Eldridge may pick Bay berries & watch them too; they must be wartered at the Island & confined on the Island every Night, in the Morning driven towards the west End of our Beach. The Bayberries will help pay for his Time but if there are none, the keeping so many Creatures will richly pay it. He might take a bush hook & clear up that Island with a Cedar Tree on it & if he is faithful I will make him some present for extraordinary Trouble. We have no News here but what you will see in the Papers sent with my last, there is no other Prospect but of War. We are taking the most vigorous Measures to bring things to a happy Issue. Remember Me to all the Family & our Friends. May Heaven preserve you all. I am Your very affect. Father Sam Ward ""

858,dg002215,1775,John Adams Notes of Debates,"""John Adams' Notes of Debates   Oct. 20. [1775] Deane.(1) Their Plunder only afforded one Meal of fresh meat for the privates. All the rest was reserved for the Officers and their Friends among the Inhabitants. I would have Traders prohibited OCTOBER 20, 1775  from importing unnecessary Articles, and from exporting live Stock, except Horses. Gadsden. If we give one leave when there is 100 who have an equal Right, it will occasion Jealousy. Let each Colony export to the Amount of so many thousand Pounds, and no more. Chase. We have Letters, from Guadaloupe, Martinique and the Havanna that they will supply us with Powder for Tobacco. Gadsden. France and Spain would be glad to see G.B. despotic in America. Our being in a better State than their Colonies, occasions complaints among them, Insurrections and Rebellions, but these Powers would be glad We were an independent State. Chase. The Proposition is for exporting for a special Purpose, importing Powder. I would not permit our Cash to go for Rum. Live Stock is an inconsiderable Part of our Cargoes. I dont wish to intermix any Thing in this debate. I would restrain the Merchant from importing any Thing but Powder &c. Molasses was an Article of importance in the Trade of the Northern Colonies. But now they cant carry on the African Trade, and the Rum is pernicious. If you give a Latitude for any Thing but Arms and Ammunition, We shant agree what Articles are necessary and what unnecessary. Each Colony should carry on this Trade, not individuals. I would not limit the Quantity of Ammunition to be imported by each Colony. An 100 Ton a Colony would supply the W. Indies mediately and the Army and Navy. 20 Ton would be a considerable Adventure for a Colony. Debts are due from the B[ritish] W. India Islands to the Inhabitants of these Colonies. I am not for permitting Vessells to go in Ballast and fetch Cash. I wish to import Cash from every Place as much as possible. Deane. It cannot be done with secrecy or dispatch. I rather think it would be as well to leave it to Traders. Zubly. It is of great Weight that there be no favourites. Dyer. There will be such continual Applications to the Assemblies, by their Friends among the Traders, it will open a compleat Exportation. It would compleatly supply the W. Indies. Jay. We have more to expect from the Enterprise, Activity and Industry of private Adventurers, than from the Lukewarmness of Assemblies. We want French Woolens, Dutch Worsteds, Duck for Tents, German Steel, &c. Public Virtue is not so active as private Love of Gain. Shall We shutt the Door vs. private Enterprise. Lee. The Gentleman may move for those Things as Exceptions to the general Rule. Randolph. We are making Laws contradictory in Terms. We say nobody shall export and yet Somebody shall. Against all Rule. Lee. It is a common Rule in making Laws, to make a Rule and then make a Proviso for special Cases.   Dyer. The Rule and the Proviso are passed at once in the same Act, 'tho. If I give my Voice for an Unconditional Proposition, what security have I that the Condition or Proviso will be added afterwards. The greatest Impropriety, in the World. Chase. Both Sides are right, and it arises from this, that one Proposition is to be made public the other kept secret. We have very little Confidence in each other. Zubly. If half the Law is to be public and the other half secret, will not half the People be governed by one half and the other half by the other. Will they not clash? Jay. Least your Produce falls into the Hands of your Enemies, you publish a Law that none go from the Continent. Yet to get Powder, We keep a secret Law that Produce may be exported. Then comes the Wrangles among the People. A Vessell is seen loading. A fellow runs to the Committee. Lee. The Inconvenience may arise in some Measure, but will not the People be quieted, by the Authority of the Conventions. If We give public Notice, our Enemies will be more active to intercept Us. On the Contrary the People may be quieted by the Committees of Safety. Wythe. The only Persons who can be affected by this Resolution are those, whom on the other side the Water will be called Smugglers. Consider the danger these Smugglers will run-liable to seizure by C. House officers, by Men of War at Sea, and by Custom house officers in the Port they go to. What can they bring. Cash, Powder, or foreign Manufactures. Cant see the least Reason for restraining our Trade, as little can be carried on. My Opinion is We had better open our Trade altogether. It has long been my Opinion, and I have heard no Arguments vs. it. Zubly. We cant do without Trade. To be, or not to be is too trifling a Question for many Gentlemen. All that Wise Men can do among many Diffficulties, is to choose the least. Stone. Cannot agree to the Proposition made by the gentleman from Maryland. Not for binding the People closer, than they are bound already. The Proposition is the same with that which was made that our Vessells should be stopp'd and foreigners invited to come here for our Produce and protect their own Trade. This appears to be a destructive System. It was a laborious Task to get America into a general Non Exportation to G.B., I., and W. Indies. Shall We now combine with Britain, to distress our People in their Trade, more than by the Association. People have look'd up to this, and are unwilling to go further. The restraining Bill a most cruel, unjust, unconstitutional Act: Yet We are going to greater Cruelties than they. We are all to be in the same Circumstances of Poverty and Dis-  tress. Will the West Indies be supplied by a circuitous Trade. I think not. How can the West Indies get Supplies from France, Holland or Spain? The whole Produce will not be carried. It is said the Men of War will take the Produce. This Argument will operate against exporting for Powder. The Army will be supplied. It is impossible to prevent their getting Supplies at least of Bread. It appears to me, this is not a temporary Expedient, but will have a perpetual Influence. It is a destructive, ruinous Expedient and our People never will bear it. Under the faith that your Ports would be kept open to foreigners, People have made Contracts with foreigners. You are giving a Sanction to the Act of Parliament, and going further. Under such a Regulation We never can exist. I would export Produce to foreign W. Indies, or any where for Powder. But the Mode of doing it, will defeat it. The Assemblies never will turn Merchants successfully. I would have private Adventurers give Bond, to return Powder, or the Produce itself. Chase. Differs from his Colleague. A different Proposition from that for restraining our People and inviting foreigners. This Proposition invites your People. If you carry on your Exports, without the Protection of a foreign Power you destroy America. If you Stop Provisions and not other Produce you create a Jealousy. If you export Provisions and not other Produce you create a Jealousy. Dont think the Risque will prevent Supplies to the W. I. Islands. We must prevent em Lumber as well as Provisions. Great Quantities will be exported, notwithstanding the Risque. All the fleet of B. cannot stop our Trade. We can carry it all on. We must starve the W. I. Islands and prevent em exporting their Produce to G.B. There will be great Quantities of Provisions and Lumber exported. It will enhance the Expence to carry em to Spain or France first and thence to the W. Indies, hut the Price will be such that the W. Indies will get em. I hold it clearly We can do without Trade. This Country produces all the Necessaries, many of the Conveniences and some of the Superfluities of Life. We cant grow rich. Our Provisions will be cheap. We can maintain our Army and our Poor. We shant loose our Sailors-The Fishermen will serve in another Capacity. We must defend the Lakes, and Cities. Merchants will not grow rich-there is the Rub. I have too good an opinion of the Virtue of our People to suppose they will grumble. If We drop our commercial System of Opposition We are undone. We must fail. We must give up the Profits of Trade or loose our Liberties. Let the Door of Reconciliation be once shutt, I would trade with foreign Powers and apply to them for Protection.   Leave your Ports open, and every Man that can will adventure. The Risque will not prevent it. It was strongly contended at the first Congress that Trade should be stopp'd to all the World, that all Remittances should cease. You would have saved a civil War if you had, but it could not be carried -the Gentleman from S. Carolina could not prevail to stop our Exports to B., I. and W.I. Our Vessells will all be liable to Seizure-our Trade must be a smuggling Trade. Yet We can trade considerably, and many Vessells will escape. No Vessell can take a Clearance. Many Vessells will go out unless you restrain them. All America is in suspence. The common sense of the People have pointed out this Measure. They have stopped their Vessells. Lee. We possess a fine Climate and a fertile Soil. Wood, Iron, Sheep &c. We make 11. or 12,00000 thousand (2) Pounds Worth of Provisions more than is necessary for our own Consumption. Dont think it necessary to combat the Opinion of some Gentlemen that We cannot live without Trade Money has debauched States as well as Individuals, but I hope its Influence will not prevail over America vs. her Rights and dearest Interests. We shall distress the W. Indies so as immediately to quit Coin for Corn. 4 Millions go yearly from the W. Indies to B. and a Million at least returns. If our Provisions go from these Shores, then they will go where the best Price is to be had. W. Indies and our Enemies will get em. If it was not proper a year ago, it may be now. This Proposition is not perpetual. When We get Powder We may make ourselves strong by sea and carry on Trade. J. Rutledge. A Question of the greatest Magnitude that has come before the Congress. If it is necessary to do without Trade our Constituents will submit to it. The Army will be supplied with Flower from England, where it is now cheaper than here. But they would be supplied here, if they were to demand it, upon Pain of destroying our Towns. W. Indies are supplied and have laid up Stores, and some of them have been raising Provisions on their own Lands. It will bear hard upon the Farmer as well as the Merchant. Dont think the Reasons the same now as last Year. It would then have destroyed the Linen Manufactory, and the W.I.-but now they have had Notice of it they are prepared against it. ""

There is Beef and Pork, and Poultry, and Mutton and Venison and Veal, Milk, Butter, Cheese, Corn, Barley, Rye, Wheat, in short every Species of Eatables animal and Vegetable in a vast abundance, an immense Profusion. We raise about Eleven hundred Thousand Bushells of Corn yearly more than We can possibly consume. The Country produces Provisions of all Kinds, enough for the sustenance of the Inhabitants, and an immense Surplusage. We have Wood and Iron in plenty. We have a good Climate as well as a fertile Soil. But Cloathing. If instead of raising [a] Million Bushells of Wheat for Exportation, and Rice, Tobacco, naval Stores, Indigo, Flaxseed, Horses, Cattle, &c, Fish, oil, Bone, Potash &c, &c, &c, the Hands now employed in raising Surplusages of these Articles for Exportation, were employed in raising Flax and Wool, and manufacturing them into Cloathing, We should be cloathed comfortably. We must at first indeed Sacrifice Some of our Appetites. Coffee, Wine, Punch, Sugar, Molasses, &c and our Dress would not be so elegant. Silks and Velvets & Lace must be dispensed with. But these are Trifles in a Contest for Liberty. But is there Temperance, Fortitude and Perseverance enough among the People to indure Such a Mortification of their Appetites, Passions and Fancies?

Georgia must have an Indian War, if they cant supply the Indians. The Creeks and Cherrokees are in our Province. We must have Indian Trade. Four Millions have been spent in 6 Months. We have been successfull. But We have gain'd little. All the Power of G.B. it is true, has gained very little. N. England has been at great Expence, so has N. York. Pensylvania has spent hundred thousand Pounds of their Money to fortify their River. Virginia as much. N. Carolina a great deal. S. Carolina have issued a Million. 18 Millions of Dollars is an enormous Sum of Money. Whenever your Money fails, you fail too. We are to pay Six Millions, now, 12 Millions more presently, and have no Trade. I would bear the Character of a Madman, or that of an Emissary of Lord North, rather than believe it possible to pay 18 Millions of Dollars without Trade. Can We make bricks without Straw? We can live upon Acorns, but will We? Wythe. The Rule that the Question should be put upon the last Motion that is made and seconded-this is productive of great Confusion in our Debates-6 or 7 Motions at once. Commerce, whether we consider it, in an Economical, a moral, or political Light appears to be a great Good. Civility and Charity, as well as Knowledge are promoted by it. The Auri Sacra Fames is a fine Subject for Philosophers and Orators to display themselves upon. But the abuse of a Thing is not an Argument vs. it. If the Gentleman was possessed of Philosophers Stone or Fortunatus's Cap, would he not oblige the Continent with the use of it.  OCTOBER 21, 1775  Why should not America have a Navy? No maritime Power, near the Sea Coast, can be safe without it. It is no Chimaara. The Romans suddenly built one in their Carthaginian War. Why may We not lay a Foundation for it. We abound with Furs [Firs], Iron ore, Tar, Pitch, Turpentine. We have all the materials for construction of a Navy. No Country exceeds us in Felicity of Climate or Fertility of Soil. America is one of the Wings upon which the British Eagle has soared to the Skies. I am sanguine, and enthusiastical enough to wish and to hope, that it will be sung that America inter Nubila condit. British Navy will never be able to effect our Destruction. Before the days of Minus, Natives round the Archipelago carried on piratical Wars. The Moors carry on such Wars now, but the Pillars of Hercules are their Ne Plus ultra. We are too far off, for Britain to carry on a Piratical War. We shall sometime or other rise superiour to all the difficulties they may thro in our Way. I wont say there is none that doeth good in Britain, no not one, but I will say she has not righteous Persons enough to save their State. They hold those Things honorable which please em and those for just which profit em. I know of no Instance where a Colony has revolted and a foreign Nation has interposed to subdue them. But many of the Contrary. If France and Spain should furnish Ships and Soldiers, England must pay them! Where are her Finances. Why should We divert our People from Commerce and banish our Seamen. Our Petition may be declared to be received graciously, and promised to be laid before Parliament. But We can expect no success from it. Have they ever condescended to take Notice of you.

I have argued for opening our Ports, but am for shutting them untill We hear the Event of our Petition to the King, and longer untill the Congress shall determine otherwise. I am for a Navy too, and I think that shutting our Ports for a Time, will help us to a Navy. If We leave our Ports open, warm Men will have their Ships seized, and moderate ones will be favoured. Lee. When you hoist out a Glimmering of Hope that the People are to be furnished from abroad, you give a Check to our own Man-  ufacturers. People are now everywhere attending to Corn and Sheep and Cotton and Linen. Chase. A Glove has been offered by the Gentleman from Georgia and I beg leave to discharge my Promise to that Gentleman to answer his Arguments. My Position was this-that Gentlemans System would end in the total destruction of American Liberty. I never shall dispute self evident Propositions. The present State of Things requires Reconciliation, or Means to carry on War. Intelligence We must have. We must have Powder and shot. We must support the Credit of our Money. You must have a Navy to carry on the War. You cant have a Navy says the Gentleman. What is the Consequence? I say, that We must submit. G.B. with 20 ships can distroy all our Trade, and ravage our sea Coast can block up all your Harbours-prevent your getting Powder. What is the Consequence? That We should submit. You cant trade with nobody, you must trade with Somebody. You cant trade with any Body but G.B.-therefore I say We must submit. We cant trade with foreigners, the Gentleman said. The whole Train of his Reasoning proved that We must break our whole Association as to Exports and Imports. If We trade with G.B. will she furnish us with Powder and Arms. Our Exports are about 3 Millions. Would B. permit us to export to her, and receive Cash in return? It would impoverish and ruin G.B. They will never permit a Trade on our Side without a Trade on theirsl Gentn. from N. York, would not permit Tobacco and Naval Stores to be sent to G.B.-nothing that will support their naval Power or Revenue. But will not this break the Union? Would 3 Colonies stop their Staple when the other Colonies exported theirs. 1500 Seamen are employed by the Tobacco Colonies-125 Sail of British Ships. But you may drop your Staple, your Tobacco. But it is difficult to alter old Habits. We have a great Number of female Slaves, that are zest employed about Tobacco. N.C. cannot, will not give up their Staple. The Gentleman from G. was for trading with G.B. and all the World. He says We cant trade with any Nation but Britain, therefore We must trade with B. alone. What Trade shall we have, if We exclude B., I., W.I., British and foreign. Eastern Provinces may carry it on with a small Fleet, if their Harbours were fortified. S[outhern] Colonies cannot. Eastern Colonies cant carry on their Trade to that Extent without a naval Power to protect em not only on the Coast but on the Ocean, and to the   Port of their Destination. The same force, that would assist the Eastern Colonies, would be of little service to us in summer Time. It must be a small, narrow and limited Trade. The best Instrument We have is our Opposition by Commerce. If We taken into Consideration G.B. in all her Glory-Commons voted 18.18.20 milions (2) last War, 80,000 seamen, from her Trade alone. Her strength is all Artificial-from her Trade alone. Imports from G.B. to the united Colonies are 3 Millions per annum-15 Millions to all the World-1/5th. 3/4 is british Manufactures. A Thousand british Vessells are employed in American Trade. 12 Thousand Sailors-all out of employ. What a Strokel I dont take into view I [reland] or W. Indies. Colonies generally indebted about one years Importation. The Revenue of Tobacco alone half a Million, if paid. N[orth] Britain enter less than the Quantity and dont pay what they ought. It employs a great Number of Manufacturers. Reexported abroad is a Million. It is more. 80,000 Hdds are reexported and pays British Debts. The Reexport employs Ships, Sailors, Freight, Commissions, Insurance. Ireland. The flaxseed 40,000£ st. Linen brought 2,150000£ from I. to England. Yard 200,000. Ireland can raise some flaxseed, but not much. W. Indies. Glover, Burk, and other Authors. They depend for Indian Corn and Provisions, and Lumber, and they depend upon Us for a great Part of the Consumption of their Produce. Indian Corn and Fish are not to be had but from the Colonies, except Pilchards and Herrings. Jamaica can best provide for her Wants, but not entirely. Ireland can send em Beef and Butter but no Grain. B. can send em Wheat, Oats not Corn, without which they cannot do. Stop Rum and Sugar, how do you affect the Revenue and the Trade? They must relax the Navigation Act to enable foreign Nations to supply the W. Indies. This is dangerous as it would force open a Trade between foreigners and them. Britain can never support a War with Us, at the Loss of such a valuable Trade. Affrican Trade dependent upon the W. India Trade.-700,000£. 25,000 Hdds. of Sugar are imported directly into these Colonies and as much more, from Britain, manufactured. Jamaica alone takes 150,000£ st. of our Produce. National Debt 140,0000, (3) ten Millions the Peace Establishment. 20 Million the whole Current Cash of the Nation. Blackstone. I never read any Body that better understood the subject.

The Name of one of them is John Folwell, the other Josiah Hart, each of them a Captain of a Company of Militia in the County of Bucks in this Province. Mr Joseph Hart the Father of one of them has exerted himself with much success in procuring Donations for Boston. These Travellers visit the Camp from the best Motive that of gaining Knowledge in the military Art by Experience-that their Country may have the Use of it, whenever there shall be an opportunity. You will greatly oblige them by giving them a Letter to General Thomas, and by introducing them to such Persons and Places as will best answer the honest and usefull End they have in View. I could wish them as well as other Strangers introduced to H. Knox and young Josiah Waters, if they are any where about the Camp. These young Fellows if I am not mistaken would give strangers no contemptible Tale of the military Knowledge of Mass. M[en] in the sublimist Chapters of the Art of War. Salt Petre is certainly making in considerable Quantities in several Places. I wish to know what success Dr Whiting has. You wonder, that certain Improprieties are not felt. Well you may. But I have done finding fault. I content myself with blushing alone, and mourning in secret, the Loss of Reputation our Colony Suffers, by giving such Samples of her Sons to the World. Myself, remember the worst Sample of all. Pray change it. ""

868,dg002225,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   Dear sir Octr. 21. 1775 We must bend our Attention to Salt Petre. We must make it. While B. is Mistress of the sea, and has so much Influence with foreign Courts, We cannot depend upon a Supply from abroad. It is certain that it can be made here because it is certain that it has been formerly and more latterly. Dr Graham of White Plains in the Colony of New York told me, that he has made Some thousands of Pounds Weight, many years ago, by Means of a German servant whom he bought and found to be good for nothing else. Messrs De Witte, one of Windham, the other of Norwich, have made a considerable Quantity, a sample of which has been shewn me by Coll Dyer, and they have made a large Collection of Materials for making more. Mr Wisner of New York informs me that his son has made a Quantity of very good, by the Method published by the Continental Congress. Two Persons belonging to York Town in this Colony have made one hundred and twenty Weight, have recd the Premium and are making more. A Gentleman in Maryland made some last June from Tobacco House Earth. Mr Randolph our venerable President, affirms to me that, every Planter almost in that Colony, has made it from Tobacco House Earth. That the Proscess is so simple that a Child can make it. It consists in nothing but making a Lixivium from the Earth which is impregnated with it, and then evaporating the Lixivium. That there is certainly discovered in Virginia a vast Quantity of the Rocks of Salt Petre. That there are Salt Petre Rocks he says all Chemists & Naturalists who have written Agree. And that he was informed by many Gentlemen in Virginia, cautious, incredulous Men, of strict Honour and Veracity, that they have been to see the Rocks and tryed them and found them, by Experiment to be the very Rock of Salt Petre. The old Gentn. in Short, who is not credulous nor inthusiastical but very steady, Solid, and grave, is as sanguine and confident as you can conceive, that it is the Easiest Thing in the World to make it, and that the Tobacco Colonies alone are sufficient to supply the Continent forever. Every Colony My Friend must set up Works at the public Expence. I am determined never to have Salt Petre out of my Mind but to insert some stroke or other about it in every Letter for the future. It must be had.  OCTOBER 21, 1775  ""

869,dg002226,1775,Francis Lightfoot Lee to Landon Carter,"""Francis Lightfoot Lee to Landon Carter   My dear Col. Philadelphia Octr. 21st 1775 I received your Letter with great pleasure tho contrary to your expectation it paid postage to the hated Post office. As the constitutional post now goes regularly, we may with a safe conscience say how d'ye to each other.(1) It gives me concern to hear that you are withdrawing from public business;(2) upon my word, this is not a time for men of abilities with good intentions to be only spectators, if we cant do all the good we cou'd wish, let us at least endeavour to prevent all the mischeif in our power. Your good friend Ld. Dunmore is endeavouring to raise all the powers on earth to demolish poor Virginia. We have advice, that at his earnest sollicitation a fleet may be expected this fall to ravage our defenceless plantations & burn our little Towns. And we have lately discovered a plot of his & Conolly's, which is to be executed in the following manner. Conolly despairing of getting up the Country through Virga. or the Carolina's, is to go to St. Augustine from thence to the Creeks & Cherokees, and through all the tribes to Detroit; by general Gage's commission he is to have the Garrison & Cannon of that place, & the assistance of the French at that settlement. With all these he is to form an army in the spring, & march to Pitsburgh, from thence to Alexandria, proclaiming freedom to all servants that will enlist; there he is to be join'd by Dunmore with the fleet & troops from England & march through the Country. He has Captains commissions from Dunmore for Cornstalk & White Eyes. We have given the earliest intelligence of these schemes to our Com. of safety, & hope with their endeavours assisted by the Carolinas & Georgia, that Conolly may be intercepted this fall or winter.(3) Our military operations this campaign have been very languid, from the want of powder, but we still hope, our success in Canada will be such, as to cut a figure for the first essay. Such measures have been taken, as give us good reason to expect a plentifull supply of that necessary article before the next spring; and then we shall be in readiness to receive the very warm attack, which from all our advices, the Ministry are preparing for us. But least we shou'd fail in being supply'd from abroad, every man shou'd exert himself in making saltpetre. Your several plantations wou'd furnish a good deal, & you know the process is easy. With plenty of powder, the Victory is surely ours. Octr. 22d. Here I was interrupted yesterday evening by an express for Doct. Shippen to our worthy speaker. He went out to dine with Mr. Hill and while at dinner was suddenly seized with a dead palsy, OCTOBER 21, 1775  and this morning we are inform'd that he died last night.(4) You knew his Virtues & will lament the loss of the friend and Patriot. I am so concern'd that I cant think of politicks. My best respects to my good friend Mr. Carter.(5) I have got a man at work to make his wool cards, & we are in possession of Miss Betsys musick, which shall be sent by the first opportunity. Mrs. Lee Jolns me in every good wish to Mrs. Carter & Miss Lucy. We have no doubt of Miss Lucy's happiness in the married state, as so much depends upon herself, & knowing the worth of Mr. Colston. Remember me to all friends. When I shall see them, God knows. Believe me my dear Col. your sincerely affect. friend & respectfull Servant Francis Light. Lee ""

871,dg002228,1775,Richard Henry Lee to George Washington,"""Richard Henry Lee to George Washington   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 22d October 1775 I thank you for your obliging favor of the 13th (1) and I assure you that no Man living approves the vigorous measures you mention more than myself. Great bodies, you know, move slow; and it is as sure, that the most palpable and glorious events may be delayed, and the best causes finally lost by slow, timid, and indicisive counsels. We must be content however to take human nature as we find it, and endeavor to draw good out of evil. You will, no doubt, have heared of the disgraceful conduct of our Norfolk, in suffering Lord Dunmore, with a few men to take away their printing pressl It happened when the good men of that place were all away, and none but Tories & Negroes remained behind. Virginia is much incensed and 500 men are ordered immediately down to Norfolk. I expect, by every Post, to hear of the demolition of that infamous nest of Tories.(2) By a Vessell in 20 days from Quebec, which I believe brings us later intelligence than you had from thence when the last Express left Camp, we learn that the D[eputy] Governor had 12 Companies of Canadians in training, and that they were generally on their guard. But the same acco[unt] says, the Government was so suspicious of the attachment of its Troops, that they were trusted with no more than 4 rounds of Cartridge. This still gives us some hopes of success on that quarter. Before this reaches you will have heared of Collo. Allens unlucky, and unwise attempt upon Mt. Real, nor have we, from the last accounts much prospect of success from St. Johns. The Ministerial dependance on Canada is so great, that no object can be of greater importance to North America than to defeat them there. It appears to me, that we must have that Country with us this winter cost what it will. Colo. Stephen writes me from Fort Pitt, that the Indians on that quarter come slowly in to the Commissioners, and that they evidently appear to be waiting the event of things in Canada, when they will surely, according to custom, join the strongest side. We have so many resourses for powder, that I think we cannot fail of getting well supplied with that most necessary article. Remember me, if you please, to Gen. Gates, and to all my acquaintances with you. I am, with great esteem and sincerity, dear Sir Your affectionate and obedient servant. Richard Henry Lee P.S. Monday morning. 'Tis with infinite concern I inform you that our good old Speaker Peyton Randolph Esqr. went yesterday to dine with Mr. Harry Hill, was taken during the course of dinner with the dead palsey, and at 9 oClock at night died without a groan. Thus has OCTOBER 22, 1775  American liberty lost a powerful Advocate, and human nature a sin- cere friend. R. H. L. ""

Your Letters never failed to give me Pleasure-the greatest Pleasure that I take, is in receiving them. And altho every one, which has yet come to Hand is replete with melancholly Tidings, yet I can truly say I never was so earnest to receive them. I rejoice in the happy Principles and the happy Temper, which apparently dictated them all. I feel myself much affected with the Breach upon the Family. But We can count a Mother, a Brother, an Aunt, and a Brothers Child among the slain by this cruel Pestilence. May God almighty put a stop to its Rage, and humble us under the Ravages already made by it. The sorrows of all our Friends on the Loss of your Mother are never out of my Mind. I pray God to spare my Parent whose Life has been prolonged by his Goodness hitherto, as well as yours that survives. The tremendous Calamities already felt of Fire, Sword and Pestilence, may be only Harbingers of greater still. We have no security against Calamities here-this Planet is its Region. The only Principle is to be prepared for the worst Events. If I could write as well as you, my sorrows would be as eloquent as yours, but upon my Word I cannot. The unaccountable Event which you allude to has reached this Place and occasioned a Fall.(1) I would be glad however that the worst Construction might not be put. Let him have fair Play-tho I doubt.  OCTOBER 23, 1775  The Man who violates private Faith, cancells solemn Obligations, whom neither Honour nor Conscience holds, shall never be knowingly trusted by me. Had I known, when I first voted for a Director of an Hospital, what I heard afterwards when I was down, I would not have voted as I did. Open barefaced Immorality ought not to be so countenanced. Tho I think, a Fatality attends us in some Instances, yet a divine Protection and favour is visible in others, and let us be chearfull whatever happens. Chearfullness is not a sin in any Times. I am afraid to hear again almost least some other should be sick in the House. Yet I hope better, and that you will reassume your wonted Chearfullness and write again upon News and Politics.

I dread to hear further from my Family least a pestilential Infection should have seized Some other Branch of it-But will hope for better Things. I dont Think you negligent, my Friend, having had too much Experience of your Care & attention. I only thought it my Duty to omit no oppertunity to press for accounts &c. I wish my other Friends were as little chargeable with Negligence as you. I want to know a Thousand Things. What are the Prices of European and West India Goods. How the Non Exportation is observed. How the Prices of Provisions. Whether there is any Prospect of keeping any Trade alive and what. You will receive a Letter from a Comtee,(2) whose Business it is to prepare a compleat Narration of the War-at least of the Murders, Robberies, Piracies, Treasons, Felonies, Villanies &c of the Army and Navy. Mr Wythe who is one, is a Virginian, a Lawyer of high Rank at the Bar, a great Schollar, a most indefatigable Man and a staunch Virginian, to all appearance. You will observe the Vote limits Us to last March. This was done without design & I dont intend to be so limited and therefore I hope OCTOBER 23, 1775  the two Houses will appoint a Committee upon a larger Scale and collect Facts at least from the Port Bill i.e. the time when it took Place. I hope neither Time, Trouble nor Expence will be spared upon this occasion, that an Account of the Expence will be kept by the Province, and altho I have no authority to say it will be paid yet I believe it will by the Continent. Compliments to Mrs Warren-tell [her] I had rather have received a Letter than a Promise of one tho that is valuable. ""

He was seized at Table having but a few Moments. before set down with a good deal of Company to dinner. He died in the Evening, without ever recovering his senses after the first Stroke. As this Gentleman Sustained very deservedly One of the first American Characters, as he was the first President of the united Colonies, and as he was universally esteemed for his great Virtues and shining Abilities, the Congress have determind to shew his Memory and Remains all possible Demonstrations of Respect.(1) The whole Body is to attend the Funeral, in as much Mourning as our Laws will admit. The Funeral is to be tomorrow. I am the more pleased with this Respect on Account of an Impropriety, which you know was unfelt.(2) This venerable Sage, I assure you, since he has stood upon the same Floor with the rest of Us has rose in the Esteem of all. He was attentive, judicious and his Knowledge, Eloquence, and classical Correctness shewed Us the able and experienced Statesman and Senator, whereas his former station had in a great Measure concealed these and shewed Us chiefly the upright and impartial Moderator of Debate. You would have wondered more at the Want of [Sensi] bility which you remarked if you have [been] here and seen, the Difference. Mr Randolph was as firm, stable and consistent a Patriot as any here-the Loss must be very great to Virginia in Particular and the Continent in general.  OCTOBER 23, 1775  I sometimes wonder that a similar Fate does not befall more of the Members. Minds so engaged and Bodies so little exercised are very apt to fall. This goes by Mr Gawen Brown. ""

In the new Establishment of the Army should the General Officers be allowed Regiments & the Field Officers Companies. Agreed in the Negative unanimously. Secondly. The Affairs of the Hospital require a Director Genl. if Doctr. Church is unworthy of continuing in that office. Lt. Col. Hand (late a Surgeon in the Army) & Dr. Foster are the only two who have made Application for the office to the General. Agreed that this be referred wholly to the Congress. Thirdly. In what Light are Vessels which are made Captures of with their Cargoes to be considered? That is, what Part is to be assigned the Captors in the Pay of the Continent & whose Vessels are fitted out at the publick Expence & how is the Residue of the Cargo & Vessel to be disposed of? The Instructions given by the General to the armed Vessels now out being considered were approved, except that 1/3 of the whole Capture be allowed the Officers & Men with any Reserve. 4. What is to be done with Prisoners taken in Transports by Vessels either in the Continental Pay or others? Are they to be detained as Prisoners or released; if the former what Distinctions are to be made between those taken by the Continental Vessels & others.

In what Manner are Prisoners to be treated? What Allowance made them & how are they to be cloathed? Agreed that they be treated as Prisoners of War but with Humanity & the Allowance of Provisions to be the Rations of the Army- that the Officers being in Pay should supply themselves with Cloaths, their Bills to be taken therefor-the Soldiers furnished as they now are.(4) 6. Suppose Troops should be landed at New York; is it expected that any Part of the Army before Boston be detached while the ministerial Troops remain there? Agreed that the Number of Men in the new Army being calculated to oppose the Army at Boston it is not expected that the General should detach any Part of it to New York or elsewhere, unless it appears to him necessary so to do for the common Safety.(5)   7. Ought not Negroes to be excluded from the new Inlistmt especially such as are Slaves. All were thought improper by the Council of Officers. Agreed That they be rejected altogether(6) 8th. How often should the Troops be paid. The General Officers were divided upon this Point. Some were for a Payment per Month, others every 3 Months? Agreed that they be paid monthly.(7) 9th.

Agreed: That under all Circumstances it is best he should remain where he is.(10) 12. Artificers of different Sorts have been employed on the best Terms they could be got, but may nevertheless appear high-none having less than 1/ extraordinary for every Day they work. Some have £4.10 per Month & with great Difficulty got on those Terms. Is this agreeable? Agreed that it is & that the General go on upon the present Agreement, as being the best that can probably be made.(11) 13. The Riffle Companies have exceeded their Establishment in Point of Numbers, but have nevertheless been paid as they had no more Officers than were allowed by Congress: is this right? Agreed that the General pick out from each Company such as are not Marksmen & dismiss them in such Manner as will be safest, with an Allowance of Pay to go home, if they do not Chuse to Enlist into other Corps (12) & in the mean Time that all receive their Pay.(13) 14. Very unhappy Disputes prevail in the Regiment of Artillery, Col. Gridly is become very obnoxious to that Corps & the General is informed that he will prove the Destruction of the Regiment if continued therein-what is to be done in the Case? Agreed. That as all Officers must be approved by the General, if it shall appear in forming a new Army, that the Difference is irreconciliable, Col Gridly be dismiss'd in some honourable Way, & that the  half Pay which he renounced by entering into the American Army ought to be compensated to him.(14) 15.

Several Indian Chiefs of the St. Francis, Penobscot, Stockbridge & St. John's Tribes have been to offer their Services & told they would be called for when wanted & dismiss'd with Presents. Ought they to be called if a Necessity for them should appear, & is the giving them Presents proper? Agreed That these Indians or others may be called on in Case of real Necessity, & that the giving them Presents is both suitable & proper?(16) 18. Would it not be adviseable to have Expresses posted along the Roads at different Distances (Persons of Character) for the Purpose of conveying early & frequent Intelligence? Agreed that such a Regulation is highly necessary, but that the Mode of carrying it into Execution be left to the Congress.(17) 19. Lead & Flints are much wanted where & in what Quantities can they be had? Agreed. That as much Lead as can be spared from the Northern Department & is wanted here should be sent down from Ticonderoga & all other Supplies of these Articles attended to.(18) 20. Several issuing Commissaries & Clerks are necessarily employed under the Commissary General, For which no Provision is made. Several Assistant Quarter Masters are also employed in order to discharge that Duty. A Clerk is & allways has been necessary to assist in the Office of the Adjutant Genl.

Six Vessels (armed) are now fitted out & fitting upon the best Terms to intercept the Enemys Supplies will this be agreeable to the Congress?   Agreed that the Committee approve of the Scheme & will recommend it to the Congress. (l9) October 24th. 1775 The Committee proceeded in their Conference on the Generals Queries, viz 1. When the Army receives such Supplies of Powder as to be enabled to spare some to the Country how & upon what Terms is it to be done? Agreed. That it be sold to them at a reasonable Price.(20) 2d. Tents, if the Army should have Occasion to take the Field, will be indispensably necessary for the Officers & Men, how are they to be provided & are the Officers to be allowed any? Agreed. That it be recommended to the Honl. Congress to pay an early Attention to this Article & if the Pay of the Officers is not considerably increased that Tents be allowed them. The General informed the Committee that he had given particular Orders that all the Tents now in Use should be carefully pack'd up in proper Places during the Winter. The Council of War lately held having in Consequence of an Intimation from the Congress deliberated on the Expediency of an Attack upon Boston & determined that at present it was not practicable. The General wishes to know how far it may be deemed proper & adviseable to avail himself of the Season to destroy the Troops who propose to winter at Boston by a Bombardment when the Harbour is block'd up, or in other Words whether the Loss of the Town & the Property therein are to be so considered as that an Attack upon the Troops there should be avoided when it evidently appears the Town must of Consequence be destroyed. The Committee were of Opinion this is a Matter of too Much Importance to be determined by them, therefore ref[er] it to the Congress. The General now requested that the Committee would represent to the Congress the Necessity of having Money constantly & regularly sent, & that some Regulation upon this Head should be made as soon as possible. Also That the Congress would be pleased to establish or recommend it to the Legislature of this Province to establish some Court for the Tryal & Condemnation of Vessels taken from the Enemy, so that they may be distinguished from those of a different Character & all Abuses prevented as much as possible.

I sincerely Join with you in dreading a Seperation from Great Britain which can be acceptable to very few. If all wisdom is not banished from the King's Councils the petitions of America can no longer be disregarded; and I must flatter myself that the last from our Congress being altogether unexceptionable, even to the most despotic Court, will produce a Conference and Accommodation on a constitutional and permanent basis. I thank you for the Intelligence from Lieut Thomas which is more particular in some Respects than the Congress Accounts. I suppose Genl Montgomerie can shelter his Troops at Montreal whenever he pleases, and by changes and frequent Reliefes, will be able to keep  OCTOBER 23, 1775  the Field as long as is necessary for the Capture of St John's, which I agree with you cannot be supplied in the manner the Canadian Prisoners represent. I hoped before this to have had some Subject for a Letter; but we have no News from England but what the Prints furnish, and the whole amounts to no more than Surmise and Conjecture. If Administrations was disposed to Peace, I think they woud come to no Conclusion without the advice of Parliament, in Support of whose usurped Authority this cruel and unnatural war has been prosecuted. I therefore expect nothing decisive till their next Sessions. In the meantime I hope the winter will put a Stop to the Ravages of the King's Ships which are employed in carrying on a pitiful predatory war against defenceless Towns and Coasts, disgraceful to the British Fleet. As to the Army they are confined in narrow Limits and kept in a State of Inaction by a Superior Power- so that no danger is to be apprehended from them without a very great Reinforcement. Upon the whole the Aspect of American Affairs is as favourable as we had any Reason to expect, tho we must all deplore the precious Blood which has been shed by Englishmen and Countrymen during this horrid Conflict. I am still undetermined how to dispose of my Family this winter. Over myself I fear I shall have little Command. My dearest Polly seems desirous that we should fix in New York for the Improvement of our Children. But that unhappy City is in too much danger and Confusion to Justify such a Measure, at least it so appears to me. At all Events I shall endeavour to be with my Family in a few weeks for I grow very impatient under such tedious Seperations. Some certain Account from England (which we have Reason daily to expect) of the probable Fate of our Petition will determine my Conduct. Adieu my dear and honourd Sir.

A Dexterity and Facility of thus unravelling Mens Thought and a Faculty of governing them by Means of the Knowledge We have of them, constitutes the principal Part of the Art of a Politician. In a Provincial Assembly, where We know a Mans Pedigree and Biography, his Education, Profession & Connections, as well as his Fortune, it is easy to see what it is that governs a Man and determines him to this Party in Preference to that, to this system of Politicks rather than another &c. But here it is quite otherwise. We frequently see Phenomena which puzzle Us. It requires Time to enquire and learn the Characters and Connections, the Interests and Views of a Multitude of Strangers. It would be an exquisite Amusement, an high Gratification of Curiosity, this same Mystery of Politicks if the Magnitude of the Interests & Consequences did not interest us sometimes too much.

882,dg002239,1775,Committee of Conference to John Hancock,"""Committee of Conference to John Hancock   Sir Cambridge Octo. 24. 1775 We arrived at this place on the 15 and shoud have proceeded immediately to perform the Duty imposed by the Congress, but the President of the Congress of New Hampshire was detained by the Illness of his Family from attending. After waiting two days for him it was determined to call in General Sullivan to represent that Colony. The president joined us next day, and we have been constantly employed in the Consideration of the many important Matters with which we are charged, all of which we hope will be finished today. We enclose you a Copy of the several Determinations (1) of this meeting on those Heads on which the Governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut, the Council of this Province, the President of the Congress of New Hampshire, together with the General, were directed to be consulted, by which you will see that they were unanimously of Opinion, not only that any Reduction of pay was absolutely impracticable but that a bare proposal of this Nature woud cause such Discontents, if not Mutinies as woud perhaps prove the Ruin of the Army. We are sorry to find this Opinion too much confirmed, by the Difficulty that occurs in prevailing on the Troops of Connecticut to OCTOBER 24, 1775  insist for the month of December only, according to the Directions of Congress. Under these Circumstances we thought it our Duty to consent that the General shoud immediately proceed to a new Enlistment of the present Army for the next year without waiting for the Directions of Congress, being convinced by the Opinion, not only of the Gentlemen we were directed to consult, but of every Officer we conversed with on the subject, that every Moments delay was big with Danger. We have however reserved, in the terms of the new inlistments a Right in Congress to disband at Pleasure, without mentioning the Months additional pay Voted the Soldiers in Case they had listed at 5 dollars per month. Last night we received the Melancholy Account of the burning the Town of Falmouth, by some Ships sent for that Purpose by Admiral Graves, the commanding officer of which declared he had Orders to destroy every Seaport between that and Boston. It is easy to conceive what Effects this must produce in this Camp, every Soldier who came from Falmouth insistg. on leave to go and take care of his Family and to find a place for them where they may be covered from the inclemency of the approaching Winter. Indeed tis too reasonable a Request to be refused. Shoud the Same Fate fall to the share of many such Towns, tis easy to foretell what must happen to the Army especially shoud it happen before the new Army is inlisted. This we hope will not only excuse our conduct, but induce Congress to hasten their Deliberations upon this matter. One more Reason for dispatch is that Men may much more probably inlist before, than after they feel the hardships of a Winter Campaign. Upon examining the Journals of assembly it appears that the Men raised in the Years 1758 & 1759 by this Colony received fourteen pounds bounty & had thirty six Shillings per month pay, which as their Engagements were for Six Months only, was much higher Terms than the present when no other Bounty is allowed than a Coat to each Man. We are with great Respect Sir your most Obedt. Tho Lynch B Franklin Benj Harrison ""

Since my last, we have nothing new from England or from the camps at either Cambridge or St. John's. Our eyes are turned to the latter place with no little anxiety, the weather having been uncommonly bad for troops in that quarter, exposed to the inclemencies of the sky without any protection. Carleton is retired to Quebec, and though it does not appear he has any intimation of Arnold's expedition, yet we hear he has embodied 1,100 men to be on his guard. A small vessel was the other day cast away on the Jersey shore (she was one of the transports which had some time ago brought over troops to Boston), on board of which were a captain, with his subordinate officers and marines, amounting to 23 in all, and also a Duncan Campbell, who was going to recruit men at New York for General Gage, he having some time before undertaken the same business in the same place, and actually carried off 60 men. The marines and their officers were all taken immediately, except their captain and the recruiting gentleman; these pushed off in a little boat, and coasted it to Long Island, where they got on board a sloop which was to have sailed in an hour, when the party sent after them came upon them. They were brought to this city this morning, the marines having been here some time.(1) Our good old Speaker died the night before last.

John Morgan, a Native of this City, is a Doctor of Physick, a Fellow of the Royal Society at London; Correspondent of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris; Member of the Arcadian Belles Lettres Society at Rome; Licentiate of the Royal Colledges of Physicians in London and in Edinburgh; and Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Colledge of Philadelphia. This Gentleman Served an Apprenticeship of six or seven years under Dr John Redman, an eminent Physician in this City, during which Time he had an opportunity of Seeing the Practice of all the eminent Physicians in this City, as he attended at the Hospital, and for one year made up the Prescriptions of all. After this he devoted himself four Years to a military Life, and went into the service as a Physician and surgeon to the Troops raised by this Colony; after this he went abroad, and Spent five years in Europe, under the most celebrated Masters in every Branch of Medicine, and visiting the principal Cities and Seats of Science in Great Britain, Holland, France and Italy. This Gentleman in 1765, delivered a Discourse upon the Institution of Medical Schools in America, (2) at a Commencement, which was published with a Preface, containing an Apology for attempting to introduce the regular Mode of practising Physic in Phyladelphia. Every Winter Since he has read Lectures to the Students at the Colledge as a Professor &c.

For the Winter when the Men of War cannot cruise upon the Coast is the only Time that We can trade. Wealthy Merchants, and monied Men cannot get the Interest or Money. More Virtue is expected from our People, than any People ever had. The Low Countries did not reason as We do about speculative opinions, but they felt the oppression for a long Course of Years, rich and poor. Zubly.

All that are supported by Trade, must be out of Business. Every Argument which shews that our Association will materially affect the Trade of G.B. will shew that We must be affected too, by a Stoppage of our Trade. G.B. has many Resources.

904,dg002261,1775,in Congress,"""in Congress   [October 27, 1775](1) Motion [to continue nonexportation is] part [of the] general system. Limitation to March-when apparent [we can] only trade in winter-enemy [can] prevent [us] in summer.(2) Arguments against Trade [are] general-hardly believe serious. Inconveniences from stopage [of] trade.  OCTOBER 27, 1775  III. Objects. I. Enable our own people to bear Burthens & to render them willing to carry on war. II. To procure means [of ] war. III To impoverish, weaken enemy. I. May be laid down as a principle, that all circumstances being alike, those support war longest who have most superfluous wealth. Those avoid it who feel more injuries from war than [they have] reason [to] expect from submission. Consider effect [of nonexportation] on wealth [of the] people. 1st. Reduction of price of produce to 1/2 value-Price [of] Labour must fall same proportion. This no inconvenience if [it] stood alone, because labour & subsistance bear same proportion to each other. 3 Things to be consider'd: 1. Tho labour cheap yet vent for produce small-farmer discharge labourers. 2d. Cloathing dearer than before-thereafter [when] produce falls 1/2, necessaries purchased [rise in] same proportion: value of cloathing, salt &c. is as 1 to 2; the farmer [would] pay 2/3 of income. 3. Burthen still heavier on labourer who [in] genl. being maintained by farmer, worked for cloathing & triffle for pleasure of family. [With his] wages diminished 1/2, necessaries except food raised 1/2, [it is] impossible [that he] can cloath himself at all. 2d . People [who] subsist by trade: Merchants, ship builders, Rope & sailmakers, Sailors, Smiths, Millars, labourers employed [at] Furnaces, carriers by land & water-in New York, Pensylvania, Rode Island make about 1/4 of the whole-other Colonies North [of] Pensylvania 1/8--so that have upwards [of] 225,000 [plus] 75,000 [or]300,000 people besides labourers out of employ who must be supported. All these must be supported by farmer whose income [is] already diminished 2/3. May be said [that these] may be employed. How? Not in culture, Lands less cultivated now than before. Not manufactures-always worked up all materials; of course [there are] hands to do it without them. Consider rigor [of] climate, delicate life, many [of] these [do] not think 30 dollars [a] year extravagant for subsistance. 9,000,000 [dollars]. This tax must be raised immidiately on 7 Colonies & those [the] poorest   Picture of Robert R. Livingston Notes  May be said some [of] these [colonies are] rich; support themselves & others. Deny. Riches [of] northern colonies consists [of] stock in trade, money at interest, Land rents. 1st. No use. 2nd. Interest money can not be paid when trade stoped, nor can principle be recovered-suits [at] law stoped, of course credit, & with it circulation [of] cash. 3d. Landlord cannot expect rent of people taxed 2/3 of whole estate. So that this resolution [to continue nonexportation] anihilates all property.(3) II. Inquire whether war with all these pressures [is] not more greivous than any they expect from (peace) submission. If it is they chuse lesser evil. [The people] felt no oppression-found [they] grew wealthy under dominion [of] parliment. Yet spirit [of] liberty excited wonderfully. Hopes boyed up, now see serious. We ourselves thought virtue shd. not be tried. [If we would] not tax 3,000,000 when in affluence, how expect 7 Colonies [to] bear weight [of] 9,000,000 [dollars], besides burthen of war & a total loss besides of 2/3 of property? Add to this [that the] value [of] commodities on hand [which] amount to ,(4) operate as a bridle on possessors. Horses, wheat &c. which could sell £30, now but 15; as much under influence as if £15 given him to desert cause. People know too that on submission storm [would] burst only on leaders; That oppressions [would] not [be] heavy at least for time. [People] already alledge dispute [is] about property; they have none. No instance [in] history [that a] people reduced [to] this situatio maintained war. Revolt [in the] Low Countries not paralel, grivously opressd religion-governmt felt many years-body [of the] people felt as much as rich. During war [the Dutch] carried on trade-grew rich. Case nearest ours-commotion [in the] year 1640.(5) Their people soon tired [on governmt of republick, Tho' trade most flourishing state, meerly on acct. [of] taxes. Petition [and] commotions shew inclinations, army necessary to subject them. Restoration matter [of] genl. satisfaction. Calculate from northern colonies these inconveniences, not so much felt southwd. Trade [in the South is] carried on English bottoms-no Seamen, no merchants, but few factors. No ship   builders-various mechanicks employed in that business-few carriers but negroes. Planters live on estates, cultivation [of] which with great number [on hands easily procure food & clothing sufficient for whites.Blacks go naked till 14-of course may till 50. Not wonder therefore some [of] them sickle measure which judging own climate is but temporary inconvenience. Hope [they] change sentiments when [they] take view [of the] northern ones. Whether [we can] obtain means [of] war [if] this takes place. 1st. Wants sufficiently obvious. Operations [of] armies checked by it. Citys defenseless. Coast lyable to be ravaged. Second. Exception with respect [to] them but these [will] not answer purpose-2 reasons: (1st) Because publishes wants to our enimies-make [them] more vigilant. (2d) Few merchants engage when bound at all events to return [with] military stores. May so happen [these] cannot be got at port sent- then voyage frustrated. If trade left at large, they always indeavour to get them because yield most proffit-adventure because shd [they] fail [to obtain] that cargo [they would] still not return empty. Has been said that if [we had ] open ports none but eastern colonies trade-own advantage-rejoice at it. Tho' they joined sentiment that our enjoying advantage [was] not hurtful [to the] rest [of the] provinces, [it] wd excite jealousy in theirs. Yet persuaded own Constituents think as to wish them advantages ten times greater. Besides every Colony [has] chance during winter of sliping out. 3d Objection. impossibility [of] obtaining navy. [Nonexportation] banishes seamen, who not only [are] lost but become enimies-forced by necessity into British service. [Given] these considerations [we] Must Trade. III. Meathods proposed. 1st. Invite forreigners. 2d. Trade with all the world except G. B. & I. 3d. Export immediately to G. B. & Ireland except tobacco & lumber. I. Invite forreigners.2 Inq.uiries. 1st. Whether foreigners at large or particular nations? 2d. Whether temporary expedient or lastg Basis of our trade? If at large no national object. Still less so if only temporary  expedient. Not expect merchants [to] alter course [of] trade & turn [into a] chanel which expect soon [to be] stoped & in which expect many rivals. If then must trade [with a] particular power, inquire who shall be! Holland, Portugal unable to protect us. [Would] Spain regardless of her own trade consider new one as object?Suffered all staples todecay,mismanagement-weak,unenterprizing-war already on hand. Only remaining power France. 1st. How [....](6) 1st. Is [it] not very doubtful whether she [France] will trade with us, considering low state [of her] finances, weakness [of the] present monarchy, And late conduct? Gent. asserts she must; for want [of] grain which [she can] get no where else. Our exports of grain to France do not make a 110th part of her consumption. Our exports to her never amounted 1,000,000 [bushels]- her consumption 150,000,000. So [France] not forced [to trade for] those. As many advantages [would;] result [to] her from trade, may possibly think [it] worth her notice. But private adventurers never undertake this. Before govermt interposes, must settle Terms. Must at least be permanent at all events. Have Gent. turned thoughts to what terms shall be? Have fix'd time? Considered whether trade may not become monopoly? Whether she can supply us with woollens without getting them from England? Whether this [might] not defeat our non importation? True, this [would be a] loss [to] G. B., but have [gentlemen] considered whether greater loss [might] not fall on us? Have made any provision for our shipbuilders, sailors &c. or must [these] be a burthen? But this evident & this measure not to be adopted till treaties settled-nor they entered into till [the French] agree to break with Great Britain. II. Trade with foreigners at large [in our] own bottoms. This more advantagious because still imploy our own hands. Retain Sailors. Still has its disadvantages. 1st. Vessels liable to capture. By which means [Britain  would] receive our commodities on a cheap lay. 2d. West Indies would be supplied from foreign West Indies. 3d. British goods would be lodged at foreign ports. Thus non importation, in which our chief strength, [would] be defeated. 4th. When our trade [is] witheld, Briton [would] be under necessity of fetching some commodities from Northern nations [which she] now gets of us. This [would] afford vent to goods [she] usually send to us. May [be] said no purchasers. Mistake. Both Dutch & English send woollens up Baltick. Of course price must be nearly equal. If so then a small reduction in price [would] enable English to undersell Dutch. That reduction would [be] made. For as [Britain] must fetch commodities from there, [she] must either send vessels empty and loose freight outward, or by sinking whole profit, make freight. May be said This was done when [she] traded with us- of course [her prices] could sink no lower. Not fact. When same good imported [by Britain] from America that [she would now] get from Northern nations, & at rather a cheaper rate-profit to the mercht trading with them was on his outward entries-only took their commodities to make a freight. Now reverse. So [it is] clear By non exportation agreement we defeat non importation. Leave [British] manufactures & merchants [in the] same state they were, subjecting indeed [that] nation to a loss, but too small to be early felt. That made up by captures. If Then [a] mode can be fallen upon that can prevent these inconveniences, preserve our non importation inviolate, sure prejudice or hard words shd. not prevent a cool examination of it. This did myself honour to mention. As was recd. cooly, [I] shd. have passed over had [I] not been called upon.(7) Now endeavour to defend. III. Export immediately to G.B. & Ireland except tobacco (& Lumber), but not import. These evident advantages. 1st. If our exports equal [£] 2,500,000 we must drain [Britain] anualy of that some [sum]. Effect this [would] have on G.B. when considered [that her] current cash not more than [£] 2,000,000. Besides  employing hands, enriching country, [it would] enable [us] to pay whole expense [of the] war. Enables [us to] purchase what [we] want [to] carry on war. Cheaper, less risk. For vessel would be safe from here to England then have money with which [to] trade [with] any foreign nation. Landings little danger [if] any, numerous inlets on coast. This would give us intelligence of Movements of our enimies. Would reserve our seamen. Objections. 1st. That prohibition [of] tobacco [exports] would create disgust [in] 2 Colonies. [For] my own part [I have a] higher opinion [of their] virtue than [to] think so. Principles on which prohibited might be explained. Lands [which] raise tobacco [are] fit [for] any grain. Female negroes not employed, but will they be employed if trade totally stoped? If not, were disadvantage. 2d. That many things exported by us manufactured in England & reshiped. Have shewn [that if Britain] did not get [them] from Colonies, [they would] be procured from elsewhere-& in return for them manufactors. Iron. But even if not, [the] value of those as well as home consumption [would be] paid us in specie. 3d. Number hands employed in reshiping. But surely more employed [by] us in shiping-not only same but what they consume too. 4th. Flax seed [to] Ireland not so important as [we] imagine. [They could] procure [it] from Holland [as they] formerely did. Whole value [£] 40,000- Idle [to] think [they] could not manufacture [for] want of it. 5th. West Indies-provision Shiped not reshiped there. Gent did not think much weight in argument when [he] supposes trade [would] be so ruinous to G.B. that she would prohibit it. Worth trying. Perhaps interest [of] individual [would] over rule publick good. Find [that Britain] does carry on some trades where ballance [is] against her-East Indies. [During the] last non importation against [Britain, we] exported to her. Probable [we would] enjoy advantage at least [for] some  time when [Britain] prohibited exportation [of] specie, which [is the] most probable meathod [Britain would] take [to] stop it. Purchase forreign bills answer same purpose. Gent went far into non importation & disadvantages Britain laboured from. [I] agree [with that] sentiment, & [am] so far [from] wishing to break it that I mention this [as the] only mode to preserve [non importation] in full force. Breach association. But if [non exportation is] founded in error, shd. be revoked. Not at present. Let people feel want [of] trade, which [they will] do in few weeks, then grant. ""

What shall We say of a Country which produces such Characters as Hutchinson and Church? However to turn my Attention from this detestible Subject to another more agreable. Congress has appointed instead of Church, Dr. Morgan of this City whose Character I will pourtray for your Satisfaction. The Gentleman appointed Director and surgeon general of the Hospital, is John Morgan M.D. Fellow of the Royal Society at London; Correspondent of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris; Member of the Arcadian Belles Lettres Society at Rome; Licentiate of the Royal Colledges of Physicians in London and in Edinburgh; and Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Colledge of Philadelphia. This Gentleman was one of the first who received their Education in the Colledge in this City, and served an Apprenticeship of six Years with Dr. John Redman an eminent Phisician, here, during one whole Year of which he put up the Prescriptions of all the Phisicians who attended the public Hospital here, who were all eminent. After this the Dr. entered the Army and served four Years under Generals Moncton, Forbes and Stanwix, where he had an entensive Practice, in the Army among all Kinds of Diseases. Five years after, he left the Army he spent in Europe,(1) under the most celebrated Masters in every Branch of Medicine. During this Period he visited the principal Cities and Seats of Science in Great Britain, Holland, France and Italy. Returning from his Travels, he was chosen Professor of Medicine in the Colledge in this City, where he has constantly read Lectures every Winter, and for many Years practiced among the Citizens Dr. Morgans moral Character is very good, and his manners are civil, decent, and agreable. He married a sister of the Lady of our Chaplain, Mr. Dushe, who is new Rector of the three united Churches in this City. A sister of the Doctors is married to Mr. Stillman the Antipaedobaptist lately in Boston, now in this Place. Thus I hope We shall hear no Complaint that this Place is not now well filled. Jealousy and Envy spare nobody. Some have whispered that the Dr. is a little Visionary in Theory and Practice. But all agree that he is attentive, vigilant and laborious for the good of his Patients in a great Degree. and he is said to be a pious Man.  OCTOBER 28, 1775  ""

It is Shearing of its Beams that Luminary, which, in all its Glory might dazzle our feeble Sight. But a Question arises, whether, our Association against Exportations, can be observed, so as to have its full Effect, upon Britain, Ireland and the West Indies, unless We extend it further? We have agreed not to export to B., I. and the W. Indies. Parliament has made an Act that We Shall not export to any other Place, So that Trade is entirely stopped. But will not a Smuggling Trade be opened? That is will not Adventurers push out Vessells against the Act of Parliamentl If they do, when the Vessells are once at Sea, will they not go to the Place where a Famine price is to be had. The Spirit of Commerce is mercenary and avaricious, and Merchants will go where the Scarcity is greatest, the Demand quickest and the Price highest. What Security then can we have that Merchants will not order their Vessells to the West India Islands, British or foreign, to Ireland or even to Great Britain, in Defyance of our association? Besides is there not reason to apprehend, that the concealed Tories of whom there are many in every Colony, and especially in every maritime Town, will Send their Vessells to sea, on purpose to be taken by the Enemy and sent to Supply the Army and Navy in America. It is true, their Vessells would be forfeited, and seized and condemned no doubt but they might be pleased with this, and would easily obtain hereafter Compensation or Retribution for this meritorious Sacrifice, from the Ministry. In Short may not our association be wholly evaded and eluded, if We dont draw it closer? My own opinion upon these great Questions I may possibly give you sometime or other.

The Griefs of your Father and Sisters, your Uncles and Aunts, as well as the remoter Connections, often croud in upon me, when my whole Attention ought to be directed to other Subjects. Your Uncle Quincy, my Friend as well as Uncle, must regret the loss of a beloved Sister, Dr. Tufts my other Friend I know bewails the loss of a Friend, as well as an Aunt and a sister, Mr. Cranch the Friend of my youth as well as of my riper Years, whose tender Heart sympathizes with his fellow Creatures in every Affliction and Distress, in this Case feels the Loss of a Friend, a fellow Christian, and a Mother. But alas what avail these mournfull Reflections. The best Thing We can do, the greatest Respect We can show to the Memory of our departed Friend, is to copy into Our own Lives, those Virtues which in her Lifetime rendered her the Object of our Esteem, Love and Admiration. I must confess I ever felt a Veneration for her, which seems increased by the News of her Translation. Above all Things my dear, let us inculcate these great Virtues and bright Excellencies upon our Children.(1) Your Mother had a clear, and penetrating Understanding and a profound Judgment, as well as an honest and a friendly and a charitable Heart. There is one Thing however, which you will forgive me if I hint to you. Let me ask you rather, if you are not of my opinion? Were not her Talents, and Virtues too much confined, to private, social and domestic Life. My Opinion of the Duties of Religion and Morality, comprehends a very extensive Connection with society at large, and the great Interest of the public. Does not natural Morality, and much more Christian Benevolence, make it our indispensible Duty to lay ourselves out, to serve our fellow Creatures to the Utmost of our Power, in promoting and supporting those great Politicial systems, and general Regulations upon which the Happiness of Multitudes depends. The Benevolence, Charity, Capacity and Industry which ex- OCTOBER 29, 1775  erted. in private Life, would make a family, a Parish or a Town Hap- py, employed upon a larger Scale, in Support of the great Principles of Virtue and Freedom of political Regulations might secure whole Nations and Generations from Misery, Want and Contempt.

You tell me that a Committee of both Houses of Assembly is appointed to bring in a Militia Bill.(1) I am of your Opinion that this Matter requires great Attention and I wish with you to see our Militia formd not only into Battallions but also Brigades. But should we not be cautious of putting them under the Direction of the Generals of the Continent, at least until such a Legislative shall be established in America as every Colony shall consent to. The Continental Army is at present very properly under the Direction of the Continental Congress. Possibly if ever such a Legislative should be formd, it may be proper that the whole Military Power of every Colony should be under its absolute Direction. Be that as it may, will it not, till then, be prudent, that the Militia of each Colony should be under the Direction of its own Legislative which is and ought to be the sovereign uncontroulable Power within its own Limits or Territory. I hope our Militia will be always prepard to aid the Forces of the Continent in this righteous Opposition to Tyranny. But it is your natural Strength which ought to be under your own Direction & employd for your own Safety. It is a Misfortune to a Colony to become the Seat of War. It is always dangerous to the Liberties of OCTOBER 29, 1775  the People to have an Army kept up among them over which they have no Controul. There is at present a Necessity for it. The Continental Army is kept up in our Colony for our Security. But History affords us abundant Evidence of established Armies making themselves the Masters of those Countries which they were designd to protect. It is now in the Power of our Assembly to establish many wholesome Laws & Regulations which could not be done under the former Administration of Government. Bad Men may be kept out of places of publick Trust. The utmost Circumspection I hope will be used in the Choice of Men for publick officers. It is to be expected that some who are void of the least Regard to the publick, will put on the Appearance & even speak boldly in the Language of Patriots, with the sole purpose of getting the Confidence of the publick & securing the Loaves and Fishes for themselves or their Sons. Men who Stand Candidates for publick posts should be critically traced in their Views and Pretensions, and tho' we would despise mean & base Suspicions, yet there is a Degree of Jealousy which is absolutely necessary in this degenerate State of Mankind and is indeed at all times to be considerd as a political Virtue. It is in your power also to prevent a Plurality of Places incompatible with each other being vested in the same Persons. This our Patriots have loudly and very justly complaind of in times past, and it will be an everlasting Disgrace to them if they suffer the practice to continue.(2) Care, I am informd, is taking to remedy this Evil with as little Inconvenience as possible, but it is my opinion that the Remedy ought to be deep & thorough. After every other Consideration, Virtue is the surest Means of securing the State. Our brave Ancestors laid an excellent Foundation for the establishing and perpetuating virtuous Principles in the Country, when they created a publick Seminary of Learning, even before they had cut down the Woods in Cambridge, and they early made Laws for the Support of Grammar Schools. A better Foundation could no Men lay. I hope you will improve the Golden opportunity which you now have of restoring the ancient Purity of Manners in our Country. Every thing that we esteem valuable depends upon it. For, Freedom or Slavery, says an admired Writer, will prevail in a Country according as the Disposition and Manners of the Inhabitants render them fit for the one or the other.(3) ""

By a private letter this day to a gentleman of Congress from General Montgomery we learn that our forces before St. John's are 4000. in number besides 500. Canadians the latter of whom have repelled with great intrepidity three different attacks from the fort. We ap- OCTOBER 31, 1775  prehend it will not hold out much longer as Monsr. St. Luc de la Corne and several other principal inhabitants of Montreal who have been our great enemies have offered to make terms. This St. Luc is great Seigneur among the Canadians, and almost absolute with the Indians. He has been our most bitter enemy. He is acknowledged to be the greatest of all scoundrels. To be assured of this I need only mention to you that he is the ruffian who when during the last war Fort William Henry was surrendered to the French and Indians on condition of saving the lives of the garrison, had every soul murdered in cold blood. The check which the Canadians received at first is now wearing off. They were made to beleive we had an army of 15,000 men going there. This put them in high spirits. But when they saw Montgomery with but 2700 they were thunderstruck at the situation they had brought themselves into. However when they found even this small armament march boldly to invest St. John's and put a good face on the matter they revived, and the recruits since have contributed to inspirit them more. I have set apart nearly one day in every week since I came here to write letters. Notwithstanding this I have never received the scrip of a pen from any mortal breathing.(2) I should have excepted two lines from Mr. Pendleton to desire me to buy him 24. lb of wire from which I concluded he was alive. I speak not this for you from whom I would not wish to receive a letter till I know you can write one without injury to your health. But in future as I must be satisfied with information from my collegues that my country still exists, so I am determined to be satisfied also with their epistolary communications of what passes within our knowledge.

Suppose We should appoint a Continental King, and a Continental House of Lords, and a Continental House of Commons, to be annually, or triennially or Septennially elected? And in this Way make a Supreme American Legislature? This is easily done you know by an omnipotent Continental Congress. And when once effected, His American Majesty may appoint a Governor for every Province, as his Britannic Majesty used to do, and Lt Governor and secretary and judge of Admiralty. Nay his Continental Majesty may appoint the Judges of the supream Courts &c too-or if his American Majesty should condiscend to permit the provincial Legislatures, or assemblies [to] nominate two three or four Persons out of whom he should select a governor, and 3 or 4 Men for Chief Justice &c out of whom he should choose one, would not this do nicely? To his Continental Majisty, in his Continental Privy Council, Appeals might lie from all Admiralty Cases, and from all civil Causes [possessed?] at least, of a certain Value, and all Disputes about Land, that is about Boundaries of Colonies, should be settled by the Conti- OCTOBER 31, 1775  nental King and Council, as they used to be by the British K. and Council. What a magnifient System? (1) I assure you this is no Chimera of my own. It is whispered about in Coffee Houses, &c and there are [those] who wish it. I am inclined to think it is done, as one Artifice more to divide the Colonies. But in vain. It would be very curious to give you an History of the out a Door Tricks for this important Evil of dividing the Colonies. Last Fall the Quakers and Antipaedobaptists were conjured up to pick a Quarrell with Massachusetts; (2) last Spring the Land Jobbers were stimulated to pick a Quarrell with Connecticutt for the same End.

The Difficulties and Disorders in the Business and Family I dont so much wonder at as I have been so much from home this last year & when at home have been so much engaged in Matters which prevented my taking that Care of my Family & affairs which I could wish but surely my little dear Children cannot so soon forget their Duty to God, to their Father, NOVEMBER 1, 1775  their Country, Family, Friends & to themselves; They are young but old enough to consider that He who gave them Being & whose Goodness supports, comforts & preserves them every moment Deserves their highest affection & their most chearful Obedience. Again a kind most indulgent Father ever ready to do them all the Service in his Power at the Risque of his Life, at the Expence of many of the Amusements & Pleasures of this World must be entitled to their warmest Affection, Gratitude and Duty. Their Country also has a Right to their best Services and if they spend their time idly instead of being usefully employed in Business or in improving their own Understandings they will be only a Burthen to the Community and never capable of doing any great Good; their Sisters, Brothers and Friends have a Right to expect all the Good in their Power to do them but if they contract vicious or idle Habits They will not be able to do Good to any, and lastly upon their own Behaviour depends their present & future Happiness. They much want a good School, proper Company & the Care of a kind watchful Parent or Parents; all these and every thing else that would have a Tendency [to] make them wise, good & happy they should have if it was in my Power to obtain them for my Children, but instead of murmuring because We have not every Wish gratified let us make the best Improvement of what We have. What inconceivable Distress many Parts of the Continent feel. Let us thank God that We have a comfortable Retreat where it is probable our Enemies will not be able to reach Us, what We may be called to do or suffer I cannot at present say but the Cause in which We are engaged is good. The great Author of our Beings made us free, tamely to suffer ourselves to be enslaved would be to spurn at his Bounty and quit that noble Rank of free and rational Creatures which He designed us for and degrade Ourselves almost to the Level of the brute Creation; This our Duty obliges us to shun at the Hazard not only of many of the Comforts of Life but even of Life itself. I wrote so fully upon Business lately that it is not necessary to add much now. I mentioned the Quantity of Pork which you must lay in. I hope the Hogs & Cattle are well fed & no Waste made; your Flax should be rolled before this time; if it is not done already let it be done as soon as possible. Linens of all kinds will be scarce and very dear; make therefore & take in all you can at a moderate Rate. Besides the Manufacture of Wool mentioned when at home there should be one good fine p[iece] Broadcloth made for Me & your Brothers and a p[iece] good Dray also for Summer with proper linings for each. I wish to know what state your manufacturing is in. With Regard to Molasses I dont think you'l get it under 1/6 per Gall. If you can get right good for that I would take one hhd more but you must not sell at 48/ a Gallon; 2s/ law. would be as little as   you can afford. If you can get Rum do get I Hhd at least for People will be unwilling to do without it; if you have no Prospect of getting any be sure to keep plenty for yourselves for a good while. Be sure to keep plenty of Salt for your own Use & Wine also. Pins are not to be had save at a most extravagant Price: if you have none to use I will buy a few if I see any Way to get them home; I'l see if I can buy any black handkerchiefs. One of the p [iece] s of Bandannois missing I sent to Providence by one Mr. Dabney who lives near your Uncle Ward, write to him So he will see that you have it. The other p[iece]s I sent to Norwich by one Mr. (1) Mr. Benjm Clarke may contrive to get it some how or other for you without much Trouble or Expence if you write to him soon about it. We have no late News from England, by the last. We have nothing to expect but War and I think We are in a Way to carry it on with the greatest Success. Gentlemen who a few months since could not bear the Idea of War now chearfully concur with us in the most spirited Measures. The Expedition against St. Johns in Canada has always gone on heavily but upon the whole I think We shall take it and by the best Accts. from Colo. Arnold He had got near Quebec without any Opposition, the Canadians were very friendly, there were no Soldiers in Quebec & few or no Guns mounted on the Walls, the Troops were in good Health & high Spirits & expected to take the Place easily. I have never heard from your Bror. since he was at Fort Weston 24th Sepr. The Congress has ordered two Battalions to be raised in New Jersey, one in this Province, two were lately raised by Consent of Cong[res]s in No. Carolina, & to Morrow I expect So. Carolina will be allowed to raise two Battalions at the Expence of the Continent.(2) In one Word my Dear We are determined to spare neither Men nor Money; May God of his infinite Goodness direct & Prosper all our Measures & in his own due Time restore Peace, Liberty & Safety to this Continent. I would gladly write to your Aunts but I am engaged in a Comee. in the mornings always & often in an Evening which with attending constantly upon Congress leaves Me little or no Time for necessary Relaxation & Exercise; I am obliged to them for their kind Remembrance of Me in your Letter. Give my most affectionate Regards to them, to all your Brothers & Sisters, to my Family & Friends. I am My dearest Your most affece. Parent Sam Ward P.S. Since writing the above two Ships have arrived from London. They bring over amongst other Things a Proclamation dated 23rd Augst last for suppressing Rebellion & Treason in the Colonies.(3) We are all declared to be Rebels in effect tho not in express Terms, this has a most happy Effect here for those who hoped for Redress from  our Petitions now give them up & heartily join with us in carrying on the War vigorously.

921,dg002278,1775,Expedition to Nova Scotia,"""Expedition to Nova Scotia  [November 2-10? 1775] (1) Proposals. That two Battallions of Marines be raised consisting of one Coll, two Lt Colls, two Majors &c (officers as usual in other Regiments) that they consist of five hundred Privates each Battalion, exclusive of officers. That particular Care be taken that no Persons be appointed to office or inlisted into Said Battalions but Such as have actually Served in the Merchant Service as Seamen, or so acquainted with maritime Affairs as to be able to serve to advantage by Sea, when required. That they be enlisted and commissioned to be held for and during the present War, between G. Britain and the Colonies, unless regularly dismissed by orders of the Congress. That they be distinguished by the Name of the 1st and 2d Battalion of American Marines. That a Sufficient Number of Vessells be taken up, and provided at Newbury Port, or Portsmouth by the 1st day of December next for transporting Said two Battalions and three Months Provisions, and other Necessaries. That Said two Battalions be raised and marched to Said Place of Rendezvous, by the 1st of December, and in Case they are not easily raised or there is likely to be delay, that the General Draught out of the Forces under his Command to make up, any such Deficiency, of those who have been employed at Sea if Such are to be had. That Said Battalions shall be armed in the following Manner vizt, a light Fusee, fitted for Slinging-a large Hatchet with a long Handle, and a Spear, with thirty two Rounds per Man of Ammunition. That a Number of Men be immediately Sent into Nova Scotia, to inform themselves of the Temper and Disposition of the Inhabitants of that Colony with respect to the Present Struggle between G. B.  NOVEMBER 2, 1775  and these Colonies, and how far, they may be willing or able to take an active Part in the present Dispute. That two Swift Sailing Boats be employed constantly to ply between Minas and Portsmouth or Newbury to bring Intelligence of the State and Situation of the Province, in general but most minutely or every Thing respecting the Town and Harbour of Hallifax. That as soon as the Said two Battallions shall be arrived, at either of Said Ports and the Situation of that Colony and the Town of Hallifax shall be known the Said Battallions embark for Minas and make their Voyage with all possible Dispatch. That previous to their Arrival, Horses and Carriages be privately engaged for their Use, and that on their Landing they immediately make a forced March for Hallifax and possess themselves of that Town and of the naval and other Stores there and if practicable of the Shipping. Note. Coll Arnolds Expedition was Supposed in Boston to have been against this Place, which caused the General to Send thither Shipps, and Troops, but not enough to make Resistance to two Such Battallions. Further the Country are intirely in our favour, a few Scotch Traders and renegade Tories excepted. Should this Expedition by any Accident be found impracticable, these would be two Battallions of the utmost Service, being capable of Serving either by Sea or Land. Should the Expedition Succeed, the Consequences will be of the utmost Importance, nothing less than the greatest Distress, if not the Utter Ruin of the ministerial Navy in America. The Naval Stores in that Place are Said to be of vast Value, the Docks and Barracks and yards cost the Nation more than one Million Sterling, and is the only Place at which Shipps of War can refitt in America. These Battalions Should consist of Ten Companies each of fifty privates in a Company. The Reason for this is, that in fitting out any Ship of War one of these Companies would compleatly man a Small Vessell and two of them make a large Proportion of Marines for the largest. Should this Expedition Succeed, which it most unavoidably will, if prudently managed, the Destruction of the Docks and Yards, and the Stores, which may be brought off, will be an immense affair, and a Retreat can even be made with Safety. But if a Ship or two of Warr should be taken, in the Harbour, of which you may be certain, and the Place by Reinforcements held, untill a force Superiour can be brought from G. B. it will unavoidably destroy, and defeat every operation of our Enemy for the next Campaign, as all their Transport Ships may by a few Armed Vessells from this Port be intercepted before they can have Intelligence to avoid them.

Sir, You have, in the foregoing, (1) the outlines of the policy of the Connecticut government, in as concise a view as I could; the great and leading principles of which will, I conceive, apply to any new state; and the sooner they are applied the better it will be for the health and prosperity of the rising community. An equal and certain security of life, liberty and property; an equal share in the rights of legislation, and an equal distribution of the benefits resulting from society; with an early attention to the principles, morals and manners of the whole, are the great first principles of a good government, and these well fixed, lesser matters will easily and advantageously adjust, as I may say, themselves. I am far from thinking our system is entirely fit for you, in every point. It has grown up and enlarged itself, as we have grown. Its principal features are worth your attending to; and, if I had leisure, would point out, more particularly, which part I think you might adopt immediately, what additions are necessary, and why some parts should be rejected. But I will, if possible, give you, after your perusal of this, the general heads of what, from my little reading and observation, I think to be the most simple, and, consequently, the best plan of government. I am, Sir, yours, S Deane [P.S.] Two laws, I see, I have run over without noting upon: the one is, for punishing vagabonds, by setting them to hard labour. The other, for the punishment of theft, which you may think too light, but I think too severe; or, in other words, I would avoid infamous punishments, such as cropping, branding, whipping, &c., and substitute hard labour in their stead.

The Advices which they bring (amongst which is a Proclamation for suppressing Rebellion & Sedition) are of immense Service to [us]. Our Councils have been hitherto too fluctuating; one Day measures for carrying on the Ware was adopted, the next nothing must be done that would widen the unhappy Breech between G.

Had We at the opening of the Congress in May immediately taken proper Measures for carrying on the War with Vigor We might have been in Possession of all Canada undoubtedly & probably of Boston. Thank God the happy Day which I have long wished for is at length arrived. The southern Colonies no longer entertain Jealousies of the northern, they no longer look back to G.

Our Resolutions will henceforth be spirited, clear and decisive. May the supreme Govr. of the Universe direct & prosper them. The Pleasure which this Unanimity gives Me is inexpressible.

The Arguments on this Matter (being the first of the Kind as we had no Charter) were Truely Ciceronial, the eminent Speakers did honour to themselves and the Continent; Carried by a very great Majority.(1) The Power is ample and full, even to the Choice of governor, if the Colony should think it Necessary but that, we humbly Conceive worthy of Consideration. You'll See that the government is Limited to the Present Contest to ease the minds of Some few persons, who were fearful of Independance, we thott it Advisable not to oppose that part too much, for once we had taken, any Sort of government, nothing but Negotiation with Great Britain can Alter it. We would here beg leave to Suggest whether a government Somewhat Similar to the Massachusetts would not be best-a free Representation of the Province tho' not too many as they may be increased at any Time, but it would be hard to Diminish; those Representatives to Chose a Council, of proper number; Say 15; these two Branches to Act in all Cases whatever and not to Proceed so far as govenor at Present, tho' the Door may be left open for that purpose. We throw out these hints with great Submission to the Honbl. Convention. We think [we] can say (without boasting) [we] have done our duty in this matter, by paying constant Attention, for a long time, not only in the House but in Private Conversation with Members, to clear up any doubts they might have on this head.

Her Behaviour is easy and genteel. She avoids talking upon Politicks. In large and mixed Companies she is totally silent, as a Lady ought to be-but whether her Eyes are so penetrating and her Attention so quick, to the Words, Looks, Gestures, sentiments &c. of the Company, as yours would be, saucy as you are this Way, I wont say.

[1775] My Time is so little at my own Disposal that I am obligd to improve a Moment as I can catch it to write to a Friend. I wish I was at Liberty to communicate to you some of our Proceedings, but I am restraind, and though it is painful to me to keep Secrets from a few confidential Friends, I am resolvd that I will not violate my Honor. I may venture to tell you one of our Resolutions which in the Nature of it must be immediately made publick, and that is to recommend to our Sister Colony N Hampshire to exercise Government in such a form as they shall judge necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, during the Continuance of the present Contest with Britain. (1) This I would not have you mention abroad till you see it publishd or hear it publickly talkd of. The government of the N England Colonies I suppose will soon be nearly on the same Footing, and I am of opinion that it will not be long before every Colony will see the Necessity of setting up Government within themselves for Reasons that appear to me to be obvious.

932,dg002289,1775,Samuel Adams to James Warren,"""Samuel Adams to James Warren   My dear sir, Philada Nove 4th 1775 I thank you heartily for your very acceptable Letter of the 23 of October by Fessenden. It is very afflicting to hear the universal Complaint of the Want of that most necessary Article Gunpowder, and especially in the Camp before Boston. I hope however that this want will soon be supplied, and God grant that a good Use may be made of it. The Congress yesterday was presented with the Colors of the Seventh Regiment, taken in Fort Chamblee which is surrendered to Major Brown. The Acquisition of 124 Barrils of Powder gives a happy Turn to our Affairs in that Quarter the Success of which I almost began to despair of NOVEMBER 4, 1775  The Gentlemen who have lately returned from the Camp may, perhaps all of them entertain a favorable opinion of our Colony. I may possibly be partial in saying, not more favorable than it deserves. Be that as it may, the Congress have judgd it necessary to continue the Establishment of the Mens pay, and to enlarge that or the Captains & Leiutenants.(1) In Addition to the Continental Army four new Battalions are to be raisd viz three for the Defence of South Carolina and one for Georgia.(2) These with 1000 Men before orderd for North Carolina, with the Assistance of provincial Forces it is hoped will be sufficient to defend the three Southernmost Colonies. It is recommended to N Hampshire to form a Government to their own liking, during this Contest-and S Carolina is allowd to do the same if they judge it necessary.(3) I believe the Time is near when the most timid will see the absolute Necessity of every one of the Colo nies setting up a Government within itself. No Provisions or Produce is to be exported from any of the united Colonies to any part of the World till the first of March except for the Importation of the Unum necessarium (4) and for Supplys from one Colony to another, under the Direction of Committees, and a further Exception of live Stock under the last Head, and Horses are allowed to be sent to the foreign West Indies. We shall by the Spring know the full Effect of our Nonexportation Agreement in the West Indies. Perhaps Alliances may then be formed with foreign Powers, and Trade opened to all the World Great Britain excepted. You will possibly think I have set my self down to furnish a few Paragraphs for Edes & Gills paper, and what is more that I am betraying the Secrets of Congress. I confess I am giving my Friend as much Information as I dare, of things, which are of such a Nature as that they cannot long be kept secret, and therefore I suppose it never was intended they should be. I mention them however in Confidence that you will not publish them. I wish I was at Liberty to tell you many of the Transactions of our Body but I am restraind by the Ties of Honor, and though it is painful to me, you know, to keep Secrets, I will not violate my Honor to releive my self or gratify my Friend. (5) But why have I told you so trifling a Story, for which I cannot forgive my self till I have askd forgiveness of you. We live in a most important Age, which demands that every Moment should be improvd to some serious Purpose. It is the Age of George the Third; and to do Justice to our most gracious King, I will affirm it as my opinion, that his Councils and Administration will necessarily produce the grandest Revolutions the World has ever yet seen. The Wheels of Providence seem to be in their swiftest Motion; Events succeed each other so rapidly that the most industrious and able Politicians can scarcely improve them to the full purpose for which they seem to be designd.   You must send your best Men here; therefore recall me from this Service. Men of moderate Abilities, especially when weakend by Age are not fit to be employed in founding Empires. Let me talk with you a little about the Affairs of our own Colony. I perswade my self my dear friend, that the greatest Care and Circumspection will he used, to conduct its internal Police with Wisdom & Integrity. The Eyes of Mankind will be upon you, to see whether the Government, which is now more popular than it has been for many years past, will be productive of more Virtue moral and political. We may look up to Armies for our Defence, but Virtue is our best Security. It is not possible that any State should long continue free, where Virtue is not supremely honord. This is as seasonably as it is justly said by one of the most celebrated Writers of the present time. Perhaps the Form of Government now adopted may be permanent. Should it be only temporary, the golden opportunity of recovering the Virtue and reforming the Manners of our Country should be industriously improvd. Our Ancestors laid an excellent Foundation for the Security of Liberty, by setting up in a few years after their Arrival, a publick Seminary of Learning; and by their Laws, they obligd every Town consisting of a certain Number of Families to keep & maintain a Grammar School. I should be much grievd if it should be true as I am informd, that some of our Towns have dismissd their Schoolmasters, alledging that the extraordinary Expence of defending the Country renders them unable to support them. I hope this Inattention to the Principles of our wise forefathers does not prevail. If there should be any Danger of it, would not the leading Gentlemen do eminent Service to the Publick, by impressing upon the Minds of the People, the Necessity & Importance of encouraging that System of Education, which in my opinion, is so well calculated to diffuse among the Individuals of the Community, the Principles of Morality, so essentially necessary for the Preservation of publick Liberty. These are Virtues & Vices wch. are properly called political. \""Corruption, Dishonesty to ones Country, Luxury and Extravagance tend to the Ruin of States.\"" The opposite Virtues tend to their Establishment. But \""there is a Connection between Vices as well as Virtues, and one opens the Door for the Entrance of another.\"" Therefore \""Every able Politician will guard against other Vices,\"" and be attentive to promote every Virtue. He who is void of virtuous Attachment in private Life, is, or very soon will be void of all Regard to his Country. There is seldom an Instance of a Man guilty of betraying his Country, who had not before lost the feeling of moral Obligation in his private Connection. Before C-h was detected of holding a criminal Correspondence with the Enemies of his Country, his Infidelity to his Wife had been notorious. Since private & publick Vices,   though not always apparently, are in Reality so nearly connected, of how much Importance, how necessary is it, that the utmost pains be taken by the Publick to have the Principles of Virtue early inculcated on the Minds even of children, and the moral Sense universally kept alive, and that the wise Institutions of our Ancestors for those great Purposes be encouraged by the Government for no People will tamely surrender their Liberties, nor can they easily be subdued, where Knowledge is diffusd and Virtue preservd. On the Contrary, when People are universally ignorant & debauchd in their Manners, they will sink under their own Weight, without the Aid of foreign Invaders. There are other things which, I humbly conceive, require the most serious Consideration of the Legislative. We have heretofore complaind, and I think justly, that bad Men have too often found their Way into places of publick Trust. \""Nothing is more essential to the Establishment of Manners in a State, than that all Persons employd in Places of Power and Trust by Men of exemplary Characters. The Publick cannot be too curious concerning the Character of publick Men.\"" We have also complaind, that a Plurality of Places incompatible with each other have sometimes been vested in one Person. If under the former Administration there was no Danger to be apprehended from vesting the different Powers of Government in the same Persons, why did the Patriots so loudly protest against it? If Danger is always to be apprehended from it, Should we not by continuing the Practice, too much imitate the degenerate Romans, who upon the Fall of Julius set up Augustus. They changd indeed their Masters, and when they had destroyd the Tyrant sufferd the Tyranny to continue. Tell me how a Judge of Probate can consistently sit at the Council Board and joyn in a Decision there upon an Appeal from his own Judgment. Perhaps, being personally interested in another Appointment, I may view it with a partial Eye.(6) But you may well remember that the Secretary of the Colony declind taking a Seat at the Council Board, to which he had been elected prior to his Appointment, until, in the House of Representatives he had publickly requested their Opinion of the Propriety of it, and there heard it explicitly declared by an eminent and truly patriotick Member as his opinion, that as the Place was not then as it formerly had been, the Gift of the Crown but of the People, there was no Impropriety in his holding it. The rest of the Members were silent. Major H y [Joseph Hawley] has as much of the Stern Virtue and Spirit of a Roman Censor as any Gentleman I ever conversd with. The Appointment of the Secretary and his Election to a Seat at the Board were both made in the Time of his Absense from the Colony, and without the Solicitation of any of his Friends that he knew of- most assuredly without his own. As he is resolved never wittingly to   disgrace himself or his Country, he still employs his Mind on the Subject, and wishes for your candid and impartial Sentiments. I fear I have trespassd on your Leisure, and conclude with assuring you that I am with sincere Regards to Mrs Warren Your very affectionate Friend (7) S A ""

This however is an inconvenience, which must be Submitted to for the sake of Superiour Advantages. But I must take the Liberty to say, that I think We shall soon think of maritime affairs, and naval Preparations. No great Things are to be expected at first, but Out of a little a great deal may grow. It is very odd that I, who have Spent my days in researches and Employments so very different, and who have never thought much of old Ocean, or the Dominion of it, should be necessitated to make such Enquiries: But it is my fate, and my Duty, and therefore I must attempt it.(1) I am to enquire what Number of seamen may be found in our Province, who would probably inlist in the service, either as Marines, or on board of Armed Vessells, in the Pay of the Continent, or in the Pay of the Province, or on board of Privateers, fitted out by Private Adventurers.(2) I must also intreat you, to let me know the Names, Places of abode, and Characters, of such Persons belonging to any of the seaport Towns in our Province, who are qualified for officers and Commanders of Armed Vessells. I want to be further instructed, what ships, Brigantines, schooners &c are to be found in any Part of the Province, which are to be sold or hired out, which will be suitable for armed Vessells-what their Tonnage, the Depth of water they draw, their Breadth, their Decks, &c, and to whom they belong, and what is their Age. Further, what Places in our Province, are most secure and best accommodated for Building new Vessells, of Force in Case a Measure of that Kind Should be thought of. The Committee have returned, much pleased with what they have seen and heard, which shews that their Embassy will be productive of happy Effects. They say the only disagreeable Circumstance was that their Engagements, Haste, and constant Attention to Business was such as prevented them from forming such Acquaintances with the Gentlemen of our Province as they wished. But as Congress was waiting for their Return before they could determine upon Affairs of the last Moment, they had not Time to spare. They are pretty well convinced I believe of several important Points, which they and others doubted before. NOVEMBER 5, 1775  New Hampshire has leave to assume a Government and so has South Carolina but this must not be freely talked of as yet, at least from me. New England will now be able to exert her strength which a little Time will shew to be greater than either Great Britain or America imagines. I give you Joy of the agreable Prospect in Canada. We have the Colors of the seventh Regiment as the first fruits of Victory. ""

Their Return has contributed much to Harmony and Unanimity, in all smaller Matters, in the great material Questions there was enough of them before. I am under great obligations to you for your Attention to me. Shall answer your Letters as soon as time will admit, but I assure you, I am very busy. I am obliged to trouble you with Enquiries concerning Subjects which you understand very well and I know nothing of. I want to know what is become of the Whalemen, Codfishers, and other Seamen belonging to our Province and what Number of them you imagine might be inlisted into the Service of the Continent, or of the Province, or of private Adventurers, in Case a Taste for Privateering and a maritime Warfare should prevail. Whether you think that two or three Battalions of Marines could be easily inlisted in our Province. What Ships, Brigantines, Schooners, suitable for armed Vessells might be purchased or hired, and at what Prices in our Province, what their Burthen, Depth of Water, Length of Keel, Breadth, hight between Decks, Age &c and to whom they belong. What Places are most suitable that is safest and best accommodated for building new Vessells, if any should be wanted-and what shipwrights may be had, and in what Time Vessells compleated. But above all, what Persons, their Names, Ages, Places of abode and Characters, may be found in our Province who might be qualified to serve as Commanders and officers &c.(1) These are necessary Enquiries, and I am very ill qualified to make NOVEMBER 5, 1775  them, yet to tell you a secret in Confidence, it has become my Duty. There is a Disposition prevailing to spare no Pains or Expence in the necessary Defence of our Rights by Sea or Land. The News you will see in the Papers, give you Joy of the good Prospect to the Northward. New Hampshire has Permission to establish what Form of Government they like best, and so has S. Carolina and so will every other Colony which shall ask for it which they all will do soon, if the Squabble continues. New England will now be able to exert her Strength and if I ken it right, it will be found to be that of a full grown Man, no Infant. Who expected to live to see the Principles of Liberty Spread and prevail so rapidly, human Nature exerting her whole Rights, unshackled by Priests or Kings or Nobles, pulling down Tyrannies like Sampson, and building up, what Governments the People think best framed for human Felicity. God grant the Spirit, success. My best Respects to your good Lady, will write her as soon as possible. ""

We have Specimens of exceeding fine Petre brought us here from many parts of this Colony, New Jersey & other places & nothing is clearer than that numbers of People in different places are able to make it. The grand Matter is to propagate the making it in large Quantitys. I was in great expectation that the Resolves of the Congress on this Subject would have produced good Effects in the Tobacco Colonies, but on Enquiry I find that the Convention of Virginia did not take any steps to carry it into Execution (having many  NOVEMBER 6, 1775  Matters before them). Maryland voted a Sum of money but appointed no operators. The Congress very justly alarmed at the astonishing inattention of the Colonies to this most essential Matter, have Appointed Another Comittee to devise Ways & Means to promote this Manufacture.(2) I have the honour to be one of this Cmttee, & great pains have we taken about it, we have not yet determined how, but we have under Consideration to send certain Germans who are here, & who have given Specimens of their skill, into the Tobacco Colonies to carry on the manufacture there. The great Works of this City have made no Salt petre valuable, the House of Assembly of this Colony have the matter under Consideration. I hope Something Great will be done in New England-& this Sr. brings me to what I have principally in veiw in writing Vizt. there Laying a foundation for a great quantity of Salt petre next Spring. There are two matters to be attended to forthwith, the first is to Search out & work up all the impregnated Materials that are now on hand or to be found & At the Same time to provide mix & duly dispose suitable materials for impregnation in as large quantitys as possible. I hope this matter is not neglected-immediate Care must be taken-sheds must be prepared over dry Land & the Materials must not be put very thick if made in Beds under Sheds, for if they are thick or deep the Air will not impregnate it through. It is generally thought best that the Stuff should be made into Walls or fences as they call them, some such are made in this city & they talk much of making many here. An easy method of making these fences is this. Let the Stuff be properly mixed Sc Cut Straw be mixed with it to make it stick together, then let your Walls be made about 15 or 18 inches at bottom, abt. 5 feet high & tapering to the top to about 4 or 5 inches thick in Order to make it Stand while forming let peices of Joyce or Poles be cut of a Suitable length & set in this Manner with the ends on the Ground & little Stakes Stuck against the ends into the Ground. A number of Such pairs of Joyce must be set at convenient distance ranging as you intend the Wall shall go, rough boards are to be put on the inside of these Joyce frames so that when the dirt is put between them it may be kept up & so as you raise your Dirt you put more hoards till you get to the Top, ramming the Dirt as you go along Sufficient to keep it from falling & yet not so hard as to prevent the Air from entering. These Walls should be covered with boards or straw so as to prevent the Rains from washing the sides. The Germans I have consulted on this Matter are of Opinion that if proper Materials are now put up in a judicious manner they will be so impregnated in 6 months as to yeild largely. Therefore at all events Materials must be forwith provided in as large a manner as possible. Sr. it [is] my opinion that unless we exert our selves in this Mat-  ter & have some tollerable Success it is very uncertain whether every thing else we can do will Avail as much, & if we are successful in this matter in my Opinion every thing else favourable will come of Course. I hope you Correspond with yr Brethren of the Salt petre Cmttee & also with other well disposed Active Salt petre Makers in any place that you know of, spurring them on to lay up proper materials in a proper manner. Pray shew this to Major Hawley, Mr. Gerry & other persons who are desirous to promote this matter. Give my Regards to all Friends. The Express is waiting & I must Subscribe yr. friend & hble Sert.

Novr 7th 1775 My last Letter to you I Sent by young Mr Gawen Brown who left this place about a fortnight ago. I know not how many I have written. I wish you would send me the Dates of those you have receivd in your next. My Son informs me in a late Letter, that you were about removing to little Cambridge. I am exceedingly pleasd with it, because I am sure you could not be comfortable in your house at Dedham in the cold Season. When we shall return to our Habitation in Boston, if ever, is uncertain. The Barbarity of our Enemies in the Desolations they have wantonly made at Falmouth and elsewhere, is a Presage of what will probably befall that Town which has so long endur'd the Rage of a merciless Tyrant. It has disgraced the Name of Britain, and added to the Character of the Ministry, another indelible Mark of Infamy. We must be content to suffer the Loss of all things in this Life, rather than tamely surrender the publick Liberty. The Eyes of the People of Britain seem to be fast closed; if they should ever be opened they will rejoyce, and thank the Americans for resisting a Tyranny which is manifestly intended to overwhelm them and the whole British Empire. Righteous Heaven will surely smile on a Cause so righteous as ours is, and our Country, if it does its Duty will see an End to its oppressions. Whether I shall live to rejoyce with the Friends of Liberty and Virtue, my fellow Laborers in the Common Cause, is a Matter of no Consequence. I will endeavor by Gods Assistance, to act my little part well-to approve my self to Him, and trust every thing which concerns me to his all-gracious Providence. The Newspapers will give you an Account of the Surrender of the Garrison at Fort Chambly to Major Brown of the Massachusetts. The Colors of the 7th Regiment were taken there and were brought to the Congress on Fryday last. I wrote to my Daughter not long ago. I hope she has receivd the Letter.

I was informed no letter was suffered to go in till its contents had been examined by a committee, and that letters wrote by persons they thought disaffected, were sometimes stopped, though the contents were only business or compliments. Under the circumstances, I thought it prudent to open your letter, and put it under cover to Gen. Washington, at the same time requesting the favor of him, after he had read its contents, to send it into Boston, and to permit an answer to return the same way. I have not yet received an answer from him, but am in hopes it will not be long before I have that honor.(1) I could think of no better way to get you an answer from the Commissioners. If I have done wrong I must rely on your goodness to excuse it. I can say but little on the score of politics-the present appearance is much against us and our cause. We have had no accounts from England later than the 26th of August. We are told our Petition will be disregarded; that we shall be declared rebels, and our estates confiscated; we are threatened with ships of war, troops, Russians, Hanoverians and Hessians. God knows how it will end. Some officers from Gen. Gage's army have been detected in enlisting men in the Province of New York to go to Boston; some of these recruits have been examined on oath, and declared that each of them was promised two hundred acres of land, not in the woods, but cleared cultivated land with houses thereon, that they were to be put in possession at the end of the war, when the rebels were subdued,  NOVEMBER 9, 1775  which they were taught to believe would soon happen. We are in daily expectation of further intelligence from England, several vessels being expected here; the last ships that have arrived brought the king's proclamation. You will see it in the newspapers; it is remarkable those ships brought very few letters from private persons-it would seem as if the proclamation had deterred our friends from writing on the subject of politics.

We expect it dayly and are Anxious for its Arival.(1) I hope you have fallen on some method to furnish your Soldiers with Arms and Amunition, those Articles are very scarse throughout all the Colonies.(2) I find on enquiry that neither can be got here, all the Gunsmiths in this Province are engaged and cannot make Arms near so fast as they are wanted. Powder is also very Scarse notwithstanding every effort seems to have been exerted both to make and import. The Congress exert every Nerve to put the Colonies into a proper state of defence, four Regiments are ordered to be raised on Continental Pay for the defence of South Carolina and Georgia.(3) It is expected the two Regiments with you will be continued and kept up the same as other parts of the Army. One Regiment is now raising in this Province and Two in New Jersey on the same establishment. Twenty thousand Men are to be kept up near Boston and Five thousand on the Lakes, Canada &c, The whole Army to be enlisted to the 31st of December 1776 unless discharged sooner by Order of Congress. The Pay of the Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns is increased, they are now allowed as follows, a Captain 26 2/3 Dollars, a Lieutenant 18 Dollars, an Ensign 13 1/3 Dollars per Calendar month. The Rations allowed the Soldiers thro' the whole Army you have as follows, One pound of Beef or 3/4 lb of Pork, or 1 lb of Salt Fish per day each Man. NOVEMBER 9, 1775  1 lb of bread or Flour. 3 pints of Peas or Beans per Week or Vegetables in proportion, rating Peas or Beans at 6/ per Bushel. 1 pint of milk per man per day or at the rate of 1/72 of a Dollar per pint. 1/2 pint of Rice, or one pint of Indian meal per man per week. One quart of Spruce Beer or Cyder per man, or 9 gallons of Molasses per Company of 100 Men per week. 3 lb. of Candles to 100 men per week for guards. 24 lb of Soft Soap or 8 lb. hard Soap for 100 men per Week.(4) I doubt not you will find it Necessary to come into a new agreement with your Commissaries, for it will be but Just and right to give your Soldiers the same allowance that is given to those in other places. It is also recommended that all the Soldiers be put into some Uniform, that the Public purchase the Cloth and have it made up and that it be discounted out of each Mans Pay, at the rate of 10/ per month. The Soldiers near Boston we are told are well pleased with this regulation. Several other matters which together with some Ships and Vessels that are fitting out at the Charge of the Continent will enhance our expences amazingly, by which you may Judge we have but little expectation of a reconciliation.

But since this document is clearly in Duane's hand it is unlikely that Brattle would have forwarded it to Tryon with a covering note ascribing it to Yates, unless perhaps a third person was a party to Brattle's activities, and added a hastily written endorsement with an attribution prompted by the appearance of Yates' name on the document. In any event, Tryon forwarded NOVEMBER 9, 1775  the FC in a letter of December 7 to the Earl of Dartmouth. See PRO: C.O. 5, 1107:11, 29.

I had seen Governor Trumbull, who shewed me your first Letter, in which you mentiond that 500 of Hinmans were to proceed to Canada. I told him that Colo Dyer had misinformed that I said that I did not imagine, there were more than two or three Hundred Men of Hinmans who were there, properly armed & ready for Service; and being asked where the Rest were, I answered I did not know any thing about them, only that they were not at the Camp, & told the Govr further that I was glad to hear so many had joined the Army since I left it, so that I went farther in my Guess than I find by your Letter was fact.(1) I am very sorry to find they fell so short of your & general Montgomery's opinion on the Article of Courage. I pity, from my soul, that brave gentleman, his Feelings must have [been] truely acute when he saw them running away from themselves.

Monckton hath nobly refused said he would never engage in such an infamous Cause. Orders are given to open all Letters at the post Offices & stop such as contain any American Intelligence. The People disapprove the Introduction of foreign Troops; the Parliament setts 26th Octr., Ministry was collecting its Forces to carry every Measure with a high hand. Opposition was rallying its Friends in Order to make a vigorous Stand. A Letter from a Gentn. of high Character whose Intelligence hath ever been good says that Ministry was putting Arms into the Hands of all who would receive them, English, scotch, irish, roman catholics, Hessians, Hanoverians &c, and that fifty Men of War are to destroy all our maritime Towns & interdict our Trade. If Administration succeeds they are determined another Letter says to extirpate the New England Colonies. An Army from Canada & the 20000 men from England they suppose capable of doing this, these Threats will not intimidate one brave Man but animate all in their Country's Cause and blessed be God We are in his all gracious Hands & not in those of a Ministry fit to serve a Nero only. To Be or not to be is now the Question; every private View, Passion & Interest ought to be buried. We are embarked in one common Bottom. If She sinks We all perish; if She survives the Storm, Peace & Plenty (the offspring of Liberty) and every thing which will dignify & felicitate human Nature will be the Reward of our Virtue. Oh my Brother This is not the Cause of the Colonies & of Britain only but of human Nature itself, and that God who is the Author of Nature, the Friend of Mankind and who hath so remarkably preserved & prospered these Colonies will still continue his all gracious Protection to which I most devoutly recommend You, my Friends & my Country.

The floor of a meeting House being taken up, the Earth under it produced one pound from Every Bushel; under Barns stables &c much more.

Indeed the hurry of business is such here with many of us, that we have little time for the ordinary offices of life. You may be assured that I will do Colo. Read [Reed] all the service that I can in the way you desire(1)l We have a Ship here in 6 weeks from London, that brought the original letter of which the inclosed is a copy.(2) Tis from a well informed, sensible friend, and may be relyed on. All the other letters from London join in confirming it to be the fixt determination of K and Court to leave undone nothing that they can do, to compel implicit obedience in America. One very sensible letter that I have seen, mentions that Gen. Amherst had recommended (& 'twas said it would be executed) to remove the Army this winter from Boston to Long Island, in order to get amply supplied by ravaging N. Jersey, N. York, and Rhode Island. Should this NOVEMBER 13, 1775  be attempted, I suppose you will be furnished with an opportunity of giving them a genteel parting salute. And besides, I should suppose that a winter favorable for us, would expose them to ruin from a timely, strong attack, of superior numbers on that naked Island. It seems that immense stores of Indian goods are sent to Canada in order to bribe the Indians to an early and vigorous attack on all our frontiers next Spring. God grant that Colo. Arnolds success and Montgomeries may frustrate this diabolical part of their infernal plan against the common natural rights of Mankindl We hoped here that the surrender of Chamble, with the military stores there obtained, would speedily procure the reduction of St. Johns, but no accounts are yet come of this wished event. After Lord Dunmore, supported by the North British Tories, had long committed every outrage at Norfolk unopposed, our people not having Arms or ammunition until lately; his Banditti at length attempted Hampton, where they met with the chastisement you will see described in the part of Dixons paper inclosed.(3) The Lieutenant Wright there mentioned has been since found dead on the Shore, a bullet having been placed in his body before he jumpt over board. We have not yet heard the consequence of their next intended attack, but it seems a very heavy Cannonade was heared there the next day. If the Devil inspired them to come on shore, I make no doubt but we shall have a good account of them. I have a very particular reason for entreating that you will inform me by return of Post, what number, and what strength of Armed Vessels could possibly be procured from the ports where you are, to be in Delaware Bay, if Congress should desire it by the middle or last of December at furthest. Two or 3 Vessels of tolerable force, issuing from hence, may affect a stroke or two of great consequence to us at that Season. We have certainly 4000 weight of powder, and a very considerable quantity of Oznaburgs arrived in Virginia from Statia for the use of our little Army consisting of about 2000 men now at Williamsburg & Hampton. Be pleased to let Gen. Lee see the letter from England. I heartily wish you every happiness and all the success the goodness of your cause deserves & I am, with great esteem dear Sir Your affect. friend and obedient Servant. Richard Henry Lee [P.S.] Congress has ordered 500,000 dollars to you soon as they can be signed.(4) The Continental and Virginia Commissioners have just concluded a treaty of firm friendship with the Ohio Indians and those of the Six Nations that inhabit near that Quarter. We have taken the most effectual measures, by sending Runners from all the Southern provinces into the Indian Nations thro which he proposes to pass to arrest and secure Ld.

I am sure Mr Chew is so heartily disposed to oblige you and to serve the Cause, that nothing in his Power will be wanting. I fear however that you will be sometime in want of your Secretary, as I did not find him in hast to return when I mentioned to him what is just now related. He doubtless has many private affairs to transact. The Loss must be greatly increased by Mr Randolphs absence who I hear came to Town last Night. I am happy to inform you that Congress has agreed to every Recommendation of the Committee and have gone beyond it in allowing the additional pay to the officers.(2) I rejoice at this but cant think with Patience that pityfull wretches who stood cavilling with you when entreated to serve the next Campaign shoud reap the Benefit of this addition. They will now be ready enough but hope you will be able to refuse them with the Contempt they deserve and to find better in their Rooms. Coud not some of the Gentlemen at Camp inlist the New England Men who have been perswaded to leave you, Frazier told me he coud. It woud be a Capital Point to convince the World that it is not necessary to have bad Officers of that Country in order to raise Men there. I can scarce bear their Tyranny. I have a Letter from undoubted authority that assures me, that the Destruction of the Parliamentary Army in America will certainly produce Peace and by another that the Seizing Quebec will produce the same Effect. I have no doubt America stands now indebted to NOVEMBER 13, 1775  her General for the One & will before the Return of Spring for the other. Mistake me not, I have not altered my mind a jot since I left you. I mean not to anticipate your Determinations, but only to approve your Design to hover like an Eagle over your Prey, always ready to Pounce [on] it when the proper Time comes; I have not forgot your Proposition relative to that City; I try to pave the way for it, and wait for the Season as you do.(3) No appearance of Peace unless produced by necessity on the part of the Enemy, every human feeling seems to have forsaken them. Fear and Interest only are listened to. We hear Seven Tonns of Powder are arrived at Rhode Island & as many at Portsmouth, I hope tis true as it will possess us of advantagious grounds & begin the Enemys Destruction. It is suspected in England Howes Army will give you the slip [and] land at Long Island; which God of his infinite mercy grant. We wait with impatience to hear of the total reduction of Canada. Your Virginians we hear have drubbed L [ord] D [unmore], killed & took 50 Men and sank one of his Vessells. May all such Vilains so perish. A Mr. Richd.

His Brother boards Miss Willing on them. The Articles of War has all the amendments as reported.(4) You will inforce them. You will not now suffer your Officers to sweep the Parade [with] the Skirts of their Coats or bottoms of their Trowsers, to cheat or to mess with their Men, to skulk in battle or sneak in Quarters. In short being now paid they must do their Duty & look as well as act like Gentlemen. Do not bate them an Ace, my Dear General, but depend on every Support of your Friends here. I have strove to keep two Battallions now raising in the Jerseys and one here quite disengaged that they may be ready on a call to join you, shoud those you have desert you. I have not been quite unsuccesful.(5) The Winter is our own, Boston will not during that season be reinforced; at least we have reason to think so. I want the Return I desired from Gates exceedingly.

Mr. Leach Said, he Still refused to Sign it, & told the Commissary that he would complain to Congress: but after Some further altercation he told Mr. Livingstone that for one half the extra Sum he would Sign the receipt, which was complied with and the articles of his account altered to correspond with the receipt. Flour was altered from 16/6 to 18/ per Ct., the price of Peas increased to 9d per Bushel and 3d added to the price of each flour Barrel. Mr. Leach mentioned at the Same time another Instance wherein Mr. Livingstone demanded & took a receipt for £8 more than he paid for Some Service done for the public that amounted to about £50.

I should often write to You but I am often engaged in Committes Morning & Evening that my Time is so taken up that I cannot indulge myself the Pleasure of writing to you & my other Children so often as I wish. Mr. Greene gave me some Encouragement that he would write to me, a good long Letter would be very acceptable and I shall probably stay here long enough to give you both Opportunities of writing to me. Some Gentlemen think We may at Christmas adjourn until Spring, others think We must sett the whole Winter, affairs grow every Day more serious. May divine Wisdom direct all our Measures. By the last Ships We have Letters of 9th & 10th Sepr. They all agree in this that the Administration is determined to push their Measures at all Events. One Letter says the King in a Conference whicll he lately had with a Person of Rank told him that he was unalterably determined let the Consequence be what it would to reduce the Colonies to absolute Obedience. For this Purpose 50 sail of Men of War & 20000 land Forces are to be sent over in the Spring, our maritime Towns to be destroyed & all Commerce interdicted. In one Word those Wicked Madmen are calling not upon Heaven but upon every other Power to assist them in destroying Us. There is now and then a timid Wretch who is frightend with these terrible Denunciations of Vengeance but I have the vast Pleasure to see that instead of intimidating they highly animate, instead of dividing they most strongly unite the People in general and the Congress in particular. We are now all or very nearly all of one Mind, the only Question is  NOVEMBER 13, 1775  how We shall best defend all Parts of the Continent & most effectually distress and annoy our Enemies. Many very important Plans are under Consideration, others will be taken into consideration very soon and from the Spirit with which Measures are now planned & pursued I have no Doubt but by the divine Blessing We shall be able to reduce our Enemies to Reason and establish the Rights and Liberties of this Country upon an equitable advantageous & permanent Basis. What Fortifications you have at Greenwich I dont know but I wish if they are not sufficient to defend (2) the Town that the People would immediately erect such Works as will defend it against the most savage Enemies for such under the sacred name of Christians the once glorious Name of Englishmen & the endearing Appellation of Brethren We have now to fight. Many Measures are taken by Congress to get a sufficient Quantity of Powder but I fear some of them may fail. The Want of that Article alone may ruin Us; every Measure therefore ought to be taken to obtain it. I hope Mr. Greene & the Com[pan] y may be able in the Course of this Winter to serve the Country in this important Matter without Injury to their private Fortunes. The General Assembly is authorized by Congress to send out Vessels loaded with any produce except horned Cattle, Sheep, hogs & poultry to the foreign West Indies for Powder. If the Comp[an]y has a swift small Vessel I doubt not but the Depys Govr. would employ them, or if they have Cash or good Bills they may send on their own Acct. for Powder, they cant export produce unless on the Colonys Acct. I wish Mr. Greene may acquaint your Uncle Greene & the People of Greenwich that every Expectation of an Accommodation is entirely over that our only Safety is under God in a brave Defence of our Lives & Property that they may take every possible Measure for their Defence. Happily We have this Winter to prepare in, the Prize for which We are contending is every thing dear to human Nature, no Time is to be lost, may Heaven direct & prosper us all.

These ought to be expected, and prepared for by every Man concerned in the Conduct of our Councils or Arms. I hope the Generals will act with Discernment and Integrity in Seperating those officers who are to be discharged from the rest. But the Reduction of the Regiments cannot be avoided. Our Province had so many more officers than other Colonies in Proportion to their Number of Men, that altho the Congress excused it for the Time passed, in Consideration of the Confusion and Distress of our affairs when the Troops were raised, yet they will not consent that the Inconvenience should continue, now there is Leisure to correct the Error. I am much concerned at Times on Account of the Pay of the Privates. It is thought here to be very exorbitant-and many Gentlemen are under great Concern about the Consequences. The Expence of the War will accumulate upon the Colonies a Debt, like that of our Enemies. And we have no Funds out of which even the Interest can he paid and our People are not used to Taxes upon the Luxuries much less upon the Conveniences and Necessaries of Life.

I lament the Dishonour which falls upon the Colony by the mean, mercenary Conduct of some of her Servants. But in all Events I hope no Instance of Fraud or Peculation will be overlooked, but Strictly and impartially punished, untill every Rascall is banished from the Army, whatever Colony may have given him Existence. It behoves the Congress, it behoves the Army to Shew that nothing but a rigid inflexible Virtue, and a Spotless Purity Character, can preserve or acquire any Employment. Virtue, my young Friend, Virtue alone is or can be the Foundation of our new Governments, and it must be encouraged by Rewards, in every Department civil and military. Your Account of the Drs. Defence at the Bar of the House is very entertaining.(2) I should have formed no Idea of that Hearing if you had not obliged me, with an Account. I think with the Candid, that Contempt is due to him for his Timidity and Duplicity. But I cannot wholly acquit him of something worse. He mentions in his Letter his having in a former Letter given his Correspondent a Hint of the Design against Bunkers Hill. Now I never can be clearly freed from Jealousy, untill I see that Letter. The Hint he mentions might [have] occasioned [our?] Loss of that Post, and of all the Li[ves] which were destroyed on the 17th of June. However I have hitherto kept my Mind in Suspense.

I had yesterday the pleasure of your letter of the 4th inst. by Captain Price, for which, as well as a former kind letter, I heartily thank you.(1) The report you mention, that Congress have resolved upon a free trade, is so far from being true that you must have seen by the public papers before now that they have resolved to stop all trade untill next March. What will be done then time will discover. This winter I hope will be improved in preparing some kind of defence for trade. I hope the Colonies will do this separately. But these subjects are too important and intricate to be discussed in a narrow compass, and too delicate to be committed to a private letter. The report that Congress has resolved to have no more connections, &c., untill they shall be indemnified, for the damages done by the tyranny of their enemies, will not be true perhaps so soon as some expect it. Verbal resolutions accomplish nothing. It is to no purpose to declare what we will or will not do in future times. Let reasoning Men infer what we shall do from what we actually do. The late conduct, in burning towns, so disgracefull to the English name and character, would justify anything, but similar barbarity. Let us preserve our temper, our wisdom, our humanity and civility, though our enemies are every day renouncing theirs. But let us omit nothing necessary for the security of our cause. You are anxious for Arnold. So are we, and for Montgomery too, untill this day, when an express has brought us the refreshing news of the capitulation of St. Johns-for Arnold I am anxious still-God  NOVEMBER 14, 1775  grant him success.

981,dg002338,1775,John Adams to Richard Henry Lee,"""John Adams to Richard Henry Lee   Dear Sir Philadelphia Novr 15th. 1775 The Course of Events, naturally turns the Thoughts of Gentlemen to the Subjects of Legislation and Jurisprudence, and it is a curious Problem what Form of Government, is most readily & easily adopted by a Colony upon a Sudden Emergency. Nature and Experience have already pointed out the Solution of this Problem, in the Choice of Conventions and Committees of Safety. Nothing is wanting in Addition to these to make a compleat Government, but the Appointment of Magistrates for the due Administration of Justice. Taking Nature and Experience for my Guide I have made the following Sketch, (1) which may be varied in any one particular an infinite Number of Ways, So as to accommodate it to the different Genius, Temper, Principles and even Prejudices of different People. A Legislative, an Executive and a judicial Power, comprehend the whole of what is meant and understood by Government. It is by ballancing each one of these Powers against the other two, that the Effort in human Nature towards Tyranny can alone be checked and restrained and any degree of Freedom preserved in the Constitution. Let a full and free Representation of the People be chosen for an House of Commons. Let the House choose by Ballott twelve, Sixteen, Twenty four or Twenty Eight Persons, either Members of the House, or from the People at large as the Elections please, for a Council. Let the House and Council by joint Ballott choose a Governor, annually, triennially or Septennially as you will. NOVEMBER 15, 1775  Let the Governor, Council, and House be each a distinct and independant Branch of the Legislature, and have a Negative on all Laws. Let the Lt. Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, Commissary, Attorney General and Solicitor General, be chosen annually, by joint Ballott of both Houses. Let the Governor with Seven Councillors be a Quorum. Let all officers and Magistrates, civil and military, be nominated and appointed by the Governor, by and with the Advice and Consent of his Council. Let no officer be appointed but at a General Council, and let Notice be given to all the Councillors, Seven days at least before a General Council. Let the Judges, at least of the Supreme Court, be incapacitated by Law from holding any share of the Legislative or Executive Power, Let their Commissions be during good Behaviour, and their Salaries ascertained and established by Law. Let the Governor have the Command of the Army, the Militia Forts &c. Let the Colony have a Seal and affix it to all Commissions. In this Way a Single Month is Sufficient without the least Convulsion or even Animosity to accomplish a total Revolution in the Government of a Colony. If it is thought more beneficial a Law may be made by this new Legislature leaving to the People at large the Priviledge of choosing their Governor, and Councillors annually, as soon as affairs get into a more quiet Course. In Adopting a Plan, in some Respects Similar to this, human Nature would appear in its proper Glory asserting its own moral Dignity, pulling down Tyrannies, at a single Exertion and erecting Such new Fabricks, as it thinks best calculated to promote its Happiness. As you was the last Evening polite enough to ask me for this Model, if such a Trifle will be of any service to you, or any gratification of Curiosity, here you have it, from, sir your Friend and humble servant John Adams ""

982,dg002339,1775,John Adams to Samuel Osgood,"""John Adams to Samuel Osgood   Sir Novr. 15.1775 The true Cause why General Frie has not recd from me, any particular Intelligence, is that the Matter has been hitherto Suspended, and that I am under Such Engagements of Secrecy, that I could not in Honour acquaint him with any Thing that has pass'd in Congress.(1) As Soon as I arrived in Philadelphia, I made it my Business to introduce General Fries Name and Character into Conversation in every private Company where it could be done with Propriety, and to make his long services and Experience known. But I found an Interest making in private Circles in Favour of Coll. Armstrong of Pensilvania, a Gentleman of Character, and Experience in War, a Presbyterian in Religion, whose Name runs high for Piety, Virtue and Valour. What has been done in Congress I must be excused from Saying, but nothing in my Power has been omitted, to promote the Wishes of our Colony or the Honour and Interest of General Frie. It is Sufficient to say, that nothing has as yet been determined. But it will be settled soon. And let it be decided as it may, every good American will acquiese in the Decision. New England, as you justly observe is the Nursery of brave and hardy Men, and has hitherto Stemmed the Torrent of Tyranny, and must continue to do it, but the other Colonies are making rapid Advances in the military Art, and We must be cautious that we dont hold our own Heads too high, and hold up invidious Distinctions. The other Colonies are capable of furnishing good Soldiers, and they Spare no Pains to emulate New England herself. You observe that no Tory Province has been So contemned as ours There may be some ground of Complaint, but have not our People aimed at more Respect than was their due? No other Colony I am fully sensible could have borne the shock as ours has done and it is possible that this Circumstance may have made our People expect more than their due. It is certainly true that some of our Southern Brethren have not annexed the Same Ideas to the Words Liberty, Honour and Politeness that we have; but I have the Pleasure to observe every day that We learn to think and feel alike more and more. I am Sorry that the Committee did not dine with General Ward, but am convinced there was no unfriendly Design. The Gentlemen politely told me that the only disagreable Circumstance in their Journey was that they had not Time to cultivate an Acquaintance with Gentlemen in Camp and at Watertown, as they earnestly wished. Am very Sorry for General Wards ill State of Health, and that this has made him entertain Thoughts of resigning. I cannot think that the Acceptance of the Invitation from the Connecticutt officers, was NOVEMBER 15, 1775  pointed, or intended as a Slight to General Wards. Perhaps the Connecticutt gentn. might send a Card, which General Ward might omit -or it might be mere Inadvertence or Accident. A Card is an Engine of vast Importance in this World. But even if it was designed it is not worth regarding. These Little things are below the Dignity of our glorious Cause, which is the best and greatest that ever engaged the human Mind. It has been an inexpressible Mortification to me, to observe in So many Instances, the attentions of Gentlemen in high Departments both civil and military, to the little Circumstances of Rank and Ceremony; when their Minds and Hearts ought to have been occupied, by the greatest objects on this side of Heaven. I have been sufficiently plagued with these Frivolisms myself, but I despise them all, and I dont much revere any Man who regards them. I wish you to write me often and with Freedom. But you must not be too punctilious in waiting for my answers for I assure you I have more things to do than I am fit for, if I had three Hours where I have one. I am &c John Adams [P.S.] Your first Letter to me is now before me. ""

He seems in a great Degree to have recoverd his Health, and I dare say it will be still more satisfactory to you to find, that he is warmly attachd to the Rights of his Country and of Mankind. Give me Leave to congratulate you, and also to express to you the Joy I NOVEMBER 16, 1775  feel on another Occasion; which is, that your own Health is so far restord to you, as to enable you again, and at so important a Crisis, to aid our Country with your Council.

I thank God who has disappointed our Fears; and it is my ardent Prayer that your Health may be perfectly restord and your eminent Usefulness long continued. We live my dear Sir, in an important Age-An Age in which we are called to struggle hard in Support of the publick Liberty. The Conflict, I am satisfied, will the next Spring be more severe than ever The Petition of Congress has been treated with insolent Contempt. I cannot conceive that there is any room to hope from the virtuous Efforts of the People of Britain. They seem to be generally unprincipled and fitted for the Yoke of arbitrary Power. The opposition of the few is feeble and languid-while the Tyrant is flushd with Expectations from his Fleets and Armies, and has, I am told, explicitly declared, that, \""Let the Consequences be what they may, it is his unalterable Determination, to compel the Colonists to absolute Obedience.\"" The Plan of the British Court, as I was well informed the last Winter, was to take Possession of New York, make themselves masters of Hudsons River and the Lakes, cut off all Communication between the Northern and Southern Colonies, and employ the Canadians upon whom they greatly relyd, in distressing the Frontiers of New England. Providence has smiled upon our Northern Expedition. Already St Johns is reducd, and if we gain the Possession of all Canada this Winter, of which there is a fair Prospect, Their Design, so far as it respects this Part of their Plan, will be totally frustrated.

They also brought Letters for a number of Persons inimical to our cause; many of these Letters have been opened by the Committee of Safety by which we find the Ministry are determined to carry on the War against American Rebels with the utmost Vigor. I saw a Letter from a Member of Parliament to Docr. Franklin mentioning that Gen. Haldiman had been Closeted by the King who was very particular in his enquiry what sort of people the Americans were, how did they Collect an Army together, how furnish them with arms & amunition, how Cloath, pay & Victual them &c. To these and a great number of questions of the like kind he received such Answers as gave him great uneasiness. It seems the Reduction of America is a favourite plan of his own; he has declared he will pawn all the Jewels of his Crown in order to effect it. You will see by the papers our Troops have taken Fort Chamblee and St. Johns in Canada. We expect Montreal & Quebec are ours by this time. Some of the late Letters from London mention a Number (say 5000) of Troops will be immediately sent to make a diversion in the Southern Colonies. From all the Accounts I have seen I think it would be very imprudent to discharge any of NOVEMBER 16, 1775  your Soldiers, Congress seems to be very well satisfied that they are raised. There are no Arms nor any Powder to be got here. You may be supplied with some Powder from South Carolina, Arms you must get in your own Province if possible.

The judicious and decisive Conduct of the General Assembly does great Honor to the Colony. I had that Part of your Letter containing those Proceedings read in Congress; they were highly approved.(1) Mr. Adams, Colo.  NOVEMBER 16, 1775  Dyre & others observed afterwards to me that We had sett them all a noble Example. I hope Mr. Cooke is in the Chair before this Time, present my most affectionate & respectful Congratulations upon the Occasion. I hope some Gentleman who is a zealous Friend to the Liberties of his Country and who hath Sense & Spirit enough to see and pursue her true Interests at all Hazards supplies his Place. I could have wished that the Colony instead of another Emission had directed Us to apply to Congress for the Sum wanted though the Accts. were not ready.(2) Connecticut did so & obtained it and We should without Doubt have been allowed what We wanted. I fear too great a Flood of Bills may affect their Credit and of all things We should be most careful to keep up the Credit of our Money. While that is done We can raise any Supplies for the common Defense, without it We should be vastly embarrassed. The Gentn. who may attend with the Accts. of the Comee. of Safety I shall be most heartily glad to see and they may spend their Time here very agreably but I must confess I can have no Idea of the Accts being so intricate as to make it absolutely necessary that they should at this advanced Season take so much Trouble but it will answer this good End if there should be any Money in the Treasury to pay us with they can take it home with them perhaps in a cheaper Manner than We could find it. The Treasury is almost empty but another Emission will be made soon. I most cordially congratulate You upon the happy Reduction of St. Johns, the Papers give you most of the particulars. Genl. Montgomeries Letter says that he was immediately setting out for Montreal and mentioning the Repulse of Carleton he adds that He beleives it to be his last Effort (No News of Arnold). A Committee with Powers nearly similar to those given the Comee. which was at Cambridge is sett out for Ticonderoga & Canada, the Gentn. are Mr. Langdon, Mr. Robt. R Livingston & Mr. Paine. They have some Instructions relative to the particular Situation of the Canadians besides those concerning the Troops. Mr. Hopkins & Lady are very well. I have seen many Letters from England since my last; they all agree in the Acc[oun]ts I then gave you. In a Conference which the King had with a Person from America He told him that he was unalterably determined let the Consequence be what it would to compel the Colonies to absolute Obedience. Thank God his Power does not equal his Obstinacy & Pride. Our Instructions for an American Fleet has been long upon the Table; when it was first presented it was looked upon as perfectly chimerical, but Gentn. now consider it in a very different Light.

I admire your skill in Phisiognomy, and your Talent at drawing Characters, as well as that of your Friend Marcia from whom at the same Time I received several important Characters, which you shall one day see. I agree with you in your sentiments that there is Reason to be diffident of a Man who grossly violates the Principles of Morals, in any one particular habitually.(2) This sentiment was conveyed to Us in one of the Paradoxes of the ancient Stoicks, that \""all sins were equal,\"" and the same Idea is suggested from higher Authority, He that violates the Law in any one Instance is guilty of all. I have no Confidence in any Man who is not exact in his Morals. And you know that I look upon Religion as the most perfect System, and the most awfull Sanction of Morality. Your Goodness of Heart, as well as your sound Judgment will applaud me for using the utmost Caution in my Letters. But if you could see me, and observe how I am employed you would wonder that I find Time to write to any Body. I am very busy and so is every Body else here. I hope to be with you at Christmas, and then to be excused from coming here again, at least until others have taken their Turns. The late Appointment you mention gives me many very serious Thoughts.(3) It is an Office of high Trust, and of vast Importance at any Time: But of greater at this, than any other. The Confusions and Distractions of the Times, will encumber that Office with embarrassments, expose it to dangers and Slanders, which it never knew before. Besides I am apprehensive of other Difficulties. Mr. [William] Cushing has been on that Bench, and was my senior at the Bar. Will he accept under another? Mr. Paine too has taken an odd Turn in his Head of late, and is so peevish, passionate and violent that he will make the Place disagreable, if he does not think better of it. Mr. Cushing, Mr. Serjeant [Sargeant] and Mr. Read are very able Men, and Mr. Paine might be so if he was undisturbed in his Mind. But the Unhappy Affair in his Family, his Church and Town, appears to me to have affected his Mind too much. It is a melancholly Thought to me, because I have ever had a Friendship for him. I am really sorry that he has exposed his Character and Reputation so much of late as he has done, by certain Airs he has given himself, and it has many Times, in the beginning of the summer, when I was in an ill state of Health made me unhappy. But since the Adjournment, I have avoided Altercation with him, and this I shall continue to do. That Ambition and Avarice reign every where as you observe, is NOVEMBER 18, 1775  Portrait of George Ross 360 NOVEMBER 18, 1775 most true. But I hope that Preferment will follow Merit, after our Affairs get into a more settled Course. Remember me to all. When you said that Kissing goes by Favour, you did not explain the Particulars I wish you had. But all Censure and Clamour at this Time must be avoided and discountenanced as much as possible.

Having much to say to you, I begin, before I certainly know how this is to reach you.(1) I had your favor by a young gentleman whom I shall take every opportunity to endeavor at least to serve. I think it is abundantly his due. You have had accounts of the battle at Bunker's Hill- the loss on the part of the Regulars, is near the truth; on the other, greatly exaggerated [. . . .] (2) You wonder, with many others, that an Army so superior as ours, have not recovered Boston-and demolished the little Army of Rebels therein. You know, Boston. Recollect my friend that it is surrounded by the sea, except a very narrow causeway-that the enemy is master of the sea-that this only entrance by land is fortified to the utmost extent of art-work within work-defended by Cannon, and rendered impassable by deep diches-that the whole city is commanded by two steep, and high hills, each of which is fortified on the ascent, and a little Citadel at the top, with guns that reach everywhere. Recollect that thirty-two Battalions of choice British Troops, (or half her Army) occupy those works-that this Army has every advantage that Arms, Artillery, and plenty of ammunition can give. Add their being under the best Officers Britain can boast-and add, that our men are young Soldiers, and want that steadiness necessary to the attack of Trenches with bare Musketry-which long discipline alone can give. Consider that the business of the Enemy is to subdue America, and while they are imprisoned in Boston, their errand stands still-that they are every day perishing by disease, want, and desertion-all which must increase as winter cuts off their resources by sea-and I mistake if you will not own, that our Generals act wisely in not risking a repulse, or loosing a number of brave men in obtaining that-which a little time must give them, without loss, and make total and conclusive when it happens. Should Howe, be driven to his ships in summer, he will easily land in some other part, and begin new trouble. Ice prevents all this. Be assured, that our strength at Boston, by means of Fortifications, is such as leaves no doubt of our security. I wish the strength of Howe's Army, joined to all that we are threatened with next year, were to try an attack there-and that the fate of the War depended on the event. I should think fifty thousand men would inevitably be defeated in such an attempt. I have been lately at Cambridge, and speak from what I have seen. I have also, very lately, been at our Camp on the Lakes.  NOVEMBER 19, 1775  Have we not, my dear sir, great reason to bless God, for all his abundant mercies, on this occasion. Consider America, lulled in a long state of peace, and security. Where were we to look for Armies -more especially for Generals-attacked suddenly, and under cover of friendship, and protection, by the most powerful nation in the world, who, not content with her superiority of strength, calls in all other nations to her assistance, uses art-as well as force-to provoke attacks from our neighbours, calls in Savages to ravage our frontiers, to massacre our defenceless women and children, offers every incitement to our Slaves to rebel and murder their masters, ravage and burn our unfortified sea-coast. Behold, on the sudden, this distressed, unprepared people roused-behold Armies raised-and still more strange-under the command of veteran Officers, not only securing our Enemy from ravaging our country, but carrying War into every place where an Enemy can be found. The people so earnestly pressed to attack us, refusing every act, every force; our Indians keeping up peace, against all acts used to detach them from us, by lies, calumnies, and interest. Our Slaves remaining faithful-against the promise even of liberty, dearest-best -of all rewards. Behold two entire British Battalions, for the first time in her history prisoners of war-besides those in Boston-nay, what is still stranger-the coast of New England-scoured by Privateers-unmolested, and supplies to the army cut off. Could our most sanguine hopes, have gone so far last spring? Yet blessed be God all this is the case. Abused-belied-discarded-destroyed-with a rage, and malice altogether unknown, to civilized, or even barbarous nations' of this day-can it be credited-that America still languishes for reconciliation? Thus impregnable-thus prosperous, in every attempt-that she rises not a single jot in her terms of accommodation-that she even in sight of her unoffending towns, now in ashes-demands not restitution-nor reimbursement? Surely our worst enemies, must confess -that of all people we are the most placable, mild, and forgiving. That this is the case, you may be sure-no new demand would be made on our part. Peace and reconciliation, upon the one condition, we have ever asked it, viz.: Restitution of Rights, would be received as the greatest blessing. I objected when our last petition was before Congress-that using such lowly, and humiliating expressions, would produce, in narrow minds, an opinion of our weakness. I was not mistaken. I find that thought in papers and letters from the other side-as if boasting were a proof of anything but the bully [. . . .] From all this you will find such a departure from every rule of war, among even barbarous states, as very little entitle them to such terms, as you will observe them receive from our gallant General, in  the enclosed Capitulation-every article of which is religiously observed on our side.(3) Let them boast of their greatness-of the arts of Kingcraft, of Policy-be it ours, to be faithful, humane, and affectionate to our prostrate Foes. Let us treat them like the Individuals, of a Nation, with whom we do not consider ourselves at war-but rather as Defenders from Tyranny and Oppresion. Should the Slaves of those Monsters, add Injury to oppression, I hope we shall always act, like brave, humane, and Polite Victors. It gives me great pleasure to be able to enclose you an account of the reduction of Montreal (4)-and the greater part of Canada[....] Pray remark that no rejoicings have been permitted, though the advantages we have gained are so important-even the consideration of their having been obtained with so little Blood, has not been sufficient, to make us forget, that we were conquering our Brethren-let them blush who have forgotten this. I wish Britain would adopt the measure-of calling a Convention of Delegates, from the Assemblies of each Colony-by act of Parliament. I shall readily adopt the measure, we quarrel not about words. While you are at home, can't you send us ship loads of Powder; Our Saltpetre does not come in fast enough; 'twill fetch a great price, and be a very beneficial Trade, to France, Holland, or any other Nation, who will get valuable returns, in Provisions for their West Indies. If you meet with inaccuracies you'll pardon them in so long a letter, from one who really has not an hour in the day at his own disposal [. . . .] I fear I shall stay here all winter. I will not desert the Assembly here, while it lasts, be the season ever so disagreeable, or my stay inconvenient. I shall be always happy in your Friendship and correspondence, and shall certainly answer every letter I receive, which was not the case of that, sent before the last. My family's most respectful compliments, attend you, and yours. You know the hand of Dear sir, yours sincerely and Affectionately. P.S. I was in hopes, we should have availed ourselves of your abilities, and Integrity. Don't suspect I asked it. Could you sound, and find out, the sentiments of those who have the power to help us, particularly of those, who could send us necessaries, for war, and coarse goods, in exchange for our Productions. No Custom House dare touch them, and Men-of-War are easily avoided, the Trade would be amazingly profitable. Ten of the Troops from Ireland are arrived; there has been a dreadful storm, which is said to have destroyed many of the Transports, with almost the whole Fish, and Fishery of Newfoundland.  NOVEMBER 20, 1 775  Howe's Army must be very weak, for they suffered Lee to take possession of Cobble Hill, a few days ago-which being within half cannon shot, of their lines, and commanding Lechmere's Point, where they last landed, gave them as good an opportunity as they could wish, of forcing our Army to a Battle, on equal terms-this Point being full as near, and as much exposed to their Artillery, as ours; strong necessity urging them also, want of Provisions, having brought on scurvy, and other dreadful diseases, and their lines thinning every day, by death, and desertion, all could not bring them out. Deserters say there is much discontent among the men, and that the Officers are obliged to lie, in order to quiet them, by assuring them, of an immediate Reinforcement of three thousand Men, when they know, none such is coming. I had the pleasure of entertaining the Commanding Officer of St. John's yesterday, and of ordering the disposition of two Regiments of British Troops. While we are called, and treated as Barbarians, their prisoners have every indulgence possible. In this, may we always be their superiors. The ways are at this season, so impracticable, that we have no late accounts from Quebec. Gun-lock makers, in any number, skilful Saltpetre makers, and Powder makers, would be very acceptable-they are to be got in Germany.

Tayloe two or three days agoe, from whome 1 suppose you have had the news, and intended by Mr. Colston to answer your last letter; but an express from the Camp last night having brot fresh intelligence I take the advantage of tomorrow's post to communicate it to you. The transports from Ireland with five Regiments compleat have arrived at Boston, a fishing boat with 6 muskets took NOVEMBER 20, 1775  a schooner belonging to the fleet loaded with provisions for the officers, in her were many letters by which we learn that the Roman Catholic Lords, Bishops & Gentry are extreamly active in procuring recruits; the Protestants very averse to the business, many recruiting parties driven out of their towns, and even the lower class of Catholics show great dislike to it, but with the high premiums given by the Popish towns &c many recruits are raised, & it is expected as many will be raised as will compleat the number entended for the next campaign, which they say is 22,000. 5,000 Hanoverians are to garrison Gibralter & Port Mahon, the British regiments there to go to England & Ireland. I will not anticipate your reflection upon these infamous proceedings of the Ministry, but I think he must be blind indeed who does not see the design of establishing arbitrary Government in America; and unworthy the name of man, who does not oppose it, at all hazard. The establishment of Popery will no doubt, be the reward of the exertions of the Roman catholics. We do not think the whole of these raw Irish will make a dinner for our troops. Our only fear is the want of ammunition, but we hope to be releived from that before next spring. Our cutters have taken two more of their caitering Vessels, one loaded with wood the other with provisions. 600 of the enemy made a sally out of Boston to carry off some cattle but a few of our men quickly repulsed them, with the loss of two of their men. We have heard of Arnolds being in Canada & recd. with open arms by the inhabitants, so we expect that Quebec & of course the whole Province is ours by this time. So much for news. I am glad to find that amidst all the breeches button making in Virga. & in spite of the Cholic you keep up your spirits; & therefore hope you have defeated all the party schemes in Richmond. Lord Dunmore seems to be a little quiet since the taste of Virga. prowess at Hampton; we expect that Col. Woodford will keep him to his good behaviour at Norfolk.

999,dg002356,1775,Samuel Ward to Henry Ward,"""Samuel Ward to Henry Ward   Dear Bror. Philadelphia 21st Novr. 1775 Yesterday We had a Number of Letters (taken on Board the Transport from Ireland) to the officers in Boston read in Congress. The Writers of some of them freely condemn our Enemies, assure their correspondents that the People at large heartily wish Us Success & some even say that it is Time for Ireland to follow our Example. There is great Reluctance to the Service; additional Bounties are given by the leading roman Catholics. Other Letters say that the People of both England & Ireland in general are against Us, that many who have supported our Interest until the Proclamation came out have now changed Sides, but tho' these Letters vary in that Respect They all agree that the King is determined let the Consequence be what it will to reduce us to Submission. I am vastly pleased to find that our Friends in England give us such good Intelligence. The five Regiments which I lately wrote You might be expected this Fall came out with this Transport & are chiefly or by this time wholly arrived & that the 20000 men are to come in the Spring & the Men of War is confirmed in these Letters. If We can but get Arms and Ammunition I have no Doubt but We shall give a good Acct. of them and I think We have a good Prospect. Many Vessels are out on the Merchts. Acct. some on the several Colonies and others on Acct. of the Continent and great Encouragement hath been given & a Person well acquainted in Germany with the manufacture of Salt Petre is employed by Congress to go down immediately to Virginia & sett up very extensive Works but as every possable method will be made us[e] of for interupting these Supplies I hope the Merchts in Providence have or will immediately take the most speedy & effectual Methods for obtaining large Supplies. I think they ought to import Lead by all Means for allowing We succeed in getting it out of the Conn [ecticu] t Mines which is by no Means absolutely certain yet, the land Carriage would cost almost as much as the lead would abroad. Arms also will be wanted for We must undoubtedly encrease our Army very considerably. Happily for America the Congress will chearfully adopt NOVEMBER 21, 1775  the most vigorous Measures & pursue them with the utmost Spirit; that Timidity and Fluctuation of Counsels which a Hope of Reconciliation induced have done Us infinite Mischief. One of the above referred to Letters says that Ministry concluded from our Petition that the Congress found themselves too weak to carry on Opposition & took a Resolution to exert their whole Force to crush us at once. Many of Us expected this would be the Consequence of those measures but Thanks be to God We are not like to be again haunted with that evil genius And the Sin of Fear is now intirely banished from amongst us. By Letters from Camp I find there is infinite Difficulty in reinlisting the Army. The Idea of making it wholly continental has induced so many Alterations disgusting to both officers & men that very little Success has attended our recruiting Orders. I have often told the Congress that under the Idea of new modelling I was afraid We should destroy our Army. It is expected that an Attack will be made upon our Lines on the Arrival of all the Reinforcements. A Reduction of the Army, or a Want of Powder or Arms may be fatal, You are much nearer the Camp than I am & may be better acquainted with the Difficulties. Southern Gentlemen wish to remove that Attachment which the Officers & men have to their respective Colonies & make them look up to the Continent at large for their Support or Promotion. I never thought that Attachment injurious to the common Cause but the strongest Inducement to People to risque every thing in Defense of the whole upon the Preservation of which must depend the Safety of each Colony. I wish therefore not to eradicate but regulate it in such a Manner as may most conduce to the Protection of the whole. I am not a little alarmed at the present Situation of the Army, I wish your utmost Influence may be used to put things upon a proper Footing and must beg Leave through you to recommend the matter to the immediate Attention of the Governor. There is no Time to be lost. We have been so vastly hurried that the building a Navy hath not been taken into Consideration yet but it will be done in a Day or two I think. Proper Regards to all.

Whither a new Convention is Called, and when to meet. Whither a new Committe of Safety is appointed, and if so who are the members. How the people like the Resolve of the Congress concerning Civil government, and what is done in consequence of it. Whither the Colony has undertaken to procure themselves any Powder. Whither any Salt petre is made or any body Engaging in that Business. Whither the fire arms voted by the covention are made. Whither the people in General are peacable & orderly or not. I should be very Glad to be informed of these and of Every other public affair, as soon & as often as possible, and hope that you and my other friends will frequently write to me. If it does no other good (that is if Some of the letters should not convey me any material public intelligence) it will at least give me great pleasure to hear from my friends in our Colony, while (as I Expect) I am confined here the Ensuing winter. In order to Encourage intelligence being conveyed to & from the Delegates while the Congress is Sitting, they have ordered that all letters from & to them be carried post free as you will see by the publick prints. I hope our Colony will omit nothing in their power to put themselves in a good State of Defense for unless good providence interpose, I Believe the ministry will use their greatest Efforts the spring and Summer coming to Subdue us to Slavery. Thus it appears by the latest & best account. If we can Stand our ground one year more I make no doubt things will turn to our minds. Capt Langdon went off to Ticonderoga the 12th Inst so I am left here alone in behalf of our Colony & I am obliged to attend constantly otherwise the Colony will have no vote. We frequently leave off so late as to Scarcly to Dine by Day light. I am in good Health; hope this will find you & your family so too. Remember me to all friends. 1 am Sir your friend and Servant Josiah Bartlett P.S. Please to inform me how the Gentlemen at Portsmouth behaved in the late Surprize there and Excuse my incorrectness & Blotings as I have not time to Copy it and write in haste by Candle light. J B ""

1006,dg002363,1775,Committee to the Northward to John Hancock,"""Committee to the Northward to John Hancock   Sr Albany Novr. 23 1775 We arrived the 16th in the Evening at New Winsor, having been detained part of a day by Rain. The morning following we rowed down the River about 8 miles to the Fortress in the Highlands where we spent the day in making such Observations as we thought would be of most use to the Congress, & wish our time would have permitted us to render them more perfect without interfering with the other commissions with which we have been honoured.(1) We found the fortress in the care of Messrs Bedlow, Greenal & Lawrence whom the Convention of New York had appointed Commissioners to Superintend the Work wch. was carried on under the direction of Mr. Romans, agreeable to his plan presented to the Congress. The Garrison consisted of 100 men, being the remainder of two companys, from which drafts were made to compleat those that were sent up to the Northward while they continued recruiting. Exclusive of these there were at the fortress 27 Carpenters, 16 Masons, 2 Smiths & 59 Labourers, a Clerk & a Steward. We must own that we found the fort in a less defensible Scituation than we had reason to expect, owing chiefly to an injudicious disposition of the labour which has hitherto been bestowed on the Barracks, the Blockhouse & the South West Curtain. This, Mr. Romans assured us, would be finished in a week & would mount 14 Cannon, but when Compleated we consider as very insufficient in itself to answer the purpose of defense, tho it is doubtless Necessary to render the whole fortification perfect, but as it is the least useful it should have been the last finished. It does not command the Reach to the Southward, nor can it injure a Vessel turning the West point, & after She has got round, a small breeze or even the tide will enable a ship to pass the Curtain in a few minutes. The principal Strength of the fortress will consist in the South Bastion on which no labour has as yet been bestowed; a Vessel turning the Point is immediately exposed to its fire. The Platform of this will be raised 57 feet above high Water mark, when Compleated, which gives it an elevation of about 11 degrees above the guns of a Vessell at the West point, Supposing she carries them 12 feet above the surface of the Water, According to Mr. Romans Account. On this Bastion it is proposed to mount 11 Large Cannon. The block house is finished & has 6 4 pounders mounted in it, & is at present the only Strength of the fortress. The Barracks Consist of 14 Rooms, each of which may contain 30 men, but they are not yet Compleated for want of Bricks with which to run up the Chimneys. NOVEMBER 23, 1775  The fortress is unfortunately commanded by all the Grounds about it, & is much exposed to an attack by Land, but the most Obvious defect is that the Grounds on the West point are much higher than the Fortress behind which point an Enemy may land without the Least danger. In order to render this Post impassable it seems necessary that this Place Should be Occupied & batteries thrown up on the opposite Shore, where they may be erected with little expense as the Earth is Said to be pretty free from stone. This will indeed render our Works very extensive, but we fear nothing Short of this will be sufficient to avail us of the winding of the River. Mr. Romans informs us of a place about 4 miles lower down the River, which is free from the inconveniency we have mentioned & where the elevation is much greater. Had we had more time we should have gone & examined it. We would submitt to the Congress whether it may not be proper to send Some persons better versed in these matters than we are, to take An Accurate Survey of the highlands, & to pitch on those Spots on which Batterys may be most cheaply, expeditiously & advantagiously raised. We found at the fortress 8 9 pounders & 6 Carriages 42 6 pounders& 18 Carriages 16 4 pounders & 4 Do. 5 3 pounders 101 9 pound Shot 180 6 pound Do. 140 4 Do. Do. 43 double Leaded 6 lb. shot 19 Do. 4 lb. Do. Cannon Cartridges 400 of 9 lb. 400 of 6 lb. 88 of 4 lb. 185 lb. of Match 100 lb. Muskett ball 100 lb. Grape Shott 170 lb. Powder These are all the particulars which our short stay at the fort enabled us to collect. We offer our own sentiments in matters with which we are so little acquainted with the greatest diffidence, & submitt them implicitly to the Congress but cannot help wishing when we consider the importance of the object, that they would take the opinion of those who are capable of giving them more useful information. We congratulate you & the Congress on the happy success of our  Arms & remain with the greatest Respect your & their most Obedient humble Servants Robt R Livingston Junr Rob Treat Paine John Langdon P.S.

1010,dg002367,1775,Benjamin Harrison to Unknown,"""Benjamin Harrison to Unknown   [Philadelphia, November 24, 1775] (1) The confederation is an article mentioned in your letter.(2) Let me give you a state of that matter: In the last congress, it was observed by a gentleman, with whose extensive knowledge and abilities the world is well acquainted, that when we set out originally upon the plan of a commercial opposition, an instrument was formed by which the colonies were bound to stand by one another, till certain ends were obtained. This was the association; that Great Britain had now rendered an opposition by arms necessary, in which case he thought there should be also some bond of union, in writing, that each colony might know how far it stood engaged, and for what purposes, and how far it had a right to rely on its sister colonies. He therefore introduced a form of confederation, to be moulded into any shape thought proper, and merely to set the thing a-going. I do not recollect whether it was read or not, but I well remember that the congress refused to enter into any consideration of it, to send it to the conventions for their approbation, to have it printed for public perusal, to have any NOVEMBER 24, 1775  entry made in their journals of such a paper being offered, or in any manner to make any order which should imply either approbation or disapprobation of it; it was simply permitted to lie on the table, from which it followed, that if gentlemen thought proper to say anything about if afterwards, it was to be on their own authority individually, and not as proceeding by the order, or even the desire, of congress. Since this, not a word has ever passed in congress upon it, nor had we heard any thing without doors till Mr. Inglis informed us such a paper had been solemnly laid before a neighbouring convention for them to say whether they would accede to or reject it in the lump, it being said that the alteration or diminution, even of a letter would not be admitted; that in the lump they chose to decline it;(3)and that the thing began to make some noise in Virginia. This is the whole I know of it. Though I might not approve of the confederation proposed, perhaps, as it stood (for really I do not remember what it was) yet I am ready openly to declare to the world it is my opinion we ought to be bound together by some treaty of alliance, or confederacy, in which the objects of the war should be defined, the terms of closing it delineated, and the colonies of the union bound to each other to contribute their respective force to obtain these objects, and when these objects were attained, that any one colony should have a right to say they would go no farther. MS not found; reprinted from the Virginia Gazette (Pinkney), December 13, 1775, under the heading: \""Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to his friend in this city [Williamsburg], dated November 24.\"" l Worthington C. Ford published this letter in the Nation, 48 (March 28, 1889): 261-63, with a brief essay inviting further study of the Articles of Confederation which Franklin proposed July 21, 1775, because of the paucity of evidence available on the subject. Ford deduced the identity of the author from the fact that Richard Henry Lee and Harrison were the only Virginia delegates who were in Philadelphia in both July and November and his assumption that the letter's moderate tone did not fit Lee's radical views. It is possible, of course, that the author was not a Virginian, but in the absence of other evidence Ford's conjecture invites no challenge. 2 A letter to the Virginia delegates of November 11 from the Virginia Committee of Safety but written by Edmund Pendleton contains the following query: \""What is become of the Confederation? We are told some Copies are in the Colony and condemned, whilst we can say nothing on the Subject, being strangers to its contents.\"" It is a reasonable conjecture that the recipient of the letter printed above was one of the six members of the Virginia Committee who signed the letter of November 11, although Pendleton himself may be a more likely candidate than Richard Bland, Carter Braxton, Dudley Digges, John Page, or John Tabb. See Edmund Pendleton, The Letters and Papers of Edmand Pendleton, 1734-1803, ed. David J. Mays, 2 vols. (Charlottesville: The University Press of Virginia, 1967), 1:129. 3 The North Carolina Provincial Congress had rejected the proposed articles on September 4, 1775. Am. Archives, 4th ser. 3:196.

You tell me, Sir, \""that We shall have no Winter Army, if our Congress dont give better Encouragement to the Privates than at present is held forth to them\"" and that \""there must be some small Bounty given them, on the Inlistment.\"" What Encouragement is held forth, or at least has been, I know not, but before this Time no doubt they have been informed of the Ultimatum of the Congress. No Bounty is offered-40 shillings lawfull Money Per Month, after much Altercation, is allowed.(1) It is undoubtedly true, that an opinion prevails among the Gentlemen of the Army from the Southward, and indeed throughout all the Colonies, excepting New England, that the Pay of the Privates is too high and that of the officers too low. So that you may easily conceive the Difficulties We have had to surmount. You may depend upon it, that this has cost many an anxious Day and Night. And the Utmost that could be done has been. We cannot Suddenly alter the Temper, Principles, opinions or Prejudices of Men. The Characters of Gentlemen in the four New England Colonies, differ as much from those in the others, as that of the Common People differs, that is as much as several distinct Nations almost. Gentlemen, Men of Sense, or any Kind of Education in the other Colonies are much fewer in Proportion than in N. England. Gentlemen in the other Colonies have large Plantations of slaves, and the common People among them are very ignorant and very poor. These Gentlemen are accustomed, habituated to higher Notions of themselves and the distinction between them and the common People, than We are. And an instantaneous alteration of the Character of a Colony, and that Temper and those Sentiments which NOVEMBER 25, 1775  its Inhabitants imbibed with their Mothers Milk, and which have grown with their Growth and strengthened with their Strength, cannot be made without a Miracle. I dread the Consequences of this Disimilitude of Character, and without the Utmost Caution on both sides, and the most considerate Forbearance with one another and prudent Condescention on both sides, they will certainly be fatal. An Alteration of the Southern Constitutions, which must certainly take Place if this War continues will gradually bring all the Continent nearer and nearer to each other in all Respects. But this is the Most Critical Moment, We have yet seen. This Winter will cast the Die. For Gods Sake therefore, reconcile our People to what has been done, for you may depend upon it, that nothing more can be done here-and I should shudder at the Thought of proposing a Bounty. A burnt Child dreads the fire. The Pay of the officers is raised, that of a Captain to 26 dollars and one third per Month, Lts and Ensigns in Proportion-Regimental officers not raised. You then hint, \""that if Congress should repeal or explain away the Res. of 18 July respecting the appointment of military officers, and vest the Council with the sole Power, it would throw the Colony into Confusion and end in the Distruction of the Council.\"" The Day before Yesterday I wrote a Letter to the Honorable Board in answer from one from their President by order to us upon that Subject, which Letter Revere carried from this City yesterday Morning. Therein I candidly gave my opinion to their Honours that our Resolution was clear and plain, that the Colony might Use their own Discretion, and therefore that they might yield this Point to the House-and that the Point was so plain that I did not see the least occasion for laying the Controversy before Congress.(2) But my dear Friend I must take the Freedom to tell you that the same has hap- pened upon this occasion which has happened on a thousand others, after taking a great deal of Pains with my Colleague your Friend Mr Cushing, I could not get him to agree with the rest of Us in writing a joint Letter, nor could I get him to say what opinion he would give if it was moved in Congress. What he has written I know not. But it is very hard to be linked and yoked eternally, with People who have either no opinions, or opposite Opinions, and to be plagued with the opposition of our own Colony to the most necessary Measures, at the same Time that you have all the Monarchical Superstitions and the Aristocratical Domination, of Nine other Colonies to contend with.

You know Madam, that I have no Pleasure or Amusements which has any Charms for me. Balls, Assemblies, Concerts, Cards, Horses, Dogs, never engaged any Part of my attention or Concern. Nor am I ever happy in large and promiscuous Companies. Business alone, with the intimate unreserved Conversation of a very few Friends, Books, and familiar Correspondences, have ever engaged all my Time, and I have no Pleasure no Ease in any other Way. In this Place I have no opportunity to meddle with Books, only in the Way of Business. The Conversation I have here is all in the ceremonious, reserved, impenetrable Way. Thus I have Sketched a Character for myself of a morose Philosopher and a Surly Politician, neither of which are very amiable or respectable, but yet there is too much truth in it-and from it you will easily believe that I have very little Pleasure here, excepting in the Correspondence of my Friends, and among these I assure you Madam there is none, whose Letters I read with more Pleasure and Instruction than yours. I wish it was in my Power to write to you oftener than I do,(1) but I am really engaged in constant Business of seven to ten in the Morning in Committee, from ten to four in Congress and from Six to Ten again in Committee. Our Assembly is scarcly numerous enough for the Business. Every Body is engaged all Day in Congress and all the Morning and evening in Committees. I mention this Madam as an Apology for not writing you so often as I ought and as a Reason for my Request that you would not wait for my answers. The Dispute you mention between the House and Board I hope will be easily settled. Yet I believe the Board acted with great Honour and Integrity and with a wise Design and a virtuous Resolution to do nothing that should endanger the Union. But I am clear that it is best the two Houses should join in the Appointment of officers of Militia, and I am equally clear that the Resolve of Congress was intended to leave it to the Discretion of the Colony to adopt such a Mode as should please themselves, and I NOVEMBER 25, 1775  have done myself the Honour to write these sentiments to the Board, who were pleased to write to us upon the occasion. Am obliged to you for your Account of the state of Things in Boston, I am ever anxious about our Friends who remain there and nothing is ever more acceptable to me than to learn what passes there. The Inactivity of the two Armies, is not very agreable to me. Fabius's Cunctando was wise and brave. But if I had submitted to it in his situation, it would have been a cruel Mortification to me. Zeal and Fire and Activity and Enterprize Strike my Imagination too much. I am obliged to be constantly on my Guard-yet the Heat within will burst forth at Times. The Characters drawn in your last entertained me very agreably. They were taken off, by a nice & penetrating Eye. I hope you will favour me with more of these Characters. I wish I could draw a Number of Characters for your Inspection. I should perhaps daub on the Paint too thick-but the Features would be very strong. The General is amiable and Accomplished and judicious and cool; You will soon know the Person and Character of his Lady.(2) I hope She has as much Ambition, for her Husbands Glory, as Portia & Marcia have, and then the Lord have Mercy on the Souls of Howe and Burgoyne & all the Troops in Boston.

Novr. 25 1775 I should have done myself the Pleasure of writing you by Return of the-Express but was so ill at that time, that I found it impossible. I am now much better, tho' still greatly distressed with a Cough which I see no Prospect of getting rid of until I lead my Course to a warmer and better Climate. So much for myself. Letters from Genl. Washing ton a few days since inform us of the arrival of Troops from Ireland, the Number is not known but it is guess'd at 2000, or 2500. It is the opinion of himself & officers that Howe will soon attack him. I wish he may; if our people behave like Men, success will, nay must attend us. Some time last Summer, the officers at Boston fitted out a large Schooner from that place & dispatched her to Ireland for a Supply of Tongues, Wine &c. On her Return a few Days ago, she was intercepted by one of our armed Vessels in Continental pays and brought into Harbour with all her Grog & an abundance of Letters from Gentn. in Ireland to their Friends in Boston. These Letters were open'd & NOVEMBER 25, 1775  have afforded much Amusement & some Intelligence. We find by them that Administration are determined at all Events to attempt the Reduction of America, that Boston will be made strong by 22 or 25000 Men in the Course of this Winter & the Spring-that Lord Kinmare has added to the King's Bounty that of 10/6 per Man for all who shall inlist under Major Roche-that the City of Corke has followed the Example but more extensively, that Lord Bellamount has the Direction of the Recruiting parties in that part of the Kingdom-that the Roman Catholic Priests have been applied to to stimulate their Flocks against us, which they have promised to do, if the Regiments to be raised be officer'd by Gentn. of their religious p[ers]uasion-in short that all the Powers of Hell are to be let loose upon us. On the other Hand, Intelligence by the same Conveyance inform us that all the Whigs in the Kingdom a very few Excepted are warmly interested in our Cause, that the common people are not less well affected, that several Towns have resolved not to permit any officers to recruit amongst them, & have destroyed the Drums of those who have been hardy enough to attempt it, & that the Dislike to the Service is so great & so general that those employed therein meet with little or no Success. So much for Irish Politics. You Will no Doubt 'eer this reaches you hear of our having taken Chamblee & St. John's. We should have wrote to the Commee upon the Subject, but waited for more particulars. We have received no farther Accounts from that Quarter; but are in daily Expectation of hearing of the Fall of Montreal & Quebec. In the last of those places I am told there is great Abundance of what we want very much-powder & military Stores. I have that Expedition much at Heart I must confess, for I really think & have thought for a long Time, that America will be saved in Canada. It may put Reconciliation at a greater Distance 'tis true, as his Majesty will find just difficulty to persuade himself to part with arbitrary power tho' it were established but in an Acre of Ground; however it will make the Cure radical whenever it is effected, & really we have lived in so unsettled a Condition for such a length of Time that I would now wish to fight it fairly out & either establish a Connection consistent with the Principles of Liberty & placed upon a permanent Basis, or have nothing more to do with them. The latter I think most likely to be the case. The Distruction of our Towns in the wanton Manner in which it has been affected, a mode of Warfare (as I have already expressed it) totally exploded amongst civilized Nations, give us little Reason to think that they will attempt to make Peace. Indeed if it is not soon set about, it will be all in Vain even to wish for it hereafter.- The Minds of People will be so warmed by the Acts of Cruelty hitherto exercised & daily committing against them that they will not wish for a Connection with Men of such savage Disposition.  NOVEMBER 26, 1775  Pray make my Respects where due. God bless you. In Haste, Yrs truly Edward Rutledge ""

I therefore rejoice at your safe return, & at your finding the Families in so good a Situation to whom my warmest remembrance, & Congratulations to the New parents. Thos. Mumford Esqr. arrived here Night before last, & his Brother as usual, sticks by the Stuff. Col. Dyer increases in fretfullness with the severity of the Weather, and brother Roger sets off tomorrow to pay a Visit to Connecticut before the New Delegation are seated.(1) Things are in just the same Train as when You left Us, & consequently I am quite willing to quit my Station to abler Men, & who they are, the Colony knows, or ought to know best.(2) I did not leave New York untill Saturday Morng. and then with the Mortification of effecting Nothing.(3) Was thrown into the most wretched Situation, at those two little Ferries, which took Us not Five Minutes to cross, took Me Near as many Hours. The wind & Tide conspiring against Us, carried Us quite down into the Bay, & in short I was glad to get on Shore at any Rate, or any where, after well nigh perishing with the Cold. At Elisabeth Town where We dined on Sunday, I dined & found my Freind Jay waiting for Me. He took a Seat with Me, & we had as agreeable a Journey, as the badness of the Roads and Weather would admit of, saving that at Woodbridge Where we lodged, Somebody finding out that I had Two loose Coats (for I bot. Me a .New one in New York) very civilly borrowed my old One, without troubling Me with any Questions about the matter or debating which he should take, he also borrowed a P [air] of Shoes & Buckles & some other Trifles of Mr. Jay, & has not call'd on either of Us since. Thus You see, it is in Vain for Me, to think of having more than One Coat at a Time, were I provident enough to lay in so small a Stock which you know I am not in general. I del[ivere]d your billet & pattern to Mrs. Trist, who thanks You for your Commission, which w [he] n Executed will report. Beleive me my Dear my long & thorough acquaintance with the Genius of Our Assembly prevents my being surprized at any sudden Whim they take, or uneasy at any of their Resolutions so farr as they respect myself individually. On a review of the part I have acted on NOVEMBER 26, 1775  the public Theatre of Life, an examination of my own Genius & Disposition, unfitt for Trimming, Coasting, & intrigues with the populace, I have greater reason to wonder how I ever became popular at all. What therefore I did not expect, I have Too much Philosophy to be in distress at loosing. I only wish that my Freinds felt as easy, on this Occasion as myself; if they knew what fatigues I have undergone, & the disagreeable prospects before Me, as to public Affairs, they could wish Me here only in Confidence that my Abilities might be of service to the public, rather than to myself, but of this The Supreme Assembly are best Judges, & to them I submit sincerely praying, that the Consequences which I think I foresee, necessarily flowing from this measure may be averted. I am surprized that Knight should abuse Me in the manner he has done, cost what it will procure a supply elsewhere. I should be sorry that you or my Freinds should manifest any uneasiness on my being superceded, for they who effected it will find, & that soon, the mischeif intended, recoil on them to their Shame & disgrace, or I am greatly mistaken, and at present God knows I wish the worst of them no other punishment, than a Consciousness of the low, envious, jealous, & sordid motives by which they are actuated; as on the other hand one of the greatest pleasures I enjoy is a Consciousness of the rectitude of my intentions & Conduct, & the pleasing Reflection of being Superior to such Motives & those actuated by them. I have wrote a Long Lettr. and on a review it is too much about myself, I will write of something of more importance in my Next. My Compliments to all Freinds. I am my Dear Your Affectionate Husband S Deane ""

They have come into a resolution to  NOVEMBER 26, 1775  supply them.(1) I send it you herewith and desire you will lay a copy of it before the Provincial Council and the Conmittees of the Sea Ports &c. I have wrote to you sundry times since I came here but have not been so fortunate as to hear a single word from Edenton since I left it. By some intercepted Letters we find the British Ministry are determined to reinforce their Army at Boston with 22,500 Men, which are to be sent over with all possible expedition. Five Regiments each 700 men are already arived, the remainder will be out early in the Spring, of this matter we have pretty good intelligence. It is thought we shall have Occasion for all the Men we can raise so that you must not discharge your Troops till you hear further from our Body. Tho. Persons wrote to Penn that you intended to disband them at your next meeting. We have had that matter under consideration, a Committee was appointed to consider it, and will report perhaps to morrow. I have not seen the report but am told the purport of it is that your two Regiments shall be kept in pay till December 1776 unless discharged sooner by Order of Congress and that it is recommended to you to fall upon every method in your power to get Arms & Amunition for them.(2) The latter you may be supplied with at Charles Town, I have done all I could to purchase Some of both here, but cannot as yet get any of either, if I could have done it I should have had an Order of Congress on the Treasurer here for money to have paid for them. If the Order from Congress should not reach you before you set of[f] for the next meeting of your Council you must prevent the disbanding of your Soldiers. I ought not to call them your Soldiers, the Continent consider them theirs and the Congress mean to give Orders Accordingly. Tho. Persons also wrote Penn that a person had purchased lately near 200 hhd of Tobacco in Bute & Granville, which he hinted was intended to be Shipped in Violation of the association, He also mentions that people in general are dissatisfied with the proceedings of the Convention at Hillsborough and are dayly falling off from the American Cause, for other matters of News I refer you to the Bearer Mr. Houston who is one of the Georgia delegates to whom I doubt not you will shew every Civility.

Proper persons will certainly and presently be appointed, under proper regulations, to determine on sea Captures. I heartily congratulate you on the surrender of St. Johns.

I make no doubt but the most effectual guard will be taken to render this attempt fatal to its Authors.

1026,dg002383,1775,Robert R Livingston Jr to John Jay,"""Robert R. Livingston, Jr., to John Jay   Dear John Fort George 27 Nov 1775. I am now on the borders of Lake George where we have been detained this day & part of yesterday by a head wind & extream severe wheather. It is almost impossible to conceive the difference we found in the climate in half a miles riding. After we got over the mountain, within the reach of the woods that close from the lake it was like leaping from Octr. to Decr. We hope to leave this tomorrow & have prepared tinder boxes & axes for an enca[m]pment on the shore, as we can hardly expect as they tell us to get over in one day & hope to experience the pleasure of laying on hemlock beds. They laugh at us here for having brought but one blanket with us, but we hope to make it up in fire. This morning & part of yesterday I employed in going over the ground where the French received the first check from Sir Wm Johnston, & this afternoon I went over the remains of Fort William Henry, & the French lines part of which are still visible. No fort could have been more unfortunately scituated as it is commanded by almost all the grounds about it, yet it appears that the defense must have been prety gallant, since the approaches were begun at a distance yet they held out till they got within twenty yards of the fort, every gun but one of which was dismounted. You remember how the capitulation was violated & the horrid Slaughter of those brave fellows by the Indians under the command of Le Corne. I could hardly stir a step with[out] imagining that I walked over the grave of some unfortunate victim to the ambition of princes. We have little hopes of getting farther than Ticonderoga, as the lake is already frozen to Crown Point, & the cold of last night & this day have I dare say extended it not a little. We met upon the road great numbers of the Connecticut Troops, most of whom as we are informed have gone home. It give[s] me great pleasure to find that Montgomerry has contrived to gain the affection as well of the New England Troops as our own. They speak of him in the highest terms. You cannot conceive at the distance you are, the difficulties he & his troops have had to struggle with, difficulties which I am amazed they should ever get over. By the last accounts we have from Montreal, we hear that Montgomerry had ordered a battery to be raisd at the mouth of the Sorrel & got a Gondola from the lake into the river St. Lawrence by which means he has sloped nine vessels loaded with stores from going down, & I am in great hope they will be taken. Carleton is said to have escaped by land to Quebeck, where we hear he has about 700 men chiefly of the Royal Emigrants (in which [. . .] Stephen Watts is inlisted) & they are employed below Quebeck in distressing the inhabitants who are favourable to us. Arnold we hear is at Point Levi waiting for assist NOVEMBER 27, 1775  ance from Montgomerry who writes me that he will go down immediately if he can get his men to follow him in which we hear he is like to succeed. He proposes to secure the channel below Quebeck & advises that some able genl. be sent to take the command, and recommends Lee as he expects a pretty severe attack in the spring. I wish he would stay himself as I know [no] person of more prudence & conduct in our service, but I believe he finds that the provision made for a second in command, will not support one at the head of an army. He says nothing of this to me but express[es] a warm desire to return to his farm & mill. I hope you have seen Harry. I have great satisfaction in the commendation he receive[s] from all who have served with him. Both his Colo & lieutenant Coll have resigned, so that I hope he will receive the rank to which he was before entitled, & has now earned. If he is still with you I pray you to take him by the hand, you will find amidst his roughness, many good qualities. There is one subject on which I wished to speak to you had I had the pleasure of seeing you. They talk of sending the new levies to Boston, I think we should by no means consent to it, for many reasons that I dare not commit to paper, but which will suggest them selves to you. If you are not tired of politicks I would just mention to you that under the notion of soldiers baggage there are two compleat suits of cloathing at Montreal for each Soldier which have never yet be[en] unpacked. Now I have great doubt, whether by the capitulation they can be entitled to these & If they are, whether they may not be purchased of the soldiers for our Northern army at a cheap rate, indeed we may afford to pay well for them as the transportation will amount to nearly their value. If the Congress should take any order with respect to this matter, I should be glad if they would send off an express to stop them here. Hitherto I have only asked your attention to those matters which your love of your country makes it your pleasure to attend to. I could wish to detain you by the less important concerns of private friendship, which I never feel so strongly as when absence & solitude acquaint me with the movements of my own heart, but Pain[e] already considers me as impolite. Let me hear from you, & direct to the care of Walter Livingston at Albany. God bless you & remember me to any lady you think fit. Farewell. Yours Most Sincerely Robt R Livingston junr PS I just hear [it is] doubtful whether Carlton has escaped. His vessels have made too fruitless attempts. Montgomerry has marched to join Arnold, most of our troops enlist. All those that Wo[o]ster had with him stay [arld] amount to about 300. ""

He was struck with an Apoplexys and expired within five hours. I have it in my power to acquaint you that the successes of our arms have corresponded with the justice of our cause. Chambly and St. John's have been taken some weeks ago, and in them the whole regular army in Canada except about 40. or 50. men. This day we receive certain intelligence that our General Montgomery is received into Montreal: and expect every hour to be informed that Quebec has opened it's arms to Colo. Arnold who with 1100 men was sent from Boston up the Kennebec and down the Chaudiere river to that place. He expected to be there early this month. Montreal acceded to us on the 13th. and Carleton set out with the shattered remain[s] of his little army for Quebec where we hope he will be taken up by Arnold. In a short time we have reason to hope the delegates of Canada will join us in Congress and complete the American Union as far as we wish to have it completed. We hear that one of the British trans NOVEMBER 29, 1775  ports is arrived at Boston, the rest are beating off the coast in very bad weather. You will have heard before this reaches you that Ld. Dunmore has commenced hostilities in Virginia. That people bore with every thing till he attempted to burn the town of Hampton. They opposed and repelled him with considerable loss on his side and none on ours. It has raised our country into perfect phrensy. It is an immense misfortune to the whole empire to have a king of such a disposition at such a time. We are told and every thing proves it true that he is the bitterest enemy we have. His minister is able, and that satisfies me that ignorance or wickedness somewhere controuls him. In an earlier part of this contest our petitions told him that from our king there was but one appeal. The admonition was despised and that appeal forced on us. To undo his empire he has but one truth more to learn, that after colonies have drawn the sword there is but one step more they can take. That step is now pressed upon us by the measures adopted as if they were afraid we would not take it. Beleive me Dear Sir there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a Union with Gr. Britain than I do. But by the god that made me I will cease to exist before I yeild to a connection on such terms as the British parliament propose and in this I think I speak the sentiments of America. We want neither inducement nor power to declare and assert a separation. It is will alone which is wanting and that is growing apace under the fostering hand of our king. One bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly our future course; I am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on. If our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from slavery, and General Howe's reinforcement should arrive in safety we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of Boston and take another drubbing: and we must drub you soundly before the sceptered tyrant will know we are not mere brutes, to crouch under his hand and kiss the rod with which he deigns to scourge us. Edmund passed thro' this city on his way to Williamsburgh to see whether his presence might be of service in settling his uncle's affairs. He was in perfect health, and will return again to the camp at Cambridge. My compliments to Mrs. Randolph and the young ladies and beleive me to be Dear Sir Your's &c. ""

1034,dg002391,1775,Richard Henry Lee to Catherine Macaulay,"""Richard Henry Lee to Catherine Macaulay   Dear Madam, Philadelphia 29th Novr 1775 As a good Christian properly attached to your native Country, I am sure you must be pleased to hear that North America is not fallen, nor likely to fall down before the Images that the King hath set up. After more than ten years abuse and injury on one side, of modest representation on the other; Administration at length determine to try if the sword cannot affect, what threatening Acts of Parliament had in vain attempted; that is, the ruin of the just rights and liberty of this great Continent. Lexington, Concord, and Bunkers Hill opened the tragic scene; and clearly proved to the whole world that N. America had no reliance but on its own virtue in Arms. The battle of Bunkers Hill, tho followed by strong reenforcements, has not enlarged the prison of the Ministerial Army many paces. After the clearest proofs that the Quebec Act was going to be carried into effect by marching an Army of Canadians &c. into these Colonies, and when every attempt had been made to bring the Savages on the defenceless women and Children along our extensive frontiers; it became high time, on principles of self preservation, to avert the meditated [Evi] 1. The war was therefore sent into their own Country having first, by proper Agents and Memorials, explained to the Inhabit- NOVEMBER 29, 1775  ants of Canada and to the Indians, the views and objects of the United Colonies. Success, equal to the justice of the cause, has followed this undertaking. With indefatigable zeal 3000 Men crossed Lake Champlain and laid siege to Fort St. Johns, which place, as the key to Canada, had been made very strong by Govr. Carlton, and garrisoned with 500 regular Troops and 100 Canadians. During this siege, a detachment from the Army pierced further into the Country, invested and took Fort Chamble (between St. Johns & Montreal) that was garrison'd by about 80 Regulars. Gen. Carleton having by this time collected 800 Men, marched to the relief of St. Johns, when 600 of the Am. Troops met and defeated him. This was presently followed by the surrender of St. Johns, with all the Garrison prisoners of war, and there they found a plentiful supply of military stores. A rapid march to Montreal was next made, and yesterd[ay] brought the account of the surrender of that Town [to] General Montgomerie on Monday the 13th instant upon condition that the people should quietly enjoy their religion and not be molested in their property. Gen. Carleton had escaped down the St. Laurence with 2 or 3 Vessels, but it was expected he would fall into the hands of Collo. Arnold, then at Quebec, to which place he had penetrated with 1000 men by the rivers Kenebec and Chaudiere. No doubt is entertained here, but that this Congress will be shortly joined by Delegates from Canada, which will then complete the union of 14 provinces. Thus have the evil machinations of an unprincipled Administration been turned greatly to the honor and security of the people they meant to ruin. The proclamation that followed the receipt of so humble a petition has determined the Councils of America to prepare for defence with the utmost vigor both by Sea & Land. Altho' upon the former of these elements, America may not at first be in condition to meet the force of G. Britain, yet as Hercules was once in his Cradle, so, time and attention will, under the fostering hand of Liberty, make great changes [in] this matter. The knowing Ones are of opinion that by next Spring so many Armed Vessels will be fitted out as to annoy our enemies greatly, and to afford much protection to the Trade of North America. It is wonderful what great benefits have already been obtained by the infant efforts of some Colonies in this way. Whilst this Country abounds in Wood, iron & Artisans, whilst a soil and Climate fitted for the abundant production of Hemp is possessed by an industrious people, strength on the sea cannot long be wanting. The Congress has ordered a suspension of all exportation for a certain time. This looks like ruin to the West Indies. The almost infinite distress that these Islands will feel in a short time is realy shocking to human[it]y, but in this case, charity must begin at home, and the liberties of North America be at all events secured. The animation and perseverance that the spirit of Liberty and re-  sentment furnishes was well displaid in the seige of St. Johns. Twas a wet cold season, and the Men thinly clothed, the ground so low & wet on which they were placed, that they were compelled to lay heaps of brush, and weeds on the Top of the brush, that they might sleep out of the water at night. In this horrid situation they vigorously pressed the seige for 47 days, when the Garrison surrendered prisoners of war. Lord Dunmores unparallelled conduct in Virginia has, a few Scotch excepted, united every Man in that large Colony. If Administration had searched thro the world for a person the best fitted to ruin their cause, and procure union and success for these Colonies, they could not have found a more complete Agent than Lord Dunmore. We regret not having heared from England since early in September, but our Congress disregarding this, are proceeding with vigor, perseverance, and judgement in effecting the great purpose for which they were appointed. You know the Writer of this letter Madam, and therefore it is as unnecessary to sign it, as it would be to assure you of his affection and esteem for your whole self, and all your connections. We hope all are well at St. Bees and that proper care will be taken there in this tempestuous Season. The last Post produces a proclamation from Ld. Dunmore declaring Liberty to the Slaves and proclaiming the Law martial to be the only law in that Colony-And all this he says is done \""in virtue of the power and authority to me given by his Majesty.''(1) Is it possible that his Majesty could authorize him thus to remedy evils which his Lordship himself had created? I would have inclosed you a copy of this curious proclamation, had I not feared it would too much increase the size of this packet. The inhumanity with which this war (unprovoked as it has been on this side) is prosecuted, is realy shocking. A few days since, in the midst of winters [. . .] that northern climate, did Gen Howe turn out of Boston between two & three hundred Women and Children without even the necessaries of life. Some of them died on the water side before their hospitable Countrymen could relieve them. This cruelty is the more unpardonable, as these unhappy people have been by violence detained in Boston until now, contrary to the faith of a most positive agreement entered into between the Town & Gen. Gage. The inclosed printed papers will shew you Madam how successful the cause of liberty has been in Canada. No doubt is entertained of Quebec & Govr. Carleton having fallen into the hands of Gen. Mongomerie & Colo. Arnold. A Valuable Artillery Store Ship is just fallen into our hands and the Stores are at our Camp at Cambridge.   The Ship is the Nancy I think. ""

Schuylers has anticipated our instructions. I believe we shall leave you to manage what you have so prosperously begun, I shd. almost say finished. I long to take you by the hand & to talk over with you the ennumerable fatigues & difficulties which I see from your letter to the Genl to me that you have sustained.(2) I assure you that I have most sincerely simpatized with you, however I would have you comfort your[self] with the approbation of the continent which you most heartily have. If heaven shd. again bless us with peace, these very troubles will be sources of pleasure, as our friend Virgil expresses it \""Forsan Haec meminise juvabit.\"" But I am restrained from coming over to you by reasons of which Schuyler approves & which I am sure will be very satisfactory to you when I shall have an opportunity of mentioning them. I do not care at present to trust any thing to paper which I would not chuse to let the world see. I wish to heaven you could so contrive it in your new arrangement of Officers as to leave of [f] those who are unworthy to command. I know it is difficult but it is necessary. A certain battallion is so exceedingly ill officered that I shd. be sorry to see it continued especially with the rank it now holds. I should be glad to hear in what manner you have settled this. Coll Wyncoop tells me that you have purchased cloathing for the troops that have reenlisted without making any deduction from their pay. This is exceeding the terms prescribed by the congress & I am fearful will create some difficulty. You see by the instructions sent you by Genl. Schuyler that the men who were at the taking of St. Johns, Montreal & Ticonderoga will be entitled on their reenlistment to two months pay. If you have not published this I believe it would be best to say nothing of it & lay outt that money in cloathing. I shall talk to the genl. & my Colleagues on that head when you shall hear from me again. We have little good news from England, every thing looks as if they were resolved to push us hard next summer. If we have but the means of defence I shall not be apprehensive of any thing they can do, I can not however help lammenting that we shd. NOVEMBER 29, 1775  be forced to by the mad policy of a few bad men to continue a war that must be ruinous to those whom we wish to consider as friends. I do not know how to approve or blame your Desire of quiting the service. Your country still wants you, nor do I know how your loss will be supplied, & yet the sacrifice you must make is such as can hardly be borne by a man of any sensibility or feeling, heaven direct you to what is best. As for the politicks of our province it still moves in the same rascally channel in which it has hitherto run. When I last heard from New York the tories were loud presuming upon a miscarriage in Canada. What alteration your success has made 1 am unable to say. I have much to say but am called down to see Capt. Gordon who is below. I shall either continue this or write to you again as I have opportunity, but least the post shd. go too early I will stop here & remain Most Affectionately my Dr Sir Yours &c.

However, they said as it appeared from our representation of matters, that our House of Representatives had conceived otherwise of this Matter & had Claimed a right to a Voice, with the Council, in the choice of militia officers & that if the dispute was Continued it could throw the Colony into a Ferment; and considering also that at this critical Junc- NOVEMBER 29, 1775  ture our Militia might be suddenly wanted and it was therefore highly expedient & necessary it should be immediately settled & regulated, it was their Opinion that it would be adviseable for the Council, during the present exigency of our affairs, to gratify the House of Representatives in this Claim but not by any means any further to deviate from the Charter. Thus we have collected and advised you of the Sentiments of the members of the Congress in general, which we doubt not will be some aid to you in your deliberations & determinations upon this Important Subject, and were we present we should Vote Agreable to this Advise.

1041,dg002398,1775,John Hancock to Richard Montgomery,"""John Hancock to Richard Montgomery   Sir, Philada. Novr. 30th 1775 I am directed by the Congress to transmit you their Thanks for your great and signal Services in the Expedition committed to your Command against the British Troops in the Province of Canada.(1) The Reduction of St. Johns and Montreal they esteem of inexpressible Advantage to the united Colonies, and the most mortifying Contravention to the ministerial System of enslaving the extensive Territory of Canada. It cannot therefore fail of reflecting singular Lustre on the Character of a General so issentially instrumental in preserving that Liberty, by the Abolition of which, a corrupt Parliament intended to annihilate every Appearance of Freedom in America. Nor, are the Humanity and Politeness, with which you have treated those in your Power less illustrious Instances of Magnanimity, than the Valour, by which you reduced them to it. The Congress, utterly abhorrent from every Species of Cruelty to Prisoners, and determined to adhere to this benevolent Maxim, till the Conduct of their Enemies renders a Deviation from it indispensible necessary, will ever applaud their Officers for beautifully blending the Christian with the Conqueror; and never, in endeavouring to acquire the Character of the Hero, to lose that of the Man. The Victories already gained in Canada afford us a happy presage of the Smiles of Providence on the farther Designation of the Continental Arms in the North, and will in all Probability greatly facilitate the entire Reduction of the deluded Malignants in that Province to Liberty. These, Sir, are Exploits so glorious in their Execution, and so extensive in their Consequences, that the Memory of Genl. Montgomery, will doubtless be of equal Duration, with the Remembrance of the Benefits derived from his Command. At the same Time that the Congress rejoice with you in the Success of their Arms under your more immediate Direction, they can NOVEMBER 30, 1775  not avoid expressing their Concern at the Intimation you give of your Intention to retire from the Service.(2) They are sensible that the Loss of so brave and experienced an officer will be universally regretted as a Misfortune to all America. But they still hope, that upon reconsidering the Matter, the same generous and patriotic Motives, which first induced you to take so capital a Part in opposing the unprovoked Hostilities of an unnatural Enemy, will prompt you to persevere in the Cause, and to continue gathering fresh Laurels, till you find our Oppressions reduced to Reason, and America restored to her constitutional Liberties.

The Congress hear with Concern your Request of Leave to retire.(2) They regret the Injuries your Health has sustained in the Service, and beg you will not insist on a Measure, which would at once deprive America of the future Benefits she expects from your Zeal and Abilities, and rob you of the Honor of compleating the glorious Work you have so happily & successfully begun. You have hitherto risen superior to a Thousand Difficulties in giving Freedom to a great and an oppressed People. You have already NOVEMBER 30, 1775  reaped many Laurels, but a plentiful Harvest still invites you. Proceed therefore, and let the Footsteps of Victory open a Way for Blessings of Liberty, and the Happiness of well ordered Government to visit that extensive Dominion. Consider that the Road to Glory is seldom strewed with Flowers, and that when the black and bloody Standard of Tyranny is erected in a Land possessed by Freemen, Patriots cease to remain inactive Spectators of their Country's Fall. Reflect, Sir, that the Happiness, or Misery, of Millions yet unborn, is now to be determined; and remember that you will receive an honourable Compensation for all your Fatigues, in being able to leave the Memory of illustrious Actions, attended by the gratitude of a great and free People, as a fair, a splendid, and a valuable Inheritance to your Posterity.

Dec 2 1775 I have been so much engaged in scribbling to you in your honour- DECEMBER 2, 1775  able political Capacity that I have left nothing to say to you as a private Gentleman. I cannot however so far forget you as a friend, as not to assure you that I hold you in the most affectionate Remembrance. From newspapers & private Letters we are assured that next Summer will be a bloody one. The Sovereign has declared (we hear) that he will pawn the Jewels of his Crown or humble America. Indians, Negroes, Russians, Hanoverians & Hessians are talked of as the Instruments to accomplish this blessed purpose. But under God, If we have virtue We may be free. Let every man say he will be free and act as if he wished it & We may defy the threats of the minister. I beg leave to recommend to your particular Care a packet for Geo & Thos Hooper. Pray forward it by a safe and expeditious Oppty. Remember me in the most respectful manner to your Lady & Sisters. Tell my good friend Iredell that I have exhausted all I have to say in the Letter w[ritte]n to the Council & must refer him to that Newspapers for politicks. I kiss his Hand.

1051,dg002408,1775,Francis Lightfoot Lee to Robert W Carter,"""Francis Lightfoot Lee to Robert W. Carter   Dear Sir, [December 2, 1775] We have had nothing new since the reduction of Montreal, which I suppose you must have heard of. It is supposed Arnold must be in possession of Quebec by this time. If he shou'd be too weak to effect it Montgomerie will join him from Montreal. At all events we have got the most valuable part of Canada, as it cuts off all communication with the Indians, & prevents inroads on our fronteers. It wou'd give me infinite pleasure, if our affairs to the Southward wore as favorable an Aspect; it will require very vigorous efforts, to put a stop to the proceedings of Lord Dunmore. We are extremely alarm'd by an express from the Comtee. of Northhampton County to Congress (1) informing that he has issued a Proclamation, declaring military Law in Virga. & offering freedom to all servants & slaves, who shall repair to the King's standard which he has erected; that the inhabitants of Norfolk & Princess Ann Counties have taken an Oath to oppose, to the last drop of their blood, any of their countrymen who shall come in arms into their Counties. The Comtee. asks for assistance, being apprehensive that their people from their exposed situation, & the number of their slaves, will thro fear be induced to follow the example DECEMBER 2, 1775  of the other two Counties. We have got the Proclamation. I have been thus full least the letters from Northhampton to our Comtee. of safety shoud be intercepted; which they were apprehensive of. This intelligence gives great concern to all the real friends of America; & subjects your countrymen, to the sneers of its disguised Enemies, & the lukewarm. Fatal consequences may follow if an immediate stop is not put to that Devil's career. I shoud think a sufficient force of Militia or Minute men, shou'd immediatly be sent to drive him & his adherent on board the ships; the estates of the inhabitants of Norfolk, or elsewhere, who have taken arms agst. the Country shoud be sequesterd for its defence, the proclamation burnt by the hangman, & heavy penalties inflicted on those who disperse them thro' the Country. The patroles shou'd be very diligent. Will it not be necessary for the convention by a short Ordinance, to establish the present Laws and Judges? It wou'd contribute more than anything to the quiet & safety of the people, & security of our commerce in the spring, if the Convention (2) wou'd exert themselves in fitting out small armed Vessells, to prevent small tenders from infesting the bay, & rivers; if it cannot be done in Virga. they might be procured here. Probably Virga. might spare powder for this purpose, but without very bad fortune we shall soon have it in. It is inconceivable what good effects have been produced from such a measure to the Northward, not a tender dares to come from under the Guns of the large ships; & the Vessells employ'd by the Army in Boston to procure wood & provisions are every day falling into our hands. There are small guns in several parts of Virga., a few at Hobb's Hole & Col. Fauntleroys. The furnaces shoud be set to casting them. God prosper your deliberations. Yr. afft. friend Francis Light.

Sabbath Day 11 oClock [December 2, 1775] (1) For Fear the Post should go out I was shorter than I designed; a very long Debate hath been held relative to reinlisting the Army. I proposed & urged every thing in my Power to get a Bounty given the Soldiers but could not prevail. The Southern Gentn. insist upon it that let the Event be what they will they would not give it & even Conn [ecticu] t & Hampshire voted against it but afterwards it was resolved to pay the Men the Arrears & one Months Pay Advance & write to the Colonies to assist Genl. Washington in compleating the Lines. The News from Virginia you have principally in the Govrs. Letter. It is alarming & if it had arrived before the Resolve against a Bounty would I think have helped Us in that Question; I shall endeavour to improve that & every other Circumstance to obtain every Encouragm [ent] to our People to inlist. Lord Dunmore has proclaimed martial Law, the apprehending Conolly & his Assistants must check his Lordships Progress. Dont fail to write & particularly with Regard to the Army. The Committee of Princess Ann County in Virginia have wrote to the Congress for Troops as they are remote from the rest of the Colony: the Letters are now reading.

1055,dg002412,1775,John Adams to Abigail Adams,"""John Adams to Abigail Adams   My best Friend Decr. 3. 1775 Yours of Novr. 12 is before me. I wish I could write you every day, more than once, for although I have a Number of Friends, and many Relations who are very dear to me, yet all the Friendship I have for others is far unequal to that which warms my Heart for you. The most agreable Time that I spend here is in writing to you, and conversing with you when I am alone. But the Calls of Friendship and of private Affection must give Place to those of Duty and Honour, even private Friendship and Affections require it. I am obliged by the Nature of the service I am in to correspond with many Gentlemen both of the Army and the two Houses of Assembly which takes up much of my Time. How I find Time to write half the Letters I do, I know not, for my whole Time seems engrossed with Business. The whole Congress is taken up, almost in different Committees from seven to Ten in the Morning-from Ten to four or sometimes five, we are in Congress and from six to Ten in Committees again. I dont mention this to make you think me a Man of Importance because it is not I alone, but the whole Congress is thus employed, but to apologise for not writing to you oftener. Indeed I know not what to write that is worth your reading. I send you the Papers, which inform you of what is public. As to what passes in Congress I am tied fast by my Honour to communicate Nothing. I hope the Journal of the session will be published soon, and then you will see what We have been about in one View, excepting what ought to be excepted. If I could visit the Coffee Houses, in the Evening and the Coffee Tables of the Ladies in the Afternoon, I could entertain you with many smart Remarks upon Dress and Air, &c. and give you many sprightly Conversations, but my Fate you know is to be moping over Books and Papers, all the Leisure Time I have when I have any. I hope I shall be excused from coming to Philadelphia again, at least untill other Gentlemen have taken their Turns. But I never will come here again without you, if I can perswade you to come with me. Whom God has joined together ought not to be put asunder so long with their own Consent. We will bring Master Johnny with Us, you and he shall have the small Pox here, and We will be as happy, as Mr. Hancock and his Lady. Thank Nabby and John for their Letters, and kiss Charles and Tom for me. John writes like an Hero glowing with Ardor for his Country and burning with Indignation against her Enemies. When I return I will get the sulky back to New Haven, and there leave it to be repaired, to be brought home by the first Post after it is done. [As to coming home, I have no Thoughts of it-shall stay here till  DECEMBER 3, 1775  the Year is out, for what I know. Affairs are in a critical state and important Steps are now taking every day, so that I could not reconcile it to my own Mind to be absent from this Place at present. Nothing is expected from the Commissioners, yet We are waiting for them, in some Respects. The Tories, and Timids pretend to expect great Things from them. But the Generality expect nothing but more Insults and Affronts. Privateering is licensed and the Ports are wide open. As soon as the Resolves are printed, which will be tomorrow, I'le send them. I have had a long Conversation with He seems to be in a better Temper, and I live on Terms of Decency and Civility with him and he with me. And I am determined to live so. Have lived in more Decency with him and another, since my last Return than ever, at least than since last August when the sin of Precedence was committed. Theres the Rub.

1056,dg002413,1775,John Adams to James Warren,"""John Adams to James Warren   My dear Sir Philadelphia Decr. 3. 1775 I have only Time to acquaint you that Congress have ordered the arrears of Pay to be discharged to the Soldiers and one Months Advance Pay to be made, No Bounty nor any Allowance for Lunar Months.(1) I have a Thousand Things to say-But no Time. Our Army must be reconciled to these Terms, or We shall be ruined for what I know. The Expences accumulating upon the Continent are so vast and boundless that We shall be bankrupt if not frugal. I lately had an opportunity, suddenly, of mentioning two very deserving officers, Thomas Crafts Junior who now lives at Leominster and George Trot who lives at Braintree to be, the first a Lt Coll the DECEMBER 3, 1775  second a Major of the Regiment of Artillery under Coll Knox. These are young Men under forty, excellent officers, very modest, civil, Sensible, and of prodigious Merit as well as Suffering in the American Cause. If they are neglected I shall be very mad, and kick and bounce like fury. Congress have ordered their Names to be sent to the General, and if he thinks they can be promoted without giving Disgust and making Uneasiness in the Regiment, to give them Commissions.(2) Gen. Washington knows neither of them. They have too much Merit & Modesty to thrust themselves forward and solicit, as has been the Manner of too many. But they are excellent officers, and have done great Things both in the political and military Way. In short vast Injustice will be done if they are not provided for. Several Captains in the Artillery Regiment were privates under these officers in Paddocks Company. Captain Crafts who is I believe the first Captain, is a younger Brother to Thomas. I believe that Burbeck, Mason, Foster &c would have no objection. The Merit of these Men from the Year 1764 to this day, has been very great tho not known to every Body. My Conscience tells me they ought to be promoted. They have more Merit between you and me than half the Generals in the Army. ""

1057,dg002414,1775,Samuel Ward to Henry Ward,"""Samuel Ward to Henry Ward   Dear Bror. Philadela. 3rd Decr. 1775 When I wrote you yesterday I was not so well acquainted with the affairs of Virginia as I am now. Last Evening a Comee. (of which I am a member) appointed to take into Consideration the State of that Colony &c met. We had all the Virginia Delegates with Us and the Letters from the Comee. of Northhampton County with the Proclamn. & new Oath of Allegiance & an Association of Lord Dunmores planning before us. From the whole it appears to me that Norfolk & Princess Anne Counties lying on the South Side of Chesapeak Bay & forming the Northeast part of that Colony on the Southside of the Bay have been so far debauched & intimidated by Lord Dunmore  DECEMBER 3, 1775  who has been vastly active & politic that they have not been able to check his Operations. Having full Scope He hath exerted every influence derived from Authority, Coercion, Flattery & Corruption, hath offered Freedom to all indented Servants & Negroes who would join him & in this Way hath got about 1200 Men with him, is about to open Trade to the interdicted Ports, and has greatly alarmed the other Counties on that Bay. The Committee of Northhampton County lying on the other side of Chesapeak Bay & being unconnected with the rest of the Colony has wrote to the Congress for Aid. They assure Us that the People are well disposed but have neither Arms nor Ammunition and being two or three hundred miles remote from that Part of the Colony which can give them assistance they are afraid that Lord Dunmore will be able to force great numbers in that And the adjoining County of Awcomack into his Service & get large Quantities (half a million of Bushs.) of Wheat for Exportation to our Enemies. When the Situation of these Counties is considered the Character of the Colony ought no more to be affected by what is past there than that of our Colony should be by the imprudent Conduct of some People in Newport, indeed by all Accts. which I can get there is not half the Number of Tories in Proportion to their Numbers that We had last Spring, and that those People are Men of true Courage their whole History evinces. The Comee. has not yet reported but concludes to recommend a sufficient Force to be sent into those two Counties to protect our Friends & cover our Association until measures can be taken for effectually reducing Ld. Dunmore & his associates. I enclose you a Curiosity a Jamaica Gentn. who was in London gave my worthy Friend lately from thence a Copy from which I took this, the whole is finely done & the last Line I think ought to be the motto of every American. I have this Moment recd the Favors of Messrs. Nichs. & Jno. Brown addressed to Us jointly.(1) The Sentiments do great Honor to the Authors, they recommend Matters of vast Importance, make my most respectful Compliments And let them know that as soon as Mr. Hopkins & I can confer upon them We shall with great Pleasure acknowledge their Favors in a particular manner. It is very unhappy that We lodge apart. We are both much upon Comees. and our Time is so taken up that We have no Opportunities scarcely of consulting each other. This Day I shall enjoy myself highly. Next to the Pleasure of being at home is that of seeing our Friends when abroad; Govr. Hopkins, his Bror. & Son, the Comee. for Accts (2) & Capt. Whipple all do me the Favor to dine with Me; never did I expect the Pleasure of seeing so many of my Countrymen on this Side Rhode Island. I shall be happy if the afternoon proves as agreable to them as I am sure it  must be to Me. I expect them every Moment and therefore must conclude. Your very affece. Bror.

I mentioned to the Congress this morning, the anxiety which some of the Chambly officers expressed to you, relative to the Separation of that Garrison. On examining the Articles we find nothing to warrant their Construction, and consequently the Congress do not think proper to alter that arrangement. If those Gent. had any assurances from the General that the Garrison should remain together or in any other way were led to consider that as one of the Terms of Capitulation, I wish to be made acquainted with it. Your observations on the faith of Treaties are founded in Policy as well as Justice, and I am confident the Congress on being informed of any Errors of that Kind would most readily correct all Mistakes.(2) The late valorous Expedition against Rivington, gives me Pain.

Your Friends here have been treated with Civility, and I dare say you will esteem him worthy of your particular Notice. It will afford you Satisfaction to be informd that Congress has granted £133,000 to the Colony of Massachusetts Bay in part of their Account to be exhibited, to be paid out of a new Emission already orderd to be made, for which the Colony is to be accountable.(1)  DECEMBER 5, 1775  We go on here by Degrees, though not with the Dispatch I could wish. Gentlemen seem more and more to enlarge their Views, and we must be contint to wait till the Fruit is ripe before we gather it. A few days ago we had Intelligence from Virginia that their Governor Lord Dunmore had landed a Party of Regulars who, joynd by a Number of Volunteers, had attackd and defeated a Number of Provincials. His Auxiliaries consisted of the Inhabitants of Norfolk, a Town inhabited by Scotch Tories, and such weak & timid People as they prevaild upon to joyn them. Lord Dunmore has issued a Proclamation, calling upon the People to resort to the Kings Standard or be deemd Traitors, and declaring the indented Servants and Negroes belonging to Rebels, who will joyn him free. He has also in the same Proclamation declared his Determination to execute Martial Law, thereby tearing up the Foundations of civil Authority & Governmt in the Colony. The Congress, taking this under Consideration, have recommended to the Colony of Virginia the setting up and exercising civil Government, in like Manner as N Hampshire and South Carolina.(2) I hope the Dispute between the two Houses relating to the Establishment of the Militia, has before this time subsided or settled. The Council wrote us a Letter upon the Subject, directing us to give our opinion of the Sense of Congress on the two Resolves referrd to, either with or without consulting our Brethren as we should think best. I had Reasons of weight in my own Mind against requesting the formal Determination of Congress; Mr J [ohn] A [dams] was of the same Mind. Mr C[ushing] was of a different opinion, nor would he agree with us in writing an Answer joyntly. We therefore wrote seperately, and, if you think it worth while, you may read our Letters which I suppose are in the Council Files. I intreat you my Friend to joyn with your Compatriots in our Colony, in inspiring our Assembly with publick Spirit. There are Persons not far from you who watch for opportunities to disgrace the Colony in this Regard. I hope they will never give just Occasion to say \""I cannot describe the egregious Want of publick Spirit which reigns here.\"" It is exceedingly mortifying to me to hear such Paragraphs read. If I ever shall have the inexpressible Pleasure of conversing with you, I will candidly tell you who has written in this Stile. This much I can now assure you, that one at least of these Letter writers is not a mean Person. I have many things which I wish to say to you with Regard to the internal Police of our Colony but I have not Leisure now to write. You have Scilla and Charybdis to avoid. You cannot but be perplexd. I feel for you. You have need of the Grace of Patience, and (though it has been long said that I have fallen out with the word) I will add Prudence too. Persevere in that which your heart has ever been so warmly engagd in, the Establishment of a  Government upon the Principles of Liberty, and sufficiently guarding it from future Infringements of a Tyrant.

DECEMBER 5, 1775  The Accompts inclosed in yours of the 25th We have only had Time to look at & without particular examination observe That altho it may be very proper, that The Continent should be acquainted with the distresses, & expenditures of each Colony, yet we are in doubt as to the propriety of laying in The expence of holding Assemblies, & sending Delegates to Congress, as a Charge to the Continent and are apprehensive such a Claim would rather do Us harm than otherways as no such Demand has been made by any other Colony. This Acct. is filed No. 12. The Acct. No. 13 will we conceive want explanation, how farr the expresses or post Riders were employed meerly in the Continental, & how farr in the service of individuals. The Accompts No. 5 & No. 10 relate to Arms & Ammunition. The first we conceive (for the particulars are not before Us) is for the supply of those Articles on the Soldiers entering the Service, the latter is said to be in order to replace Loss of Arms, Blankets &c. These being gross Charges, will want explanation (Viz) whither the Colony agreed to furnish the Soldiers on enlisting with Arms & Blankets over & above their Wages, also whither these Charges were any part of them for Cloathing. The Acct. No. 9 requires we conceive, a very different stating, as the Board of Claims will not pass such General Charges as those for the Money advanced for Powder, Lead &c without knowing first what Quantity of those Articles they have actually received. Having but this Moment received Your last Favor And The express going out this Day must defer saying anything more particular on these Accts. at This Time, observing that as the Rhode Island Accts. are Now under examination We can in a day or Two, be more explicit, as the mode in which they are pass'd will form a precedent for Ours. But at the same Time inform you, that as several Colonies, this in particular, have been at large, & heavy expences, not only in training their Militia but in arming themselves both by Sea, & Land, without making any Charge that we have as yet heard of to the Continent therefor, We conceive that it will not be prudent to urge the Claim No. 11, for special Attendance &c in pursuance of the Act of Octo. 1774, nor shall We unless specially directed lay it in. This Colony have now in the River fourteen Armed Galleys, with near Seven Hundred Men on board and We are informed by their Committee of Safety which has sat daily for the last Six Mo. that their expences have amounted to more than Fifty Thousand pounds which they expect to bear as a Colony Charge, should they alter their Opinion the expence of Our Armed Vessels might then be urged for with greater propriety. Indeed We considered it a probable method, to have them appl [ie] d for, to get them into Continental Service, but your honor will remember That at the Time they were applied for, they were reported to be unfitt for the Eastward Service. The Congress are Now fitting out with all possible dispatch a Number of  Armed Vessels, and though the Committee have engaged the Number already ordered yet it is Our Opinion, more especially Mr. Deane's who attends that Board, That if the Minerva shall be judged Staunch, & fitt for Service, That She may be employed by the Congress. Wish your honor to write on this subject in your Next. As the Season advances, and Our Fleet must sail soon, Capt. Whipple has joined them, this Day, and is taken into Continental Service. Your motion for Cannon shall be laid before Congress tomorrow and We shall take the earliest Opportunity of giving you the Result.(4) Mr. Kirkland, & Mr. Deane are employed, and every thing respectg. the Indians appears favorable. It will be best that Mr. Wolcott take pains to go to the bottom of the Suspected Wickedness of one of his Collegues,(5) as he will stand on his defence, & may require a public Tryal. We wish to know when the Assembly will be convened, as We trust, they will give Us an Opportunity of reporting Our proceedings to them, and rendering up that Trust committed to Us, and in Our absence taken from Us, before we had compleated it, for reasons unknown to Us, in the most public, as We are conscious to Ourselves We can in the most honorable manner. At a Time like this, when every man of Sensibility, & patriotism is \""feelingly alive all oer,\"" when all that he can expect to save out of the general wreck of the Times is a Consciousness of having done every thing in his power to save his Country and render it happy, and a Character among his Countrymen correspondent therewith, We must be stupidly negligent to Ourselves, & Our immediate posterity affected by Our Characters, should We silently pass by the strongest Censure pass'd on Us by implication, in the late New Appointment-A Censure in the Face of the whole Continent, and which if unexplained will be forever considered as Such, though they will, which is Our cheif happiness, never find ground, or Cause in Our Conduct. Phlegmatic people may reason as they feel on the occasion; dark, envious, & designing persons, whither outdoors or in, may gloss it over to suit their Views. We trust neither set will prevent Our having a public opportunity of giving an Account of the Manner in which we have executed so farr as We have been permitted the all important Trust committed to Us, which is the only favor we wish for, or ask. A dangerous Storm is gathering in the South, Lord Dunmore having proceeded to the black, & dreadful extremity of putting, as farr as is in his power into execution the execrable planns of ministry, by proclaiming Liberty to the Slaves in Virginia. Shall be able to write You more at large in Our Next on this Subject. The Naval Committee will be in want of Seamen & Marines; if therefore the Briga[ntine] in Colony Service will on refitting bear a Survey, and can be warranted sound, and Staunch for Service, Mr. Deane thinks the Na-  val Committee would employ her to bring round Seamen & Stores to this place, but this must be resolved on immediately as before hinted. Respecting the Colony Accts., We cannot consider Ourselves at Liberty to lay them in partially without Your Orders, & for Reasons above we are convinced that exhibiting them as sent Us, would prejudice the Colony, particularly the Charge for training the Militia since Octo. 1774, The Charge for the Lead Mines and the general Charge of Monies advanced Mr. Sherman, Mr. Shaw &c. The importance of the Harbor of New London, the ease, & certainty of fortifying it with the great advantages resulting therefrom to the Continent in General, to the Colony in particular, have not escaped Our Notice, but with all Submission We suggest whither the Charge already incurred in that department had not better be omitted for the present untill the Continent will take it up generally. In everything that relates to the above, wish to have Your earliest Commands; in executing which We shall ever exert the Utmost of Our abilities, & hope to your Satisfaction. We are &c. ""

Mr Dickinson began with informing the house, that the Congress were Alarmed at the Reports of the House going to Petition the DECEMBER 5, 1775  King, said That the Congress had taken the Matter into their Serious Consideration. The result was that he and his Collegues, Were Deputed to wait on the House. He then began with the first Congress, sd. Their first Meeting was to appease the disorders from Oppressive Acts of Parliaments. Their Most humble Petition b Declaration of Rights. Which was Approuved by all America particularly by This House, Which Adopted in great part the Very Words. But the Congress Petition was Rejected and Britain Prepared for warr. Said She had been thought to believe we were a Rope of sand and would not fight. To Divide us the Resolution of the 20th February, was sent out, Which the Congress Rejected, Pensilvania Rejected, dr this House in a Most Manly manner in their Excellent address to their Governor. In the Spring Genl Gage sent a Detachment to Lexington which, without Cause put to Death Some Americans but in the end they were forc'd Shamefully to Retreat. When the New Congress Met [there was] a General ferment in the Colonys and a universall Union. Said had the Congress then Drawn the sword dr thrown away the Scabbard all lovers of Liberty, all honest and Virtuous Men Would have applauded them, but they Again Presented a humble Petition, sent it by the Honourable Mr Penn (which he would not have us beleive was Rejected, because no Answer; said it was not received on the Throne, Therefore No answer expected; The Conduct of Parliament and administration the only Answer) but said it was Necessary to Convince Great Britain that we would fight, and were not a Rope of Sand, therefore An Army was formed, Expedition against Canada &c Success Attend every Where. Said The Savages who were to be lett loose to Murder our helpless wives dr Children were our friends. The Canadians fought in our Cause, and Canada, from thence Armys were to over run us, is Conquered in as few Months as it took Britain Years. Said we have nothing to fear but from Europe 3000 Miles distant, but a Country so United Cannot be Conquered. He said, The Eyes of all Europe are upon us. Untill This Controversy the Strength & Importance of this Country was not known, The Nations of Europe look with jealous eyes on the Struggle. Brittain has Natural enemys France & Spain. Should we be unsuccessfull in the Next Campaign France will not sitt Still dr Suffer Britain to Conquer. He then braged of our Success & Courage, said Nothing would bring Great Britain to reason but our Unity & Bravery, That all Great Britain wanted was to procure Separate Petitions, which we Should avoid, it would break our Union we would be a Rope of Sand. Repeated as if to frighten us, That Neither Mercy nor Justice was to be Expected from Great Britain. He then Complimented the House on their former Petition and Noble Answer to the Governor, in their address on the Resolution of the 20th of February, and intreated us not to Petition but rest on our former Petition and that of   United America. He spoke near three quarter of an hour. Mr Jay said that Mr Dickinson had been so full little was left for him, but said that we had Nothing to expect from the Mercy and Justice of Britain: Petition Now not the Means, Vigor and Unanimity the only Means. That the Petition of United America presented by the Congress ought to be Relyed on, others Unncessary, and hoped the House would not think otherwise. He Spoke ten or twelve minutes. Mr Wythe to the same purpose about 8 minutes. ""

1069,dg002426,1775,Richard Henry Lee to George Washington,"""Richard Henry Lee to George Washington   Dear Sir, Philadelphia 6th Decr. 1775 The inclosed letter from Colo. Pendleton came to hand two days ago, and as it will save a good deal of unnecessary writing, I send it to you.(1) The proclamation there alluded to, we have seen. It proclaims martial law thro Virginia and offers freedom to all the Slaves, calling their Masters rebels &c. It seems this unlucky triumph over Hutchings with his less than half armed Militia, so dispirited the miserable wretches in that neighborhood, that many have taken an oath of Ld. Dunmores prescribing, reprobating Congress, Committees &c. Long before this, Colo. Woodford with 800 good men, must be arrived in those parts, and I make no doubt has forced his Lordship on board his Ships again. All this would have been prevented, if our troops could have crossed James River in proper time, but they were obstructed & forced to march high up by the Men of War, and indeed, such is the nature of our water intersected Country, that a small number of men provided with Naval force, can harrass us extremely. I have good reason to hope that in a few weeks the state of things in Virginia will be greatly altered for the better. I thank you for your list of Armed Vessels, but at present no use can be made of them.(2) I hope some of them will be fortunate enough to meet with prizes eastward. I had not heared of your improvements on the Kanhawa being destroyed, and unless Mr. Lund Washington has received very accurate information on this head, I am yet inclined to doubt it, because I see in the treaty lately concluded with all the Ohio Indians, they first inform the Commissioners of the Kanhawa fort being burnt DECEMBER 6, 1775  by some of their rash young men, but they promise to punish the offenders and prevent repetition of the like offenses. They are very precise in their information, and mention only the Fort as well as I remember. I hope therefore that your property may yet be safe. This treaty with the Indians is the more likely to last as Connelly, with his little Corps of Officers, are now in close custody in Maryland, having been arrested there, as they were stealing thro the Country to Pittsburg, from whence they were to proceed to Detroit, and with the Troops in those Western parts, Indians &c. he was to have done wonders. This wonderful Man is now in close jail. I congratulate you on the surrender of Montreal, and from Gen. Mongomeries letter giving account of that event, I think we have room to expect that Quebec is fallen before now. A Committee of Congress some time since sent to Canada, have direction to raise a Regiment in that Country, to invite Delegates to this Congress, and to give the strongest assurances of protection to their Civil & Religious rights. I am glad to hear of your getting Cobble hill & I hope it will prove useful to you. We are told that your enemy troops are very uneasy on Bunkers hill. God grant that their uneasiness may increase to their ruin. No accounts yet from England, but Ships are daily expected. I am, with much esteem, dear Sir Your affectionate and obedient Servant Richard Henry Lee ""

1070,dg002427,1775,Robert R Livingston Jr to John Jay,"""Robert R. Livingston, Jr., to John Jay   Dr. John Albany 6 Dec 1775 I wrote to you on my first arrival at Lake George & hoped to have found a Line from you here on my return. My disappointment has not however so angered me as to prevent my appologizing for you, of which this second letter is a proof. I most sincerely congratulate you upon our amazing success in Canada. If you knew the Obstacles we have had to strugle with you would think it little short of a miracle. Tho' as you will find by the letters you will receive herewith the matter is far from being ended, as the base desertion of the troops in the hour of victory, has left us much inferior to the enemy and I could wish that no attemp[t] was made upon Quebeck till the freezing of the lake admitted of our sending in a reinforcement, since there is no dependance to be placed upon the Canadians, & the first ill success  DECEMBER 6, 1775  Reproduction of Congressional Resolution of December 6, 1775  will convert them into enemies, in which case with the assistance of Carleton we may be easily cut off. But the people that compose our army think so much for themselves that no general dare oppose their sentiments if he was so inclined. You can not conceive the trouble our generals have had, petition, mutinies & request to know the reason of every maneuvre without a power to suspend or punish the offenders, the strongest proof of which is that Montgomerry was under a necessity to reinstate Mott in order to quiet his men. Lamb is a good officer but so extremely turbulent that he excites infinite mischief in the army. A few days ago he promoted a petition & remonstrance upon the subject of some indulgence that was shewn to one or two officers who had families in Canada & were permitted to visit them on their parol [e] . It was couc [he] d in such terms that Montgomerry immediately resigned the command but on their making a proper appology reassumed it. You can form no judgment of the impositions on the publick by the Officers & troops of the New England Colonies-I speak this in confidence & without prejudice. A great number of troops have been raised but when ordered upon duty tho they had recd. pay the whole season for doing nothing they dwindled down to a handful whole companies falling sick at once & yet full muster rolls being returned. You ask why this is not punished! The Offenders form the court martial & tho it may seem incredible yet mutiny, disarming the centries, & endeavouring to resque Offenders from the guard is punished only by a fine of 6/. Many of our own Officers are little better. However I am pleased to find that our troops have continued in Canada & have on all occasions behaved with spirit if we except the regiment raised in New York, who together with Waterburies regt. ran away at the first landing of which you have had an account. The rest of our Troops were not there accept [except] one or two companies who behaved well. Contrive if possible to introduce Gent. into the army. Genl. Prescot is now here, he is the author of all the cruelties agt. Walker & Allen in Canada, a man demented so low as to break the windows of the Barracks with his own cane. Montgomerry resented his conduct so highly as to refuse to see him or any of the Officers of his party. The Officers taken at St Johns we hear are gone with their men, notwithstanding an express direction to Capt. Mott of Connecticut who had the charge of them to separate them. This shd. by all means be done as they have it in idea to keep up the regiment which it would be very absurd to permit. You judging from the climate of Philadelphia may wonder we did not proceed to Canada but if I had been so inclined We should have met with many obstructions, besides that Canada is not yet in a state to negotiate, especially as we could derive no assistance from Montgomerry who was going down to Quebeck.  DECEMBER 7, 1775  But my strongest objection was that your Committee is by no means adapted to the manners of the people with whom they are to deal & I am persuaded would not greatly raise the reputation of the congress, nor answer any good purpose among that polished people. You brought us into this scrape, pray get us out, chuse men who have the address to conciliate the affections of their fellow mortals, & send them up in February. I will accompany them in my private capacity, as I wish to make the jaunt. If it lays in your way to serve Harry I know you will do it. Let me hear from you soon. The Express waits.

Montgomery intended to set out imediately after the taking Montreal & nothing can have prevented but the want of a Sufficient number his men Willing to go, Which was verry little doubted when the last Express left there. In my last letter I told you that it was generally believed that 2000, or 2500 men had landed at Boston as a reinforcement to General Howe. This has since been frequently Contradicted and last night I saw Capn. Blewer (Robinson's partner) who left our Camp yesterday week and has brought letters from the general to the Congress. Capn. Blewer's account and all the accounts by him say there are but 450 arrived. That they now have in Boston and at Bunckers Hill about 7000, and that upward of 1000 of them are now in the Hospitals. That they are verry much distressed for fresh provissions and that the Scurty has got among them. These accounts add that General [ ] (2) Putnam Commanded the detachment that took possession of this place, that he had mounted Eight peices of Cannon there, four of them 24 and 18 pounders, and that they were takeing possession of Litchmare's point when he Came away, and beginning to fortify, Which when done would Command Charlestown ferry. I think it is something Extra-ordinary that they Should suffer our people to go on in this way without firing at them. However it is supposed by some that they have a general attack upon our lines in Contemplation. Time will unriddle the Mistery. I have got my Blank Deeds and Books relative to the New Loan office nailed up in a Box and put on board Capt Bell's Shallop and Should be glad you would have good Care taken of them When they arrive.

He had got as far as Albany, and a Quick passage of a boat from Allbany to Elizabeth-Town to Lord Stirling and an Express from him to the Congress has brought us the News before Arnold's Express Could arrive. We have also got Intelligence (by letter) from General Montgomery that the party he sent down the Sorell has intercepted General Carlton and his Vesshels and that he (Montgomery) has since joined the party and got Carlton and his Veshells between them and Montreal, and Expects in a few days to have him & his fleet in possession.

They have also directed Genl. Schuyler to make diligent search for lead, and retaining DECEMBER 8, 1775  so much as may be wanted there to send the remainder to your camp. However it is hoped the gentlemen you have sent will expedite that business. By order of Congress I forwarded a commission for H. Knox, who is appointed Colonel of the regiment of Artillery. The Congress also have relieved your difficulties with respect to the two battalions of marines, having ordered that the raising them out of the army be suspended. It is the desire of Congress that such a body of forces may be raised, but their meaning is that it be in addition to the army voted. And they expect you will think of proper persons to command that corps & give orders for inlisting them wherever they may be found. The Congress are sensibly affected with your situation and regret the backwardness in the troops to reinlist. In addition to what I had the honor of transmitting you the 2d Instant, they have desired me to inclose you a copy of a resolution passed yesterday and to write to the council of Massachusetts Bay, the Convention of New Hampshire and the Governors of Rhode Island & Connecticut, acquainting them with the present state of the army and enclosing copies of the resolutions of this Congress relative to your being empowered to call forth the militia of those governments on any emergency and requesting those colonies to exert themselves in defence of our common liberties by affording you all the aid in their power and to comply with your request for the assistance of the militia whenever you may find it necessary to apply for it.(3) The Gentlemen with the money set out today. I hope the arrival of this will relieve some of your difficulties and that the payment of the arrears & the months advance, which you are empowered to offer will induce many to reinlist, who seem not to be attracted by nobler motives. By letters received yesterday we learn that Col. Arnold after a fatiguing march had reached Canada, where he was well received by the inhabitants, that on the 14 of November he had reached Point Levi & was preparing to pass the river that night, that notwithstanding his being deserted by Col. Enos, he had great hopes of gaining possession of Quebec, as both the English & Canadian Inhabitants were well affected to our cause; that Carlton with the ships under his command was stopped in her passage down the river by a fort in our possession at the mouth of Sorrel & some row gallies, and that General Montgomery was preparing to attack him from Montreal but of these matters you will doubtless be more fully informed by an express which we understand was dispatched to you from Ticonderoga.(4) I have the Honor to be with much Esteem, Sir Your most obedt huml sevt.

It gave me great Satisfaction to find you had at Length made a Convention. My Apprehensions on that Head occasion'd much anxiety, and am still grieved that the People of our Province have so little Firmness as to be duped by the artifices of men whose views are obvious, & of the Rectitude of whose Intentions there have long been Reason to doubt. The printed Paper inclosed in your Letter is alarming and that for the Reasons you suggest. It is a Piece of Finesse difficult to obviate, considering the Temper of the Province. The Conduct proper to observe on the occasion turns so much on Circumstances that it is difficult at this Distance to advise what would be best. To declare absolutely against having any more Assemblies would be dangerous, because the People are too little informed to see the Propriety of such a Measure. And yet the Reasons you urge for supplying their Place by Conventions are very forceable. If an Assembly of proper Members could be formed, it would give me little Uneasiness. For then should Lord Norths Proposition be laid before them, it would be in their Power to reduce Administration to a disagreable Dilemma. My Plan in that Case would be to assure the Governor of their Desire of seing Peace between Britain & the Colonies reestablished, and of their Readiness to declare their Sentiments respecting Lord North's Proposal, whenever his Majesty would be pleased to direct some mode of hearing the joint Proposals and offers of his American Subjects. That hitherto the Petitions both of Assemblies & Congress had remained unanswered, & therefore that they must decline attempting to signify their Sentiments on the Subject till such Time a Way for them being heard was opened. That they had no Reason to expect that his majesty would pay greater attention to their Desires when signified by a Governors Letter to a DECEMBER 8, 1775  Secretary of State, than he had done to their Petitions. That the faith of the Ministry had not be[en] kept with the Colony, for that a former assembly had been invited to petition, and after being drawn into that measure were neglected. That they were determined to share the fate of their Neighbours, and tho disposed to Reconciliation, were determined to defend their Liberties.

1080,dg002437,1775,North Carolina Delegates to Elihu Spencer,"""North Carolina Delegates to Elihu Spencer   Reverend Sir Philadelphia 8th Decer. 1775 Mr. Livingston is so obliging as to cover this. We rely upon his friendship to apologize for the freedom we assume in thus abruptly introducing ourselves to your acquaintance. In the present unhappy controversy between Great Britain and the Colonies it is the particular misfortune of North Carolina that in a very populous part of that Province there is seated a body of Men who not only refuse to become active in support of those rights and privileges which belong to them in common with the rest of the inhabitants of that Colony, but from the temper of mind which these people discover at present, there is some reason to apprehend that they might be led by any designing tool of Administration to pursue measures hostile to the friends of America and which might eventually involve them and us in a Melancholy scene of bloodshed. Those from whom these disagreeable consequences are principally to be apprehended are of the number of those who some years Ago were concerned in the Insurrection and from thence got the appellation of Regulators. To these however it is not confined, much pains has been taken to disseminate this disaffection. It prevails, we are informed, among the Highlanders and we much fear is too general in the back parts of North Carolina. It probably has its source in ignorance and want of information with respect to the nature of the dispute and the rectitude of those who advocate the American side of the question. We know that the education of most of these men have been religious, that they look to their Spiritual pastors with great respect and  DECEMBER 8, 1775  Portrait of Robert Treat Paine  that truths from their mouths come with redoubled influence upon their minds; could one or more of this persuation be prevailed upon to exert his good offices to give them information and Stimulate them to their duty the most beneficial consequences would result. With this in contemplation the Continental Congress has resolved \""that it is necessary that two Ministers of the Gospel should be applied to to go immediately amongst the Highlanders and Regulators in the Colony of North Carolina for the purpose of informing them of the nature of the present dispute between Great Britain and the Colonies and that the Gentlemen to be employed be allowed Forty dollars each per month for their Services and that the delegates of the said Colony be impowered to apply to and procure persons for this purpose.\""(1) Under this Sanction and from the warmest testimonies of Mr Livingston and the reverend Mr. Duffield in favour of yourself and Mr McWhorter we are induced to apply to you both, earnestly requesting your patriotick aid and assistance to effect the desirable purpose which the Congress have in View by means of the above resolve.(2) As you are well acquainted with the genius of the back inhabitants of our Province the task will be rendered easy to you and be assured that every thing in our power shall be exerted to make the Mission agreeable to you and to give Success to your endeavours. At the same time you will have the satisfaction of doing a signal Service to the friends of liberty in that Country and to America in general.

1082,dg002439,1775,Edward Rutledge to Ralph Izard,"""Edward Rutledge to Ralph Izard   My Dear Sir: Philadelphia, December 8, 1775. I should have wrote you frequently, and fully, had I had the least reason, to imagine that you would have been in England at this day. But your own letters, and general report induced me to believe, that immediately upon your return to London, you would have prepared for a voyage to your Native Country-to act, and suffer in the Common Cause. Let this then be my apology for silence-unmerited entirely on your part, and far from intentional offence on mine. Permit me to add further, that your residing abroad, at least for a time, will, in my opinion, be of more service than returning to America. You will receive by this conveyance a proclamation issued by Lord Dunmore-tending in my judgment, more effectually to work an eternal separation between Great Britain and the Colonies, than any other expedient, which could possibly have been thought of. Indeed my Friend, however chimerical such an Event may appear, to the feeble understanding of a deluded people, it seems to be not very far distant-if the Administration, continue their wicked projects, nor in itself is it at all impracticable. I cannot, however, without much anxiety look forward. If all connection with your Island, shall but once be put an end to, we must bid adieu, at least for a number of years, to Ease, and Happiness. We launch as it were into an unknown Ocean-and engage in a Business to which we are entire strangers. If, on the other hand, we fondly continue our Connection-at a time when every Engine of Oppression is raised against us-our Exe- DECEMBER 8, 1775  cutive will be so weak-foreign Powers, will be so unwilling to assist us-the Demon of Anarchy, will lay such fast hold upon us- that we may at last fall a prey to those sons of Darkness on your side of the Atlantic. Tell me then, I beseech you, (before it is too late) what are the sentiments of the English Nation-are the people of that Country determined to force us, into Independence? Or do they really imagine, that we are so void of the Feelings of Humanity, and so insensible to the calls of Reason as willingly to submit to every Insult-to every Injury? Do they expect that after our Towns have been destroyed- our Liberties repeatedly invaded-our women and children, driven from their Habitations-our nearest Relatives sacrificed at the Altar of Tyranny, our Slaves emancipated for the express purpose of massacreing their Masters-can they, I say, after all their injuries, expect that we shall return to our former connection with a forgiving, and cordial Disposition. Surely if the Administration had consulted their friends, the Bishops, they could have informed them, that Christian charity-however strongly enjoined in Holy Writ-has seldom, if ever, extended so far in practice. Speaking for myself, I freely confess, that I feel such high Resentment for the unmerited-and indiscriminate cruelties committed against the Inhabitants of this Country-that I do not believe I shall ever forget-or ever forgive them; and so determined am I on being free that I will even quit my Native Country without a sigh-if the Genius of Liberty shall loose her Influence. That, however, I trust will never be the case. America, indeed, appears to be the natural clime, for Freedom- and she seems to spread her powers still wider and wider [. . . .] (1) How truly vain must be the expectations of those, who wish to subjugate us, when we consider, that wanting every sinew of War, we have been able to resist-and baffle-their wicked attacks. Let them reflect that America engaged in this contest, without Arms-Ammunition-Officers-or money. We shall, however, soon have a sufficient quantity of the two first articles-to do Mr. Howe's business for him-in the course of the winter[....] This session may determine the Fate, of a great Kingdom-unless the Parliament improve the opportunity now offered them, they may loose forever their American Colonies. May God grant them Wisdom to discover-and Virtue to pursue such measures-as may best tend to the Establishment of Peace, and Happiness [....] You must take this as I write it, for we are so closely engaged in Business, that we have hardly time to eat and drink, what with attention in the House, and committees. I shall write to A[rthur] L[ee] in a few days. With much sincerity and affection, I am, my dear sir, Your friend.

1085,dg002442,1775,Charles William Frederic Dumas,"""Charles William Frederic Dumas   Dear Sir, Philadelphia, 9 December, 1775. I received your several favors, of May 18th, June 30th, and July 8th, by Messrs. Vaillant and Pochard;(1) whom if I could serve upon your recommendation, it would give me great pleasure. Their total want of English is at present an obstruction to their getting any employment among us; but I hope they will soon obtain some knowledge of it. This is a good country for artificers or farmers; but gentlemen of mere science in les belles lettres cannot so easily subsist here, there being little demand for their assistance among an industrious people, who, as yet, have not much leisure for studies of that kind. I am much obliged by the kind present you have made us of your edition of Vattel. It came to us in good season, when the circumstances of a rising state make it necessary frequently to consult the law of nations. Accordingly that copy, which I kept, (after depositing one in our own public library here, and sending the other to the College of Massachusetts Bay, as you directed,) has been continually in the hands of the members of our Congress, now sitting, who are much pleased with your notes and preface, and have entertained a high and just esteem for their author. Your manuscript \""Idee sur le Gouvernement et la Royaute\"" is also well relished, and may, in time, have its effect. I thank you, likewise, for the other smaller pieces, which accompanied Vattel. \""Le court Expose de ce qui s'est passe entre la Cour Britannique et les Colonies,\"" bc. being a very concise and clear statement of facts, will be reprinted here for the use of our new friends in Canada. The translations of the proceedings of our Congress are very acceptable. I send you herewith what of them has been farther published here, together with a few newspapers, containing accounts of some of the successes Providence has favored us with. We are threatened from England with a very powerful force, to come next year against us.(2) We are making all the provision in our power here to oppose that force, and we hope we shall be able to defend ourselves. But, as the events of war are always uncertain, possi- DECEMBER 9, 1775  bly, after another campaign, we may find it necessary to ask the aid of some foreign power. It gives us great pleasure to learn from you, that toute l'Europe nous souhaite le plus heureux succes pour le maintien de nos libertes. But we wish to know, whether any one of them, from principles of humanity, is disposed magnanimously to step in for the relief of an oppressed people; or whether, if, as it seems likely to happen, we should be obliged to break off all connexion with Britain, and declare ourselves an independent people, there is any state or power in Europe, who would be willing to enter into an alliance with us for the benefit of our commerce, which amounted, before the war, to near seven millions sterling per annum, and must continually increase, as our people increase most rapidly. Confiding, my dear friend, in your good will to us and to our cause, and in your sagacity and abilities for business, the committee of Congress, appointed for the purpose of establishing and conducting a correspondence with our friends in Europe, of which committee I have the honor to be a member, have directed me to request of you, that, as you are situated at the Hague, where ambassadors from all the courts reside, you would make use of the opportunity that situation affords you, of discovering, if possible, the disposition of the several courts with respect to such assistance or alliance, if we should apply for the one, or propose the other. As it may possibly be necessary, in particular instances, that you should, for this purpose, confer directly with some great ministers, and show them this letter as your credential, we only recommend it to your discretion, that you proceed therein with such caution, as to keep the same from the knowledge of the English ambassador, and prevent any public appearance, at present, of your being employed in any such business; as thereby we imagine many inconveniences may be avoided, and your means of rendering us service increased. That you may be better able to answer some questions, which will probably be put to you, concerning our present situation, we inform you, that the whole continent is very firmly united, the party for the measures of the British ministry being very small, and much dispersed; that we have had on foot, the last campaign, an army of near twenty-five thousand men, wherewith we have been able, not only to block up the King's army in Boston, but to spare considerable detachments for the invasion of Canada, where we have met with great success, as the printed papers sent herewith will inform you, and have now reason to expect the whole province may be soon in our possession; that we purpose greatly to increase our force for the ensuing year, and thereby we hope, with the assistance of a well disciplined militia, to be able to defend our coast, nothwithstanding its great extent; that we have already a small squadron of armed vessels to protect our coasting trade, who have had some success in taking several of the enemy's crui-  sers, and some of their transport vessels and store ships. This little naval force we are about to augment, and expect it may be more considerable in the next summer. We have hitherto applied to no foreign power. We are using the utmost industry in endeavouring to make saltpetre, and with daily increasing success. Our artificers are also everywhere busy in fabricating small arms, casting cannon, &c.; yet both arms and ammunition are much wanted. Any merchants, who would venture to send ships laden with those articles, might make great profit; such is the demand in every colony, and such generous prices are and will be given; of which, and of the manner of conducting such a voyage, the bearer, Mr. Story, can more fully inform you; and whoever brings in those articles is allowed to carry off the value in provisions, to our West Indies, where they will probably fetch a very high price, the general exportation from North America being stopped. This you will see more particularly in a printed resolution of the Congress. We are in great want of good engineers, and wish you could engage and send us two able ones, in time for the next campaign, one acquainted with field service, sieges, &c., and the other with fortifying of seaports. They will, if well recommended, be made very welcome, and have honorable appointments, besides the expenses of their voyage hither, in which Mr. Story can also advise them. As what we now request of you, besides taking up your time, may put you to some expense, we send you for the present, enclosed, a bill for one hundred pounds sterling, to defray such expenses, and desire you to be assured that your services will be considered, and honorably rewarded, by the Congress. We desire, also, that you would take the trouble of receiving from Arthur Lee, agent for the Congress in England, such letters as may be sent by him to your care, and of forwarding them to us with your despatches.(3) When you have occasion to write to him to inform him of any thing, which it may be of importance that our friends there should be acquainted with, please to send your letters to him, under cover, directed to Mr. Alderman Lee, merchant, on Tower Hill, London; and do not send it by post, but by some trusty shipper, or other prudent person, who will deliver it with his own hand. And when you send to us, if you have not a direct safe opportunity, we recommend sending by way of St. Eustatia, to the care of Messrs. Robert and Cornelius Stevenson, merchants there, who will forward your despatches to me. With sincere and great esteem and respect, I am, Sir, &c. B. Franklin. Philad. Dec. 12.1775.

Dumas Collection his letter of June 30 is in PPAmP, Franklin Papers. Charles William Frederic Dumas (1721-96), of French ancestry, German birth, and Dutch residence, was a man of broad intellectual interests whom Franklin had apparently met on a visit to the Netherlands in 1766, which led to a correspondence that extended from 1768 to Franklin's death. Dumas, whose long service in behalf of Congress began at this time, enjoyed no formal recognition and was irregularly compensated until October 1785 when provision was finally made for his salary retroactively from April 1775. After Franklin arrived in Paris in December 1776, Dumas was employed in a variety of duties, particularly in the supply and outfitting of American ships in Dutch and French ports. Later he assisted John Adams as translator and secretary and for years functioned virtually as an American charge d'affaires at The Hague, although he never acquired an official diplomatic title. See Benjamin Franklin, The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, ed. Leonard W. Labaree (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959-), 15:178; JCC, 29:835; Jefferson, Papers (Boyd), 8:315-16, 340, 12:200-201n; James Madison, The Papers of James Madison, ed. William T.

On this side it seems absolutely necessary to provide for a vigorous defence seeing that every Account we receive from England threatens nothing but destruction. These threats will prove vain whilst the Americans continue united & there is every appearance that the Union will be preserved & grow stronger the longer we are oppress'd. It is but doing bare Justice to assert that nobody wish for Independance on Great Britain; the People all call out for reconciliation on Constitutional Terms, & they do not act against Great Britain untill drove to it by some apparent necessity. From this Cause they attack'd the Ministerial Army at Lexington, defended their Lines at Bankers hill & have kept them there ever since. From Necessity they have taken possession of Canada as it was notorious that the Ministry depended on that Country & its Inhabitants to pierce Us in the Rear, & get Us between two fires, in short it is meer necessity that ever induc'd Us to take up arms, & that now forces Us to depend on them. We love the people of England. We wanted no other Friends, no other Allys, but alas if they cannot be content to Consider Us as Brothers entitled to the same freedom, the same priviledges themselves enjoy, they cannot expect a people descended from their own flesh & blood, long Used to & well acquainted with the blessings of freedom, to sit down tamely & see themselves stripd of all they hold dear.

Although Samuel Chase, in conjunction with the ongoing efforts of Congress to acquire a small fleet, had already made preliminary inquiries there into the availability of suitable vessels, news of Dunmore's intensified naval activities underscored the need for a naval force to challenge the Virginia governor. As a result of Harrison's efforts, by early January the Continental sloop Hornet and the Continental schooner Wasp were ready to join the new American fleet that was preparing to sail from the Delaware with orders to proceed to the Chesapeake and attack Dunmore's naval force. See JCC, 3:395, 4:335-36; Am. Archives, 4th ser. 3:1669-71; Samuel Chase to John Adams, November 16, 1775; and Naval Committee to William Stone, December ? 1775, and January 10, 1776.

1091,dg002448,1775,Thomas Jefferson to John Page,"""Thomas Jefferson to John Page   [December 10? 1775] De rebus novis, ita est. One of our armed vessels has taken an English storeship coming with all the implements of war (except powder) to Boston. She is worth about £30,000 sterling as General Washington informs us, and the stores are adapted to his wants as perfectly as if he had sent the invoice.(1) They have also taken two small provision vessels from Ireland to Boston; a forty gun ship blew up the other day by accident in the harbor of Boston. Of a certainty  DECEMBER 10, 1775  the hand of god is upon them. Our last intelligence from Arnold to be relied on is by letter from him: he was then at Point Levy opposite Quebec and had a great number of Cannoes ready to cross the river. The Canadians received him with cordiality and the regular force in Quebec was too inconsiderable to give him any inquietude. A later report makes him in possession of Quebec, but this is not authenticated. Montgomery had proceeded in quest of Carleton and his small fleet of 11. pickeroons then on Lake St. Francis. He had got below him and had batteries so planted as to prevent his passing. It is thought he cannot escape their vigilance. I hope Ld. Chatham may live till the fortune of war puts his son into our hands, and enables us by returning him safe to his father, to pay a debt of gratitude. I wish you would get into Convention and come here. Think of it. Accomplish it. Adieu. [P.S.] The Congress have promoted Brigadier Genl. Montgomery to be a Major General, and on being assured that Arnold is in possession of Quebec it is probable he will be made a Brigadier General, one of those offices being vacant by Montgomery's promotion.(2) This march of Arnold's is equal to Xenophon's retreat. Be so good as to enquire for the box of books you lodged for me at Nelson's and get them to a place of safety. Perhaps some opportunity may offer of sending it to Richmond. ""

Colony of Connecticut, have in pursuance of such designs, raised a Large Sum of Money and with the same employed Agents to inlist Men.(1) That they have also collected, a great Number of Blankets, Shoes, Firelocks, with a quantity of Powder & ball, & other military Stores in this City and conveyed the same to their Agents in this Country who have therewith cloathed, & Armed the Men, they have raised, for sd. hostile purpose. That to induce Men to engage, they have by sd. Agents been promised the plunder of the Inhabitants, they should in this manner seize on & remove, over & above exorbitant Wages given them. That by artful, & wicked Means, the late resolution of Congress,(2) respectg said Inhabitants, which the honorable Presidt. sent forward, for the purpose of preventing hostilities, has  DECEMBER 12, 1775  been represented as a Forgery, and a Libel propagated, among the people, who were solicited to join in these hostilities, fictitiously signed John Hancock President the purport of which was that This Congress had ordered the removal of sd. Inhabitants. That the Agents of sd. Association had proceeded to seize on large Quantities of Goods, & Stores, belonging to some of the said Inhabitants of Connecticut & others, which were going up the River Susquehannah, to supply the said Settlers in part, but by much the greater part of sd. Goods, were designed for The Indians of sd. Six Nations at the head of sd. River. That the detention of sd. Goods, the Total interruption of all Supplies to the Indians, and the hostile preparations making, have given the Indians the most alarming Apprehensions. That the different parties, engaged in this Hostile invasion, began their March on Monday last, to their place of rendevouz, giving out as they went, that they should be Fifteen Hundred Strong when Collected. That all passes leading to, & from sd. Settlement are seized on, & guarded by sd. parties. That the distress'd Settlers have put themselves into the best posture of defence, in their power, having no other alternative, but to Submit to plunder, and ruin, with their Families, or defend them, to the last Extremity.

I wish I could send hence any American Literary Production worthy of your perusal, but as yet the Muses have scarcely visited these remote Regions. Perhaps however the Proceedings of our American Congress, just published, may be a subject of some Curiosity at your Court. I therefore take the Liberty of sending your Highness a Copy, with some other Papers which contain Accounts of the successes wherewith Providence has lately favoured us. Therein your wise Politicians may contemplate the first efforts of a rising State, which seems likely soon to act a part of some Importance on the stage of human affairs, and furnish materials for a future Salust. I am very old and can scarce hope to see the event of this great Contest: but looking forward I think I see a powerful Dominion growing, up here, whose interest it will be to form a close and firm alliance with Spain (their Territories bordering) and who being united, will be able, not only to preserve their own people in peace, but to repel the Force of all the other powers in Europe. It seems therefore prudent on both sides to cultivate a good understanding, that may hereafter be so useful to both; towards which a fair Foundation is already laid in our minds by the well founded popular Opinion entertained here of Spanish Integrity and Honour. I hope my presumption in hinting this will be pardoned. If in any thing on this side the Globe I can render either service or pleasure to your Royal Highness, your commands will make me happy.

Manly, has taken a Store ship, loaded with 2000 stand of arms, a great deal of artillery, 30 tons of shot, a quantity of shells & shott for the bombs & Cannon; and a very great quantity of all kinds of Artillery stores, to the amount of 20,000 £ Str., as tis thott. We make no doubt but Quebeck Carleton with his powder are in our possession by this time. If we are supply'd with powder from that or any other quarter this winter we shall certainly make Boston too hot for Howe, as the Ministry has kindly supplied us plentifully with Artillery. These successes to the Northward, and the former reputation of Virga. make the present proceedings with you appear in a very odd light. The real friends of liberty are under great concern, & your delegates are mortified with the sneers & reflections of the lukewarm but that is trifling to the uneasiness we suffer, from the apprehension of the consequences that may follow from Ld. Dunmore's being allow'd to get to such a head.(1) It does not appear to me that Woodford's force is sufficient to effect any thing decisive. In my opinion, our safety depends upon an immediate, & effectual stop being put to that infernal Demon, & his tory associates at Norfolk. The Congress are giving the greatest attention to a Navy, & I hope we shall have ships enough by the spring to oblige the Ministerial fleet to consult their safety by keeping close together, & of course will not be able to do us much injury. I am surprised at not receiving Letters from my friends in Richmond by the Constl. post. The Postmaster assures me there is a post establishecl from Fredericksburg to Portroyal, Hobb's Hole, & Urbanna; And the County Comtees were to direct where the offices shou'd be kept. I wish it was inquired into & the obstruction mentioned; that they may be removed, if in the Postmaster's power. I hope the County chose a Comtee to your liking, & that every thing is quiet. Is it not necessary that the Convention should establish some kind of Government as Ld. D. by his proclamation has utterly demolished the whole civil Government. I believe the Congress will adjourn before Christmas, but whether long enough to allow me to see Virga. is uncertain. ln the mean time my best wishes attend my friends in Richmond.

Philadelphia 12th Decr. 1775 I am obliged to You for the many very important Hints in your last and hope You will never omit your Sentiments upon every interesting Occasion. The Contest between the two Countries involves a Question of no less magnitude than the Happiness or Misery of Millions & when We extend our Views to future Ages We may say Millions of Millions. Our Views therefore ought to be extensive, our Plans great & our Exertions adequate to the immense Object before Us and such I doubt not will be the Conduct of Congress. Our Accts. have been presented. There were several large Articles in them which had never been before Us in any Accts. already liquidated. The Comee. of Claims desired the Direction of Congress upon these, Who allowed the Expenses of moving the Stock and the Amount of the Cannon but as the Riflemen & other Soldiers raised in the middle & southern Colonies found their own Arms and were al lowed no Bounty The Congress would not pay those two Charges. We hope however when the Difficulty of raising men without a Bounty is better understood and the Accts. from the other Colonies are also before us to obtain a Reversion of this Opinion. Upon a Consultation We all thought best to defer any further Examination of the Accts. until the general Assembly is acquainted with this Resolve & all the N[ew] E[nglan]d Accts. can come under Examination together. We shall move for a Grant to the Colony for a Sum about adequate to the Ball[anc]e as it now stands and as the new Money ordered is now printing We hope to get it for the Comee. in a Week or ten Days. When you have read the enclosed, seal and deliver it. An objection was made in the Comee. of Secresy that as Mr. Hopkins was going to Sea the Continent would not be safe with his Security. Justice to the Continent, the honor of the Colony & my own Character require me to ask their Obligation and as I had no Motive in this Matter but a Desire of serving them I doubt but they will readily give it. You will take it & deposit it in your office until my Return or a safe Conveyance here presents. Mr. Nicho. Brown mentions 800 Boxes spermaceti Candles which he would send upon Permission for Powder.(1)If they could do in any foreign Port of Europe & he would export them on Acct. of the united Colonies upon the same Com[missio]ns allowed Clarke & Nightingale & the same Freight that we give others I could serve him & wish to know as soon as possible for our Contracts for Powders are near compleated & People are every Day offering to take up the Remainder & I keep it open on Purpose to serve the Com[pan]y & accommodate that Part of the Country with Arms & Ammunition.(2) We should want a great Part of this Cargoe in good small Arms.

1108,dg002465,1775,Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane,"""Silas Deane to Elizabeth Deane   Philadelphia Decr. 15th. 1775 I wrote you one Line yesterday, per Capt Phelps, since which I am fully Convinced this Congress will adjourn before Christmas if nothing New offers. Naval preparations are Now entering upon with Spirit, and Yesterday the Congress chose a Standing Committee to superintend this department, of which I had the honor to be Unanimously chosen one.(1) This will detain Me here sometime after the 1st of January, indeed I apprehend that the Congress will leave a Number to put into Execution the resolves of the Congress, together with the Naval Committee, as the adjournment will probably be over to the 1st of March. I do not expect to return sooner unless it may be to engage Workmen on the Business, part of which, I shall agree to have carried on in the Colony. I hear from Connecticut that I am in Irons, & that Your Journey with Mr. Webb was to see me, and as I shall not return with Col. Dyer, & Cyder being plentys I expect to hear soon, of my being hanged, Drawn, & quartered. I wrote to Governor Trumbull a Lettr. On the Conduct of the Assembly which he will be obliged to read before them when they meet, and I think, some People will look small, in the issue.(2) If the Assembly sit this Winter I shall endeavor to be at home at the Time at all adventures, to demand a hearing before them, how I have discharged the Trust reposed in Me and shall bring with me Vouchers for my Conduct, from the Gentlemen of the Congress. My Enemies designs have been, by superceeding me in my absence, tacitly to Censure Me, & leave by implication a Stigma on my Character, which they know a public hearing must not only clear up, but Tumble them into the Pitt they have (like Moles as they are) been digging for Me. They cloak themselves under Sanction, and Au- DECEMBER 15, 1775  thority of Assembly, and have no Idea of my asking for a public hearing, which as they have not censured Me directly, They imagine I shall not think of, but I can fairly do it, by desiring to give an Acct. of my performance of the Duty reposed in Me, and Justice can never refuse Me. Col. Dyer joined Me in the Letter, but he somehow grows every Day, more peevish, & is at Times absolutely intolerable, I know the Cause, & You can guess at it. Governor Ward has in a formal Manner, laid Seige to Mrs. House, & I am apt to think the Fortress will surrender, on the first serious Summons. Poor Mrs. Christ. Marshall died this Morning suddenly which has greatly distress'd that freindly Circle of Brothers, and Sisters. You remember, She was D. Mumfords Master's Wife. I look out, most impatiently, for Your Brother Dudley.(3) His Shipp is a fine one of Thirty odd Gunns & is nearly ready. The behavior of Our Soldiers, has made Me Sick, but little better could be expected from Men, trained up with Notions of their right of saying how, & when, & under whom they will serve & who have, for certain dirty political purposes, been tampered with by their Officers, among whom, no less than a General has been busy.(4) I sent you the Silk, Cost four Dollars, the Whole by Capt. E. Phelps whom I sent express to Rhode Island, and ordered him to send you the Silk by the Post from N. Haven. I shall write Brother Bar [naba] s by this Opportunity, You will shew such parts of this Lettr. to such persons as you may judge fitt to be Seen, & to See. My Complts. to Neighboring Freinds, Love to the Family & Connections, I am affectionately Your's S. Deane ""

I receivd one or two since from the Govr. & one from your brother. They mentioned Nothing about you whether dead or alive, att home or Abroad. I fear you give your self too much Uneasiness on the hints I gave you some time agoe.(1) I soon found they made no lasting Impression here & were but Transient & gone. My Inducement in giving you some pains on the Subject was  DECEMBER l6, 1775  rather to put you on your guard as knowing every one has some Watchfull Enemys. Some of the Congress throw out once in a while As tho the Army might be Supplyd at a much less expence & with equally good provisions. They say now the rations Cost the Continent at least a shilling or 14d per diem law[ful]l & they have heard persons say in Philadelphia they would undertake for 7d or 8d per diem. Indeed one Wharton has undertaken to Supply a Battalion lately raised here for 7d or 8d this Currency per diem with the same rations found in the Army. Perhaps you may make a bargain to advantage. I dare say there will be bidders of this kind which by & by may give Uneasiness. Indeed they want to engross every thing if possible at this place & are Constantly Intriguing with one or another of the Delegates for places, Pensions, Employments~ Contracts, &c. Indeed I think we have been Cooped up in this prison of a City long enough. Poor Connecticutt Troops have lost (here) all their fame & all their glory.(2) You will Scarce hear any thing but execrations against them. The Congress astonished & Confounded at their want of every thing laudable, or Impossible they could leave the lines at this Critical moment, and Hazzard their Country & all for Whims for Trifles but however we have excused them as far as possible, but especially the. Colony as the Congress had till lately made no application to the Colony for Troops. If they had, the Colony would have seen they were had there by the day, either New or Old, but they would obstinately scorn to apply to Governt. for Troops but would Vainly pursue their own Method. They were told 2 months agoe they would fail in every other Method but by applying to the Colony for such a Number of Troops and the Colony would see they had them tho I know we have had a set of Uneasy fellows in the Army who would spread disaffection wherever they went. I hope my Thomas will behave well & that the ill Treatment he recievd will be no disadvantage too him on the whole; tho for my own part I could allways have wished him not to have gone into the Army at all (as) [his?] little Interest will be ruind by it, but however if he behaves well am Content as the Cause is so just, the Contest so glorious. I depend on your & your Friends kind disposition towards him with all friendly advice & assistance. He wants use & acquaintance with or in good Company. His fault has been too much the other way. But guard him against the Vices which attend all. I hope soon to leave this place. I am really tired. I am [so] Home sick, that whither I was dismissed out of good will or Envy I rejoice. My respects to Coll Mifflin, Genlls &c &c as occasion and am Sincerely yours Elipht Dyer [P.S.] Post waiting; cannot revise; therefore you must take my letter as it comes.

On one Passage there was a vote whether to be printed or not, & the Colonies were equally divided. A Letter read from Gen. Washington advising of some Captures made by our Vessels & that he had released the President of the Island of St. Johns & others who had been taken.(1) A Comee. of 3 prepared a Speech to be delivered by the President to Capt. White Eyes a Chief of the Delaware Indians said to reside on the Muskingham, who was then introduced into the Congress accompanied by One of his Councellors and an Interpreter. The Chief was dressed in a good Suit of Blue Cloth with a Laced Hat & his Counsellor was wrapt in a Blanket, Capt. White Eyes shook all the Members heartily by the Hand, beginning with the President & used the same Ceremony at his Departure, he stayed about an Hour, Our President delivered the Speech & the Chief answered by his Interpreter that he was well pleased to hear such a good Speech and meet his Brethren in the Grand Council Fire, that he would faithfully report to his Friends the kind Disposition of the Congress & proposed to stay in Town all Winter. He wanted a Clergyman, Schoolmaster & Blacksmith established among his People and said they inclined to embrace Christianity & a more civilized Way of Life. A Copy of the Congress's Speech was given to Him when he withdrew, his Councellor said Nothing. A Motion to keep the Officers and Soldiers all together who were taken at St. Johns, took up several Hours & was lost .N Colonies to 5. A Motion was carried by a bare Majority to permit the Officers to go where they will within the former Orders of Congress till furthe. Order. An Indian introduced Himself by the small Door into the House in the Midst of Debate, he was heard, he wanted Money & was promised a Supply. Several Reports from Committees were made, particularly one relative to Capt. Motts Petition. Jefferson moved that no new Motions shall be offered after 12 oCloc without special Permission till the Order of the Day is satisfyed, which was agreed to. The Comee. appointed to fit out the 13 Ships were impowered to draw on the Treasury for 500,000 Dollars.

I find that the News of raising a Battalion in our government has spread amongst you, by the persons you mention intending to apply for Offices. Perhaps when they come to know that their Service will not be confined to the Government, but may be ordered to the most distant parts of the Continent and that as soon as they are raised it may repress the Ardor of some of them.

Schuylers last Express. Mr. Duane just now accidentally told me that your Brother was about to leave this Town, and I am now retired to the Lobby, in a Hurry to say a line or two to you. I confess I was a little hurt at not being favored with a Line from you, especially as your writing to others convinced me that it was in your Power. The Matter is now explained I have only to regret the accident by which the Letter was detained. I most sincerely console with you on the Loss of your good father & my good friend. The many Instances of Friendship & Attention recd. from him & the family will always command my Gratitude & interest me in every Thing that concerns them. Something hangs about Harry (1) that I dont understand & probably never shall unless you & I should hereafter confer upon the Subject. On hearing of his being in town I took Ph. Livingston with [me] & went to his Lodgings to pay him a Visit Intending unless pre-engaged to take him home to dine with me. I asked him whether he dined out DECEMBER l9, 1775  that Day-he told me he should dine with Mr Duane &c at Smiths- on which I replied that I would do myself the Pleasure of dining with him, which I accordingly did. From that Day to this I have not seen his face except in the Street or at some Gentlemans House. I am not without my suspicions relative to his Behaveour which you will easily guess & which shall induce him to explain to you.

Let us however fortify ourselves against immedeiate Grief by contemplating his Virtues and by a firm assurance that rescued from the Vexations and Calamities of a Jarring world he is translated to the Manshions of eternal Rest and Happiness. This is the sure Reward of a Life directed by a Reverence for the Supreme Being, by a Love of Justice, by Patriotism, and Philanthropy: Qualities for which our amiable Friend was conspicuous!

1126,dg002483,1775,Henry Wisner to Benjamin Towne,"""Henry Wisner to Benjamin Towne   Mr. Towne (1) Philadelphia, December 21, 1775. Having for many months been sensibly affected with the great disadvantage the colonies labour under for want of ammunition, I thought it my duty to apply myself to the attainment of those necessary arts of making SALTPETRE and GUNPOWDER; and having far exceeded my expectations in both manufactures, I think myself still farther obliged to communicate the so much needed knowledge to my country at large. My first trial was on Saltpetre, two pounds of which my son has extracted from about six bushels of stable dirt, perfectly fit for making Gunpowder. This was done by the method of Doctor Young and Mr. Rubsaman, lately published by the former, for which, and many other useful informations, I take this opportunity to return those gentlemen my publick thanks.(2) I have lately erected a Powder-Mill in the south end of Ulster County, in the colony of New-York, at which I have made as good powder as I ever have seen, and will bear the inspection of good judges, in the following manner: GUNPOWDER is composed of nothing more than the four plain simple articles, Saltpetre, Brimstone, Charcoal, and Water. The three first of which are to be made as fine as possible, so as to be sifted through a gauze sieve, or fine bolt, as fine as for common flour. But it being difficult to make the Saltpetre all fine, those parts that will not be easily got through the sieve, must be dissolved in soft warm water, then let the Sulphur, Saltpetre, and Charcoal, be each separately  DECEMBER 21, 1775  weighed. Take of the Saltpetre an hundred weight, of the Sulphur fifteen pounds, and Charcoal eighteen pounds, and in that proportion for any greater or smaller quantity. This being done, mix them all well together in some large vessel, such as a potash or any other kettle, and when well mixed, moisten the whole with the aforesaid nitrous water till it is as moist as dougll for making bread. Then put an equal quantity in each mortar, and pound it well for at least twenty hours; and if the mill runs slowly, let it run twenty-four hours; and as the paste, by pounding, will naturally grow dry, it must be kept moist by putting in a little of said water, and when pounded sufficiently take it out of the mortar, and put it in some tub or any other proper vessel. As to the graining, it must be done in the following manner, viz. have a box made about five feet square, the sides eighteen inches deep, the bottom tight, and top entirely open; fix across the box two rods or laths near the middle, about four inches below the top, and about ten inches apart, then have six sieves made of wooden splits in the same manner as a wheat riddle, but much finer, the coarsest should be about as fine as a cockle sieve, or a little finer, and so each sieve to increase in fineness till the last is as fine as possible. I believe it were best to make the two coarsest of wire; then take about a quart of the paste, put it into the coarsest sieve, set the sieves on the two rods that are fixed across the box, then work the sieve with a circular motion, which will press the paste thro' the sieve in large and unshapely grains, and when a considerable quantity is passed through, then sift it over again in the next coarsest sieve, and so till the grains are fine enough. The last sieve must be so fine that whatever passes through it will be too fine for Powder, and is to be worked over the next batch. As the paste will naturally roll together in large round balls, when worked in the sieve, a board must be made near as large in circumference as a common pewter plate, and about one inch thick, on the center, declining to the edge, of some hard wood turned in a lathe, and made as smooth as possible. This board must be put into the sieve among the paste, which breaks the hlmps in pieces, and forces the paste through the sieve. When the powder is well grained in the manner directed, it must be rolled in a barrel, the inside of which is to be made as smooth as conveniently may be, with as small a door cut in one side capable of being shut tight, and the barrel to be fixed so as to be turned by the shaft of the mill. Put in a few pounds at a time, and let it be rolled as above, which will make the Powder smooth; then sift it in the finest sieve, till the fine parts that work off in the barrel pass through the sieve, which is to be returned again into the mortars. The Powder must be put in flat trays or dishes, and set by to dry either in a small room kept warm with a large stove, or, if the weather be dry, in the shining of the sun.  I therefore most heartily recommencl to the good people of this Continent to enter into these necessary businesses with spirit, being well assured that a greater quantity may, with ease, be made than will be needed for our consumption, even admitting the times to be worse than the threats of the British administration would lead us to expect. Any person inclining to build a powder mill will be shewn a plan, with directions for the constructions of all its parts and utensils, by applying to their very htlmble servant,(3) Henry Wisner MS not found; reprinted from the Pennsylvania Evening Post, December 21, 1775. 1 Benjamin Towne (d. 1793), printer of the Pennsylvania Evening Post, was noteworthy for the mutability of his political allegiances in the revolutionary era, supporting the American patriot cause until the British occupied Philadelphia, adopting a loyalist position during the British occupation, and returning to the American side after the British evacuated the city. DAB. 2 Thomas Young had published an essay on the manufacture of saltpetre in the December 7, 1775, issue of the Pennsylvania Evening Post and had arranged for Towne to print in the December 5 issue some notes on the production of nitre which he had \""received from Mr. Jacob Rubsamen, a gentlemen of very liberal education, observation, and experience, some years since from Hesse in Germany.\"" Pennsylvania Evening Post, December 5, 7, 1775. 3 Samuel Adams sent a copy of Wisner's plan of a powder mill with a short covering letter to Paul Revere.

I hope you found Mrs Adams and Family in a confirmd State of Health. I will not envy you, but I earnestly wish to enjoy, at least for a few Weeks, domestick Retirement and Happiness. I dare not however, urge an Adjournment of the Congress. It would indeed be beneficial to the Members & the publick on many Considerations, but our Affairs are now at so critical a Conjuncture that a Seperation might be dangerous. Since you left us, our Colony has sometimes been divided, on Questions that appearcl to me to be important. Mr C[ushing] has no doubt a Right to speak his opinion whenever he can form one; and you must agree with him, that it was highly reasonable, the Consideration of such Letters as you have often heard read, which had been assignd for the Day, should, merely for the Sake of order, have the Preference to so trifling Business as the raising an American Navy. I  DECEMBER 22, 1775  know it give you great Pleasure to be informd that the Congress have orderd the Building of thirteen Ships of War viz five of 32 Guns, five of 28 and three of 24.(1) I own I wishd for double or treble the Number, but I am taugllt the Rule of Prudence, to let the fruit hang till it is ripe, otherwise those Fermentations and morbid Acrimonies might be producd in the political, which the like Error is said to produce in the natural Body. Our Colony is to build two of these Ships. We may want Duck. I have been told that this Article is manufacturd in the Counties of Hampshire & Berkshire. You may think this worth your Enquiry. Our Fleet, which has been preparing here will be ready to put to Sea in two or three days, and it is left to the Board of Admiralty to order its Destination. May Heaven succeed the Undertaking. Hopkins is appointed Commander in Chiefe. I dare promise that he will on all occasions distinguisll his Bravery, as he always has, and do honor to the American Flag. General Schuyler is at Albany. By a Letter from him of the 14th Instt.(2) we are informd that there had been a Meeting of Indians in that place, who deliverd to him a Speech, \""in which they related the Substance of a Conference Coll Johnson had with them the last Summer, concluding with that at Montreal, where he deliverd to each of the Canadian Tribes a War belt and the Hatchet which they accepted; after which they were invited to feast on a Bostonian and drink his Blood, an ox being roasted for the purpose and a pipe of Wine given to drink. The War Song was also sung. One of the Chiefs of the Six Nations who attended that Conference, accepted of a very large black War belt with an Hatchet depicturd on it, but would neither eat nor drink nor sing the War Song. This famous Belt they have deliverd up, and there is now full Proof that the ministerial Servants have attempted to engage the Indians against us.\"" This is copied from the Generals Letter. You will know what I mean when I mention to you the Report of the Committee of Conference. This has been considerd and determind agreable to your Mind & mine. Mr H[ancock] agreed with me in opinion, and I think, in expressing his Sentiments he honord himself. I dare not be more explicit on this Subject. It is sufficient that you understand me. I have more to say to you btlt for Want of Leisure I must postpone it to another opportunity. Inclosd you have a Number of Letters which came to my hand directed to you.

To prevent the ill consequences, that might ensue from the backwardness of the men in the present service to reinlist, the Congress, as I informed you in my last, have written to the governors of Connecticut & Rhode Island, the council of Massachusetts Bay and the president of the convention of New Hampshire; In consequence of which letters they have strong hopes & confidence, that measures will be taken to compleat your army. As to the article of butter, the Congress desirous to obviate whatever may have a \""tendency to give the soldiery room for complaint\"" have instructed me to inform you, that the same may be continued, until further order. The Congress receive, with great satisfaction, your congratulations on the success of Capt Manly. By the enclosed resolves you will perceive their determination on the captures already made, as well as those which may be made hereafter.(1) It is expected the several colonies will erect courts of admiralty, and that the judges in those courts will regulate their decisions by the law of nations, except where it is relaxed by the enclosed resolutions. I am further directed to inform you, that the Congress approve your taking such of the articles found on board the Concord, as are necessary for the army. The necessity of the case will, they apprehend, justify the measure, even though the vessel, upon trial, should, contrary to their expectation, be acquitted.(2)  DECEMBER 22, 1775  I am Authorized to inform you that it is the pleasure of Congress that Mr. Mifflin the Quarter Master General hold the Rank of Colonell in the Army of the United Colonies, and that you Establish his Rank accordingly. I must Beg leave to Refer you to the Inclos'd Resolutions of Congress for your future proceedings, which I am Directed to Transmitt you. You will Notice the last Resolution Relative to an Attack upon Boston, this pass'd after a most serious Debate in a Committee of the whole house, and the Execution Referr'd to you, and may God Crown your Attempt with Success. I most heartily wish it, tho' individually I may be the greatest sufferer.(3) I have paid Mr. Fessenden the Express in full for his three Journies as Express to Philadelphia, Deducting only Sixty Dollars, which he Says, you order'd him, that there will be no pay due to him for Services perform'd heretofore, only for his Expences now from this place to you.

1129,dg002486,1775,John Jay to Alexander McDougall,"""John Jay to Alexander McDougall   Dear Sir Philadelphia 22d Decr. 1775 Few Things have for some time past given me more Pleasure than the address with which you managed the Govrs. Letter on the Subject of Lord Norths Motion. It occasions however both Surprize and Concern that the Sin of Fear (as Lewis Morris calls it) should operate so powerfully on some of your Patriots, as it seems to do.(1) The Provision for the Delegates I imagined Would be similar to that of Connecticut. However as the Convention has thought proper to move on other Principles, I am determined that pecuniary Considerations shall never induce me to quit the Field so long as my constit- DECEMBER 22, 1775  uents will keep me whole. The allowance they have agreed upon will if I retrench a little, about do that. It must be obvious that keeping much Company, is necessary to obtain a personal Influence with the members, and that the Colony is interested in their Delegates possessing such IntRuence. Should we ever converse upon this Subject I will mention some important Instances of its Use. I am glad you think of reducing our Number. Five is certainly sufficient-3 of them to be a Quorum.(2) Your Conduct relative to Sear's Expedition so far as it respects Connecticut is certainly proper-but I suspect this will be the first Instance of censuring the Followers without reprehending the Leaders. It is time that your Government should acquire a firmer Tone. Tomorrow I shall go to Elizabeth Town for a Week-and shall devote the first Leizure Hour I have to telling you twenty things about which want of time compels me now to be silent. Mr. Duane complains to me that you have taken no notice of a Letter he wrote you some time ago. He says it was friendly & expected you would treat it as such. It respected some Observations made on your Detention from the Army, & his Remarks on that Subject: which were just. Coll. Morris was very useftll at the Indian Treaty & had he not, by being accidentally at Pittsburgh, given the Congress an opportunity of supplying Dr. Franklins absence, by appointing him Com[missione]r pro Tempore, there is Reason to believe our affairs in that Quarter might have suffered. As to Arms. I think you should take Care how you strip yourselves to cover your Neighbours Nakedness-neighbours too who have no Reason to expect. It is Time that you should look to your own Necessities. New York never stood better with Congress than now. Your Alacrity in raising & arming your Troops last Summer &c. is compared with the Tediousness & slow moving of others. Some Powder has arrived here, but the Fleet will consume it. More has arrived to the Eastward & the Camp will take that. For the future remember that Charity should begin at Home. God bless you. Yours &c.

Dr Sir Philadelphia 22 Dec. 1775 In Answer to yours of the 18 Instant (since which I have sent the Commissions by Mr Spencer) It can't be expected the Congress will advance the Sum you (1) mention, under the notion of deducting it out of the Men's wages, because the men may die or desert before it is due. The Blankets the men are to find themselves, & if they cannot purchase them I think the Committee should do it. However if Mr. Lowrie who is appointed Commissary was to state to the Congress the Situation of the Battalions, & what articles they are in want of & apply for an advance of Cash, I doubt not he would be attended to. I suppose the same with respect to the Committee, tho' the Commissary must be presumed to be best acquainted with the matter. I am greatly surprized the Assembly did not on Mr Kinsey's & Mr De Hart's Resignation supply their Places by the Appointment of two other Delegates. 'Tis true they have given the Right of Representation to either of their Members. This is proper enough because it may unfortunately happen that only one might be able to attend. But surely it wou'd not be proper that only one should attend. Admitting then that two attend, who does not see that they may frequently happen to differ in opinion, & then no vote can be given. If to prevent that Inconvenience, all three attend, I leave it to any man to judge of the runinous Consequences to a Man's family to give such constant & perpetual Attendance. I can assure you that nothing but my Devotion to the Public, has kept [me] here this long, whereas if we consisted of five as before, we could always have three at the Congress & take turns to see our families, & if only three attended the Expence would be the same. I scorn to quit my Colours thro' Impatience or Discouragement, but I think it reasonable that the Burden should be divided. I do not mean to blame Friend Crane for his last homeward-bound Voyage, because he fairly offered it to me as being my Turn; but as I knew that his Affairs from his Representation, suffered more by his Absence than mine did by my continuing abroad, I consented. I shall have no objection to giving Dr Harris my Interest for Surgeon in a futtlre Battalion, if he can give me any proof of his skill in DECEMBER 22, 1775  Surgery, either by the Cures he has performed, or the Testimonials of Practitioners of Reputation, because I have been told that he knows but very little about it.

I dare say you want me at home but I believe I am doing you as well as my Country more Service here than I could there. In vain would Heaven smile upon the Labours of a Parent & crown the Year with Plenty if a Tyrant & his Harpies could take it away from him, in vain would paternal affection wish to afford Protection & Support to his dear offspring when a lawless Banditti of armed men could rob them of that Parent & offer every Kind of Injury to his helpless offspring. Now my dearest is the Time to repel this lawless Invasion, Heaven calls us all to the arduous Task. Though of the softer Sex I know you have a generous Mind, endeavour to inspire all your Acquaintance with the Love of Liberty  DECEMBER 25, 1775  and a fixed Resolution never to part with it but with their last Breath. You are kind in making the best Apology you can for your little Brothers, but they have behaved ill. I have been from home near four months & have had only one Letter from Ray, charge them all to write immediately. I wish Betsy could write. Cant She be learnt this Winter, a Letter from her would give me much Pleasure. I hope she behaves well. I wish the News of Arnolds taking of Quebec which your Uncle wrote You was tnle but unhappily one quarter of his Men returned to Cambridge; the rest suffered terribly by fatigue and famine, their Arms & Powder were so damaged & exhausted & the Num ber of effective men so small 550 only that they were obliged to retire from the City & send to Genl. Montgomery for a Reinforcement. He is gone himself with all his Forces that I hope we shall soon have it. In the mean Time prepare your Mind to part with dear Bror. Heaven only knows where or how he is, if he behaved well he is safe either in Canada or the Mansions of eternal Bliss & I cant doubt it. Arnold's March is considered here as the greatest Action done this War. Some say it equals Xenophons Retreat from Persia, others that nothing greater has been done since the Days of Alexander. I had a Letter from your Uncle Ward last Post, General Washingtons Difficulties I hope will be removed. If I can get Time to buy some handkers. I will & Pins also. The Poem you desired Polly to write for [me] will send by first Opportunity Mrs. Li[. . ] Acst. cannot be setled until my Return; pay her twenty Dollars if She wants them. The Papers inclosed to your Sisters will give you all the News save that Esek Hopkins is made Commander in chief (1) ""

But am Sorry to inform you that I Cannot return to you at present. So much Business lays before the Congress; I fear it wont rise for Some time. When it Does rise, one Delegate from Each Colony must tarry to transact the Publick Business in the recess, So that I think I Shall not be able to return till towards Spring.(1) Capt Langdon is returned here from Ticonderoga, and I Expect he DECEMBER 25, 1775  will return to Pourtsmouth in a few Days and George will return with him. I will Endeavor to Send by him the things you mention in your letter and by George Shall write you more fully.

Decr 26 1775 I have receivd your obliging Letter of the 5th Instant by Fessenden, for which I am very thankful to you.(1) The present form of our Government, you tell me, is not considerd as permanent.(2) This affords the strongest Motive to improve the Advantages of it, while it continues. May not Laws be made and Regulations establishd, under this Government, the salutary Effects of which the People shall be so convinsd of from their own Experience, as never hereafter to suffer them to be repeald or alterd. But what other Change is expected? Certainly the People do not already hanker after the Onions and the Garlickl They cannot have so soon forgot the Tyranny of their late Governors, who, being dependent upon, and the mere Creatures of a  DECEMBER 26, 1775  Minister of State, and subservient to his Instructions or Inclinations, have forbid them to make such Laws as would have been beneficial to them or to repeal those that were not. But, I find every where some Men, who are affraid of a free Government, lest it should be perverted and made use of as a Cloke for Licentiousness. The Fear of the Peoples abusing their Liberty is made an Argument against their having the Enjoyment of it; as if any thing were so much to be dreaded by Mankind as Slavery. But the Bearer Mr Bromfield, of whose Departure I was not apprisd till a few Minutes past, is waiting. I can therefore say no more at present, but that I am your affectionate Friend (3) S A ""

All men are fond of Power. It is difficult for us to be prevaild upon to believe, that we possess more than belongs to us. Even publick Bodies of Men legally constituted, are too prone to covet more Power than the Publick has judgd it safe to entrust them with. It is happy when their Power is not only subject to Controul while it is exercisd, but frequently reverts into the hands of the People, from whom it is derivd, and to whom Men in Power ought forever to be accountable.

Dec. 27. 1775 (1) It was with great Pleasure I learnt from Mr Jefferson, that you were settled in America,(2) and from the Letter you favour'd me with, that you like the Country, and have reason to expect Success in your laudable and meritorious Endeavours to introduce new Products. I heartily wish you all the Success you can desire, in that, and in every other Undertaking that may conduce to your comfortable Establishment in your present Situation. I know not how it has happened that you did not receive an Answer to your Letter from the Secretaries of our Society. I suppose they must have written, & that it has miscarried. If you have not yet sent the Books which the Academy of Turin have done us the Honour to present us with, we must, I fear, wait for more quiet Times be DECEMBER 27, 1775  fore we can have the Pleasure of receiving them, the Communication being now very difficult. I can hardly suspect Mr Walpole of the Practise against you which you mention,(3) especially as he was then expecting to have Lands of his own in America, wherein the Productions you were about to introduce must have been beneficial. I rather suspect a Person whom you may remember was frequently with him, I mean Martinelli. I rejoice that you escap'd the Snares that were laid for you, and I think all America is oblig'd to the Great Duke [of Tuscany] for his Benevolence towards it, in the Protection he afforded you, and his Encouragement of your Undertaking. We have experienc'd here that Silk may be produc'd to great Advantage. While in London I had some Trunks full sent me from hence three Years Successively, and it sold by Auction for about 19/6 the small Pound, which was not much below the Silk from Italy. The Congress have not yet extended their Views much towards foreign Powers, and particularly not to those of Italy, who are so distant. They are nevertheless oblig'd by your kind Offers of your Service, which perhaps in a Year or two more may become very useful to them.(4) I am myself much pleas'd that you have sent a Translation of our Declaration to the Grand Duke; because having a high Esteem for the Character of that Prince, and of the whole Imperial Family, from the Accounts given me of them by my friend Dr Ingenhauss and yourself, I should be happy to find that we stood well in the Opinion of that Court. Mr Fromond of Milan, with whom I had the Pleasure of being acquainted in London, spoke to me of a Plant much used in Italy, and which he thought would be useful to us in America. He promis'd at my Request to send me some of the Seeds, which he has accordingly done. I have unfortunately forgotten the Uses, and know nothing of the Culture. In both those Particulars I must beg Information and Advice from you. It is called Ravizzone. I send Specimens of the Seed inclosed. I received from the same M. Fromond Four Copies of a Translation of some of my Pieces into the fine Language of your Country. I beg your Accpetance of one of them, and of my best Wishes for your Health & Prosperity.

May Heaven sanctify every thing of this as well as of the more (to human weakness) clesirable Kind to my dearest Daughter & long continue her a Blessing to all her Connections. Let your Aunt Greene know that little Ray is vastly well after the small Pox & exceeding happy: nothing but excessive fatigue & hurry prevents my writing to her. I clesign it soon. Give my most affectionate Regards to your Uncle & Aunt, to your Uncle Hubbart, & to all your Family. Mr. Greene I heard from at Norwalk in Connecticut; he was like to purcllase a load of Wheat very easily. I should have been glad of a Letter from him & wish he had come to Philada. if his affairs would have permitted it. I wrote you sometime since that I was one of a Comee for purchasing Powder &c and that I thought I could serve them in imploying their Vessels &c but never recd. any Answer from you; Mr. Mumford mentioned it to Me to Day.

We ought to spend the whole Winter in disciplining our People, providing Arms & Ammunition &c and if any thing further is necessary for the Defence of Greenwich I would by all Means advise to have it done as soon as the Weather will admit.

I never allow myself to find Fault with the Ways of Heaven or I should say that Asthma of yours was cruel to take up so much of your Time when your Country & your Friends want every Moment of it. The Barbarities of a Wallace (1) or any other Savage do not much surprize Me. When I first entered this Contest with Great Britain I extended my Views through the various Scenes which my Judgment or Imagination (say which you please) pointed out to Me, I saw clearly that the last Act of this cruel Tragedy would close in Fields of Blood, I have traced the Progress of the unnatural War through burning Towns, Devastation of the Country & every subsequent Evil, I have realized with Regard to myself the Bullet, the Bayonet & the Halter and compared with the immense Object I have in View they are all less than nothing. No man living perhaps is more fond of his Children [than] I am & I am not so old as to be tired of Life and yet as far as I can now judge the tenderest Connections and the most important private Concerns are very minute objects. \""Heaven save my Country\"" I was going to say is my first, my last and almost my only Prayer. I have several Times mentioned to you the Anxiety I felt on Acet. of the newmodelling the Army, that cruel Jealousy which the southern Colonies have of the northern has occasioned all this mischief. The Army must be wholly continental, all colonial Distinctions must be at an End, the Troops must be taught to look up not to their several Colonies but to the Continent. For that Purpose the Congress must appoint all officers. Again the British Soldiers have but 6d a Day & shall We give ours 1/. Ours shall have no Bounty & shall find themselves Arms and so far has this stupid Policy been pursued that instead of 20000 Men in the Massachusetts We have not half the Number & in Canada instead of 5000 Men We have not 1500 besides Ca- DECEMBER 27, 1775  nadians. In this Province a Battalion was ordered to be raised two Months ago at 5 Dollars a Month; 150 of the best of those enlisted have deserted & they are not full yet and still there is an Idea of raising Men upon the same Terms. I have wrote fully to General Greene & proposed to him that the Generals should recommend at least by private Letters to their Friends the offering a Bounty to the Men, finding them their Arms & recommending to the Colonies the filling tlp their Troops; this would soon fill up our Army.(2) I mention these things to You that you may use your Infiuence to prevent the fatal Mischiefs which will atend our being found unprepared in the Spring & may give Me your best Advice upon the Subject. I do not in the least despair for I firmly believe that the Cause We are engaged in is the Cause of God & hllman Nature & that in Mercy to Mankind Heaven will prosper it. If the Comee. for building those Vessels in our Colony had been appointed by Congress I shotlld have taken Care to have had you appointed one of the Comee. but as a Comee. of Congress is appointed to carry into Execution the Resolve for building the Fleet it is out of my Power. Mr. Hopkins being on the naval Comee. before is one. I have mentioned it to him or rather I believe read him part of your Letter; through hurry I have forgot to mention it to him again. I saw on Christmas Day a Master of Vessel belonging to this City who was in Boston Six Weeks & came out 3rd or 5th inst. He says the Acst. whicll We had of the old Souths being turned into a riding School is true. He saw the Horses exercised in it, the Carp[enter]s he says would not pull down the Pews &c and the officers with their Men did it. He says that all Sorts of Provisions were so scarce that they had not above seven Weeks Provisions including all Sorts. General Washingtons Letters of 16th inst. agree very nearly with this Acet. This Capt. adds that the Soldiery were much intimidated many of them disposecl to desert. He mentioned a Conversation which he overheard, \""Some of them said if there was another Action & they could get off under the Smoke they would take the fresh Beef Side of the Question.\"" He thinks the Place is easily taken. Genl. Washingtons Letters ascertain the fact that the People who were turned out of Boston were first inoculated & have since broke out with the small Pox, is their a Crime but what these monsters are capable of. Proper Measures are taken to prevent its spreading. Genl. Greene writes me the 10th inst. that our Troops enlist very slowly. He had not received my Letters mentioned above; I wish they may have a good Effect. As the Continent has taken Whipple into their Service I wish the Colony would build such an one as we had the War before last, or a larger one. The Time which we have to prepare in against the Spring is very short; not a Moment is to be lost; besides the general Defence every possible Measure ought to be taken for the Defence of the Colony. I  doubt not but you will direct your whole Attention to his important Juncture. Remember Me to all Friends. I am most affectionately yours Sam Ward [P.S.] Lord Dunmore you will see by the Papers has been defeated & obliged to fly on hoard his Ships; six Battalions will be raised in that Colony soon & I hope we shall arm all Parts of the Continent soon.

I have sat down to repeat a part of my Letter on the Subject of Salt Petre. A Gentleman here makes from 3 to 4 1/2 I[bs.] every day from less than 2 bushells of earth taken from the Surface, under any old Building. It seems, from his Experiments, that Stables or Cellars are too full of Marine Salts, and that pure Earth, loamy or Clayey which is placed so as to receive the Air, is most useful for this work, as he makes ten times as much as any hody who tries the other materials. He fills his two Kegs with Earth every Morning and pours on soft warm Water, filling it up till the water Stands an Inch above the Earth, letting it remain 2 hours, then draw it off like lees of Ashes (returning the foul). The clear is directly put into a Common Brass Kettle and hanging over the Kitchen Fire to boil, the Keggs of Earth again filled with Water, which is to be drawn off and boiled as before. When 2/3 is boiled away, both Boiling are poured on a Bit of  DECEMBER 28, 1775  wood ashes placed on some straw in order to filter and clarify; when drawn out clear it is to be boiled again till it is so thick as when dropped on the blade of a Knife it will stick when the Knife stands edgeways; tis then to be taken off immediately and poured into another Keg with a Cock 2 Inches from the bottom, where the Sea Salt and any other impurity Settles to the bottom and the Liquor containing the Salt Petre is to be poured of[f] thro' the Cock into dishes & plates to Christallize and set into the coolest plates. This must be done before the Liquor is cold, as the Salt Petre shoots as soon as 'tis cold. Colo. Horrys, Danl Hor[r]ys at Wambaw, our old Place at Santee are exactly of the same soil & under their Piazzas, Negro Houses, & Barns thousands may be got. It is needless to say how material it is to be had among ourselves. The Bond sent by Mr. Brewton is said to have been paid to the Person to whom it was first given. so there can he no expectation from it.

A Petitn. from Simeon Sellick committed to myself, Col. Floyd & Francis Lightfoot Lee Esqr.(1) The House went into Grand Committee, Gov. Ward in the Chair, when it was agreed after much Debate to allow Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina to import as much Salt as their several Conventions or Committees of Safety think necessary from any foreign Country, & to export Produce therefor. Debates upon opening our Ports to foreign Countries after the 1st of March next, within the Terms of our Association, adjorned. A Recommendation to the several Assemblies & Conventions to encorage the Manufacture of Salt, was offered by Dr. Franklin, agreed to & ordered to be published. R. Morris informed that a person offers to establish Salt Works on the Jersey Coast if the Congress will lend him £200. Mr. Morris & Lynch were desired to inquire more particularly into it. McKean gave Information that a Quantity of Arms, Ammunition & Cannon is buryed near Sir John Johnsons House with his Privity & that some Scotch and other Tories are there enlisted by the Enemy, a Comee. of 3 was appointed to examine the Two Men who brought the report to McKean & to ascertain the Fact as far as they can. Leave granted for a Lieut. a Prisoner, to come to Philada. for 2 Weeks. Andrew Allen presented a Petition from a Number of the Inhabitants of Northampton & other back Parts of Pennsylvania intimating that they will not obey the Recommendations of Congress in the Wyoming Affair, this Petition gave much Offence and was ordered to lie on the Table.(2) An Application from the Virginia Convention praying Means may be used for the Release of 3 Gentlemen, one of them a Delegate in that Convention named Robinson, lately seized by Lord Dunmore, left for Consideration.

No, I think I can venture to say that the congress will order Prescot into irons,(2) to remain in them until we have favourable accounts of our colonel and his men. Montgomery, hearing of the treatment of our people, refused to see general Prescot when he was taken, which was shewing a soldier-like spirit. Howe is carrying on the war at Boston in a manner that would disgrace savages. The very great scarcity of provisions in the town has obliged him to turn several of the inhabitants out, and, to his eternal shame be it spoken, he had them inoculated for the small pox, a short time before they were to come out, in hopes of spreading it among our troops. Is not this as bad as poisoning waters? But notwithstanding this vile scheme, by the vigilance of our people the disorder has been prevented from spreading.

DECEMBER 31, 1775  I think with You that our Declaration of Retaliation was very proper but that we may go further & believe We shall. Genl. Washington has sent a very spirited Message to Genl. Howe relative to Colo. Allen taken at Montreal; as I recollect his Words are \""Whatever may be his Treatment, whatever his Fate, such exactly shall be that of Brigadier General Preston whom We now have in our Power.\""(1) The Virginians have at length done bravely. They have defeated Lord Dunmore, killed & taken 62 Grenadiers, their Capn. one of them, and several other privates & forced him to fly on board his Ships. The Congress has taken proper measures for the Defence of the Colony which will soon be carried into Execution. I am clear with you that our Salvation depends upon effectually supporting the Dignity, Importance & decisive Authority of Congress. How far increasing their Number would answer that Salutary Purpose I have not time to consider at present, our Number is now sixty five, seldom fifty are present, often less than forty. May not the additional Number you propose support by their Infiuence in their several Colonies the Autho[rit]y of Congress more effectually in Person upon the Spot than when abroad by Letters, surely they may as Difficulties & Disorders arise apply proper Remedies and crush those things perhaps in embrio which in time would become very troublesome and dangerous. The Plan of Union I agree ought to be setled this Winter but the Terms you propose I dont like. You say Representation ought to be as equal as possible. Agreed, but what is to be represented-not the Individuals of a particular Community but several States, Colonies or Bodies corporate. All Writers agree that a Nation is to be considered as one Person, one moral accountable Person having a Will of its own &c. Your Proposition allows to the larger Colonies several Wills & to the smaller not one, that is not one entire or compleat Will, & thereby makes the smaller wholly dependent on the larger; but You say Justice requires that the larger Colonies having a great number of Inhabitants & a greater Share of Property should have a proportionably greater Share of Representation. Let us see how the Doctrine will apply to individuals. One Man hath a numerous Family & is possessed of a large Estate, another has only a small Family & a little Estate. Is not the Life, the Family, Liberty & Property of the poor man being his all of as much Importance to and as dear to him as the larger all of the rich Man. Most clearly they are, surely then he may be equally intrusted with the Care of that all, and Justice cannot require that he should be deprived of any Part of the Means of self Preservation that they may be transfered to another and yet if you allow to one of them a single Voice, to the other two or three Voices, You certainly (selfish as people in general are) deprive one of the Means of Self Preservation or defence and put him wholly in the Power of the other. Do  not the numerous Family & Fortune of the one give him suflicient Weight 8c Influence, surely they do, he can have no Right to more, the Laws have therefore wisely given to the Man of a fixed moderate Estate an equal Voice with him who is worth a hundred Times as much. Again Towns & Counties are of different Dimensions, contain different Numbers of Inhabitants & various Degrees of Wealth & yet you allow them nearly an equal Degree of Representation. I observed this to the Virginians & asked why they would risque the Introduction of a System of Equality in the States of America which they found impracticable even in a single Colony. Besides the present Sentiments, Prejudices and Jealousies would make it very unsafe. The N. E. Colonies are happily united. Others see it and knowing them to be brave and enterprizing are very jealous especially of the two larger Colonies and it is the Policy of some as far [as] the Dread of British Tyranny will admit to lessen the Influence of those Colonies, hence whole Weeks which ought to have been spent in pushing a War vigorously have been employed in ascertaining the Object and Extent of the War, hence the newmodelling the Army the Source of all its Dangers & Difficulties. If the N. E. Colonies had been applied to for their respective Quotas of Men, had appointed their Officers & been permitted to have given a Bounty as usual We might have had a fine Army long since. The ostensible Reasons for the contrary Conduct are Oeconomy & continental Views but the real one is this unhappy & ill grounded Jealousy. Again the Colonies of Pennsylvania N. York, Maryland & N. Carolina would acquire much Weight by the new Mode of Representation and besides the Jerseys, the Lower Counties & Georgia, Rhode Island & New Hampshire would proportionably loose. Can it be for the Interest of America to reduce the Power of those who have risqued all in her Cause & augment that of others who have not & never can or will proportionably serve her. It is impossible; if what I have now said is not satisfactory I will make another Attempt. Mr. Hewes was surprized at the Hint I gave him but very politely thanked me for it and determined to be upon his Guard for the future. The Army I wish may be formed soon, but the draughting of Men is vastly disagreable to Me; it distresses Families greatly, & the Men must be paid so that nothing will be saved. On the other hand I cant bear that Quota should be wanting; I had much rather have given a Bounty than be perplex'd in this Manner. I hope the Assembly may be directed to such Measures as may promote the true Interest Honor & Happiness of the Colo [n] y. The French Gentn. arrived on Friday Evening;(2)Congress has referred them to the Secret Comee. We had a Conference with them last Evening; this Afternoon they paid Mr. Dean & me a Visit and   were going to wait on the other Members. I am grieved for the poor People of Newport; when will there be an End of their Misfortunes. I wish they would nobly resolve to quit it unless it can be fortifyed. I am told Genl Lee was coming up with such a View. We have very interesting Intelligence in a Number of intercepted Letters from the southward, some Acct. of which I may perhaps be at Liberty to communicate in my next.

DECEMBER 31, 1775  1 This letter was probably written just hefore Bonvouloil 's letter to comte de Guines of December 28th in which it was enclosed. 2 Julien Achard de Bonvouloir (1749-83), French secret agent dispatched to America from London in September 1775 by the French arnbassador to England, Comte de Guines, had met covertly in Philadelphia with members of the Committee of Secret Correspondence and in his report to Guilles of December 28, 1775, had incorporated his translation of this letter from the committee. For Bonvouloir's letter to Guines, see Doniol, I :287-92, an English translation of which is available in Clark, Naval Documents, 3:279-85. Although the French government had taken pains to ensure that Bonvouloir should appear in Philadelphia as a private traveler and that his contacts with Congress should involve no official commitmcnts, the American delegates were undoubtedly aware that high level officials had participated in thc planning of his mission.

As the best information of the Enemies strengtll and situation is of the utmost importance to the execution of this service, the Naval Committee request of you Gentlemen to station at Cape Henry a Person of unquestioned honor, understanding, and secrecy, for the purpose of boarding the Fleet when it appears off the Capes of Virginia, and furnish the Commander in Chief with the most accurate information of the then Strength and situation of Lord Dunmores fleet and Land forces. This Fleet will consist of Two Ships, two Brigantines, and one Sloop, with perhaps some smaller Vessel or Vessels. And for still greater certainty, as soon as the Fleet comes within proper distance and until they pass Cape Henry the largest Ship will carry at her Mizen Peak a Jack with the Union flag, and striped red and white in the field. The Person upon the Cape on his part is to fire a Musket, and hoist a white Flag on the most conspicious part of the Cape. A Boat will then be sent on shore to get the intelligence. It is judged of the utmost consequence to the Success of this enterprise that you contrive to place 200 expert Rifle Men on such part of the Shore as that they may be taken on board the fleet before they come in sight of the Enemy, and of this, the Gentleman first at Cape Henry must be able to inform the Commander.

These Gentlemen are Dr Franklyn, Mr Lynch of S.

From England We hear of Nothing but ministerial Ill Will, Desperation, and Preparations for Revenge. With the Blessing of Heaven, however upon our Endeavours I humbly hope and trust we shall, resist them with Success. Certain Prejudices are propagated here by a few ill affected Persons in the City, that the Massachusetts Forces contain a great Number of Old Men, Boys and Negroes, more in Proportion than the Troops of the other Colonies. I wish I had it in my Power to contradict this Story in the Name, of Some Persons better acquainted with the Fact than I am: if you have Leisure to favour me with your sentiments upon this subject you may depend upon my using them with great Caution and in a manner, which will serve the Public without any Disadvantage to yourself. At the Same Time, I beg your opinion in Confidence of two Gentlemen, Mr Henry Knox and Mr [. . .] Waters; whether they are qualified for Engin[eers and] whether they have Studied the Sublime Br[. . .] the Art of War, I mean Fortification & Gunnery and whether they are Sufficient Masters of those Sciences to hold any considerable Employments in that Branch of the service.

 Dear Sir(1) Philadelphia Oct. 13. 1775. I have consulted our Committee of claims on the subject of the demands you mention.(2) It is thought that all accounts of this kind should be enquired into by your county committee & certified by them. This done, the money will be paid here on application to the committee of claims. Please to let all others who have accounts against the continental treasury know that they should apply through the same channel as early as possible lest the Congress might chance to be adjourned in which case they will not be paid till another Congress. We hope that your apprehensions of an Indian war are without foundation, as we have certain information on the very best authority that the six nations are most heartily our friends,(3) and we expect their influence will keep the Shawanese & Delawares quiet were they otherwise disposed. That influence we are assured will be exerted by them on this occasion, as they have done the like on a similar occasion lately. No news at present.

 Dear sir, New York 15th. Novr. 1775. Your's per Mrs. Deane(1) deserved an earlier reply than I have been able to give it, as well on its own, as on Acct. of the worthy Squire, it introduced to Me. You told me I might do as I pleased with him, in consequence of which I introduced him to several of my acquaintance, who Unanimously resolved he ought by no means, to be confined to a meer Circle of private Freinds, but see the world, which he will as soon as his Cloaths are made, & they were begun before I left Philadelphia, but will not be compleated before I take a look at them, The workman being a careless dog, & apt to drop stitches in his work, so much for the Squire. The Interest you feel in whatever concerns me calls for my grateful acknowledgements, and gives me the sincerest pleasure in finding November 15, 1775  that the early & constant Freindship, I have had for you was rightly placed, & founded on such a Basis, as to be permanent, & increasing, and therefore You must congratulate Me, on my Dismission from the Congress,(2) when you consider that the happiest Time for a Man to dye, is at that Moment, when he is highest in the Esteem of the World he leaves, and quite resigned to his Fate in the Next. And when I seriously assure You, without Vanity, that I could never expect, or wish, to stand fairer, or have greater influence in this, or any future Congress, than what I enjoy, at this Moment, & have for sometime past, And assure you I am quite resigned, to retire, and share the Fate, of my Country as an individual. I own that the Business of the political kind is what I prefer to any other, but I have had for this Twelvemonth past so great a Share, as well neigh to give me a Surfeit, quite To make me willing to give place to my Successors, whose Abilities, & perseverance I pray God may be equall To The more than Herculean Labor of compleating the Plann, successfully laid out, & entered upon by their predecessors. You may possibly miss seeing Mrs. Deane, & think hard of my not writing to You by her, but if She saw you, she would have told in what a Situation she found, & left Me, & how the intermediate Time was filled up. At the Committee from Seven untill Ten in the Morning breakfast in the Chamber, from Ten To four often untill five in Congress, from Seven untill Ten in the Evening again at Committee---; in this Circle she found Me in this I continued, untill ordered to this City on Business of Consequence, in the execution of which She left Me. This must Therefore be my excuse for not writing as I actually had not one hour I could call my Own, nor should I have this but for a severe rain which prevents my going out. As to the generous intentions of those, who have so kindly taken from my Shoulders, this Burthen, I thank God I have long known them & those whoentertain them & if ever I trust them, so farr, as to suffer any such Event, to give Me Chagrin may I suffer the most exquisite possible to be endured---;on the Contrary I have too much Philosophy, & Too Thorough a knowledge of that little World which You & I live in called Connecticut, (which by the way is an Epitome of the whole) to let any event of this kind give me one uneasy sensation at heart, or occasion one complaining expression from my Lipps. I wish they may be as happy in the Change, as I am, Though I must tell you I fear they will greatly suffer in their Accompts, as they will have no one at that Board, Acquainted with the proceedings of it, which from being one of its first Members I carefully attended To, not without an Eye to the heavy Accts. which I knew would one Day come, from my own Colony, & sensible that Rules established in one Case might with propriety, & force Be urged in another, but these Rules not being matter of record, or public Notoriety can never be taken advantage of by a New Member, & Mr. Sherman never saw the inside of the  November 28, 1775  Chamber of Accompts since the Board was established, Nor has Col. Dyer. They can neither of them Therefore know any thing of the matter. I have a good Opinion of the Abilities of Wolcott, Huntington, & Hosmer, Though I think they are not altogether parliamentary, or Congressional, but as to Williams I conceive him to be one of the most conceited, ignorant, & fractious puppies that ever attempted to act in the political Character, & he knows my Sentiments, & many others, for I have ever spoke freely. I can hear nothing of any little, low dirty Calumny spread about Me, in the Colony, I very much wonder at This, as it is so sure, & useful a Card, on such Occasions, that I really expected it, not that I deserved it, but from my Natural openness, & freedom of Speech & Conduct I tho't it probable---;especially as a few pounds of Rhubarb, physicked, & worked my Brother Dyer though a Strong man, off his Leggs in a Trice. I can write no more than to ask You to write much, & often for then I shall be sure of pleasure, & instruction. I am Dear sir, Yours S Deane I go for Philadelphia Tomorrow. P.S. You see with how much freedom I write my Sentiments, and I have the satisfaction that You know I am sincere. Popularity has come to me unexpectedly, it is not surprizing that this should occasion Envy & if this should contrive to destroy my Popularity, I shall say, The Lord gave the Devil hath taken away, yet blessed &c. I do not mean to bless the devil, though like other rogues, he Sometimes does a Man a good Turn, when he least of all intends it. My Complimts. to Mr. Douglass & Lady---;Adieu. ""
